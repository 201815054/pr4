An appeals court hearing to rule on the prosecutor's request has been set for March 4 at 1200 GMT, the source added on Wednesday, confirming an earlier report by Le Parisien newspaper which was published on its website.
The Paris public prosecutor's office and Airbus could not immediately be reached. Air France declined to comment. 
French judges in 2019 dropped charges against Air France and European plane manufacturer Airbus over the crash, saying the pilots had lost control of the plane.
French investigators found the crew of AF447 mishandled loss of speed readings from sensors blocked with ice from a storm, and caused the aircraft to stall by holding its nose too high.
Le Parisien reported that the Paris prosecutor now says there were ""blameworthy infringements"" on the part of Air France, notably in crew training, and says Airbus under-estimated the risks posed by ice on the sensors.

The newspaper did not say how it obtained the information.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 10:46AM ET</span>","AT&T takes $15.5 billion charge on DirecTV, adds more phone customers","By Sheila Dang and Eva Mathews
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said on Wednesday it wrote down its premium TV business, which includes satellite television unit DirecTV, by $15.5 billion, reflecting the impact of years of cord-cutting in the industry as viewers move to cheaper online streaming services. 
The fourth-quarter writedown comes as sources have told Reuters AT&T has entered into exclusive talks to sell a minority stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG in a deal seen valuing the division at above $15 billion.
AT&T purchased DirecTV for $68 billion including debt in 2015.
The company said it also took a $780 million writedown on its WarnerMedia business due to the pandemic causing shutdowns on content production and viewers staying away from cinemas.
AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey said during the earnings call with analysts that the writedown was a necessary economic move for the ""unfortunate set of circumstances around the pandemic.""
The writedowns partially eclipsed good news from the company's core wireless business, which added almost twice as many phone subscribers than Wall Street had expected.
During the fourth quarter, AT&T added 800,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, beating analyst expectations of 475,300 customers, according to research firm FactSet. 
The growth was helped by the launch of the new 5G iPhone during the quarter.
AT&T said it expects 2021 revenue growth in the range of 1%, and adjusted earnings per share to be similar to the previous year.
Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a note on Wednesday AT&T's outlook was ""uninspiring"" and it was likely to face disadvantages in the wireless business compared to competitors like  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), which appeared onstage during Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s launch of the 5G iPhone.
Excluding asset impairment, benefits and merger-related costs, AT&T earned 75 cents per share, surpassing analyst estimates of 73 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
WarnerMedia, the unit that includes HBO Max, posted revenue of $8.6 billion, down from $9.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.
AT&T said it now has 41.5 million U.S. subscribers for both its premium TV channel HBO and streaming service HBO Max in the fourth quarter, up from 38 million the previous quarter.
Total operating revenue was $45.69 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $44.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
AT&T suffered a net loss during the quarter of $13.88 billion, or $1.95 per share.

Shares of AT&T were down less than 1% at $29.48 in morning trading.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 10:46AM ET</span>",Junior bankers feel left behind in COVID-era banking boom,"By Imani Moise and David French
(Reuters) - As top investment bankers orchestrated major deals through Zoom during the coronavirus pandemic, junior staffers say they were often sitting home, bored and alone, discouraged by an industry that has struggled to retain fresh talent.
In interviews, several analysts and associates explained what it has been like to work remotely rather than shadow mentors by day and build Excel models by night at the office.
One associate described spending most summer workdays on the couch watching ESPN and learning how to paint.
As a general-assignment analyst at a mid-size investment bank, he previously got thrown on any deals where teams needed help. The pandemic stifled those requests, because senior bankers opted to handle more work themselves rather than rely on juniors they could not easily supervise, he said.
A  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC associate recalled spending most of 2020 working on what bankers disparagingly call ""science projects."" Those are research assignments not tied to any live deal or paying client.
Like others, those two staffers spoke anonymously for fear of retribution from their employers. A Barclays spokesperson declined to comment.
Some junior staffers had busier schedules or more engaged bosses but largely painted an atmosphere where they felt forgotten and unnecessary, rather than one where they were being groomed for success.
“The fear that clients have is that they may be more susceptible to leaving now simply because they don't have the cultural norms, they don't have the personal loyalty or allegiances to people,"" said Alan Johnson, head of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.
Wall Street banks were already struggling to attract and retain young talent before the pandemic.
Investment firms and technology companies were luring young staff with comparable pay and shorter hours. Plus, Wall Street's reputation suffered from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and a spate of junior-staffer deaths attributed to grueling schedules.
Banks rolled out policies to boost morale, including limits on how many hours analysts could work. But negative experiences during the pandemic may harm retention in an industry that sees about 85% of analysts leave investment banks within two years, according to recruiting firms.
“On the turnover side, March or April will begin to tell the tale,"" Johnson said. ""I have told (clients) they're going to see an unusual amount.”
The value of M&A globally dropped 5% last year to $3.6 trillion, according to Refinitiv data. Global underwriting businesses fared better, with debt offerings up 31% to $10.2 trillion and equity offerings up 57% to $1.1 trillion.
That kept senior dealmakers busy.
For them, remote work from swanky urban apartments or far-flung chalets was not so bad. For those at the bottom of the ladder, it sometimes meant working from kitchen counters in cramped studios or childhood bedrooms.
Some returned to offices when infection rates fell. The change in scenery was nice but working from a mostly empty building did not cure loneliness brought on by the pandemic, said a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) associate who returned occasionally over the summer.
Yvana Petros, a senior analyst in  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s public sector group, was one who bucked the trend.
She maintained a running list of COVID-19 actions by governments before the International Monetary Fund started publishing an official list and offered it to senior bankers for client presentations. That got Petros invitations to Zoom meetings with government officials that she could not have attended in person.
""I found myself taking on responsibilities that were greater than what a first-year analyst typically would (get),"" she said. ""That was an opportunity for growth.""
Some executives also paid special attention to juniors.
Elinor Hoover, who heads Citigroup's consumer products group, launched virtual events like trivia or a “guess the desk” game where staffers submitted photos of their work set-ups anonymously and tried to match them with the right colleagues.
Along with one-on-one check-ins, the games are part of an “aggressive” effort to connect with the department's 60 junior bankers, she said.
Some are too disillusioned to stay in the industry.
The Barclays associate moved to his parents' home when his lease expired in July. His mother asked if banking was the right career after seeing him work until 3 a.m.

He is now looking for a job in business development.

Operated by Wockhardt UK, the plant provides so-called fill-and-finish capacity for AstraZeneca's UK supply chain, which is the final manufacturing step of putting vaccines into vials or syringes and packaging them.
AstraZeneca has agreed to supply Britain with 100 million doses of the vaccine, developed by Oxford University.
It is currently engaged in a dispute with the European Union after it cut supplies to the bloc due to production issues at its Belgian factory.
""Wockhardt UK in Wrexham this morning received a suspicious package to site. All relevant authorities were immediately notified and engaged,"" the company said, referring to its facility outside the town of Wrexham in north Wales.
""Upon expert advice we have partially evacuated the site pending a full investigation. The safety of our employees and business continuity remain of paramount importance,"" it said.
Local police confirmed that a bomb disposal unit was on site and advised the public to avoid the area.

""We are currently dealing with an ongoing incident on the Wrexham Industrial Estate,"" they said in a statement.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce says new UltraFan engine future-proof despite pandemic,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) is pushing ahead with its new greener engine UltraFan for now, confident that airlines will need it in the post-pandemic recovery even as new technologies catch up, the head of the project told Reuters. 
COVID-19 has sent aviation into meltdown. Passenger numbers have slumped, airline finances have collapsed and demand for planes has halted, pushing further into the future the date when either Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) will develop a new jet.
Without a new plane, UltraFan for now has no home, another challenge for the British company which was forced to raise funds last year to survive and is bleeding cash.
Alan Newby, Rolls-Royce's director of aerospace technology and future programmes, said UltraFan, which will reduce fuel burn by 10% compared with Rolls' most efficient current models, will still be needed. 
""It's the right solution pre-pandemic and it's still the right solution now even as the world goes to look at more green solutions,"" he said in an interview on Wednesday.
In the shorter term, though, UltraFan's future is less clear. Rolls CEO Warren East told the Financial Times earlier in January that once testing of a demonstrator finishes in 2022, it will be put on ice until a new aircraft arrives.
Newby pointed out that between now and the end of testing in 2022 or 2023, things could change. 
""If we see that application on the horizon, then we'll carry on, if not, then we'll pause,"" he said.
Planes take years to develop and he said if one was to be flying by 2030, the UltraFan programme would ""need to ramp up fairly soon to meet that customer demand."" 
Some analysts have speculated that delays mean UltraFan, a geared gas turbine, could be overtaken by new low-carbon technologies either before it flies, or before it is established as a profitable new market for Rolls. 
Newby said electric flying or hydrogen-powered aircraft, favoured by Airbus, could potentially fly short distance routes by the late 2030s, but the bulk of medium or longer routes will still be powered by ""UltraFan type products"".
UltraFan, he said, is being designed to run not just on normal jet fuel but also sustainable fuel, that is fuel produced from waste products, boosting its low carbon credentials. 
Another feature is that it will be scaleable, which Rolls hopes will open up a new market for it on single aisle jets which sell at higher volumes. The company's current engines power widebody jets, which tend to fly long-haul routes. 
At Rolls' facilities in Derby, central England, Newby's team are focused on building the first UltraFan engine this year, having completed most work on the underpinning technologies as part of a 500 million pound ($686 million) project started in 2014.
""It's challenging times for the company at the moment so having something like this ... seeing that first engine run, is massively exciting for all of us,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday updated its ban on investments in certain Chinese military companies by delaying until May the application of the directive's restrictions on companies with names similar to those that have been blacklisted.
In a statement posted on the U.S. Treasury Department website, the Biden administration said most investments in companies ""whose name closely matches, but does not exactly match, the name of a Communist Chinese military company"" would be allowed until May 27, extending the deadline which was originally set to Jan. 28. 
The order does not authorize securities transactions with subsidiaries of banned Chinese military companies, it added.
In November, former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration moved to prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese companies that Washington said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military in an effort to ramp up pressure on Beijing.
The order required U.S. investors to completely divest their holdings in the firms by Nov. 11, 2021 and was seen as part of a bid by Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and box Biden into hardline policies on Beijing.
The blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies was mandated by a 1999 law but the Defense Department only began complying by publishing names of the firms last year. The catalogue now includes 44 companies including China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO). 
Questions have swirled as to how the Biden administration will handle the tough new sanctioning tool but it has so far declined to provide any insight. 

Beijing has said the United States lacks evidence and described the ban as wanton oppression of its companies.

Investing.com -- Some games are too much fun to stop.
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) stock dominated the opening of trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, doubling in price from Tuesday's close as a horde of retail traders continued to squeeze short sellers out of the stock. That was despite reports suggesting that Melvin Capital, the hedge fund which had appeared to be the focus of the retail traders' attack, had closed out of its position.
The broader market opened in more muted fashion, however, overshadowed by a record annual loss reported by Boeing (NYSE:BA). Boeing stock fell 4.3%, despite the more positive news that its 737 MAX had been cleared to resume flying by European regulators.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 453 points, or 1.5%, at 30,484 points, The S&P 500 also retreated from its record high, losing 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9%. The Russell 2000, which had also surged to all-time highs earlier in the week, retraced even more, with a 2.6% drop.
Trading in other heavily shorted stocks was also volatile. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) was halted with the stock up 18%. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was also halted after tripling in the opening minutes of the session. AMC earlier this week had completed a $917 million raise of capital and liquidity that effectively removed the near-term risk of bankruptcy, potentially positioning the stock for a strong recovery as and when vaccination campaigns allow lockdown measures to be eased.
The moves appear likely to attract the attention of the Securities and Exchanges Commission, in as much as a large volume of posts in the influential r/wallstreetbets chatboard on Reddit, which boasts 2.7 million members, singled out Melvin's positions for particularly aggressive squeezing over recent days. Michael Burry, a hedge fund manager who famously shorted subprime mortgages in 2007-8 against a solid cartel of Wall Street interests, had been among one of the earliest to suggest that the short-selling of GameStop had gone too far last year, but described Tuesday's price action on Twitter as “unnatural, insane, and dangerous.”
Burry took down his tweet after thinking better of his original impulse to namecheck @SECEnforcement, according to Bloomberg.
The fireworks overshadowed more solid gains posted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, which rose 2.7% to a new all-time high after reporting quarterly earnings that confirmed its central position in some of the biggest trends of the moment: revenue from cloud hosting services rose 50% on the year, while the company also did well out of its video gaming operations and through sales of PCs, which have burgeoned thanks to the pandemic.
The Federal Reserve, whose ultra-loose monetary policy provides the backdrop to the current extraordinary mood on Wall Street, will announce the results of its latest policy meeting at 2 PM ET, and Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to be questioned about the financial stability risks arising from the policy. Finra data quoted by the Twitter account @Hedgopia indicated margin debt on S&P 500 products rose by 18% in the last two months of the year to $778 billion.


Elsewhere,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) stock slipped 1.8% ahead of its quarterly update after the closing bell, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which also both report this evening, edged up."
16,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 09:35AM ET</span>","Navistar to collaborate with GM, others on hydrogen fuel-cell commercial trucks","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Truck maker Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International Corp said on Wednesday it will collaborate with U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and others to develop a hydrogen fuel-cell powered commercial truck and supporting fueling network.
Navistar is one of several companies globally, including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Nikola Corp,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Hyundai Motor Co that are developing zero-carbon long-haul trucks. Moves by regulators to phase out internal combustion engines have energized a race to develop commercial vehicles powered by either batteries or hydrogen fuel cells. 
Navistar said it plans to offer its International RH (NYSE:RH) Series fuel-cell truck - powered by GM fuel cells - in model year 2024. The target driving range is more than 500 miles, with a hydrogen fueling time of less than 15 minutes. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Hydrogen fuel company OneH2, in which Navistar will take a undisclosed minority stake, will supply a fueling solution and incorporate more than 2,000 of the trucks into existing customer fleets. In addition, J.B. Hunt Transport Services will be the first customer to use the truck.
""Hydrogen fuel cells offer great promise for heavy-duty trucks in applications requiring a higher density of energy, fast refueling and additional range,"" Navistar Chief Executive Persio Lisboa said.
Hydrogen backers say it is cleaner than other carbon-cutting technologies because water and heat are the only byproducts and it can be made from numerous sources, including methane, coal, water, and even garbage. Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche technology, as there are not many fueling stations and potential customers also worry about resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.
For long-haul transport, proponents say hydrogen-powered trucks have an advantage over electric rivals as they have a greater range and require less time to charge. But they are expensive so their uptake and mass production has been slow.
Last November, Illinois-based Navistar and engine maker Cummins (NYSE:CMI) said they would work together on a fuel-cell Class 8 truck. Navistar is also developing battery electric trucks. 
Also that month, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s truck unit Traton SE agreed to pay $3.7 billion for the outstanding shares of Navistar it doesn't already own. That deal is expected to close in mid-2021. 
Wednesday's deal comes less than two months after GM announced a non-binding agreement to supply fuel cells to startup Nikola. GM said that deal is not affected by the Navistar agreement.
Under its agreement with Nikola, which must be finalized by year end, GM will supply its fuel-cell system for Nikola's Class 7 and 8 commercial semi-trucks 
Nikola expects to begin testing prototypes of its fuel-cell trucks by year end, and will break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in the second quarter.
Nikola has also said it will launch its Tre electric semi-truck with CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) in the fourth quarter. 
Korea's Hyundai in December said it was launching a brand dedicated to its hydrogen fuel-cell system, and last year delivered its first H2 Xcient fuel-cell trucks to customers.
Japan's Toyota has said a demonstration version off its heavy-duty fuel-cell truck, developed with subsidiary Hino Motor Co, would be ready in the first half of 2021.
Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) last June established a separate fuel-cell business unit, and previously announced a team-up with Volvo Trucks to develop fuel-cell systems for heavy-duty vehicles.

Tesla is aiming to compete for commercial customers with its electric Semi truck, which it expects to begin selling this year.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>",The big short: GameStop effect puts global bets worth billions at risk,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - Global bets worth billions of dollars could be at risk as amateur share traders challenge the bearish positions of influential funds, inflating stock valuations and leaving the professionals looking at potentially hefty losses. 
Gone are the days when bruised retail investors fled after prominent hedge funds bet against a stock -- the GameStop (NYSE:GME) effect is rippling across U.S. markets and spreading to Europe.
Shares of the 20 small-cap Russell 2000 index companies with the biggest bearish bets against them have risen 60% on average so far this year, easily outperforming the rest of the market, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data shows.
Similarly, the best performers in Britain this week have been companies such as Pearson and Cineworld, in which investors also have sizeable short positions. 
But share price surges such as the 700% year-to-date jump in U.S. video game retailer GameStop could potentially wipe out billions of dollars of those short bets.
Bets against GameStop alone amounted to more than $2.2 billion as of Monday, FIS' Analytics data showed, equivalent to more than a fifth of the company's market value.
However, the company's share price has quadrupled since the end of last week, reaching as much as $340 in U.S. pre-market trading on Wednesday.
""Most of the short positions are funded on margins. And so when markets run against you, you are stopped out if you are a short seller,"" said Kaspar Hense, a fund manager at BlueBay Asset Management, which runs $60 billion in assets.
""A short position can exaggerate your losses if you are not actively managing your position."" 
Several traders have told Reuters that one of the reasons for the jump in the price of some shares is short-sellers buying back into the stock to cover potential losses -- the classic short-squeeze -- drawing in more retail investors hoping to ride the wave.
Short sellers typically borrow stocks to sell with a view to buying them back later when the price falls. The premium they pay to borrow the shares reflects the demand for them. 
All the GameStop shares that would be available to borrow are are already out on loan, with traders estimating annual borrowing costs at 25%-50% of the company's share price.
Short-seller Andrew Left, who runs Citron Research and is one of the big names behind the bets against GameStop, shorted the stock when it traded around $40, expecting it to halve in value. He still has a short bet although he has covered the majority of the position at a 100% loss.
Melvin Capital Management also closed out a short position against GameStop at a 100% loss.
GameStop is not the only short bet that has turned sour. BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), AMC, Macy's (NYSE:M) and Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK), have all risen anywhere between 100% to 250% so far this year.
In Europe, Evotec, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Varta have outperformed the wider market 2021.
Refinitiv data on performance of some stocks with high short interest:
Company RIC YTD rise Short interest 
GameStop 700% 100% 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) 400% 100% 
Bed Bath 110% 62.8% 
BlackBerry 250% 35.8% 
Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) 100% 82% 
Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) 35% 34%

Russian steelmaker Evraz Plc said Tuesday it was considering options for demerging its coking coal business, five days after Brazilian iron-ore giant Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) took a first step to exiting the fossil fuel. Nearly every other major miner is the process of walking away from thermal coal, used in power stations.
The world’s biggest miners have been rethinking their thermal coal businesses as more investors shun exposure amid increasing concerns about carbon emissions and global warming. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group has already sold out, while BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc are in the process of exiting, though both so far remain committed to steelmaking ingredient coking coal.
Still, as others exit coal, opportunities remain for holdouts such as Glencore.
“Coal is in long-term decline; there’s a very good reason people are looking to exit,” said Ben Davis, an analyst at Liberum Capital. “But in the meantime Glencore is in an excellent position to manage supply and make abnormal profits with so little investment in the market.”
Coal accounts for about a third of Glencore’s earnings and vies with copper as the biggest source of the commodity giant’s profits.
Carbon Target
Instead of exiting coal, Glencore has committed to run down its assets by 2050 and in doing so become carbon neutral. That pledge includes so-called scope 3 emissions, produced when customers burn or process the materials the company mines.
The target sets Glencore apart from BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale and Anglo American, which will struggle to curb scope 3 emissions because their vast iron ore operations supply steelmakers, one of the most polluting industries.
Should that approach fail to win over investors, Glencore’s outgoing Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg has said he’ll support his anointed successor, Gary Nagle, in spinning off its coal business.
“I’ll support him in anything that creates value for shareholders,” Glasenberg said in December.

Shares in the country’s dominant e-commerce company Allegro SA slumped the most in more than a month after the U.S. retail giant announced on Wednesday it started registering local sellers for its Polish website planned to launch soon. The company is already running 10 fulfillment centers in Poland that process European deliveries, but hasn’t been present on the local market.
Amazon’s arrival is a direct threat to Allegro, which has ridden an unprecedented boom in online sales, which only accelerate after many Poles were confined to work from home because of the pandemic. The Polish platform, which has seen its shares almost double since its Warsaw debut in October, controls more than 36% of the market thanks to its strong consumer base and fast deliveries.
“Amazon’s entry exposes Allegro to a significant competition risk, challenging the view that the company may further boost its market share and raise margins,” said MBank SA analyst Pawel Szpigiel. “Even as Amazon fees may be higher, merchants will get fulfillment and packaging services and access to global shoppers, which will be its advantage.”
Allegro, whose shares were trading 6.9% lower at 70.41 zloty after dropping as much as 7.9% earlier, had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg.
More Rivals
Amazon’s move comes only a week after  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s announced plans to invest in parcel lockers in Poland to speed up delivery from Chinese merchants selling goods via its AliExpress platform. Global e-commerce operators bet that a lower share of online sales in Poland will quickly converge to levels seen in Western economies.
The announcement also coincides with a market debut of InPost SA, the country’s top logistic provider that cooperates closely with Allegro. Its stock soared in Amsterdam trading after its owners raised 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in Europe’s biggest initial public offering since 2018 amid an online shopping boom that’s driving up demand for the company’s automated parcel lockers.
MBank’s Szpigiel said that Amazon’s decision may further solidify InPost’s business model, as it confirms a high interest in Poland’s e-commerce and may boost its volumes. InPost Chief Executive Rafal Brzoska predicts that in the next five, six or seven years the nation’s retail market could split evenly between a traditional brick-and-mortar model and online shopping, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.
“A full retail offer for Polish consumers is our next step and it’s now the time for doing it,” Alex Ootes, Amazon’s Vice President for European Union expansion, said in an email.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","Wall Street expects near-record iPhone sales despite delay, shut Apple stores","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - During the last three months of 2020, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered its flagship iPhone 12 model weeks later than normal iPhone debuts and shuttered some of its stores due to the pandemic.
But Wall Street is still expecting a near-record sales quarter for the Cupertino, California company's signature device when it reports fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, with estimates of $59.8 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Jan. 26. If Apple beats the number, it could eclipse its all-time record of $61.58 billion in iPhone sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
Analyst largely attribute the boost to the timing of the iPhone 12 lineup, which had a new look, 5G cellular data connectivity and new models at the top and bottom of the sizing range. 
""They have an extremely good understanding of what their refresh cycle looks like and when waves are possible and whey they are not,"" said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. ""Every bit of data across China and Europe has shown that not only was the installed base getting older, but people were not refreshing. I think (Apple) knew it would be heavy refresh cycle.""
Analyst also expect strong Mac sales of $8.69 billion, according to Refinitiv data from Jan. 26, thanks in part to the introduction of models with the first central processor chip for its laptops and desktop that Apple designed itself. Overall, analysts expect $103.28 billion in sales and earnings per share of $1.41 for Apple's fiscal first quarter.
A ""super cycle"" of booms in iPhone sales after several more modest years are not new to Apple - the company's previous high came after it announced the iPhone X, with a new design. During previous cycles, Apple's shares often traded at lower price-to-earnings ratios than its rivals due to Apple's dependence on the iPhone.
But those ratios have risen over the past year, and analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein wondered how much further they can go.

""At 33x consensus (fiscal year 2021 earnings per share), and buyside expectations above the Street's, we struggle to see case for material outperformance in (Apple), absent a surprise product announcement or migration to a bundled hardware subscription model,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

(Reuters) - Silicon Valley venture capital firm TCV said on Wednesday it raised $4 billion for its 11th fund, the biggest fund in its 25-year history, after many of the portfolio companies in its previous funds boosted their business amid the pandemic.
The announcement follows a record year for U.S. venture capital firms which raised $73.6 billion in 2020, beating the previous record of $68.1 billion set in 2018, according to PitchBook. Still, the number of funds fell to 321 last year versus 595 in 2018, showing fewer funds raised bigger amounts.
TCV invests in private companies at the later growth stage. In some cases, as with its investment in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc, the firm will continue to invest or hold its stake after the companies go public, said Neil Tolaney, general partner at TCV. 
The latest fund will help TCV ""double down"" on its investments in areas including fintech, education technology and digital entertainment, he said.
Some of the biggest venture capital funds raised last year, according to PitchBook, include Tiger Global Management's $3.75 billion fund in January, New Enterprise Associates's $3.6 billion fund in March, and Andreessen Horowitz's two funds in November totaling nearly $4.6 billion.

PALO ALTO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) may face questions about fallout from U.S. election controversies when it posts earnings on Wednesday, but top of mind for investors is a less political matter: the company's heavy bet on e-commerce to drive ad sales.
The world's biggest social media company is poised to reap a windfall from that gambit, analysts say, bolstered by a return in ad growth rates to pre-COVID levels and a holiday shopping boost from its new ""social commerce"" features.
Wall Street expects the company to report fourth-quarter sales up 25% to $26.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Driving those gains were a coronavirus-era shift away from physical stores and the unequal impact of the pandemic on low-income populations, which left others with ""flush household balance sheets,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.
Investors will be watching for signs of how new shopping features performed, including tools like Facebook Pay that enable in-app purchases in units Instagram and WhatsApp as well as on the company's namesake app.
""This e-commerce investment seems to have started to pay off right as offline businesses are looking for more online activity,"" BofA Global Research analysts wrote.
Investors will also look for guidance on the company's plans to integrate messaging across its suite of apps and introduce shopping into Reels, a short-video product inside Instagram intended to compete with TikTok, they said.
Still, Facebook is likely to face questions around U.S. antitrust complaints, privacy changes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest iOS update and Facebook's role in recent Capitol protests, as well as the business impact of its decision to suspend former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Facebook will be the first of the ad-supported tech companies to post its earnings this season. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Twitter, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) are set to follow in the coming weeks.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading lower Wednesday, with investors focusing on the tech sector as a number of household names report earnings and the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 226 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 28 points, or 0.7%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 15 points, or 0.1%.

Additionally, the company reported its Azure cloud computing services grew 50%, pleasing investors who see this segment as key to the company’s future success.
Earnings from the crucial tech sector continue Wednesday, with investors no doubt hoping Microsoft’s solid numbers reflect well on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), who are all scheduled to report after the closing bell.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Business jet prices seen as stabilizing in 2021 after year-end order blitz,"By Allison Lampert and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Preowned business jet prices are seen stabilizing in 2021, boosted by a December blitz of orders, after COVID-19 depressed demand and pricing last year, analysts and executives said.
New entrants to the business jet market and U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of favorable tax rules they feared could change under the new Biden administration fueled a December rush. 
""It was the busiest month I have ever seen in my 20 years of practice,"" said Amanda Applegate, a partner at Aerlex Law Group.
Some executives have seen continued demand from wealthy individuals in January, although corporate demand was sluggish. 
The surge could help pricing and orders for new jets this year, following a decline in 2020 deliveries of new aircraft that analysts put at 20% to 30%.
Orders and pricing of preowned jets offer clues to demand for new planes which is crucial for jet makers releasing earnings this week. Gulfstream parent General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) report earnings on Wednesday while Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc announces results on Feb. 11.
Pre-owned jet inventory dropped to 8% this month, the lowest recorded level to date in this millennium, analyst Rolland Vincent said, citing JETNET figures. A tighter preowned market normally helps pricing and sales of new planes.
The preowned market has roughly four times the transactions as the new plane market, Vincent said. 
""I do think it gets firmer this year,"" Vincent said of pre-owned and new plane pricing, pointing to a more stable market.
A recent survey of 102 jet brokers published by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) showed the average discount on the list price of a new business jet narrowed to about 14% this month, compared with 16% before COVID struck.
List prices for business jets vary from around $9 million for  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ)'s Phenom 300, according to Jefferies, to about $73 million for Bombardier's large cabin Global 7500.
On average, 2020 asking prices on preowned business jets were 10% lower than in 2019, according to a JETNET analysis. 
Preowned planes sold to operators in the United States, the world's largest corporate jet market, rebounded to at least 1,828 aircraft in 2020, up from 1,651 in 2019, according to Amstat business aviation aircraft market research.
Florida attorney Stewart Lapayowker said some recent buying was over concerns about potential tax changes after reforms implemented during the Trump administration provided for accelerated depreciation for aircraft.
Don Dwyer, managing partner at Guardian Jet, sees ""pent up demand"" this year for new planes following a December surge in preowned deals that continued into January.
""There wasn't a year end,"" he said. ""It just kept going.""

39,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Reddit's War on Wall Street Spills Over Into Europe,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com --The war between Wall Street short-sellers and the army of retail traders made famous by an influential Reddit chatboard has spilled over into Europe, with sharp squeezes in a handful of midcap stocks generating intense price volatility.
By mid-morning in Europe on Wednesday, shares in German battery maker  Varta  (DE:VAR1) had risen a further 10.4% to another new record high, the third day in a row it had achieved the feat. It’s now up by some 43% in the last week alone.
It’s a similar story for another German company Evotec (DE:EVTG), a life sciences specialist. It’s surged as much as 35% over the last three days.
Finally CD Priojekt, the Polish video-game maker behind the Cyber Punk 2077 game, has risen nearly 40% from late last week.
All three stocks had been shorted by the hedge fund Melvin Capital, which has become a lightning-rod for the anti-Wall Street sentiment bubbling among retail traders in the U.S. A number of posts on the r/wallstreetbets chatboard, which now boasts some 2.7 million members, suggest that what started out as a battle of convictions over the valuation of gaming retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) has morphed into something much broader, leading to the targeting of any stock shorted by Melvin. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Melvin had closed its short on Evotec. The company didn’t confirm the report.
All three stocks, however, showed signs of peaking in Wednesday morning trade in Europe, and were well off their intraday highs by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT).
Varta, which has reinvented itself from a dowdy manufacturer of batteries for cars and toys to a specialist in microbatteries for connected devices such as ear buds, has been a popular stock with German retail investors over the last couple of years. Its momentum has been helped in recent months by the prospect of generous subsidies from the European Union to build an industry capable of meeting the fast-growing demand for lithium-ion batteries from the auto sector.
That, however, has left Varta with the kind of price-tag that short-sellers are naturally drawn to: at Tuesday’s close, it was trading at over six times trailing 12-month sales and over 62 times earnings, Wednesday’s moves stretch that valuation even further.
Likewise, Evotec’s 5 billion-euro valuation at Tuesday’s close was more than 10 times sales and 350 times earnings. CD Projekt’s p/e of 138 seems relatively undemanding until one realizes that it represents 37 times sales and that the big driver of revenue growth – the much-delayed and bug-ridden Cyber Punk – suffered one of the most embarrassing fiascos in recent memory at its launch late last year.
Cyber Punk had to be withdrawn from most online game stores due to its bugs, but the company has now issued a patch which analysts say should see it back in Sony’s Playstation store by February.
CD Project (WA:CDR) stock is perhaps a special case: even before the war between Reddit and Melvin erupted, brokers had started to say that the sell-off in the wake of Cyber Punk’s botched launch had gone too far. It had fallen nearly 50% in December. Neither of the German stocks, however, has generated any news significantly changing their investment case in recent days, however.
As such, all three are trading at levels now dictated less by even a passing concern for accurate valuations than by the desire of Main Street America to settle scores with Wall Street. It makes for a fascinating spectacle, but it makes all three uninvestable for serious investors as long as the war continues."

The share spikes in GameStop and others including BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Ltd, headphone maker Koss Corp and Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA), have sent short-sellers scrambling to cover losing bets, while raising questions about potential regulatory clampdowns.
The top securities regulator in Massachusetts thinks trading in GameStop stock, which has jumped to $148 a share from $19.95 since Jan. 12, suggests there is something ""systemically wrong"" with the options trading surrounding the stock, Barron's reported on Tuesday.
GameStop, BlackBerry and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) were among the most heavily traded U.S. stocks before the bell, with analysts putting the moves partly down to herds of amateur investors chasing tips from Reddit discussion threads or the private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group ""Robin Hood's Stock Market Watchlist"".
""These are not normal times and while the (Reddit) r/wallstreetbets thing is fascinating to watch, I can't help but think that this is unlikely to end well for someone,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said.
Trading in GameStop stock was halted for volatility nine times on Monday and five times on Tuesday. 
Short sellers in GameStop are down $5 billion on a mark-to-market, net-of-financing basis in 2021, which included $876 million of losses early Tuesday, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. 
But some hedge funds have refused to budge from their bearish bets, with FIS' Analytics data showing investors had piled on $2.2 billion in bearish bets on GameStop - a whopping 20% of its market capitalization. 

Meanwhile in Europe, shares of Evotec and Varta jumped on chatter that Melvin Capital Management was being forced to unwind its short positions to cover losses on its other bearish bets, including GameStop.

OSLO (Reuters) - Nasdaq Clearing has been fined 300 million Swedish crowns ($36 million) by Sweden's financial supervisory authority (FI) over the default of a power trader in 2018 that showed deficiencies in its operations, the FI said on Wednesday. 
The default by private Norwegian trader Einar Aas left a 114 million euro ($139 million) hole in the clearing house's resources, forcing other members of the market to cover the loss within two business days or face default themselves.
Nasdaq Clearing, a Swedish unit of Nasdaq Inc, had also violated EU regulations by investing its own funds in derivative contracts for too long after the default, the regulator said.
""Together with other deficiencies that are presented in this decision, these breaches have created unacceptable risks in Nasdaq Clearing's operations, which could have had a very serious impact on the financial system,"" the FI's decision said.
Nasdaq said in a statement it had launched a comprehensive programme to strengthen its resilience and robustness immediately after the default, and would analyse the FI's decision before deciding on any next steps.
The trader's default was triggered by big fluctuations in market spreads, when power prices in the hydroelectric-dependent region fell due to heavy rain while German power prices spiked due to a rise in the cost of carbon, Nasdaq said at the time.
Einar Aas did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the case.
In 2018, Aas said his position in the market had been ""too big in relation to the market's liquidity"" and that he risked personal bankruptcy. 
Aas later struck deals with his creditors, settling the claims against him.

Its penalty included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs, which had acquired the Italian company via one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.
The European Commission in its 2014 decision said Goldman Sachs, as the parent company, had decisive influence over Prysmian. A lower EU tribunal in 2018 backed its argument.
The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) agreed with the reasoning and rejected Goldman Sachs' appeal.
""The General Court did not err in law in finding that, in the present case, the Commission was entitled to rely on a presumption of actual exercise of decisive influence in order to establish the appellant's liability for the infringement at issue in relation to the pre-IPO period,"" CJEU judges said.
The case is C-595/18 P The  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) v Commission.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>","No Brexit bonfire for City of London, but it won't be a 'rule taker'","By Guy Faulconbridge and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - London has no desire for a bonfire of regulations to retain its position as a top international finance centre after Brexit but it is ready to act if the European Union blocks access, the City of London's political leader said.
While it is still the only global centre to rival New York, London has seen some business and job losses since the shock 2016 Brexit vote and financial services were largely forgotten by British leaders during EU divorce negotiations, cutting the City off from its biggest single customer.
""It's disappointing to lose business but it's not at all catastrophic,"" Catherine McGuinness, who leads the ancient financial district's ruling body, the City of London Corporation, told Reuters.
The City, McGuinness said, neither wanted nor expected Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government to light ""a bonfire of regulations"". Still, a financial capital the size of London could not be a ""rule taker"", she said.
""We're not looking for a bonfire of regulation, we're not looking for a move away from international standards - absolutely not,"" McGuinness said. ""We're not expecting any major deregulation at all.""
Asked if it was worth Britain seeking so-called equivalence, essentially agreeing to stay aligned with EU financial rules in return for market access, McGuinness said: ""I would hope that equivalence decisions could be made because they ought to be pragmatic and we are completely aligned in terms of rules.""
It would be irrational of the EU to refuse, she said. 
""Its clear that we can't be rule takers - we must be rule makers. We need to look at what our strengths are and what we need to do to build on them effectively - and hopefully that's against the framework of international regulations that we will help to shape.""
The EU says it wants to examine planned UK divergence from EU rules before deciding on any UK access.
FISH BEAT FINANCE
London's Brexit job losses so far to the EU were around 7,500, McGuinness said, still at the low end of the range predicted by investment consultant Oliver Wyman which said in 2016 that the British capital could shed 65,000 to 75,000 jobs in a sector that employs a million people.
London dominates the world's $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, it is the biggest centre for international banking and the second largest fintech hub in the world after the United States.
New York retained the top spot in a survey of global financial centres published in September by Global Financial Centres Index, with London strengthening its position in second. 
While trading in euro shares and some derivatives has left for other European centres - with some to New York - after Brexit, no one European competitor has dominated and so London views New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore as its true rivals.
Some elements of the bond, derivatives and capital markets had moved after Brexit, McGuinness said, though London retained by far the deepest capital markets in its time zone.
The finance sector pays more than 10% of Britain's tax bill, but McGuinness said in 2019 that British leaders were throwing it under a bus during Brexit negotiations by focusing on the goods trade and largely ignoring finance.
Britain's trade deal with the EU, clinched last month, does not cover financial market access.
""It was disappointing, it was very surprising. I've speculated it's because fish is more picturesque than finance, it may be that we don't tell our own story well enough or perhaps they felt the sector was big enough it make its own way,"" she said.
McGuinness said she hoped Johnson's government would now focus on the future of the City, helping green finance, fintech, Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) and new types of companies generate capital.

""I think we'll stay the FX capital of the world - that would be my prediction,"" McGuinness said when asked about the long-term future of the City. ""We are very confident in London's basic strengths and that we will make up business elsewhere.""

MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was down 0.1% at 0842 GMT, having edged down in the last week after it hit a new all-time high on Jan. 21.
In the Asian session on Wednesday, shares were hurt by some profit-taking, as investors grew wary of stretched valuations.
European share indexes opened in the red. The STOXX 600 was down around 0.3% on the day at 0854 GMT.
London's FTSE 100 was down 0.2% while Germany's DAX was down 0.5%.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies as European markets opened, and was at 90.275 at 0846 GMT, up 0.1% on the day.
The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes but investors will be listening for changes in tone around the economic outlook and any mention of slowing down - or ""tapering"" - the Fed's asset purchases.
""The big question will be over any timetable for tapering asset purchases, but Powell is likely to adopt a dovish tone on this, and reiterate that it’s premature to contemplate this given the challenging near-term outlook and remaining uncertainties,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid wrote in a note to clients.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield held close to the three-week low it hit in the previous session, and was broadly flat on the day at 1.0398% at 0846 GMT.
Quarterly earnings from U.S. tech giants including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), due later in the session, were also in focus.
""With some financial assets currently trading at what many are describing as bubble territory, there’ll be heightened attention on these releases to see whether these current valuations are justified,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.
Although S&P 500 e-minis were down around 0.1%, Nasdaq futures were up 0.4% at 0847 GMT, helped by strong Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings the previous session. Microsoft said its Azure cloud computing services grew by 50%.
Heightened participation of retail investors in the stock market has come into focus this week, as amateur traders on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets stock trading discussion group piled into GameStop (NYSE:GME), causing it to skyrocket while professional shortsellers scrambled to cover losing bets.
To some stock market professionals, the recent moves look symbolic of a stock market that may be overvalued at the end of a year dominated by floods of fiscal and monetary stimulus to ease the coronavirus crisis.
The International Monetary Fund raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2021, and said the coronavirus-triggered downturn last year would be nearly one percentage point less severe than expected.
Global COVID-19 cases surpassed 100 million on Wednesday and countries around the world are struggling with new variants of the virus and delays in vaccine rollouts.
The United States aims to have enough vaccine doses to vaccinate most Americans by the Summer, President Joe Biden said on Tuesday.
In Europe, supplies of the COVID-19 vaccine have been delayed. Hospitalisations in France hit an eight-week high.
The euro was down 0.1% at $1.21455 at 0848 GMT, while euro zone government bond yields edged up slightly.
Gold was down around 0.2%. Bitcoin was down around 3.3%.
Oil prices rose after industry data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week and China recorded its lowest daily rise in COVID-19 cases in more than two weeks.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Wednesday, with investors focusing on the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, corporate earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.  
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.2%, while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%. 
Many of the European Union countries have been slow to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to their populations, dulling the generally positive tone exiting in equity markets over the last few months. 
Not helping has been an ongoing spat between pharma giant AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and EU health officials over delays in vaccine deliveries within the bloc. Astra CEO Pascal Soriot said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that the delays were due to the EU only signing its contract with the company three months after the U.K. signed a similar one.
“Much now depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines to end the pandemic, and on the ability of policies to provide effective support until that happens,” the International Monetary Fund’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post Tuesday. 
The IMF raised its growth estimate for the global economy to 5.5% in 2021, from +5.2% in its last forecast in October.
Despite this upgrade, German consumer confidence is set to drop sharply, after the latest GfK German consumer climate index fell to -15.6 from -7.5 last month. French confidence data also retreated, with the January figure falling to 92 from 95 in December.
Investors will also be keeping an eye on the U.S. Federal Reserve, as the central bank is due to announce results of its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday. 
In corporate news, UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stock rose 1.1% after Bloomberg reported that the Italian bank’s board will appoint ex-UBS investment bank head Andrea Orcel as the new CEO Wednesday, replacing Jean-Pierre Mustier.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock rose 1.6% as strong sales at fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, particularly in China, helped to cushion the impact on the French luxury group from the coronavirus pandemic.
SAP (DE:SAPG) stock rose 0.7% after the German software company provided a strategy update, while also benefiting from Microsoft’s strong results, released late on Tuesday. 
 Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) stock slid 3.6% after the precious metal miner lowered its forecast for gold output for the current year.
Oil prices climbed Wednesday, boosted by industry data showing U.S. crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released Tuesday, showed a draw of 5.272 million barrels for the week ending Jan. 22, compared with a forecast for a 603,000-barrel build. The U.S. Energy Information Administration data are due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $52.95 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $56.09. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,845.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2147.

The online retailer is concerned that excise duty will now have to be paid twice on shipments of alcohol which are sent from the British mainland across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland, ITV reported.
Britain left the European Union's single market and customs union on Dec. 31, introducing paperwork and customs declarations for those businesses that import and export goods with the bloc.
In order to keep the border open between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, a separate agreement was struck that requires a regulatory border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
The British government said the overwhelming majority of parcels continued to move smoothly, and there was no reason for businesses not to send goods to Northern Ireland. 

""These goods will not be taxed twice, and we will issue new guidance clarifying the position to ensure any remaining issues are addressed,"" a government spokesman said.

51,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 03:18AM ET</span>",GameStop’s Dizzying Surge Makes Its Japan Peer Seem a Bargain,"(Bloomberg) -- Looking for an alternative to the highly volatile spikes and troughs of trading  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).?
The rally in the videogame retailer is making  Geo Holdings Corp . (T:2681), a Japanese bricks-and-mortar retailer of games and DVDs, look positively cheap in comparison. The Japanese firm trades at about 0.2 times its trailing sales, versus GameStop’s nearly 2 times valuation as of Wednesday.
What it’s lacking in activist investor board members -- and an army of Reddit-fueled backers -- Geo makes up for in regular dividend payments, plus it has only posted a net loss in two quarters in the past 10 quarters, compared with 8 for GameStop, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Geo has generated a profit of $22 million in the last 12 months versus a loss of $275 million for its U.S. peer.
Michael Burry Calls GameStop Rally ‘Unnatural, Insane’
And while no one is thinking that Gamestop’s gains have anything to do with its fundamentals, consider that Geo trades at just 1/20 of the market value of GameStop (as of the U.S. firm’s most recent close, at least), and operates in a country that still loves physical media.
The company runs over 1,000 of its Geo locations in Japan. Like GameStop, it takes trade-ins for second-hand games, while it also rents movies and CDs (Japan does not permit videogame rentals by law). Another plus point is Geo’s “2nd Street” chain of stores, which sell used clothes, shoes and electronics.
Geo estimates that the secondhand market in Japan will nearly double in size in 2025 to 3.5 trillion yen ($33.8 billion) from 2015, with online flea market Mercari Inc. another beneficiary of this trend. As movie rental sales decline, Geo has seen the segment make up an increasing share of its business.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Column: Bubble-wary markets eye ETF crush in tech and crypto - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Is the presumed proliferation of market bubbles just speculative froth among amateur traders or is concentrated institutional money blowing big soapy spheres that interconnect and may inevitably burst each other? 
The two factors are certainly at play as savings balloon amid massive government and central bank support for confined populations during the pandemic.
Over-caffeinated day traders with whizzy new stock market apps and punting from bedrooms during lockdown get most blame for some of blinding single stock surges of the past six months.
The parabolic price surges include seemingly unrelated booms in anything from carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to cryptocurrency Bitcoin, Big Tech 'disrupters' or barely profitable internet startups.
Few doubt the combination of pandemic confinement, job furloughs, windfall savings and low-cost trading platforms all speak loudly to the phenomenon.
But the buzz around some active themed funds in the mushrooming Exchange Traded Fund space is just as eye-catching and perhaps raises bigger questions about concentrated risk.
A ballooning of the ETF world since the last great crash is the first obvious point - as they were only bit players in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. The number of ETFs captured by fund tracker Lipper has risen almost five-fold since 2009 to some 5,582 worldwide last year - with combined assets of almost $6 trillion compared with less than $900 billion 11 years ago.
Refinitiv data shows the combined ETF and wider Exchange Traded Products category topped $7 trillion last year - about 8% of total world equity market capitalisation. 
And to the extent that ETFs have traditionally been passive index trackers, growth of the sector over those years has appeared pretty benign. Their attraction stems largely from their pitch as low-cost vehicles channelling savings and 401(k) pension money into broadly diversified portfolios and which only disrupt the pricier end of the active management business.
What's more, long-standing fears of potential accidents with daily exchange sourcing and pricing of underlying assets and adequate cash balances during market stress have proven mostly unfounded to date during market wobbles of the past decade. 
But as the years rolled on and virtually every index on the planet was shadowed by multiple ETFs, questions about new trading strategies and ideas were increasingly met with the response: ""There's an ETF for that"".
Far from simple and passive index trackers, a blizzard of themed and leveraged ETFs has emerged - charging higher fees for targeted outperformance or demanded by professional investors for hedging purposes. 
A report by Citi this week shows thematic ETFs came into their own last year, with a $57 billion surge in flows bringing total assets to some $140 billion, and it reckoned this growth was ""still in its early stages"". 
And perhaps unsurprisingly, given the tech boom and ongoing lockdowns, it shows ""disruptive innovators"" and ""clean energy"" funds have driven the trend and that's where the concentration of new inflows and assets lie.
For some analysts, the swelling of these types of funds goes a way to explaining recent outsize and sometimes correlated market moves hitting the headlines - and could cause serious headaches if just one part of them were to go into reverse.
For a graphic on Themed disrupter ETFs capture and drive zooming stocks:

For a graphic on Total Net Assets in ARK's Innovation ETF:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgyzqxvq/ARK.PNG
TWO BY TWO
For example, four of the 10 best performing non-leveraged ETFs over the past year were themed funds managed by ARK Invest - with its flagship Ark Innovation and Ark Next Generation Internet generating year-on-year returns of between 750-850%. Assets under management have hit more than $24 billion and $6 billion respectively, compared with less that $2 billion and $500 million each just a year ago. 
What's in those funds is more interesting. Unlike many wider index trackers, they are concentrated in little over 50 stocks, with Tesla making up about 10% in each and the Next Generation Internet ETF also including crypto investor Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as its fifth largest holding alongside the likes of TV streaming firm  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) and online health firm Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC).
Citing a recent analysis in Barron's magazine examining difficulties for open-ended ETFs like ARK's hitting capacity limits in relatively illiquid stocks due to enormous inflows, Saxo Bank strategist Peter Garnry warned of spillovers in any sharp reversals in its holdings.
""We are basically putting out the warning this interconnectedness of positions could drive each other and become the epicenter of the next correction in growth equities,"" he wrote. ""Our thinking is that a sell-off in Bitcoin can cause risk adverse behaviour among investors with Tesla-Bitcoin-Ark positions and suddenly a vicious sell-off has started"".
Whether themed ETFs are prone to bunching relatively small stocks that have seen sharp price rises and these then attract waves of inflows looking to ape past performance that merely blow bubbles in the process is a question.
Citi notes this problem. ""We are cognizant of a 'which comes first' dilemma, the theme or the underlying stock price action?""
And on that, recent studies aren't kind.
An academic paper by Itzhak Ben-David, Francesco Franzoni, Byungwook Kim and Rabih Moussawi published by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week studied ETFs over the 20 years before the pandemic and concluded that what they call 'specialized' ETFs performed poorly. 
""These ETFs tend to hold attention-grabbing and overvalued stocks and therefore underperform significantly. They deliver a negative alpha of about −4% a year,"" it said, adding that under-performance persists for at least five years following launch - usually the peak of excitement around the investment theme.
Perhaps it's different since the pandemic.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A consortium led by state-owned pharma giant Sinopharm plans to take private China Traditional Chinese Medicine Holdings in a deal that would value the firm at at least $3.3 billion, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Sinopharm, China TCM's parent and major shareholder, is teaming up with the next two biggest stockholders, Ping An Insurance Group Co of China and executive director Wang Xiaochun, said the people, with the three holding a combined 49.4% stake.
It plans to offer at least HK$5.10 ($0.66) per share for China TCM, the people said, a premium of about 33% to the average share price over the past month of HK$3.83. China TCM shares were trading up nearly 8% at HK$4.35 on Wednesday afternoon.
The move comes as Hong Kong-listed China TCM has lagged a surge in valuations for many mainland-listed Chinese traditional medicine firms during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by a belief that some formulations can prevent the disease.
Zhangzhou Pianzehuang Pharmaceutical, which makes traditional medicine for inflammatory pain and fever relief, has more than doubled its share price over the past year and is trading at over 100 times its trailing price-to-earnings.
Shares in China TCM, however, rose just 2% last year. The stock is trading at 9 times forward earnings, well below the industry median of 20, according to Refinitiv data. 
The Sinopharm-led consortium aims to eventually list China TCM on the mainland bourse to take advantage of higher valuations there, one of the sources said.
Representatives of Sinopharm, China TCM and Wang did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Ping An declined to comment.
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media and the deal talks were confidential. 
TAKE-PRIVATE OPPORTUNITIES
The potential transaction would add to a surge in strategic investors and buyout firms tapping Hong Kong for take-private opportunities. Buyers often cite undervalued shares as a reason for the deals.
The total value of buyouts of Hong Kong-listed companies reached $25 billion last year, up 190% from 2019 and the highest since 2017. The number of such transactions - at 60 - is already an annual record, according to Refinitiv data.
Headquartered in Foshan, Guangdong, China TCM is the core platform established by Sinopharm for the traditional Chinese medicine segment. It has over 16,000 employees and more than 1,300 patent medicine regulations, according to its website.
The company reported revenue for the first half of 2020 of about 6.7 billion yuan ($1.04 billion), down 4.1% year-on-year. 
The decrease was mainly due to the underperformance of business operations affected by COVID-19, it said.

Sinopharm holds 32% of China TCM, while Ping An has 12% and Wang 5.4%. The consortium is looking for financial investors to join the take-private bid, the sources said. It aims to finalize the deal by end-March.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning after their biggest slide in two months during the previous sessions. Investors continue to digest U.S. earnings reports alongside COVID-19 virus variants and hurdles to the passage of more U.S. Stimulus measures.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.78% by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT) after returning from a holiday. Data released earlier today showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.9% both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.15%. The city saw a second flash neighborhood lockdown in a small section of Yau Ma Tei implemented and lifted in less than 24 hours.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.07%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.28%. The country's state of emergency, currently set to expire on Feb. 7, could reportedly be extended until the end of February.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.05%.
Global shares are staying near record highs with the U.S. corporate earnings season gearing up over the course of the week. New COVID-19 variants have prompted governments to impose fresh restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, and weighing in on reflection trades betting on an end to these curbs.
Investors also await answers to questions over the timing and size of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package proposed by U.S, President Joe Biden earlier in the month.
Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said that a vote on a budget resolution, a possible first step towards passing the package via the ‘reconciliation’, could take place as early as the following week.
For some investors, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and economic recovery are the keys to sustaining a rally.
“For the reopening trade to really have persistence it is going to need to show a much broader participation across the market … the virus vaccine rollout is the most important development to help give confidence in the shape of the recovery,”  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) chief investment strategist Jim McDonald told Bloomberg.
Biden’s administration indicated that it intends to order 100 million more doses each of  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines. It will also speed up shipments to states, at least temporarily.
On the COVID-19 front, the number of global cases has exceeded 100 million as of Jan. 27, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The same data showed that the number of deaths in the U.K. passed the 100,00 mark.
Across the Atlantic, the U.S. Federal Reserve will wrap up a two-day policy meeting and hand down its policy decision later in the day. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is widely expected to retain the central bank’s current dovish tone in his comments.
The U.S. will release a slew of economic data, including fourth-quarter GDP, initial jobless claims and new home sales, on Thursday. Personal income, spending and pending home sales data will be released a day later."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The operator of Hong Kong's main airport is aiming to raise as much as $1.5 billion via bond issuance to help fund the construction of a third runway, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Calls with investors started on Wednesday for the Airport Authority Hong Kong deal which consists of 10-year and 30-year U.S. dollar denominated unsecured notes, a term sheet showed.
The sources said the airport operator would likely raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with the final amount finalised this week.
The sources declined to be identified as the information has not yet been made public. Airport Authority Hong Kong did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The deal is Asia's third aviation-related debt transaction since the start of 2021 after Singapore Airline raised $500 million and Bank of China Aviation finalised a $400 million issuance.
The airport bonds are expected to be rated AA+ by S&P, the term sheet showed.
The construction of a third runway is expected to be finished in 2022 and should be fully operational by 2024, according to the airport's website. It said the project should cost HK$141.5 billion ($18.3 billion).
Travel through Hong Kong's airport has been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic with an 87.7% drop in passenger numbers in 2020, although cargo flights rose 18.3%.

Hong Kong's government finalised a $2.5 billion green bond issuance on Wednesday, a statement from the city's monetary authority said.

The video game retailer's after-hours surge added to a 93% jump during Tuesday's trading session, with the company's stock propelled by traders on Wallstreetbets, many of them buying volatile call options.
""This is certainly on my radar,"" William Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, told the magazine. ""I'm concerned because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""
GameStop and the office of the securities regulator in Massachusetts did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment outside business hours.
The stock surged 50% in extended trade after Musk tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"", along with a link to Reddit's Wallstreetbets stock trading discussion group. ""Stonks"" is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media.

GameStop has surged more than seven-fold to $147.98 from $19 since Jan. 12, spurring concerns over bubbles in stocks that hedge funds and other speculative players bet will fall in value.

""Southwest remains overstaffed in many areas. As a result, some departments will be offering additional opportunities for Employees to take Extended Time Off (ExTO) beginning in March 2021, based upon projected staffing levels"", the company said in an email to Reuters. 
""The additional opportunities for leave align with the period when some Employees will return from previously-awarded, six-month leaves on March 1, 2021"", the company added. 
Bloomberg reported earlier that 791 Southwest pilots have agreed to take off one to three months.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Tuesday reported a larger-than-expected fall in quarterly sales as the renewed surge in coronavirus cases in the United States kept customers at home. 
The world's largest coffee chain's global same-store sales fell 5% in its first quarter, which ended Dec. 27, more than analysts' estimates of a 3.4% decline, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Shares fell slightly in extended trading.
The second wave of COVID-19 infections and accompanying restrictions dented traffic at the coffee chain's stores, hampering its efforts to boost demand through product launches and new drive-thrus. 
Comparable sales declined 6% for the Americas region, compared with a 5.2% fall expected by analysts.
But in China, Starbucks' biggest growth market, comparable sales rose 5% as the company benefited from the popularity of its rewards program and the return of pre-coronavirus consumer habits. 
Customers also spent more money per order, helping to offset fewer transactions.
Starbucks also said Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer would be leaving the company next month to take a chief executive officer role at another company.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc later announced that Brewer would take the helm at the company effective March 15.
For the second quarter, Starbucks said it expects U.S. comparable sales to rise between 5% and 10%, while in China they were forecast to grow nearly two-fold a year after the pandemic hit the region.
The company did not change its guidance of an expected rebound overall this year, with global comparable sales expected to rise 18% to 23% in 2021.
Net revenue fell 5% to $6.7 billion, missing expectations of $6.93 billion. 
The Seattle-based company has been closing some stores, adding drive-thrus to others, remaking some with smaller cafes and building a few with no seating at all as it focuses on expanding to-go options.
Overall, the company opened 278 net new stores in the quarter, for 4% year over year growth. It now has 32,938 stores around the world, 51% of which are company-operated.

Starbucks also saw coffee lovers return to its Rewards loyalty program, with its count of 90-day active U.S. members increase 15% year over year to 21.8 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) was sued on Tuesday for at least $1.35 billion by a Seattle company that accused the telecommunications giant of stealing its patented ""twinning"" technology, which lets smart devices such as watches and tablets respond to calls placed to a single phone number.
Network Apps LLC said AT&T abandoned joint development and licensing agreements for its technology in 2014 after realizing it would owe a ""fortune"" in royalties because the market for smart devices was exploding, only to then incorporate the technology a year later in its own product, NumberSync.
According to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, NumberSync uses the ""same concept and architecture"" with only ""cosmetic changes,"" and its purported ""inventors"" were the same AT&T personnel who had worked with the plaintiffs.
Network Apps, which was once known as Mya Number, said Dallas-based AT&T has not paid required royalties since October 2015.
It is seeking at least $450 million of damages, which it wants tripled to reflect AT&T's alleged ""willful and egregious infringement,"" plus royalties for any future infringements.
AT&T said it will review the lawsuit and respond in court.
Network Apps' founders, John Wantz and Kyle Schei, in a joint statement said ""AT&T's decision to steal our technology"" has forced them to scale back operations significantly.
""Our technology is an eloquent solution for a critical problem at a critical time in the industry,"" they added.

According to AT&T's website, NumberSync lets consumers make and receive calls on smartwatches, tablets, computers andcompatible Alexa-enabled devices without having to download appsor engage in ""call-forwarding acrobatics."" The case is Network Apps LLC et al v AT&T Inc et al, U.S.District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-00718.

(Reuters) - Amateur investors piled further into niche stocks on Tuesday, sending professional short sellers scrambling to cover losing bets, with GameStop (NYSE:GME) skyrocketing for a fourth straight day, thanks in part to Elon Musk. 
GameStop surged 50% in extended trade after Musk tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"", along with a link to Reddit's Wallstreetbets stock trading discussion group, where supporters affectionately refer to the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO as ""Papa Musk."" ""Stonks"" is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media.
(Graphic: GameStop dominates Wallstreetbets: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/REDDIT/qmyvmyqnovr/chart.png)
GameStop's after-hours surge added to a 93% jump during Tuesday's roller coaster trading session, with the videogame retailer's stock propelled by traders on Wallstreetbets, many of them buying volatile call options. 
The share spikes of the last few days are raising questions about potential regulatory clampdowns from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
“Such volatile trading fueled by opinions where there appears to be little corporate activity to justify the price movement is exactly what SEC investigations are made of,"" said Jacob Frenkel, Securities Enforcement Practice Chair for law firm Dickinson Wright and former SEC enforcement attorney. The SEC declined comment. 
Herds of amateur investors on Reddit have long been supporters of Tesla and other hyper-volatile stocks, and their influence appears to be growing.
""I don't think this is a fad, it is a generational shift in how people think about investing their money,"" said John Patrick Lee, ETF manager at VanEck.
""A retail trader will not lean on Wall Street to manage their money and I definitely now see an antagonistic relationship between the old guard (Wall Street) and individual traders who are on the rise,"" he said.
As well as GameStop, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), also favored on Wallstreetbets, advanced 4.9% and is up 185% this year. An earlier tweet by Musk sent Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) up almost 9% before it reversed its gains.
The surge in recent days - GameStop has increased more than seven-fold to $147.98 from $19 since Jan. 12 - has spurred concerns over bubbles in stocks that hedge funds and other speculative players had bet would fall in value.
Trading in GameStop stock was halted for volatility nine times on Monday and five times on Tuesday.
To some stock market professionals, the recent moves look symbolic of a stock market that may be overvalued at the end of a year dominated by floods of fiscal and monetary stimulus to ease the coronavirus crisis. 
The benchmark S&P 500 has gained more than 70% from lows last March caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
""This is hardly an environment where informed investors are transacting to establish price discovery,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
Venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya said in a tweet that he had bought $115 call options on GameStop on Tuesday morning after an exchange with Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian. 
Short sellers in GameStop are down $5 billion on a mark-to-market, net-of-financing basis in 2021, which included $876 million of losses early Tuesday, according to analytics firm S3 Partners. 
""GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well as social media platforms,"" wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics.
Another stock popular with Reddit investors, Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE), surged 17%, and is now up 77% year to date. 
A BAD END
Much of the recent action among Reddit traders has centered around shares that have been heavily ""shorted"" by other market players - traditionally an area dominated by hedge funds. 
Shares in Evotec rallied 8% on Tuesday with three traders reporting that hedge fund Melvin Capital Management was closing its short positions after suffering losses on some bets.
Melvin previously held a 6.2% short bet against Evotec, according to filings with the German regulator. The fund did not respond to requests for comment. 
Short sellers typically bet against stocks of companies that they view as outdated in their business models or otherwise overvalued. 
Noted short seller Andrew Left is as convinced as ever that GameStop is a dying business and its stock price will fall sharply. Left shorted the company's stock when it traded around $40 a share and forecast publicly that it would tumble to $20 a share. He said on Tuesday that he was still short the stock.

""Will it end badly? Sure. We just don't know when,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc shares surged more than 7% on Tuesday after the resignation of CEO Leon Black, which investors viewed as bolstering the private equity firm's fundraising efforts.
Black said on Monday he was stepping down after an investigation into his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities. But it concluded Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, a decision that Black said he regretted.
Apollo executives said in October that some investors had paused their commitments to the buyout firm's funds as they awaited the review's findings. Apollo said on Monday that despite the controversy, its assets under management grew by $22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $455 billion.
Analysts said on Tuesday the conclusion of the review and Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan taking over from Black as CEO could prompt some investors to proceed with commitments to Apollo's funds that they had previously suspended.
""The news does clear much uncertainty,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note. ""We view the update collectively as a net positive for investors, but potentially not yet enough closure to fully step in.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote that Rowan's work building Apollo's insurance business has been ""the main growth engine for the firm."" The analysts added that changes to its governance structure, including nixing special voting rights for founders, would be positive for the stock price. 
Margaret Brown, a board member at the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), said she still wanted the roughly $400 billion pension plan, the largest in the United States, to consider halting future investments to Apollo.
""I will raise the issue in closed session with the board and hope to have a discussion in open session as well,"" said Brown, who does not sit on the CalPERS investment committee. 
A majority of CalPERS' board would have to approve such a decision.
""We expect and demand the companies and executives we do business with to act ethically and with prudent judgment at all times,"" CalPERS said in a prepared statement.
CalPERS declined to comment on whether they will authorize new investment in Apollo's funds. 

Despite Tuesday's rise, Apollo shares are down 10% over the last 12 months. By comparison, shares of peers Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc and KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc are up 5% and 29%, respectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive David Solomon's annual pay fell by $10 million, or 36%, in 2020, according to regulatory disclosures filed Tuesday, reflecting the bank's role in Malaysia's 1MDB scandal.
Solomon will receive $17.5 million for his work during the year, compared with $27.5 million the year before, the bank said.
Goldman previously announced it would reduce Solomon's pay, along with that of Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron, in light of the findings of investigations into the bank's role in the affair.
The scandal dates to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009.
Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business, including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales, for which it earned $600 million in fees, the bank has said.
Waldron will receive $18.5 million for his work last year, down 24%, or $6 million, from 2019.
Scherr will be paid $15.5 million, down 31%, or $7 million, from the previous year.
Were it not for the 1MDB scandal, Solomon and Scherr's pay would have been unchanged from the previous year, the bank said, and Waldron's pay would have risen by $1 million.
Rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Chief Executive James Gorman saw his annual pay rise by $6 million, or 22%, last year, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday. 

Goldman said in October it is clawing back $174 million from a dozen current and former executives, including Solomon and his predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein. The bank agreed to pay $2.9 billion to settle probes into its role in the 1MDB corruption scandal.

Verizon, a major broadband services provider in the United States, alerted users about a fiber cut in Brooklyn.
Spokesman Rich Young said the company was ""aware of an issue impacting the quality"" of its broadband service ""throughout the Northeast corridor."" He added Verizon has ""already seen service levels start to restore.""
Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is reviewing reports of the outage.
Acting FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said on Twitter the regulator's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau ""is working to get to the bottom of what is going on."" 
Outage monitoring website Downdetector.com also showed reports of outages at Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Roblox Corp and Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud computing arm said on its website that connectivity issues related to its services has been resolved.
It had earlier said it was investigating connectivity issues with an internet provider, which was causing disruptions to AWS services, and to many online services that rely on it. 
A spokesperson for Google said the company was aware of reports regarding issues affecting access to some of its products, but had not found issues with its services. 
Users on retail trading platforms  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Robinhood also reported operational problems in the market session for the second day in a row, according to Downdetector.com. 
""Earlier this morning, we experienced an issue with bank balances not displaying accurately that has since been resolved. Trading functionality was not impacted,"" a Charles Schwab spokeswoman said. 

Robinhood said its customers on the East Coast may have had issues with accessing the internet due to Verizon's outage, but its platform was operational.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) has permanently suspended the account of My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell for repeated violations of the company's policy on election misinformation, the social media firm said.
Lindell, a devout supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, in a phone interview with Reuters on Tuesday pushed back at Twitter's reasons for the suspension, saying Twitter is ""trying to destroy Mike Lindell - my reputation and my integrity.""
Twitter had permanently suspended Trump from its platform earlier this month.
Lindell used his personal Twitter account, which had nearly half a million followers, and the My Pillow company's account to spread unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3 election in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Republican Trump.
Lindell was suspended for repeatedly violating the company's civic integrity policy, Twitter said in a statement late on Monday. It is not clear which of Lindell’s tweets led to the ban.
Lindell's political commentary and advertisements are a regular fixture on conservative media.
A self-described former cocaine addict and alcoholic who says he found sobriety through Christianity, Lindell helped sponsor a two-week March for Trump bus tour that ended in Washington on Dec. 14 and spoke at five stops.
He said a fortnight ago that he did not help finance subsequent trips to promote the Jan. 6 rally that devolved into riots as supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results.
But the Capitol riots that left five people dead, did not change his views on contesting the election. 
""I'm never letting the fraud go,"" Lindell told Reuters then.
In Tuesday's phone interview, Lindell offered his own explanation for why Twitter blocked him.
“You’ve got to realize that they didn’t take my Twitter down because I backed Donald Trump,” Lindell said. “They took it down because they don’t want the Dominion (Voting Systems) machine fraud out there.""
The New York Times reported last week that Dominion has threatened to sue Lindell over his unsubstantiated claims of fraud involving its machines.

Lindell also said on Tuesday that Twitter removed his account after he posted a positive description of him written by an employee. ""So now an article goes up about who I really am from a real person. And they wipe my Twitter out forever.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and a German auto supplier on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a lower-court ruling that said two counties could seek financial penalties over excess diesel emissions that could total billions of dollars.
The German automaker's U.S. unit and Robert Bosch LLC asked the U.S. high court to reverse a unanimous ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that said Utah’s Salt Lake County and Florida’s Hillsborough County could seek ""staggering” damages over updates made to polluting diesel vehicles after they were sold.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America told the high court the appeals court ""decision threatens to throw one of America’s largest industries into regulatory chaos, to the detriment of manufacturers, dealers, consumers, and the environment.""
On Tuesday, the Ohio Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the state's lawsuit against Volkswagen over emissions damages from 14,000 Ohio-registered cars. VW said in court papers Ohio's claims ""could total $350 million per day, or more than $127 billion per year, over a multi-year period.""
Ohio said VW engaged in ""deceptive recalls"" after vehicles were sold and it ""seeks to hold Volkswagen responsible for modifying its customers’ cars — cars that the customers
had already purchased and used — to evade emissions laws.""
In September the Environmental Protection Agency announced a $1.5 billion settlement with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) to resolve allegations it engaged in emissions cheating.
Volkswagen noted Hillsborough County has since sued Daimler and Bosch and cited a county document that it could also bring an emissions-cheating lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, which is now known as Stellantis. 
Volkswagen settled U.S. criminal and civil actions prompted by the emissions scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from local and state government liability, the appeals court found, noting they were ""mindful that our conclusion may result in staggering liability for Volkswagen.""
The court added it was ""due to conduct that could not have been anticipated by Congress: Volkswagen’s intentional tampering with post-sale vehicles to increase air pollution.""
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who ruled in VW’s favor in 2018, noted the automaker’s ""potential penalties could reach $30.6 million per day and $11.2 billion per year"" in the case involving the two counties.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P and Nasdaq slipped on Tuesday from record closing levels as investors digested a batch of corporate earnings results, while an expected policy announcement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday helped to limit moves.
3M Co climbed 3.26% as one of the biggest boosts on the Dow after it benefited from lower costs and demand for disposable respirator masks, hand sanitizers and safety glasses amid a surge in coronavirus infections.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also provided a strong lift, up 2.71% as the drugmaker said it expected to report eagerly awaited COVID-19 vaccine data early next week.
Of the 84 companies in the S&P 500 that posted earnings through Tuesday morning, 86.9% have topped analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data. 
Still, some companies showed the toll the pandemic has had on their businesses.  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) fell 4.13% and was the biggest drag on the Dow after it posted a 15% drop in quarterly profit as pandemic-led lockdowns and business restrictions kept the credit card issuer's members from traveling and dining out.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) lost 3.17% after the company posted earnings that topped expectations but missed prepaid phone subscriber estimates.
""It is still somewhat the early days but we are getting into the heart of it here,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""Expectations are for a continuation of the massive positive surprises we saw last quarter. The risk is that if the expectations are already there and there are disappointments, you get stocks like you see in American Express today getting slammed.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.96 points, or 0.07%, to 30,937.04, the S&P 500 lost 5.74 points, or 0.15%, to 3,849.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.93 points, or 0.07%, to 13,626.07.
For the Nasdaq, the decline snapped a five-session streak of gains, its longest run of daily gains since early November. 
After the closing bell, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose 5.20% as the tech giant beat Wall Street estimates for revenue growth in its Azure cloud comuting business as it benefits from a global shift to home learning and working. 
Few, if any, changes are expected in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell likely to address inflation in his post-meeting news conference.
With the S&P 500 trading at more than 22 times 12-month forward earnings, concerns about stock bubbles on Wall Street are sparking fears of a pullback. Investors are keeping an eye out for forecasts from corporate America to justify the higher valuations.

There wasn’t much movement on a stimulus deal in Washington, as the Senate held procedural votes ahead of its second impeachment trial of now-former President Donald Trump.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Apple reports earnings
Apple’s stock has more than doubled since touching a low at the beginning of last year. Demand for Apple products and services has risen with more people studying and working from home during the pandemic. 
Analysts expect Apple to report earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $102.5 billion.
2. And so does Facebook
The social network faces big criticism this year over what critics say is its failure to stop hate speech and misinformation on its platform. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and 46 states sued it over antitrust concerns, which could force it to divest of WhatsApp and Instagram.
Analysts expect Facebook to report EPS of $3.16 on revenue of $26.3 billion.
3. Fed rate decision
The Fed is not expected to alter its stance on rates, keeping the benchmark at 0% to 0.25% as it works to steer the economy out of the pandemic morass. The Federal Open Market Committee announces its rate decision at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).

PARIS (Reuters) - Booming sales at LVMH's fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, particularly in China, helped to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has crimped revenues at the French luxury group. 
LVMH, which closed a $15.8 billion acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany in the middle of the pandemic, has like rivals taken a hit as governments the world over forced retailers to close shops during lockdowns. 
Declining international travel has also deprived luxury goods companies of tourist revenues. 
But an improving backdrop in China, one of the world's biggest markets for luxury fashions and which had eased COVID-19 measures by the second half of 2020, has helped some companies to rebound. 
LVMH's fashion and leather goods business, home to Vuitton handbags and other brands like Christian Dior, performed better than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, with sales rising 18% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Louis Vuitton is the group's biggest revenue driver.
That was an improvement on the third quarter, when like-for-like sales, which strips out acquisitions and currency effects, were already up 12%. 
""The strong beat should get LVMH's share price home and dry,"" Berstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note.
LVMH Financial Chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told a conference call that new product launches planned before the pandemic - like a Vuitton handbag named after the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris - had helped the brand. 
LVMH - which is setting the tone for luxury rivals such as Gucci-owned  Kering  (PA:PRTP) with its earnings - has also kept up with marketing spending while some smaller peers have cut back, and holding catwalk shows in cities such as Shanghai despite the crisis had helped, Guiony said. 
""Louis Vuitton and Dior were taking the bulk of customers' attention when nobody was talking,"" he added. 
LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said in a statement that the group was well placed to build on a market recovery. 
Guiony said the company had no visibility, however, on the outlook for China, at a time when new restrictions to fight a resurgence of COVID-19 cases risk overshadowing Chinese New Year festivities in mid-February, usually a major shopping highlight. 
LVMH also owns spirits brands, like Hennessy cognac, and operates airport duty free shops, which have struggled. 
The French company went ahead with its Tiffany deal during the pandemic, but ended up renegotiating the price tag slightly downwards. LVMH is now betting on growing its clout in jewellery, a resilient area of the luxury goods business.
LVMH overall group sales for the October to December period came in at 14.3 billion euros, in line with forecasts. 
For 2020 as a whole, LVMH's revenues reached 44.65 billion euros, falling 16% from a year earlier on a like-for-like basis. 
LVMH's net profit reached 4.7 billion euros ($5.71 billion), down 34% on a year earlier, while profits from recurring operations - or earnings before interest and tax - fell 28% but vastly exceeded analyst forecasts. 
The group said it would propose a dividend payout against 2020 results of 6 euros per share, including a 2 euros per share interim dividend paid in December.
It had cut its dividend last year to 4.80 euros during the COVID-19 crisis.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s quarterly report on Wednesday could trigger a $7 billion options payout to Chief Executive Elon Musk, while owners of the electric car maker's soaring stock are keen to hear the company's target for 2021 deliveries. 
Tesla posts its December quarter results following a nearly 700% surge in its stock over the past 12 months that has made it the fifth-most-valuable publicly traded U.S. company, eclipsing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Despite production that is a fraction of that of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), Tesla has become by far the world's most valuable car maker, with a market capitalization of $843 billion, compared with Toyota's $236 billion. 
Its shares are trading at over 200 times the average analyst earnings forecast for the next year, according to Refinitiv, underpinning skeptics' arguments that Tesla's stock has become highly overvalued.
After Tesla delivered just shy of a Musk-promised 500,000 electric vehicles last year, investors are focused on the Silicon Valley manufacturer's 2021 delivery target, expected to be provided on Wednesday. 
""We're expecting close to 900,000 deliveries. I think that as the economy opens up again, there is going to be pent up demand from people who want to spend some money,"" said King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, which owns Tesla shares. 
Following the close of trading on Wednesday, analysts on average expect Tesla to report adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion, up 92% from the year-ago period. That would be enough to trigger the vesting of the fifth of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk in his 2018 pay package to buy discounted Tesla shares.

Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, receives no salary at Tesla. His pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of rising targets.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70 each, a discount of more than 90% from their current price. At Tuesday's price of $889, the shares from four previous tranches and the current tranche could generate a profit of nearly $35 billion, or almost $7 billion per tranche.
Tesla earlier this month started delivering Shanghai-made Model Y sports utility vehicles to customers in China, where it is benefiting from ballooning consumer demand but also faces growing competition. 
Over the past three months, the U.S.-traded shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO have more than doubled as investors diversify their bets in the electric vehicle industry. Chinese electric vehicle makers Xpeng and Li Auto have seen their stocks jump 170% and 69% during the same period.
Investors will also look for updates on plants Tesla is building in Berlin and Texas, as well as the outlook for production of Tesla's upcoming Cybertruck pickup.

For the December quarter, analysts expect Tesla to report revenue surging 40% to $10.3 billion and net income of $752.5 million, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.01, according to Refinitiv. In the previous quarter, Tesla's profits came from selling pollution credits to other automakers, and it would have lost money if it only sold cars.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Short-seller Andrew Left does not usually smoke. But on Monday he had a cigarette to calm his nerves as shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), the stock he had shorted, continued to rocket higher. 
Left, who has built a reputation by targeting companies he thinks are overvalued, is as convinced as ever that videogame retailer GameStop is a dying business whose stock price will fall sharply someday. He said on Tuesday he is still short the stock, which means he has bet that the price will fall, and more convinced than ever of his position.
""If I had never been involved in GameStop and came to this right now, would I still be short this stock? 100 percent,"" Left, who runs Citron Research and a hedge fund, told Reuters on Tuesday. ""This is an old school, failing mall-based video retailer and investors can't change the perception of that.""
GameStop did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Shares of GameStop jumped 22% on Tuesday after surging 144% a day earlier, as individual investors again piled into a number of niche stocks, prompting short sellers to scramble to cover losing bets.
Left shorted the company's stock - selling borrowed shares in a bet that the price will fall and that the shares can be bought back at a lower level - when it traded around $40 a share and forecast publicly that it would tumble to $20 a share. 
Since Left spoke out publicly about GameStop earlier this month, other investors have turned out en masse to take the other side of short-sellers' bets, forcing the stock up some 308% this year to trade at $112.45, or up 47% on Tuesday. 
Along the way, Left said he has been threatened - although he declined to specify how - and asked authorities to investigate. 
""Everyone thinks this stock sucks and the only reason people are buying it and own it is that for them it is a game."" 
He added, ""I created this game, based on uncovering the truths ... so I can't get mad at people for taking the other side.""
The market fury, however, is something that Left, who has been posting his research for two decades and has taken on prominent hedge fund managers like Bill Ackman at companies like Valeant, has not seen before.
Short selling is something every hedge fund is technically able to do but only a handful of firms - including Citron, Jim Chanos' Kynikos Associates, Carson Block's Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research, and Ben Axler's Spruce Point Capital Management - specialize in.
Many hedge funds acknowledged over the last months that shorting had hurt their performance and Melvin Capital, a $13 billion hedge fund, on Monday received a financial lifeline from hedge funds Citadel and Point72 Asset Management after having been deeply hurt by short bets that went the other way.
The pain continues for short investors as some of the market's most shorted stocks like retailers Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and Dillard's (NYSE:DDS) Inc have marched higher in the last days.
""I don't smoke but yesterday I was outside smoking a cigarette,"" Left acknowledged with a laugh, explaining his current stress. Last year his two-year-old fund returned 155%, after gaining 43% in 2019. 

This year the Citron fund is off 2.5% since the beginning of January, Left said. ""This kind of situation teaches you proper allocation,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) said on Tuesday it expects an uptick in holiday travel this summer, but not business travel, as it seeks to recover from a year which dented airline traffic and hotel bookings, knocking 15% off its bottom line.
The New York-based company still beat Wall Street estimates for profit as it lowered credit loss reserves and benefited from higher online spending by consumers stuck at home. 
""...As we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel,"" CEO Stephen Squeri said on a post-earnings conference call.
AmEx forecast a 9% to 10% jump in overall 2021 revenue, with travel and expenditure (T&E) spending by consumers recovering to around 70% of fourth-quarter 2019 levels by the final quarter of 2021. That indicates full-year revenue of $39.7 billion on the upper end of the range, marginally below consensus estimates of $39.92 billion. 
The bullish outlook for travel, however, failed to lift shares, which fell 3% in late morning trade after AmEx's total revenue, net of interest expense, dropped 17.1% to $36.09 billion.
A rebound in corporate travel will take longer, AmEx warned, with companies, particularly large ones, limiting their T&E spending for some time. T&E spending on AmEx's cards declined 65% in the final quarter of 2020.
The company does not expect a full-blown recovery before 2022, but is focused on achieving the EPS expectations it had for 2020 in 2022, Squeri said.
AmEx also lowered some reserves it had set aside for credit losses and posted a gain of $111 million from consolidated provisions, compared with credit loss provisions of $1.02 billion last year. 

Net income fell to $1.44 billion, or $1.76 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates for a profit of $1.31 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's nominee to head the U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday vowed to protect U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies, but she refused to commit to keeping telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies on a U.S. economic blacklist. 
""I would use the full toolkit at my disposal to the fullest extent possible to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of back-door influence,"" Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo said in testimony before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, naming Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763). Congress in December approved $1.9 billion to fund the replacement of ZTE and Huawei equipment in U.S. networks.
The Commerce Department under former President Donald Trump took aim at China on numerous fronts, adding dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, including Huawei, the country’s top chipmaker SMIC, Hikvision and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology.
Asked by Senator Ted Cruz if she would keep Huawei on the economic blacklist, Raimondo said she would ""review the policy, consult with you, consult with industry, consult with our allies and make an assessment as to what's best for American national and economic security.""
Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Republican Senator Ben Sasse both criticized her refusal to commit to keeping Huawei on the list. ""Huawei is still the Chinese Communist Party’s tech puppet and a serious threat to national security,"" Sasse said.
If confirmed, Raimondo will inherit the prior Trump administration’s unsuccessful effort to bar U.S. app stores from offering Chinese-owned TikTok or WeChat for download.
Three U.S. judges blocked Commerce Department orders issued under Trump that sought to bar new downloads of the two apps and impose restrictions on WeChat and TikTok that would effectively bar their use in the United States. Those rulings are on appeal before U.S. circuit courts.
Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to shift TikTok’s U.S. assets into a new entity to address U.S. security concerns.
Raimondo also pledged to take ""aggressive"" action in response to trade practices from China. ""China's actions have been anticompetitive,"" she added, saying she would use all available tools to ""level the playing field.""

(Reuters) - Working from home has been surprisingly successful for global banks during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic but is losing its effectiveness, two prominent industry executives said on Tuesday at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
""It's remarkable it's working as well as it is, but I don't think it's sustainable,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley.
Mary Erdoes, who runs asset and wealth management for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), added, ""It is fraying. It is hard.""
For employees to focus, Erodes said: ""It takes a lot of inner strength and sustainability (without) the energy that you get from being around other people.""
Staley said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.""
He predicted that more people would come back to offices to work, but with flexibility to work from home.
Erdoes said executives believed that part of the initial success of working from home was due to adrenalin from having to adapt so quickly.
Now, she said, executives were facing the likelihood that COVID-19 and its variants would persist for a long time.
""The world is going to have to figure out how to adapt,"" Erdoes said.
Staley also told the event - which is being held virtually this year, rather than in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, due to the coronavirus - that the world economy could experience a boom after the pandemic similar to the ""Roaring 20s"" that followed the 1918 flu pandemic. Pent-up demand was widespread and could power growth, he said.

""You could have a robust second half to the year,"" Staley said, followed by an ""explosion of demand"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Recovery prospects for Europe's coronavirus-stricken airlines are slipping from bad to worse, as a British minister warned on Tuesday against booking summer holidays and Germany mulled a drastic new clampdown on travel even within the EU.
UK consumers should ""absolutely"" hold off from booking holidays, said Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for vaccinations. ""There's still 37,000 people in hospital with COVID at the moment - it's far too early for us to even speculate about the summer.""
Airline shares, which had gained ground since November's vaccine breakthroughs, have come under pressure this week amid concern that new coronavirus variants and resulting lockdowns now threaten the all-important summer season.
While major carriers have secured liquidity to survive the slump for many more months, analysts say, the latest setbacks mean some may need fresh funds to survive the following winter - tough at the best of times - and weaker airlines may fail.
Mounting restrictions and testing demands threaten more ""stress and friction"" throughout the summer, as well as ""a more truncated recovery in demand than investors currently envisage"", Citi analyst Mark Manduca warned in a note.
The travel outlook for the Easter break - this year falling in early April - already seems almost hopeless.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told party lawmakers on Tuesday that ""no tourist travel should be taking place"", as her government weighed tougher measures.
Throughout the crisis, governments have tried to maintain travel links among EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states. Over the weekend, however, Sweden barred travel from neighbour Norway in an attempt to stem the spread of new COVID-19 variants, and Belgium banned non-essential travel.
Britain is also considering mandatory confinement in ""quarantine hotels"" for some international arrivals, following the example of some Asian countries.
Shares in UK-exposed easyJet (LON:EZJ) and British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) have both fallen 14% over five days amid the resurgent gloom, wiping out some of their gains since November. Ryanair has lost 6% in the same period.
And while aircraft manufacturers have been cushioned by their large pre-crisis order books, some suppliers and engine makers are feeling the heat.
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) further lowered its financial forecasts on Tuesday, predicting a 2 billion-pound ($2.7 billion) cash outflow this year as the collapse in flying hours hit so-called power-by-the-hour contracts as well as maintenance.
British airlines and airports warned that further travel restrictions would prove ""catastrophic"", calling for a bespoke support package to help them survive the prolonged crisis.
The new curbs also threaten jobs and cargo shipments including medical equipment, industry body Airlines UK said.
Airlines' key role in vaccine distribution is also helping some to push back against restrictions affecting staff. 

KLM, part of Air France-KLM, won a partial reprieve from Dutch plans to require rapid COVID-19 tests of returning crew, after warning of cargo disruption.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Tuesday offered an upbeat outlook for its business this year after reporting a surge in quarterly free cash flow, sending its shares soaring in early trade.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate predicted a free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion this year after generating cash flow of $4.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
That compares with Refinitiv's average analyst estimate of $3.03 billion for 2021 and about $2.6 billion for the latest quarter.
The company had previously predicted a cash flow of at least $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and a return to positive cash flow for 2021.
Free-cash flow is closely watched by investors as a sign of the health of GE's operations and ability to pay down debt.
With the earnings report signaling progress in Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp's turnaround plan, GE's shares rose 9.2% to $12.
""In all, momentum is growing across our businesses,"" Culp told investors on an earnings call.
Since taking over the company's reins in 2018, Culp has been trying to revive GE's fortunes by improving free cash flow and cutting debt. However, the coronavirus pandemic hit those efforts by hammering the company's aviation unit, usually its most profitable and most cash-generative segment.
In response, Culp cut costs by more than $2 billion and took other steps to save $3 billion in cash last year.
The surge in GE's cash flow has put ""lingering liquidity concerns"" to rest, analysts at Gordon Haskett wrote in a note.
GE said aviation revenue would be flat to up this year with air traffic expected to recover in the second half.
The return of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX jets, which use GE's engines, also augurs well for the conglomerate. 
Overall, the company expects an improvement in its industrial business this year, forecasting a low-single-digit growth in revenue. Industrial revenue declined 13% in 2020.

Adjusted earnings in 2021 are forecast to come in the range of $0.15 to $0.25 per share compared with $0.01 last year.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Europe urged pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday to honour their commitments to supply coronavirus vaccines, as delivery cuts and delays dim hopes of a quick fix to COVID-19 and increase talk of blocking protectionism and hoarding.
Countries around the world, anxious to reboot economies and restart travel by the European summer, hailed the rapid development of vaccines as the best chance of escaping the year-long pandemic, which has killed more than 2.1 million people.
But vaccine roll-outs in the European Union have been slow compared with countries in some other regions and fraught with problems, not least interruptions to supply chains.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which developed its shot with Oxford University, said last Friday it would cut supplies to the EU in the first quarter of this year, a move that a senior EU official said meant a 60% reduction to 31 million doses for the bloc.
U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February.
""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first COVID-19 vaccines. To create a truly global common good,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
""And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations,"" the head of the EU executive added.
EU member states could take AstraZeneca to court for breach of supply contracts if it did not honour its schedule, Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Edgars Rinkevics said.
""The possibility should be evaluated, and it should be coordinated among the EU countries,"" the minister told Reuters, via his spokesman.
The European Commission will finalise a proposal by the end of the week to require pharmaceutical firms to register their vaccine exports from the EU, and says it has no plans to impose an export ban.
EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the aim was merely to increase transparency.
AstraZeneca said initial deliveries to the EU would fall short of the targeted volumes because of a production glitch.
""Initial volumes will be lower than originally anticipated due to reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain,"" a company spokesman said in a written statement last Friday, but declined to provide details.
UK 'CONFIDENT' OF SUPPLIES
AstraZeneca has offered to bring forward some deliveries to the EU and the bloc has asked the company if it can divert doses from Britain to make up for the shortfall, European officials told Reuters.
Health minister Matt Hancock said Britain, which has left the EU, would be able to work with the bloc to ensure there is no disruption, and that rejecting vaccine nationalism and protectionism was important.
""I'm sure that we can work with the EU to ensure that, whilst transparency is welcome, .... no blockers are put in place,"" he told an event hosted by Chatham House think tank, adding he had spoken to the chief executives of Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
""...But I would urge all international partners in fact to be collaborative and working closely together, and I think protectionism is not the right approach in the middle of a pandemic,"" Hancock said.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described unequal access to vaccines last week as a ""catastrophic moral failure"", and urged countries and manufacturers to spread doses more fairly around the world.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said it was crucial to ensure fair distribution.
""It has become even clearer to me than it was before that we need to choose a multilateral approach, that a self-isolating approach won't solve our problems,"" she told the World Economic Forum's virtual summit by video link.
""We see that first of all in the question of vaccination since it is the route out of the pandemic.""
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking at the same forum, urged wealthy countries not to hoard vaccines.

""The rich countries of the world went out and acquired large doses,"" he said. ""... Some countries even acquired up to four times what their population needs ... to the exclusion of other countries.""

(Reuters) - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc on Tuesday said it will supply a range of chips for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s next generation of vehicles.
The San Diego company has long been known for making modem chips that connected Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones and many vehicles to cellular data networks. In recent years, Qualcomm has moved into automotive chips. 
Qualcomm and GM said in statements the automaker will use Qualcomm's ""cockpit"" chips, which can run an automotive-grade operating system for functions such as the vehicle's speedometer and also the in-dashboard infotainment (information and entertainment) system. 
The companies also said GM will start integrating Qualcomm's automated driver assistance system chips for features such as adaptive cruise control and lane-change assistance.
Qualcomm has rolled out multiple tiers of chips with different features and pricing, positioning itself as GM's single provider for budget and luxury vehicles. 
""We look at this partnership as a very important foundation for what we would like to repeat really across various parts of the industry,"" Nakul Duggal, senior vice president & general manager of automotive for Qualcomm Technologies, said in an interview with Reuters.
Qualcomm also said its driver-assistance computer, called Snapdragon Ride, would hit the roads in a production vehicle in 2022, though it did not specify the automaker or vehicle. 
The system is designed to have enough computing power to scale up to self-driving functions in some vehicles. Qualcomm has not given a timeline for such a car.
Qualcomm earlier on Tuesday said it was pairing with  Veoneer  (NYSE:VNE) Inc's software unit Arriver to provide a full system of self-driving hardware and software to automakers, although Qualcomm will also offer its computer as a standalone for automakers that want to write their own code.

Qualcomm said that its next generation of automotive chips will have the ability to integrate Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Alexa voice assistant into vehicles if automakers chose to enable the feature.

100,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 10:54AM ET</span>",All the Reasons VIX Is Sounding Alarms as Greed Engulfs Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Fears unleashed by the once-in-a-century pandemic are clinging onto volatility markets even as stocks boom to record highs and Wall Street speculators gorge on every risk.
For all the euphoria in markets, the Cboe Volatility Index has stayed elevated in an historic divergence between this gauge of investor fear and rallying equities. The VIX hasn’t closed below 20 since February last year. Its current level of 23 is some six points above the decade average.
As Dean Curnutt at Macro Risk Advisors puts it, the VIX is “on an island of its own.” And there are no easy explanations.
As the market rotation reduces correlations and increases risk appetite, Wall Street strategists have long expected a spirited drop in the gauge, which uses the options market to measure the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500.
So here are four theories on why things are not so simple in volatility land.
The Aftershocks
First and foremost: Past is prologue. Historically, volatility shocks like the Covid-spurred mayhem in March have taken time to run their course. After all, implied volatility largely reflects what’s recently happened in markets. In the wake of the global financial crisis, it took some 15 months for the measure to normalize.
Yet it’s been just 10 months since the stock wipeout that sent the VIX soaring to a record.
Given precedent, it could be several months before the fear gauge settles at a more subdued level especially in light of the extended collapse in the global investment and consumption cycle.
“The VIX dropped off more quickly than usual but now has entered a slower decline,” said Vance Harwood of Six Figure Investing, a consultancy specializing in volatility. “We are just seeing the normal after-effects of a market crash.”
Add delays to vaccine roll-outs, and there are good reasons why it’s a long journey back to a pre-pandemic normal of sorts.
Blame Tech
Perhaps something else is at work too. Hedge fund Man Group, for one, blames the increasingly large weighting of technology in the S&P 500 Index.
Tech shares are now approaching a 30% weighting in the U.S. stock benchmark, up from around 20% five years ago, according to Man. Over the past year, investors have piled into these names as part of the stay-at-home trade, leading to sharp sell-offs when sentiment reverses.
When a volatile sector comes to dominate the benchmark, “we get more instances of simultaneous increases in equity markets and volatility, notably during the tech bubble of the late 1990s,” strategists at the firm wrote in a note. “Indeed, we see a similar make-up of the S&P 500 today.”
No wonder stocks have risen along with implied volatility lately -- bucking the historic norm.
In Man’s view, a “gentle rebalancing” of the equity market leaderboard at the expense of the tech sector would spur a fall in the VIX. Otherwise, brace for higher implied volatility for longer.
Call Fever
The explosion of call-option buying has also become an undeniable force in markets, with some blaming it for pushing around the underlying stocks. A more direct impact has been to raise the level of equity volatility overall.
Spurred by speculative retail fever, the smallest options traders are making record bullish bets, with volumes running 20% higher than last summer, according to Sundial Capital Research.
Dealers who have sold these calls may buy index implied volatility to hedge themselves -- adding upward pressure on the VIX.
Something like this was at work back in August and September, when stocks and volatility moved in tandem.

Since the VIX is calculated using prices of both puts and calls, when prices rise sharply for the latter, it can push up the index in the same way hedging demand can.
In short, demand for both single-name and index calls may be driving the VIX higher in what’s become more an expression of greed than the traditional signal of fear.
“There’s been a lot of call buying, not just on the index but on single stocks,” said Michael Purves, a strategist and founder of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. “And that has been one of the reasons why the VIX has been elevated.”
Shortage of Shorts
Implied volatility moves on options supply and demand, and since last year’s Covid crash a reliable source of the former has gone missing from markets.
Prior to March 2020, institutional investors sold options en masse as a way to generate income in a low-yield world to take advantage of the volatility risk premium, or the tendency of traders to demand higher compensation for future uncertainty compared with what actually comes to pass.
After many of these players bailed on that trade, there’s less selling pressure. And that means the elevated fear gauge has a lot to do with market technicals and less about the pandemic-driven business cycle.
“A lot of short-volatility guys got destroyed in March,” said Purves. “People are still very nervous to sell it.”

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields hovered close to three-week lows while stock markets were mixed on Tuesday as concerns about potential roadblocks to new U.S. President Joe Biden's planned $1.9 trillion stimulus weighed on investor sentiment.
Mounting coronavirus cases and caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week also dulled appetite for risk, lending support to the dollar against a basket of currencies. Oil prices edged down. 
Italian government bond yields were lower as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte handed in his resignation to the head of state, hoping he would be given an opportunity to put together a new coalition and rebuild his parliamentary majority.
But European stock markets (EU) were higher after two sessions of declines, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.1% after Swiss wealth manager UBS posted a surge in quarterly net profit.
""The earnings season up to now has been very good, so it comes back to the fact the market has been overbought and had a strong rally since Jan. 1, with a lot of positive news priced in,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners, referring to recent losses.
""There is room for some consolidation."" 
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were 0.1% firmer. On Monday the Nasdaq index scaled a new peak, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average index slipped (N).
South Korea and Hong Kong topped losers in Asia overnight, falling more than 2% apiece. The sell-off also saw Japanese stocks slip 1% and Chinese blue-chips tumble 2%, their biggest one-day loss since Sept. 9. 
All had touched milestone highs earlier this month.
MSCI's All-Country World index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, was 0.2% stronger, while MSCI's emerging market stock index was 1.5% lower. 
Simmering tensions in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea added to caution in Chinese markets, where a jump in small-cap short bets has also caught regulators' attention. 
After a ""buy everything"" rally over several months supported by money-printing pandemic stimulus packages, near-zero interest rates and the start of COVID-19 vaccination programmes, some investors are worried markets may be near 'bubble' territory.
They point to rocketing prices of assets such as bitcoin or, on Monday, the soaring stock of short-squeezed videogame retailer Gamestop.
U.S. lawmakers agreed that getting COVID-19 vaccines to Americans should be a priority even as they locked horns over the size of a pandemic relief package. Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer nevertheless warned the relief package may be four to six weeks away.
Disagreements have meant months of indecision in the United States, where new COVID-19 cases have been above 175,000 a day and millions of people are out of work.
""We suspect earnings may not be able to catch up with what people expect this year,"" said Jacob Doo, chief investment officer at Envysion Wealth Management, citing the lockdowns in Europe and the slow roll out of vaccines in the United States.
""Within the tech space, we are cautious on FANGS now, simply because there could be anti-trust laws that Biden would implement,"" he added, using an acronym for major U.S. tech companies including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Investors are also looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.
""We expect the January FOMC to repeat and reinforce the Fed's existing dovishness, which is still significant given the recent taper discussions and other central banks' considerations to adapt policy,"" CitiFX strategist Ebrahim Rahbari said in a note.
Against a basket of its rivals, the dollar rose 0.2% to 90.65, its highest since Jan. 20, as volatility in stocks dulled appetite for riskier currencies.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson expects COVID-19 vaccine data next week,"By Manas Mishra and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Tuesday said it expected to report eagerly-awaited data on its COVID-19 vaccine early next week, and that it would be able to meet the delivery target for doses to countries with which it had signed supply agreements.
Public health officials are increasingly counting on single-dose options like the one being tested by J&J to simplify and boost inoculations given the complications and slower-than-hoped rollout of authorized vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which require second shots weeks after the first.
The company forecast 2021 profit well above Wall Street estimates, and its shares rose 3.4% to $171.55. 
The outlook does not include any contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. 
Wolk added that pricing of the vaccine would depend on the number of doses secured by countries and organizations. 
""We will let the science play out. Once we have the data, obtain regulatory authorization and finalize agreements to supply, we will provide financial updates as warranted,"" he said on a conference call.
The U.S. healthcare conglomerate said its medical device unit continued to recover despite the recent surge in COVID-19. The division was hit hard earlier in the pandemic by a decrease in elective and non-urgent procedures like hip and knee replacement as people avoided care or hospitals were forced to suspend such procedures.
Fourth-quarter sales in the unit fell marginally to $6.59 billion. 
Adjusted profit of $1.86 per share beat estimates of $1.82 per share, helped by double-digit sales growth of Crohn's disease drug Stelara and cancer treatment Darzalex.
Stelara sales grew 32% to $2.44 billion, while sales of Darzalex jumped nearly 60% to $1.25 billion. 

J&J forecast 2021 adjusted profit of between $9.40 and $9.60 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $8.99 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: Sovereign wealth, public pension giants caught up in U.S.-China tech fight","By Marc Jones and Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds are getting caught in the escalating tensions over technology between the United States and China, a Reuters analysis of their filings data and public disclosures show.
They range from Norway and Singapore's giant sovereign wealth funds to Switzerland's central bank and the $1.1 trillion U.S. TIAA, founded over a century ago by Andrew Carnegie as the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. 
U.S. investors were banned from owning stakes in more than 40 Chinese firms viewed as having military links in a series of moves since November, as outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump sought to cement his hardline policy against Beijing.
That prompted TIAA unit Nuveen to sell stakes in blacklisted firms including China Telecom (NYSE:CHA), China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), as well as microchip giant SMIC, state oil firm CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) and phone and gadget maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF). 
Other U.S. public pension funds are expected to follow suit. 
CalPERS, the largest such fund, held Hong Kong-listed 'H' shares in several firms, including a 1.1% stake in China Telecom and 0.2% apiece of both China Mobile and China Unicom, according to Refinitiv data. CalPERS, which has been criticised by Republican party politicians for its China investments, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages $200 billion of assets and had small stakes in China Telecom, China Mobile and Xiaomi, according to Refinitiv data, told Reuters it would be adhering to the bans. 
""The sanctions really bite for U.S. institutions,"" said Elliot Hentov, head of policy research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
And the ripples aren't only being felt in the United States. 
A number of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) have been affected as the New York Stock Exchange and index providers MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have ejected blacklisted firms from benchmarks, causing some stock prices to drop more than 20%. 
Norway's $1.3 trillion SWF, the world's largest, has 0.2%-0.6% stakes in China Telecom, China Mobile, Xiaomi, CNOOC and China Unicom Hong Kong as part of a broader $35 billion Chinese equity portfolio, according to most recent disclosures running up until the start of 2020. It said it would not comment on specific holdings. 
Singapore's GIC, a self-described ""independent state investor"", has a 10% stake in China Telecom's Hong Kong-listed 'H' shares and holds roughly 1.4% of SMIC in mainland China A- and H-shares, Reuters calculations based on stock exchange filings show. GIC declined to comment.
Other holders are Canadian pension funds Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ), British Columbia Investment Management, CPP Investment Board, Netherlands-based independent pension fund PGGM Vermogensbeheer and APG Asset Management.
Non-U.S. investors are not formally required to make any changes and many will have seen the value of their Chinese investments soar in recent years.
Chinese equity markets are at a 13-year high and the market cap of the main tech index is double what it was two years ago. 
""We view our investments in China – an important country in the global economy – with a long-term perspective,"" CDPQ told Reuters, declining to comment on specific investments.

THE WEIGHTING GAME
While China's growing weight in global markets is encouraging sovereign funds to hold larger Chinese portfolios, the bans and recent claims of cyber espionage over 5G firm Huawei and social media dance craze app TikTok show how technology is now a key geopolitical battleground.
With no indication yet of new U.S. President Joe Biden's approach, China Telecom, China Mobile, Xiaomi and CNOOC's shares have dropped between 12% and 22% since being blacklisted in November or this month.. 
SMIC has bucked the trend with a double-digit gain. 
""Some of the offloaded shares may be picked up from bargain-hunting asset owners outside of the U.S.,"" said Winston Ma, former managing director of sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. ""However, it may be difficult for them to absorb everything.""

It hasn't just been Washington's actions that have caused difficulties.
Beijing shocked markets in November when it suspended Ant Group's planned $37 billion IPO with days to go and just as Trump's administration was pushing through its bans.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), which owns a third of Ant, saw its market value shrink by more than a quarter. It is a top 10 global stock and widely held by sovereign and pension funds. 
U.S. Securities Exchange Commission data https://sec.report/CIK/0001582202 shows Switzerland's central bank doubled its Alibaba holdings in the past two years to $1.4 billion worth of the $650 billion company's stock in September.
November's tumble would have wiped roughly $350 million off those holdings. Alibaba shares recovered almost half their losses in January after being spared the U.S. blacklist.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 09:40AM ET</span>",BlackRock's Fink warns companies they need to show a net-zero plan,"By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber
LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), warned the companies it invests in on Tuesday they will need to show a game plan for surviving in a world aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century.
In his annual letter to the management of companies across the world, Fink said they would also need to make clear how the plan is integrated into the company's long-term strategy and reviewed by the board.
To help investors prepare their portfolios for the transition to a net-zero economy, Fink flagged a number of fresh steps the asset manager would take, including, where possible, publishing scores for how its equity and bond funds are positioned to adapt to global temperature changes.
The focus on companies' net-zero strategies comes as policymakers and campaigners push asset managers to do more to hold companies to account over their climate plans, ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Scotland later this year.
With $8.7 trillion in assets under management, mainly in passive funds, BlackRock has a significant stake in most large U.S. corporations and in many in other countries, giving it much influence over their decisions. 
""The world is moving to net zero, and BlackRock believes that our clients are best served by being at the forefront of that transition,"" Fink said.
""We are carbon neutral today in our own operations and are committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. No company can easily plan over 30 years, but we believe all companies – including BlackRock – must begin to address the transition to net zero today.""
Last month BlackRock called for companies to lay out their plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, but Fink's widely-read annual letter will draw more investor attention to the priorities. 
Methodologies for measuring temperature alignment are constantly evolving, based on new research and data specific to particular sectors and regions, Fink said in his letter. 
The group would also look to incorporate climate considerations into its capital markets assumptions and implement a ""heightened-scrutiny model"" when deciding which assets to include in its actively managed portfolios.
Going forward, BlackRock would also publish details of the proportion of its assets under management that are aligned with net zero and plans to announce interim targets for the proportion it aimed to be net-zero aligned by 2030.
After telling clients last year that sustainability would be the company's new standard for investing, BlackRock introduced a policy that would see it sell out of some coal companies, although at the time many campaigners said the bar set by BlackRock to exit was not low enough.
Despite pressure to take a more aggressive stance, Fink's letter made no mention of introducing tougher thresholds, drawing criticism from some.

""Larry Fink’s new net-zero commitment could be a positive step if it were paired with concrete and immediate action to stop investing in new fossil fuels. But a year after its first, extremely weak coal commitment, BlackRock has yet to announce a more ambitious policy,"" said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance.

Plant-based meat alternatives, such as burger patties and sausages from Beyond Meat, have gained in popularity in recent years as curious health-conscious consumers look to broaden or shift from chicken, pork and beef-based diets.
Beyond Meat suffered a surprise loss in its last reported quarter as demand for its products at restaurants and grocery stores tapered after an initial surge at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new partnership with PepsiCo will give the faux meat maker access to the beverage giant's distribution and marketing resources and allow it to expand into new product lines, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said.
PepsiCo, which apart from its namesake soda owns the Lays, Quaker and Gatorade brands, has also been looking to expand its portfolio of health-focused snacks and beverages.
""Plant-based proteins represent an exciting growth opportunity for us, a new frontier in our efforts to build a more sustainable food system,"" said Ram Krishnan, PepsiCo global chief commercial officer.

The financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed and the operations will be managed through a newly created entity, PLANeT Partnership LLC.

(Reuters) - `When  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports earnings on Tuesday, investors will be looking for signs that big businesses are still investing in cloud computing, that smaller businesses are starting to recover and whether Xbox sales will be slowed by chip shortages.
The Redmond, Washington-based company is a winner of the pandemic-driven shift to working and learning from home, with businesses and schools adopting its Teams collaboration software and shifting many other apps to the cloud. But the pandemic also hurt sales to small businesses and sparked a global semiconductor shortage, analysts said.
Investors will closely track growth of Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business that competes with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web services and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud. Analysts are expecting a 41.4% rise in Azure sales, according to Visible Alpha.
They will be looking for signs of a resumption in stalled spending, from one-time projects at larger businesses to sales of apps such as Office to small businesses.
""We will look for both a growing bookings number and positive qualitative management guidance to indicate that the worst is behind us and customers of all sizes are now engaged deeper in digital transformation conversations,"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne wrote in a note.
Microsoft launched two new Xbox models in November, and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expected only 40% gaming hardware revenue growth because of supply constraints.
Analysts say the new consoles also factor heavily into growth of subscribers to GamePass, Microsoft's $10 per month gaming service that had 15 million subscribers as of September.

Overall, analysts expect Microsoft on Tuesday to report fiscal second quarter sales of $40.18 billion and earnings per share of $1.64, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Jan. 25.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Who needs to sit next to a trader? Asset managers embrace outsourcing,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - More pension funds, insurers and asset managers are outsourcing part or all of their dealing desks to specialist traders as they seek to cut costs and adapt their operations to deal with the coronavirus crisis, industry sources say.
Last year's volatility in markets, plunging as the pandemic took hold and rebounding as government stimulus kicked in, meant asset managers spent more time juggling trades and less time on their usual job of long-term asset allocation.
Moving some or all of their trading to specialist firms offers access to a larger group of banks and brokers, making it cheaper to execute trades and allowing asset managers to cut trading staff and trading terminal costs, industry sources say.
The shift to outsourcing has also been accelerated by changes in working practices brought about by the pandemic.
""As we all work from home, people are realising you don't need to be physically sitting next to the traders to be able to communicate,"" said Tom Carroll, head of asset management at British fund manager Sanlam Investments, which outsourced trading to  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) shortly before the pandemic.
Carrol said the move meant his company's 20 fund managers could ""focus more on what they're good at"" - picking assets for the long term rather trading through short-term volatility.
Northern Trust global head of integrated trading Gary Paulin said the bank had 65 outsourced trading clients, of which 18 were added in 2020. Half the new clients were long-only asset managers, rather than those involved in short selling or other hedging activity. Two were asset owners such as pension funds.
""Last year was a really, really important turning point for the industry,"" he said, adding that asset managers were rethinking how they operated as the type of market volatility seen in 2020 ""always exposes a bloated cost base"".
Natixis Investment Managers International's outsourced trading unit's turnover rose 18% to 317 billion euros ($384 billion) in 2020 due to the extra volatility.
Investment bank Cowen's global outsourced trading unit doubled its revenue in 2020, said Jack Seibald, Cowen's managing director and global co-head of prime brokerage and outsourced trading. He did not disclose revenues from the business.
""The lockdown opened the eyes of so many managers to the idea that outsourced trading can be a credible solution,"" he said.
SLOW BURN
Outsourcing back-office functions such as accounting is well-established, but the trend towards outsourcing trading has been a slow burn, industry sources say.
It started around a decade ago as an equities trading service for hedge funds and wealth managers. It expanded after European regulation made running a trading desk more complex https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-assetmanagers-insight/asset-managers-farm-out-trading-as-costs-and-complexity-climb-idUSKCN1UV2FE.
Cost savings, operational efficiencies and trading expertise have pushed investors to outsource dealing, industry sources say, adding it increasingly appealed to insurers, asset managers and pension funds.
David Berney, founding partner of Ergo Consultancy, said one European insurer cut the costs of buying or selling a U.S. Treasury bond to ""a few"" basis points from 25 bps by outsourcing.
Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management in Phoenix, Arizona, which switched to outsourced trading with Outset Global in October, said the firm no longer needed to employ a trader in London.
Erik Vynckier, a non-executive director of British insurer Foresters Friendly Society, said outsourcing made sense for firms with less than 500 million euros under management.
""It would be difficult to get a good trader for portfolios this size,"" he said.
Trading groups said they typically hired bank or asset management traders, sometimes in a team transfer, offering work to those set adrift by the shift away from in-house operations.
Outsourcing can also cover the analysis, administration and compliance services handled by in-house teams.
Companies offering trading services have expanded from equities into fixed income and other assets.
Outset Global started pre-initial public offering (IPO) trading on secondary markets last year. Northern Trust added European derivatives this year.
Gilles Martins, head of business development at Natixis TradEx Solutions in Paris, said the firm aimed to add further services in 2021. ""This year the clients want more.""

“I kinda love Etsy,” Tesla’s chief executive officer wrote in a tweet. In a follow-up post, Musk added that he had “bought a hand knit wool Marvin the Martian helm (sic) for my dog” and posted a picture of it.
Separately on Tuesday, Jefferies raised its price target on the stock to $245 from $205, writing that gross merchandise sales growth at Etsy “continues to outpace broader e-commerce.” The firm has a buy rating on the stock, and wrote that there was a “long runway to add buyers.”
The stock rose as high as $232.39 before the bell compared with Monday’s closing price of $208.81. A close at that level would be a record.
Etsy has been among the standout performers of the past several months. Based on Monday’s close, the stock is up nearly 560% off a March low, with most of the gains reflecting increased e-commerce demand in the pandemic.
This isn’t the first time Musk has talked up a company or its stock. Earlier this month, Signal Advance skyrocketed after he urged in a tweet for his followers to “use Signal.” That spurred ticker confusion among traders who bought shares in the medical-device provider instead of the closely held nonprofit Signal messaging app.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",More carats and sparkle: How LVMH plans to change Tiffany,"By Francesca Piscioneri, Silvia Aloisi and Sarah White
PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - French luxury goods group LVMH plans to overhaul  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF)'s vast merchandise lineup to increase the focus on gold and precious gems and take its silver bangles upmarket after closing the $15.8 billion takeover of the U.S. jeweller this month. 
Six sources, including two people with inside knowledge of Tiffany's operations, told Reuters the owner of Louis Vuitton would also likely revamp the appearance of the jeweller's stores and boost its presence in Europe and Asia.
More than a third of Tiffany's 320 shops are in the United States and two sources described some of them as out-of-date, shoddy and in need of refurbishing.
""LVMH can give Tiffany the kind of time and money needed to make some big investments in the product range and in stores worldwide, and wait for those to pay off in the medium term,"" one of the sources said.
At a town hall in New York for Tiffany's 14,000 employees on Jan. 8 - a day after LVMH installed a new leadership team - the group's new bosses laid out their initial plans to focus on high-end, sparkling jewellery, said one person who attended it. The group is also considering building out Tiffany's lineup in watches, another source familiar with its thinking said.
Compared with rivals, such as Richemont-owned Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, as well as fellow LVMH brand Bulgari, Tiffany's products are a broad range from $150 silver pendants to diamond necklaces priced in the tens of millions. 
Silver jewellery has gross margins of around 90% and offers an entry point for younger, less wealthy shoppers, but top industry names also need the medium- to high range - with a price tag above $100,000 - to create an aura of exclusivity, experts say. 
In a video message to employees during the town hall, LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, who is also France's richest man, said he wanted to elevate Tiffany's standing, even if that took time. 
""We will also prioritize Tiffany's long-term desirability over short-term constraints,"" Arnault said, according to a person who attended. At one point brandishing one of Tiffany's signature robin's egg-blue boxes, Arnault underscored the label could count on cash-rich LVMH's resources. 
The world's biggest luxury goods group, also home to Moet & Chandon champagne, was shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic and sales in airport stores plunged, but its biggest labels have been robust. 
The mood among some of Tiffany's workforce is anxious nonetheless. 
A senior store employee in Europe said the jeweller would benefit as a more sophisticated, exclusive brand under LVMH, but also worried about the group's reputation as a demanding owner. 
""If a store doesn't quite work, they just shut it down,"" this person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Arnault is known for dropping in on stores unexpectedly - including at a Tiffany store in Seoul after the deal was announced in late 2019, where he pointed out blips such as a cleaning product that had been left out on a stand and a pink Post-It note saying ""not available"" that had been put up on a product, people familiar with the group said.
LVMH and Tiffany declined to comment. LVMH is due to report full-year 2020 results later on Tuesday.
SOOTHING WORDS
After a bruising court battle midway through the acquisition process, which ended with Tiffany and LVMH renegotiating the price tag slightly downwards, Arnault had soothing words for the U.S. jeweller.
He told the town hall Tiffany's resilience in recent months had exceeded LVMH's expectations, one of those present said.
The group had previously called Tiffany's prospects ""dismal"" due to poor management during the COVID-19 crisis.
Tiffany regained some ground through online sales and in China in its last quarter. Jewellery as a whole, one of the fastest growing luxury sectors in recent years, has been more resilient than other areas during the pandemic. 
Tiffany is less exposed than rivals to Asia-Pacific - a major driver for luxury sales - which accounted for 28% of its worldwide sales of $4.4 billion in 2019. Europe stood at 11%.
Jean-Christophe Babin, who runs Bulgari, the brand bought by LVMH in 2011, told Reuters negotiations with mall owners on stores or with airports on advertising billboards were far more advantageous when carried out by a group comprising dozens of brands. 
""We can share a screen at arrivals with (watch brand Tag Heuer),"" Babin said in an interview. ""These are synergies that we had and that Tiffany will have that will help improve profitability.""
Babin said that Bulgari financed its own investments in stores and production, but that internal competition with other LVMH stablemates had cranked up the jeweller's ambitions and performance. 
""The brand was a sleeping beauty, the arrival of LVMH was a wake-up call,"" Babin said. 
MARKETING SPLURGE? 
New York-based Tiffany, founded in 1837, achieved world fame with the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, but a fresh marketing push could help the brand. 
Alexandre Arnault - one of four Arnault children with roles at LVMH and now Tiffany's executive vice president, in charge of product and communication - told the town hall he would focus on advertising campaigns and luring young customers.
The 28-year-old helped LVMH acquire luggage maker Rimowa and gave it a hipster edge while CEO there, through collaborations with Dior that made it sexy for the runway. 
The young Arnault will work alongside new CEO Anthony Ledru, who ran Vuitton's global commercial activities but is also known for rolling out its high-end jewellery line and had a previous stint at Tiffany and also at Cartier. 

He takes over from Alessandro Bogliolo, who had already overseen a multi-year renovation of Tiffany's flagship New York store on Fifth Avenue, and the purchase of an 80-carat-plus oval diamond to be set in a necklace that will become its most expensive piece of jewellery.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Tuesday, with investors cautious ahead of a flood of corporate earnings.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 91 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 12 points, or 0.1%. 
The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.7% higher, at record highs Monday, the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, also a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, or 37 points, though it had been down more than 300 points intraday. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index has closed higher in its last five sessions, its best run since early November. It’s likely to be in focus Tuesday, with software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting after the close. Results from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will follow on Wednesday.
Aside from Microsoft, largely positive results have emerged from the likes of  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) before the opening bell.

The infusion is expected to help stabilize the hedge fund, which has been hard hit by a series of short bets this year, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day, citing people familiar with the firm.

Beijing has signalled that it wants to strengthen its oversight, particularly of technology firms looking to expand into the financial space, a reversal of its once laissez-faire approach.
The drive has spotlighted  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech affiliate, Ant Group, whose record $37 billion listing was halted by Beijing in early November, with its executives called into meetings and told to expect more regulation. 
""I'd say that you just follow the standard of legal instruction, you will have the result,"" Yi said on Tuesday, speaking at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum.

131,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 05:22AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Rolls Royce Shows Catching a Bouncing Knife Can Be Tricky Too,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- When Rolls Royce (LON:RR) raised 5 billion pounds in fresh equity and debt last year, it seemed that the bottom was in, as far as the stock price was concerned. That may still be true, but Tuesday's trading update shows that catching a bouncing knife is just as tricky as catching a falling one. 
Rolls Royce stock fell as much as much as 10% on Tuesday after saying it expected net cash outflow of around 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) this year, rather than the 1.25 billion expected by analysts. That's a reflection of how airlines are pushing back their estimated return to normal due to the spread of new variants of the Covid-19 virus. 
The stock subsequently trimmed losses to be down only 6.2% by mid-morning in London but was still by some way the biggest loser in a FTSE 100 that was up 0.5%. It's now at its lowest levels since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech brought the end of the pandemic into sight back in November, with their announcement of their vaccine's effectiveness. 
Rolls's new forecasts are handy, if rough, proxy for how the predictions of a vigorous and synchronized global recovery this year are coming unstuck. Whereas Rolls had expected its airline customers to fly 70% of available hours this year, it now only expects that to return to 55%. This matters because Rolls Royce's most important revenue stream is from maintenance, which is directly linked to the amount of hours flown by its engines.
""Though significant uncertainty remains over the precise shape and timing of the recovery in air traffic and the phasing of engine concession payments, free cash outflow this year is forecast to be heavily weighted towards the first six months,"" Rolls said in a statement. It expects to turn cash flow positive ""at some point during the second half"" and to generate free cash flow of 750 million pounds next year, even before the disposals that it plans. 
The market appeared to think that there was little read-across for the rest of the sector, however. The sector may have suffered in the last week from news flow of the U.K., U.S. and others tightening restrictions on travel to stop the spread of new virus strains, but to a large extent Rolls's problems still reflect company-specific balance sheet issues. With a debt to equity ratio of around 120%, it still remains relatively highly levered. 
Of course, when the bounce finally does arrive, that means that Rolls stock out to outperform. For those who still believe in the quick, strong rebound narrative, today's upset may provide an excellent entry point. However, the recovery in travel is predicated on confidence, and confidence needs a long runway. Every week lost to stories of overstretched hospitals and tightening quarantines eats into the time available for consumer confidence to heal before the peak summer flying season. The knife is still bouncing."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.8%, with the German DAX gaining 1.5%, France's CAC 40 up 1.1% and UK's FTSE 100 adding 0.7%.
Chemical stocks gained the most among sectors as industrial gas producer Linde (NYSE:LIN) rose 3.7% after announcing an increase to its quarterly dividend and a $5-billion share buyback programme.
UBS gained 2.5% as high levels of client activity helped the world's largest wealth manager record a 137% rise in net profit.
The broader financial services index was up 1.7%. Swedish buyout group EQT (NYSE:EQT) jumped 11.7% after it signed a deal to buy global real estate investment manager Exeter Property Group for $1.87 billion.
The STOXX 600 tumbled to a two-week low on Monday after data painted a gloomy picture of the European economy in January as many countries tighten curbs to combat new variants of the coronavirus.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co said on Tuesday it expects sales in United States and China to surge this year, driven by the launch of new electric cars and sports utility vehicles (SUVs), after reporting its best quarterly profit in over three years.
Hyundai's holiday-quarter profit jumped 57% on more demand for premium-margin SUVs, but overall sales volumes fell 5% amid a broader economic weakness due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The promising outlook is a testament to Hyundai's big electric vehicle (EV) push. The company, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 automakers, is soon expected to introduce an EV-only platform that will use its own battery technology to cut time and costs.
Hyundai, however, did not provide on its earnings call any update on recently reported talks between it and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) about an electric car and battery tie-up.
On sales, the automaker said it expects a 12% jump in its biggest market, North America, in 2021. Its sales in the fourth quarter ended December slipped 2% in the region. 
""With our lineup with new models ready to launch in the United States, we aim to increase our market share to 4.8% this year,"" Senior Vice President Koo Za-yong said on the call. 
Last year, the company managed to slightly advance its U.S. market share to 4.4%, helped by sales of the Palisade SUV and Kona EV, he said, despite a 10% fall in sales.
Analysts expect a boost to Hyundai's EV sales this year despite a global recall of Kona Electric due to fires.
Hyundai said it expects sales to jump 28% in China, the world's top car market where it also plans to release the electric version of its Mistra sedan this year.
""Last year, Hyundai basically didn't do much in China, while other automakers launched new models as the Chinese auto market saw a rapid recovery amid the pandemic ... Hyundai's China strategy seems to focus on electric cars,"" said Lee Han-joon, an analyst at KTB Investment & Securities.
Hyundai expects to sell 562,000 vehicles in China in 2021, and estimates sales in North America will jump to 909,000.
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) QUARTER SINCE 2017
In the fourth quarter, Hyundai earned 1.3 trillion won ($1.18 billion), the highest since at least early 2017.
But it fell short of an average analyst estimate of 1.5 trillion won, compiled by Refinitiv, due to a strong won.
The South Korean currency rose about 7% against the dollar in the three months to December. A stronger won erodes the value of overseas sales for South Korean companies.
Hyundai shares, up more than a third this month led by news of the Apple tie-up, fell about 3% on Tuesday. 
The broader KOSPI was down 2%.
Hyundai's quarterly revenue rose 5% to 29.2 trillion won as it saw solid demand for its cars in the United States and emerging markets such as India despite the pandemic.
While demand for its vehicles from car-rental companies that purchase in bulk is still tepid, analysts said, sales of its luxury cars are expected to remain a bright spot.
Hyundai had delivered a loss in the October quarter as it provisioned for a big engine-quality related bill.
""Hyundai had a good fourth quarter, especially in the United States, where higher average-selling-price cars such as SUVs saw increasing demand as consumers shun public transit because of COVID-19 and low gasoline prices,"" KTB's Lee said. 

""Holiday deals helped as well.""

UBS, the world’s largest wealth manager, reported net income of $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020, a 137% jump on the year before, helped by high levels of client activity. Its stock rose 3.8%.
Swedish buyout group EQT (NYSE:EQT) jumped 9.6% after it signed a deal to buy global real estate investment manager Exeter Property Group for $1.87 billion.

Swiss drugmaker Novartis stock fell 3.2% after its fourth-quarter sales and profit rose less than expected, while Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) stock fell 11% said it expects another 2 billion pound cash ($2.7 billion) outflow in 2021, even if the airline industry gets going in the second half of the year.
Also helping the tone, sentiment among German exporters in the industrial sector improved significantly this month, hitting its highest since October, the Ifo economic institute said on Tuesday.
""Clarity on Brexit and the U.S. presidency, a robust industrial economy and the start of global vaccinations have led to cautious optimism in the German export industry,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
The U.K. claimant count rose 7,000 in December, below than the 35,000 expected, while the unemployment rate rose to 5.0% in November. 
Still, doubts have started to emerge about the size and timing of President Joe Biden’s package needed to stimulate the country’s economy. Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Monday that a comprehensive deal could be four to six weeks away.
Additionally, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to resign Tuesday, hoping President Sergio Mattarella will give him a mandate to form a new government with broader backing in parliament.
Conte suffered a political blow last week when a junior party left his coalition in a row over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and recession.
Oil prices weakened Tuesday on fading hopes for the rapid approval of additional U.S. stimulus, while the Covid-19 pandemic continues to cause severe economic damage.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Corp, Japan's third-largest telco, said on Tuesday Chief Technology Officer Junichi Miyakawa would become its chief executive officer, effective April 1.
The change at the top of one of SoftBank Group Corp's largest assets comes after two years of deliberation, with the telco emphasising the need to ""pass on the strengths of its current management system to future generations.""
The rotation is likely to lead to speculation over SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son's own succession plans. The 63-year-old billionaire abandoned a previous plan to hand over the reins and went on to launch the $100 billion Vision Fund.
The son of a Buddhist priest, 55-year-old Miyakawa is a technical whizz driving projects including the wireless carrier's 5G build-out. He replaces 71-year-old Ken Miyauchi, a key lieutenant of Son, who took up the post in 2015. 
Miyauchi will take the post of board chairman from founder Son, who will remain on the board. A household name in Japan, Son joins business leaders such as former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs in being the face of the company he runs. 
During Miyauchi's tenure, the telco had a bumper IPO in December 2018 to feed cash to SoftBank Group as it shifted its focus to investing in tech companies. Son has since further reduced the group's stake after a series of high-profile stumbles. 
Miyakawa takes the helm as the industry faces unprecedented political pressure to cut fees, potentially eating into fat margins in its core business.
Looking to grow sales beyond selling mobile and broadband subscriptions, SoftBank is integrating a hodgepodge of companies including online fashion retailer Zozo and message app operator Line Corp into internet business Z Holdings.

Known for blue sky thinking including flirting with the idea of making cars, Miyakawa's pet projects include an attempt to deliver broadband via drones. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc said last week it was abandoning its own balloon-based attempt.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Total investments between the United States and China are much bigger than official figures reflect, a report released on Tuesday found, underscoring the challenge facing U.S. President Joe Biden's foreign policy team at a cold point in relations between the two countries.
""All sorts of people stand to lose a lot"" should leaders continue to split apart the world's two largest economies, said Adam Lysenko, associate director of research firm Rhodium Group. 
It wrote the report released by the National Committee on U.S-China Relations, an influential Washington group of business and diplomatic leaders. Ties between the two countries are under strain on a host of issues, including human rights and trade rules.
The report estimates U.S. investors held $1.2 trillion in equity and debt securities issued by Chinese entities at the end of 2020, five times the levels shown in official data from the U.S. Treasury Department. Most of the difference was due to Chinese firms ""using complex legal structures to issue shares out of tax havens that trade on U.S. exchanges,"" according to the report.
Chinese holdings of U.S. securities, meanwhile, were as much as $2.1 trillion at the same point, 36% more than official figures suggest. Most of the difference was due to ""equity investments misclassified in official sources due to investor efforts to circumvent Beijing’s capital controls or the use of Hong Kong as an investment intermediary,"" according to the report.
Financial integration between the two economies, however, is also low, due to capital controls, Lysenko said. Were policy loosened, the two countries' combined portfolio investments would total more than $9 trillion, compared with about $3 trillion currently, he said.
In office less than a week, Biden's foreign-policy and trade teams have inherited a series of hardline policies put in place by the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump.
An executive order from November requires U.S. investors to divest from 44 companies allegedly linked to China's military, but conflicting statements from agencies handling its rollout spurred confusion among shareholders.

Kuaishou Technology’s Hong Kong IPO of as much as $5.4 billion will push the amount raised through first-time share sales in the region in 2021 to $9.93 billion, the most for a January month in 11 years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Almost $11 billion was raised in January 2010.
The bumper start comes against a backdrop of ebullient regional markets that continue to hit new records amid a flood of liquidity from central banks trying to stave off the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
The continuing boom in Asia share listings follows on from the trend seen last year globally, where investors piled into offerings in search for returns, sending company valuations soaring on their debuts. Globally, IPOs are having their best start to the year on record, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
Kuaishou, the operator of China’s most popular video service after ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin, appears to have picked the right time to go public. The Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed startup will stop taking orders from institutional investors two days earlier than planned, a sign of very strong investor demand. It has already reserved around 45% of the shares it is offering for high-profile cornerstone investors.
Earlier IPOs have also proved popular with investors, particularly mom and pop buyers. Health-care technology company Yidu Tech Inc. soared 148% on its debut this month after retail investors put in orders for 1,634 times the shares initially made available to them.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Black said on Monday he would step down as chief executive at Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, following an independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
While Black, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $8.2 billion, will remain Apollo's chairman, his decision to step down illustrates how doing business with Epstein weighed on the reputation of one of Wall Street's most prominent investment firms. Black co-founded Apollo 31 years ago.
Apollo said it plans to change its corporate governance structure, doing away with shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm.
The independent review, conducted by law firm Dechert LLP, found Black was not involved in any way with Epstein's criminal activities. Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017, according to the review.
Black, 69, said that although the review confirmed he did not engage in any wrongdoing, he ""deeply"" regretted his involvement with Epstein.
""I hope that the results of the review, and related enhancements ... will reaffirm to you that Apollo is dedicated to the highest levels of transparency and governance,"" Black wrote in a note to Apollo fund investors. He will step down as CEO no later than July 31.
Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, 58, will take over as CEO.
Rowan has often kept a low-key profile compared with Apollo's other co-founder, Joshua Harris, 56, and spearheaded many initiatives that turned Apollo into a credit investment giant, including the permanent capital base the firm enjoys through its ties to reinsurer Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd.
The revelations of Black's ties to Epstein took a toll on Apollo, which Black turned into one of the world's largest private equity groups. Apollo executives had warned in October that some investors had paused their commitments to the buyout firm's funds as they awaited the review's findings. 
Apollo shares are down 1% since the New York Times reported on Oct. 12 that Black paid at least $50 million to Epstein for advice and services, when most of his clients had deserted him. 
Over the same period, shares of peers Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc are up 19%, 10% and 23%, respectively.
""We think a large number of (Apollo fund investors) took a 'pause', and we believe the outcome (of the review) and changes today will cause most of them to return to allocating to future Apollo funds,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a research note.
Apollo shares jumped 4% to $47.65 in after-hours trading on Monday.
""We continue to follow these events closely and will evaluate how Apollo addresses its issues,"" the California State Teachers' Retirement System, one of the largest U.S. public pension funds and an Apollo investor, said in a statement.
Epstein was found dead at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for allegedly abusing dozens of underage girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. New York City's chief medical examiner ruled that the cause of death was suicide by hanging.
FALLING OUT
Black previously said he had paid millions of dollars to Epstein, but the exact size of his payments was revealed for the first time on Monday. Beyond the $158 million in payments, Black made two loans to Epstein totaling $30.5 million in early 2017. 
Dechert said in its report that Black's social ties with Epstein, who built his fortune by endearing himself to powerful figures in high society, went back to the mid-1990s.
Epstein won Black's trust by resolving an estate tax issue for him in 2012 potentially worth at least $500 million, the report said. He ended up advising Black on various aspects of his personal financial affairs, from his family office and airplane to his yacht and artwork. 
Black believed that Epstein provided advice over the years that conferred between $1 billion and $2 billion in value to him, according to the Dechert report. Black said in his note to investors that he had paid Epstein a fee equivalent to 5% of the value he generated on an after-tax basis, and not tied to hourly rates. 
Black and Epstein's relationship deteriorated after Epstein failed to repay $20 million of the loans and Black refused to pay tens of millions of dollars in fees that Epstein demanded, according to the Dechert report. 
They severed ties in October 2018, according to the report. Black knew Epstein had been convicted in Florida a decade earlier for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the Dechert report said, but there was no evidence suggesting Black had knowledge of the other alleged crimes before they were publicly reported in late 2018, culminating in Epstein's July 2019 arrest.
On Monday, Black pledged $200 million toward ""initiatives that seek to achieve gender equality and protect and empower women,"" as well as helping survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking. 
Apollo said it would pursue a ""one share, one vote"" corporate governance structure that would do away with shares with special voting rights. It said the move could qualify it for listing on the S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) indices.
Apollo also said it would seek to give its board more authority to oversee its business, eroding the power of its executive committee led by Black. 
The board will be expanded to include four new independent directors, including Avid Partners founder Pamela Joyner and physician and scientist Siddhartha Mukherjee, Apollo said. Apollo co-Presidents Scott Kleinman and James Zelter will join the board and take on increased responsibility running day-to-day operations.

Apollo had about $433 billion in assets under management as of the end of September.

A series of fires prompted mass recalls of Hyundai's best-selling Kona EV in South Korea in October.
The latest Kona fire, on Saturday in the city of Daegu, is among 11 reported so far in the country. But this incident was different as it was the first Kona EV to catch fire after undergoing the recall process, the official said on Tuesday. 
In South Korea, Hyundai has recalled 25,564 Kona EVs built during September 2017 to March 2020 due to the risk of short circuit possibly caused by faulty manufacturing of its high-voltage battery cells.
Recalled Kona EVs in South Korea get software updates and some receive battery replacements after inspection.
The recalled Kona that caught fire had only received a software update but no battery replacement, the official said on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to media. 
Korea Automobile Testing & Research Institute, which has been investigating the fires, is now looking into the adequacy of Hyundai's voluntary recall process, the official and an institute official said. 
Hyundai did not have an immediate comment.

Hyundai is expected to launch a new electric vehicle, the Ioniq 5 - its first model using a new EV-only platform - next month.

By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, with a possible delay in passing U.S. stimulus measures leading to a choppy U.S. session overnight. Ever-rising numbers of global COVID-19 cases also soured investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.82% by 10:34 PM ET (3:34 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.56%. The Bank of Korea said earlier in the day that the country’s fourth quarter GDP rose 1.10% quarter-on-quarter, higher than the 0.7% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but below the 2.1% growth recorded for the third quarter.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.31%. The city’s Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan on Monday approved the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) -BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 vaccine for the first roll-out in Hong Kong, expected to start after Lunar New Year holidays next month.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 1.20% while the Shenzhen Component fell 2.24%.
Australian markets are closed for a holiday.
Worries about the timing and amount of further U.S. stimulus emerged after Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned a comprehensive deal could be four to six weeks away. But he added that some COVID-19 relief measures could be passed before former President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial begins in early February.
President Joe Biden is willing to negotiate on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he proposed earlier in the month with Republican lawmakers. But with Democrats now in control of Congress, a Democrat-only route has so far not been ruled out.
“The immediate question now is when stimulus aid will be approved and how much?” MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Christopher Grisanti told Reuters.
The Senate also voted 84-15 to confirm Janet Yellen as Secretary of the Treasury, the first woman in the role. Yellen is now expected to move quickly on COVID-19 relief, review U.S. sanctions policy and strengthen financial regulation.
Amid the recent rally seen in global shares, investors are searching for fresh catalysts to drive them higher, or to justify the current valuations at least.
For now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, which opens today with a policy decision to be handed down on Wednesday. The focus will also be on a slew of U.S. economic data to be released throughout the week, including the GDP for the fourth quarter.
Global shares are currently taking a breather after a strong bull run last week, but some investors remained optimistic despite the downhill trend.
“Risk appetite has clearly improved … central banks and governments need to keep their foot on the accelerator,” Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr told Reuters."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, who founded the world's largest hedge fund, said on Monday that all sides need to collaborate to reconfigure capitalism for a post-pandemic world.
Dalio, whose opinions on global problems and potential solutions are widely followed, said a bipartisan and productive effort is necessary to create economic transformation. ""It can't just be a transfer of wealth. It has to be an increasing amount of productivity,"" he said at the World Economic Forum's virtual Davos Agenda.
""So it has to be over-encompassing and it has to be like a Manhattan Project,"" Dalio said referring to the U.S.-led effort during World War II to develop a nuclear weapon.
His comments came hours after he said on Twitter, ""I believe we are on the brink of a terrible civil war ... where we are at an inflection point between entering a type of hell of fighting or pulling back to work together for peace and prosperity.""
In the Davos session, held virtually because of the pandemic, Dalio praised U.S. President Joe Biden for taking a more inclusive tone and wanting to be a president for the UNITED states. ""It's a great objective,"" he said.
Still the investor said he sees no easy path to solving problems like the wealth gap, increased debt, plus the rising power of China and the declining power of the United States. ""That's a fragile, fragmented world,"" he said.

Dalio's firm Bridgewater Associates has earned $46.5 billion for investors since its launch in 1975 but suffered a setback last year when it lost $12.1 billion, according to data from LCH Investments.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",U.S. bankruptcy judge okays Weinstein Co plan paying $17 million for sex abuse claims,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) - A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge on Monday approved The Weinstein Co’s liquidation plan, which sets aside $17 million for women who accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. 
Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington, Delaware announced her ruling at the conclusion of a remote hearing. She overruled an objection from a handful of women who are looking to pursue appeals of their claims outside of bankruptcy court. 
She noted that 83% of sexual misconduct claimants in the bankruptcy “have expressed very loudly that they want closure through acceptance of this plan, that they do not seek to have to go through any further litigation in order to receive some recovery, some possible recompense ... although it’s clear that money will never give them that.”
The Weinstein Co sold its assets to Lantern Entertainment, which later became Spyglass Media Group, for $289 million after it filed for bankruptcy in 2018. The bankruptcy was precipitated by widespread claims of sexual misconduct against company founder Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year prison term after being convicted of sexually assaulting a former production assistant and raping an actress. 
Insurers have contributed $35 million under the plan, so holders of sexual misconduct claims will get almost half of that. The Weinstein Co’s lawyers say the women who filed the claims could each see six-figure recoveries.
They will have the option to forgo most of their payout under the plan if they want to continue pursuing their claims against Harvey Weinstein and former officers and directors of the company.
A group of women with sexual abuse claims argued that the choice between a full payout and continuing to pursue their claims was unfair. But lawyers for the company and an unsecured creditors’ committee, which includes women who filed sexual misconduct claims, say those releases for former officers and directors are a key component of the plan.
A lawyer for the company, Paul Zumbro of Cravath Swaine & Moore, said during the hearing that the plan is ""remarkable"" and a ""favorable closure of this really ugly story.""
The case is In re The Weinstein Company Holdings LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 18-10601.
For The Weinstein Company: Paul Zumbro, Lauren Moskowitz and Salah  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN) of Cravath Swaine & Moore and Mark Collins, Russell Silberglied, Paul Heath, Zachary Shapiro, Brett Haywood and David Queroli of Richards Layton & Finger
For the committee: James Stang, Robert Feinstein, Debra Grassgreen, Bradford Sandler and Colin Robinson of Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones

148,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",Nissan flips the switch on electric reboot in China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor is accelerating the rollout of electric vehicles in China under its main brand and its local, no-frills Venucia marque as it overhauls its strategy in the world's biggest auto market, four sources told Reuters.
Besides the focus on green vehicles, the plan involves using more locally made parts and technologies to reduce costs and help the struggling Japanese carmaker compete better with lower-cost Chinese firms and major global rivals, the sources said.
The China strategy is a key pillar of Nissan's turnaround, which involves focusing on producing profitable cars for China, Japan and the United States, rather than chasing all-out global growth as it did under disgraced former boss Carlos Ghosn.
""Before we were saying global, global, global, and China was just part of that strategy,"" one of the four people familiar with the plans told Reuters. 
""With regionalisation now replacing globalisation, we have to improve the cost competitiveness of all the components and technologies that go into a car by going totally local,"" he said.
Both the Nissan board and the board of its China joint venture Dongfeng Motor Company have backed the plan and some elements of the new strategy will be unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April, the sources said.
Nissan plans to launch three cars in China this year: the new all-electric Ariya crossover, a significant redesign of its X-Trail sport utility vehicle (SUV) and a hybrid Sylphy compact car using its e-Power technology, the sources said.
At least one new Nissan car will hit the Chinese market each year through 2025, with most either fully electric or hybrids equipped with autonomous and smart driving technology, the sources said. One is likely to be an e-Power X-Trail. 
Two of the sources said the plan also involves turning Venucia more into a brand for affordable electric vehicles (EVs), though details are still being worked out. The idea is to price new Venucia EVs well below its current cheapest EV - the e30 mini car - which starts at 61,800 yuan ($9,540). 
All four sources work for Nissan and spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to reporters.
Nissan declined to comment on its future product strategy.
""China is a core market for Nissan and Nissan is getting prepared to launch a slew of technologies including e-Power technology to fulfil customers' aspirations,"" a Nissan spokesman said. He also confirmed the Ariya would be launched in 2021.
'CHINA-SPECIFIC CARS' 
Despite being one of the world's first automakers to fully embrace fully electric cars with its best-selling Leaf, Nissan has fallen behind Toyota and Honda, analysts said. Both launched a slew of new hybrids in China in 2019 and 2020 which has helped boost their sales.
""Nissan has nothing to show off in terms of green cars in China today,"" said Yale Zhang, head of consultancy Automotive Foresight in Shanghai. ""That's hurting their image and, most importantly, sales.""
Nissan's new China strategy is also a response to growing competition from price-competitive Chinese automakers such as Geely Automobile, GAC Motor, and BYD, two of the sources said.
One of the sources said a new focus on ""China-specific"" cars designed to appeal to local tastes underpinned Nissan's more decisive turn towards electrified models. That should mean bolder grilles, sharp-looking headlamps and tail lights as well as richer, softer and more sumptuous vehicle interiors.
Many local brands are now producing better-quality cars and that's putting pressure on Nissan's mainstream cars, as well as vehicles produced by other global automakers.
The most critical part of Nissan's China-specific strategy, however, is to make cars with more parts and technologies procured within the country to slash costs.
After posting its first loss in 11 years, Nissan is scrambling to slash its production capacity and models by about a fifth and to cut fixed costs by 300 billion yen ($2.9 billion) over three years. 
Nissan expects to post a record operating loss of 340 billion yen in the year ending March 31.
Two of the sources said there wasn't necessarily a cost-cutting target for the China initiative.
However, Nissan is worried about the potential hit to profitability from increasingly stringent emissions and fuel-economy rules, as well as a likely rise in the cost of materials such as steel, other metals and semiconductors, they said.
GREEN-CAR CREDITS 
Under the new China plan, parts engineered and procured locally should go well beyond bumpers, seats and lamps to include more complex technologies such as sensors and electric power inverters, three of the sources said.
Batteries for Nissan's e-Power models, for example, will be locally developed and sourced from China's Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery Co.
Nissan's new plan is modest in terms of volume growth. It is simply aiming to outpace the overall Chinese market for cars and light commercial vehicles, which Nissan expects to grow by about 10% to 25 million vehicles by 2025, one source said.
Nissan's previous ""Triple One"" China plan aimed to boost annual sales to 2.6 million cars by 2022 but the COVID-19 pandemic derailed it. Nissan sold 1.46 million cars last year, down from 1.56 million in 2018 when that plan was unveiled. 
While Nissan's performance in China last year was broadly in line with an overall 6% decline in passenger car sales due to the coronavirus, its Venucia brand fared particularly badly.
Established in 2012 to compete with local brands making cheap, gasoline-fueled cars, Venucia's sales peaked in 2017 at 143,206 before sliding to 79,000 last year. The plan is to relaunch Venucia more as a brand for affordable EVs though it won't be going fully electric for now, two sources said.
Carmakers in China need to make enough so-called New Energy Vehicles to win green-car credits which then offset negative points from their production of combustion engine vehicles.
Nissan looks set to fall short of credits so it would either have to buy them from rivals, or step up its EV production. As buying credits would eat into profitability, it is favouring the second strategy, one of the sources said. 
Cheaper EVs made locally by global rivals such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) through joint ventures have also proved to be a success story with customers, especially in big cities. 
Launched in July, GM's tiny Wuling MINI EV has already become China's best selling electric vehicle, knocking Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3 sedan off its perch.
""We don't have enough electric cars in China. The new plan for Venucia is all about changing that more decisively,"" said one of the sources familiar with Nissan's plans.

149,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:05PM ET</span>","GameStop shares soar on short squeeze, then ease in wild trade session","By Stephen Culp and Julien Ponthus
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) skyrocketed by 144% on Monday as short sellers scrambled to cover their positions in the stock, which then pared gains in a roller coaster session that featured nine trading halts for volatility.
Options activity also surged in the stock, which had gained 245% so far this year as of Friday's close. It closed Monday's session up 18% with $16.7 billion worth of GameStop shares traded -- more than triple the company's actual stock market value. 
Short sellers had bet against the stock because they viewed GameStop's retail business model as outdated. But GameStop shares began to rise after the video game retailer's announcement on Jan. 11 about appointments to its board to double down on digital sales.
The buying frenzy as short sellers rushed to cover positions enticed retail investors to pile on in hopes of riding the stock's momentum higher.
""Many traders leveraged positions betting the stock would go down and as it became a hot topic on social media and saw artificial demand created among short sellers, there was fuel added to the fire,"" said Jake Wujastyk, chief market analyst at TrendSpider, a technical analysis software company for traders.
""Traders were being shopped out of their short positions and forced to buy back and a significant amount of artificial demand was created,"" Wujastyk added. 
Short sellers typically borrow and sell shares they expect will fall, hoping to buy them back at a lower price, pay back the loan and pocket the difference. 
Users of social media circulated memes mocking the losing bets by intuitional traders and gains made by ""mom and pop"" retail traders long derided on Wall Street as ""dumb money.""
Over a quarter of all posts on three main Reddit investing groups last Friday were about Gamestop, compared to an average of about 1% in November, according to a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) analysis. Another stock with an unusual surge was Blackberry (TSX:BB) which put out a statement noting it had not disclosed anything to prompt the move.
Retail traders ""making a complete mockery of Wall Street and sophisticated institutional investors is absolutely hilarious,"" wrote Rob Paone, founder of Proof of Talent, a blockchain recruiting firm. 
Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York also appreciated the absurdity.
""You know it’s not going to end well but while it is happening it just becomes this sideshow where people just sit back in disbelief,"" Hogan said.
The short betting was evident with 100% of the shares available to borrow to speculate against the company already out on loan, according to FIS' Astec analytics data as of Friday.
""Over the last seven days we saw shares shorted increase by +769 thousand shares, worth $50 million, an increase of +1.08% as its stock price rose +83%,"" according to Ihor Dusaniwksy, managing director at S3 Partners, a financial data, analytics and services firm.
Last week, short-seller Citron Research said the stock would be ""back to $20 fast"".
Citron did not respond to a request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Melvin Capital Management had a short position against GameStop. Melvin on Monday announced a $2.75 billion investment from Citadel and Point72 Asset Management to stabilize the fund. Melvin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Volume has also surged in GameStop options, hitting a record of 2.13 million contracts on Friday. On Monday, about 1.25 million GameStop options contracts had traded as of 3:04 pm E.T. (2004 GMT), about four times expected volume, according to Trade Alert. Given the surge in GameStop shares, expectations for volatility have likewise climbed. Based upon Trade Alert data, options are now pricing in an average move of about 22% over the next 30 days.
Among the eight analysts who cover the stock, four rate it ""hold"" and the rest recommend ""sell."" The median price target is $12.50, an ~85% discount to current levels, according to Refinitiv.

GameStop did not respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Two New York City pension funds voted to divest their portfolios of some $4 billion worth of fossil fuel company securities, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Comptroller Scott Stringer, and fund trustees said https://on.nyc.gov/39ejxHM.
""Fossil fuels are not only bad for our planet and our frontline communities, they are a bad investment,” said de Blasio in a statement on Monday.
New York was among a dozen big cities worldwide that pledged to shift their money out of the fossil fuel industry last September, part of a broader rush to embrace renewable energy both to slow climate change for cost reasons.
The move is partly symbolic, affecting just a piece of the $240 billion in pension assets managed by Stringer's office. Officials will not identify securities to be sold until transactions are completed. 
The two funds that voted to divest represent city teachers and other workers with a combined $168 billion under management. Two smaller funds for the city's police and firefighters, with a combined $63 billion, have not voted to divest. A fifth fund with $8 billion is expected to vote to divest soon, the statement said.
The steps go further than actions by other big pension funds in liberal-leaning areas to date. New York State's common retirement fund leaders, for instance, last month set a goal for their investments to reflect net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2040, and called divestment ""a last resort.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. averages on Monday closed well off their best levels of the day, which included a Nasdaq record, as concerns over the timing and size of fiscal stimulus dented optimism at the start of a week of earning reports from mega-cap companies.
Investors turned their focus to the U.S. Senate, which is aiming to pass COVID-19 relief legislation before former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial begins in early February.
Officials in President Joe Biden's administration are trying to head off Republican concerns that his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief proposal is too expensive.
""What is really underpinning the market is the stimulus – that is what it is all about,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 
""The market loves money, whether it is fiscal or monetary, and right now you have both. So if you do pull the rug out from stimulus plans, that might be a problem, but they aren't going to do that.""
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.77 points, or 0.11%, to 30,963.21, the S&P 500 gained 14.39 points, or 0.37%, to 3,855.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.76 points, or 0.71%, to 13,638.82.
After climbing as much as 1.4% to an intraday record, the Nasdaq gave back a good portion of its gains, with the so-called ""stay-at-home"" winners, including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), rising after upbeat results from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) last week.
Microsoft, scheduled to report results on Tuesday, rose as Wedbush raised its price target on the software maker's stock on expectations of further growth in its cloud business for 2021.
The S&P 500 sectors housing large-cap growth stocks, including technology, consumer discretionary and communication services, hit record highs early in the session.
Wall Street's main indexes hit all-time highs last week on optimism for a more complete economic reopening and smooth vaccine distribution across the country, which is suffering from more than 175,000 new COVID-19 cases daily with millions out of work.
Earlier on Monday, drugmaker Merck & Co said it would stop development of its two COVID-19 vaccines. 
Gamestop shares closed higher in volatile trading in a session that saw the video game retailer climb as high as $159.18 and drop as low as $61.13 on the day as investors rushed to cover short bets.
Sectors that have performed well on hopes for an economic rebound, such as financials, energy and materials, led declines on Monday, while defensive utilities, consumer staples and real estate outperformed. Weakness in financial names such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) served to keep the price-weighted Dow in negative territory.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at record highs Monday, on Apple-led strength in technology ahead of a busy week of market-moving earnings from big tech.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.12%, or 37 points, though had been down more than 300 points intraday. The S&P 500 was up 0.38%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.69%.
Tech, meanwhile, kept the downside in the broader market in check as the Fab 5 traded mostly positive ahead of a big week. Microsoft reports earnings on Tuesday after the closing bell, while Apple, Facebook and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are set to report earnings on Wednesday. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ended the day higher.
The renewed strength in tech comes as investor appetite for cyclicals run of steam somewhat amid concerns over prolonged path for further stimulus and the threat of further Covid-19 restrictions.      
Energy was the biggest cyclical sector in the red, weighed down by weaker oil prices amid ongoing worries over pandemic-fueled weakness in crude.
National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) and TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) were down sharply, with the latter down about 5%.
Financials were dragged lower by a decline in bank stocks, which continued their post-earnings weakness as global growth concerns surfaced amid rising restrictions.
Biden is expected to sign a travel ban Monday on most non-U.S. citizens entering the country who were recently in South Africa, and on non-U.S. citizens from the U.K. and Brazil, in a bid to prevent the new virus strains identified in those countries from becoming prevalent in this country.
Airlines also fell sharply as growing restrictions will likely prolong the recovery in global travel demand. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) fell more than 2%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) slipped 4%.
The fading prospect of a quick roll out of further stimulus has dimmed amid Republican opposition. Democrats are unlikely to get the 10 Republican votes needed to advance Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan. 
“We believe the size of this bill would likely prove challenging to garner bipartisan support. The provision of increasing the minimum wage to $15 is already facing resistance from the Republicans. We anticipate that the Biden administration may divide the bill into separate packages,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he aims to secure passage of the next round of Covid-19 relief by mid-March.

Investing.com -- Stocks recovered early losses on Monday to kick off a busy week of earnings reports from big tech companies, with hopes for a swift approval of new stimulus fading from view.
There were a couple of eye-popping moves in stocks as the short-selling favorite  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) whipsawed. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) soared after the CEO said recent successful fundraising means there’s no need for a bankruptcy filing.
President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus, but it faces resistance with Republicans in the Senate. The thinking now is that the administration will have to scale back some of its ambitions or present the stimulus in a series of smaller packages.
Financial and energy stocks fell on Monday, with the latter pressured by weaker oil prices on demand worries. The Federal Reserve starts its regular two-day meeting on Tuesday and will likely discuss the state of the economic recovery.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. GameStop captivates the investing public
GameStop, the video game retailer, is the topic of the town lately after its shares have been taken on a wild ride by short sellers and retail investors. On Monday, the stock jumped more than 140% in volatile morning trading but then gave it all back, and then rose again, even with intermittent trading halts. 
Analysts don’t think the stunning run-up in the shares is justified. On Monday, Telsey Advisory Group downgraded it to a sell-equivalent from a buy-equivalent. At about $85 as of midday, the shares will likely continue to be extremely volatile. Buckle (NYSE:BKE) your seatbelts.
2.  Earnings from AMD and Microsoft
This is a big week for corporate earnings, and after Tuesday’s closing bell we get reports from AMD and Microsoft.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to report earnings per share of 47 cents on revenue of $3 billion. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is expected to report EPS of $1.64 on revenue of $40.2 billion.
3. Fed starts its regular meeting 
It’s the Federal Reserve’s first meeting under the Biden administration, which has floated a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, including payments to families and money for states and local economies.
The Fed has pledged to back the economy in any way it can. The central bank’s latest rate decision is due out on Wednesday, and observers expect rates to be held steady with further commentary about the outlook for an economic revival.
Consumer confidence is one way of getting things back on track. The reading for the current month is due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) on Tuesday.

U.S.-listed shares of the security software supplier were up 17.7% at $16.53, set for a seventh consecutive session of gains.
Responding to a request from securities regulator the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, BlackBerry said it was not aware of any material, undisclosed corporate developments that could have driven the surge in its stock and trading volume. 
The latest jump in the company's shares comes after Blackberry (TSX:BB), the once-ubiquitous name in the smartphone industry, on Jan. 15 settled a patent royalties dispute with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).

(Reuters) - Indivior said on Monday former parent Reckitt Benckiser would withdraw a $1.4 billion claim against the company and it would pay the Dettol-maker $50 million to end a legal battle related to a U.S. probe into opioid addiction.
The settlement offers some respite to the London-listed drugmaker after failed efforts to stop generic versions of Suboxone Film, its top-selling drug and subject of the U.S. investigation, hit sales as it was further battered by the probe.
Reckitt and Indivior also agreed to drop all liabilities against each other and Indivior will not seek damages relating to its $600 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the $10 million it paid the Federal Trade Commission, the drugmaker said.
Its subsidiary pleaded guilty to a felony charge in July to resolve U.S. allegations that it had engaged in an illegal scheme to boost prescriptions of its opioid addiction treatment Suboxone Film. 
Indivior also said on Monday the $50 million consideration it was paying Reckkit will be carried out over five years. It did not provide any further details on the settlement.
Reckitt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The United States has been cracking down on pharmaceutical firms it believes have fuelled the opioid addiction crisis in the country, and Reckitt agreed to pay up to $1.4 billion in 2019 to resolve claims against its former pharmaceuticals unit.
Indivior itself was indicted in early 2019 and accused of deceiving U.S. doctors and healthcare benefit programs into believing the treatment, itself a form of opioid, was safer and less susceptible to abuse than similar drugs.
The long-running U.S. investigations into the London-listed companies began much before Indivior was spun out from Reckitt in 2014. 
Indivior shares closed down roughly 2% at 127.9 pence before the setllement was announced, whereas Reckitt ended the day 4.5% higher at 6,554 pence.

The largest movie theater operator has been reeling from pandemic-related closures and restrictions. Shares are down 32% in the last year. On Monday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said U.S. box office sales fell 82% last year, to $2.1 billion, and most of the sales came in the first quarter.
AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement on the company's website that ""today, the sun is shining on AMC."" The fundraising, including a $400 million loan for its Europe operations announced Monday and a combination of debt and equity sales, comes after AMC raised $1 billion from April to November last year. Aron said ""any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.”
AMC raised the possibility of exploring bankruptcy last fall when it revealed it was burning through cash and could run out early this year. That was before the fundraising spree. "

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe is set to lift a 22-month flight ban on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX this week after reviewing submissions by industry experts and whistleblowers, angering relatives of some of the 346 crash victims, who say the move is premature.
A green light from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is a key step towards resolving an almost two-year safety crisis after crashes of the best-selling jet in Indonesia and Ethiopia which were linked to flawed cockpit software.
The United States lifted its own ban in November, followed by Brazil and Canada. China, which was first to ban the plane after the second crash in March 2019 and which represents a quarter of MAX sales, has not said when it will act.
After giving provisional approval in November, EASA sifted through input from 38 commenters and ""received directly a number of whistleblower reports that we thoroughly analysed and took into account,"" Executive Director Patrick Ky said on Monday.
That, he said, did not expose any fresh technical problems.
But a France-based victims' group, Solidarity and Justice, called the move ""premature, inappropriate and even dangerous"".
Analysts and airline chiefs say EASA, which represents 31 mainly EU nations, has emerged stronger from the crisis, which eroded U.S. leadership of aviation safety.
Its U.S. counterpart, the Federal Aviation Administration, has been faulted for lax oversight of Boeing in approving the MAX, which featured little-documented software capable of ordering repeated dives based on just one vulnerable sensor.
Among its conditions for clearing the jet, EASA insisted on doing its own independent review of all critical systems well beyond the MCAS software, irking Boeing and some U.S. officials.
It also said the causes of the accidents must be understood, design changes must be implemented and pilots properly trained.
""We believe those four conditions are now met,"" Ky said.
But one lasting impact will be on a decade-old trend towards interdependence which had seen regulators rely on each other's safety judgments, amid pressure to be more efficient.
Under a 2011 agreement, EASA and the FAA agreed to base their evaluation of airplanes designed in each other's territory on the tests and compliance decisions carried out by the other agency ""to the maximum extent practicable"".
""Of course given those tragedies we have stopped this trend and we will increase our level of involvement,"" Ky said, referring to EASA approval of future U.S. designs. 
Analysts have said increased checks could slow certification of Boeing's upcoming 777X, while the FAA could retaliate by stepping up oversight of France-based Airbus.

(Reuters) - A semiconductor industry group on Monday called for a review of the Trump administration's export control policy, and urged the incoming U.S. Commerce Secretary to work with allies when curbing sales of U.S. technology to China for national security.
SEMI, which represents semiconductor equipment makers and device manufacturers worldwide, said the prior administration’s unilateral rules had made any potential benefit likely to be less effective over time, had unnecessarily hurt American industry, and had left U.S. exporters vulnerable to retaliation.
    In a letter to Gina Raimondo, secretary-designate of the U.S. Commerce Department, SEMI President Ajit Manocha said the United States should coordinate with allies whose companies compete in the global market.
    ""Multi-lateral controls - where items of concern are controlled by all major producing nations – create a level playing field, maximize effectiveness, and minimize harm to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness,"" Manocha said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. 
The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    Increasingly, Manocha noted, foreign competitors are marketing goods as ""free from U.S. export controls.""
    The letter criticizes the Trump administration for implementing rules with little public input and no clear overarching policy, and said the ""highly unusual process"" resulted in unintended consequences.
     It urged the Commerce Secretary-designate to quickly correct an August rule that expanded U.S. authority over foreign company sales to China's Huawei, which unintentionally affected some foreign-made semiconductor production and test equipment. 
     It also asked the Biden administration to promptly reduce the backlog of license applications, saying delays are de facto denials. 

     In addition, the letter said rules that restricted sales to over 100 entities the United States linked to the Chinese military went into effect without industry comment. The tech group suggested the United States work with nations like the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea to develop common objectives for restricting semiconductor technology to China.

LONDON (Reuters) - An EU forum for discussing financial services with Britain will be similar to what the United States has, and it must be in place before market access will be considered, the bloc's financial services chief said on Monday.
Britain's Brexit trade deal with the EU from Jan. 1 does not cover financial services, leaving its City of London financial center largely cut off from the EU.
Both sides are committed to creating a forum for financial regulatory cooperation by March, but talks have not started yet, the EU financial services commissioner told the European Parliament.
""What we envisage for this framework is similar to what we have with the United States, a voluntary structure to compare regulatory initiatives, exchange views on international developments and discuss equivalence related issues,"" Mairead McGuinness told the European Parliament.
U.S. and EU regulators took about four years just to agree on rules on cross-border derivatives.
Trading in euro shares has already left London, along with a chunk in swaps trading. That questions the value of any future EU access given that many banks and trading platforms from the UK have opened units in the bloc.
McGuinness said regulatory cooperation will not be about restoring market access that Britain has lost, nor will it constrain the EU's unilateral equivalence process.
Equivalence refers to EU access when Brussels deems a non-EU country's rules are similar enough to the bloc's.
""Once we agree on our working arrangements, we can turn to resuming our unilateral equivalence assessments... using the same criteria as with all third countries, including anti-money laundering and taxation cooperation,"" she said.
Britain plans to amend some EU rules.
""The United Kingdom intention to diverge requires a case-by-case discussion in each area. Equivalence and divergence are polar opposites,"" McGuinness said.

""I am optimistic that over time, through cooperation and trust, we will build a stable and balanced relationship with our UK friends.""

Shares of the video game retailer have doubled in a week. It is the most heavily shorted stock in the U.S, with more than 138% of its shares sold short, according to CNBC. GameStop shares gained more than 140% in morning trading on Monday and then fell, turning negative briefly. They were last up about 11% for the day.
Earlier this month, GameStop said  Chewy Inc  (NYSE:CHWY) co-founder and former CEO Ryan Cohen would join its board, fueling hope he would push for a change in strategy. That news forced fierce buying in the stock as hedge funds and other traders tried to cover their short bets. The shares are up 2,962% over one year.
On Monday, Telsey Advisory Group downgraded its rating on the shares to underperform from outperform, citing the sharp run-up.
""The sudden, sharp surge in GameStop's share price and valuation likely has been fueled by a short squeeze, given the high short interest, and, to a lesser degree, speculation by retail investors,"" the firm said.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",Time to pause? Wall St. grows wary of some stock bubbles,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street is abuzz about stock market bubbles as surges in the share prices of some loss-making firms, red-hot public markets and amateur investors chasing stocks at frothy valuations spark fears of a pullback.
A flood of money supply, ultra-low or zero interest rates and COVID-19 vaccine rollouts have sparked a 'buy everything' rally, helping world stocks add a whopping $33 trillion in value from their lows of last March.
The euphoria is evident in the small cap Russell 2000 index where its component companies with a negative operating profit outperformed the wider index by nearly 50 percentage points over the last year, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data showed.
""Pockets of the market have recently demonstrated investor behavior consistent with bubble-like sentiment,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts led by David Kostin wrote in a note.
Goldman noted the outperformance of negative earners was still a far cry from the 140 percentage points clocked during the dotcom boom of 1999-2000 and more in line with that of the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
While that might be of some comfort to investors, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) equity strategist Mislav Matejka expects ""hot"" areas of financial markets could be subject to bouts of profit taking which could spread to equity indices.
However, he said, those dips could be buying opportunities.
Stock valuations have soared to levels not seen since the early 2000s, but this has not caused investors major concern as interest rates are at record lows backed by pledges to keep them there until a recovery is firmly established.
For examples of these selective bubbles, look at electric vehicle-related stocks - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is up 8-fold and electric vehicle charging equipment maker Blink Charging by 2000% in the last 52 weeks, while an IPO index has surged 200% since last March versus a mere 57% for the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Elevated retail participation has contributed to soaring prices. Retail broker eToro told Reuters it registered more than 380,000 new users in the first 11 days of 2021. 
U.S. videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME)'s 50% jump on Monday, on top of 250% year-to-date, was attributed by traders to short-sellers quickly buying back into the stock to cover potential losses, defined as a short-squeeze, and retail investors piling in to benefit from the surge.
Ninety percent of the respondents in a recent survey by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said they saw price bubbles in some parts of markets, with a majority expecting Tesla to halve in value by the end of 2021.
BUBBLES DON’T BURST EASILY
However, not all the major banks see bubbles. 
""Everyone's asking us about bubbles... even the frothiest equity indices still lag well behind performance during previous bubbles,"" said Robert Buckland, Citi equity strategist.
For example, the S&P trades at 22 times 12-month forward earnings, below the peak of 25 times seen ahead of the dotcom crisis.
Citing premia over rock-bottom bond yields, Citi believes equity markets have a long way to go yet.
At just over 1%, the yield on the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Multiverse index of 10-year government and corporate bonds worldwide is the lowest in the 22-year history of the index - less than half the rate of just two years ago and compared with 6.2% at the height of the dotcom bubble.
A rollback of U.S. Federal Reserve easing is seen as a threat to markets but there is no signal of that yet from the central bank.
""Equity bubbles are not delicate,"" Buckland added.
""They don’t burst on the first hint of tightening from central banks. They are run-away trains that misallocate capital, reshape the investment industry and end careers. They take some stopping.""
What's more, for all the signs of speculative excess from hedge fund and investor sentiment surveys - cash stashed in money market funds or in household or corporate savings is still far higher than before the pandemic emerged.
""The picture is nuanced – heavy activity in certain stocks and options, but less extreme overall investment flows,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s cross-asset strategist Andrew Sheets told clients.

""Hedge funds appear optimistic, but many businesses and individuals are still keeping cash on the sidelines given the uncertainty.""

173,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",Foley-backed SPAC agrees to $7.3 billion deal with Blackstone's Alight,"By Anirban Sen and David French
(Reuters) - A blank-check firm backed by prominent investor Bill Foley has agreed to take Alight Solutions LLC, the U.S. benefits services provider owned by buyout firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX), public in a deal valued at $7.3 billion, the companies said on Monday.
Reuters was first to report on Sunday that special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp was nearing a deal with Alight.
Funding for the deal includes a so-called private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $1.55 billion. Alight's existing owners will retain a stake once it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ALIT"".
Foley Trasimene's shares rose 9.4% in premarket trading.
Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to businesses, including 70% of the Fortune 100 companies, in 188 countries, according to its website.
""It is deeply embedded in health, wealth and payroll with all of these large companies,"" said Foley, who will become Alight's chairman. ""This is a company which is the kind of classic utility that I love to invest in.""
Foley added he will advise Alight regarding its next growth phase, including boosting the percentage of its business done outside the United States from 10% today.
Alight Chief Executive Stephan Scholl said the deal would help the company offer its integrated platform of employee benefits to more clients.
With the pandemic causing severe economic dislocation, companies are being forced to cut costs as much as possible while also making benefits - especially around healthcare - easy to access. Outsourcing firms should benefit from this trend.
The deal comes after Blackstone and peer CVC Capital Partners said last month they would merge Paysafe Group with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II in a transaction that valued the payments processor at $9 billion.

Alight was advised by a bank group led by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and law firm Kirkland and Ellis, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Weil, Gotshal & Manges provided financial and legal assistance respectively to Foley Trasimene.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss luxury watchmaker Hublot, part of French group LVMH, expects sales to grow 15-20% in 2021, driven by China, after a difficult 2020 and a challenging start to the new year, its chief executive said on Monday.
Swiss watchmakers' sales slid last year as stores were affected by pandemic-related closures and as tourism, an important driver of luxury watch sales, collapsed.
Some companies which have a strong presence in mainland China have benefited from a rebound in demand, such as Richemont, which returned to growth in the final quarter of 2020.
""For Hublot, we expect 15-20% sales growth this year ... In China, we still have a lot of potential, we expect very strong growth of 30-50% there,"" CEO Ricardo Guadalupe told Reuters in a phone interview during LVMH watch week.
Guadalupe said sales growth in the final quarter had been better than in the third for Hublot, but also for LVMH's watch and jewellery business overall. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, is due to publish full-year results on Tuesday.
He said growth had come from mainland China, while Macau had also improved since October. Hong Kong was still difficult, due to the political situation, but Japan and the Middle East were doing well, he said. 
""Western Europe stays difficult due to the lack of tourists,"" Guadalupe said. Store closures related to COVID-19 restrictions are currently hitting sales in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
He said the brand was looking to further streamline its distribution network in the coming years, but would open four new stores in second-tier cities in China this year. 
A monitoring system helped Hublot to avoid excess stock build-up at retailers, but in some hard-hit areas, such as cruise ships, the brand was ready to take back unsold timepieces, Guadalupe said. 
Online sales of Hublot watches, which cost 18,000 euros ($21,864.60) on average, are still small and are expected to reach 2-3% of total sales this year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday in febrile mood, with signs of increasing investor mania in a handful of stocks while the broader market cooled off amid fears that U.S. and global growth estimates may have to be revised down due to lingering pandemic effects. 
By 9:55 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 177 points, or 0.6%, at 30,820 points. However, the S&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite posted a gain of 1.2%.
Early trading was dominated by what appeared to be driven by retail investor-driven surges in a number of stocks which had been driven to the verge of bankruptcy by the pandemic.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock surged another 39% after its 51% rise on Friday, when the momentum of buying generated by retail investors squeezed hedge fund Citron Research and other short-sellers. This victory over the skeptics appeared to encourage similar pile-ons in other stocks, despite evidence of their being in long-term decline long before the pandemic.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock soared 24% after the embattled movie theater operator said it had raised over $900 million in fresh debt and equity, a recapitalization that effectively removes any near-term threat of Chapter 11.
Finally, apparel retailer Express skyrocketed 73%, adding to gains it made after securing a liquidity lifeline earlier this month.
The moves epitomized the increasing influence of small-scale investors in a market that has become increasingly decentralized and - to some at least - democratized by technology. They were accompanied by widespread reports of retail brokerages experiencing problems due to what may have been extraordinarily heavy order flow. The service Downdetector said E*Trade, Vanguard, Robinhood, Merrill Lynch,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) and Vanguard users were all reporting problems. 
""A year ago, when I first described the latest investment craze as a ""flash mob"" with money I never imagined how accurate the phrase would become,"" said Financial Insyghts founder Peter Atwater via Twitter. ""It truly has become a parade through the mall. Friday it was GameStop and today it's AMC. So, tomorrow, do they all head to Macy's?""
Another stock making outsize gains was BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), which rose 40%. The software group and former maker of handheld devices recently settled an intellectual property dispute with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The current euphoria has been emboldened by confidence that the Federal Reserve and the new administration of President Joe Biden will keep liquidity easy, throwing money at efforts to contain the pandemic and its chilling effect on household spending. The Fed's policy-making committee meets this week and Chairman Jerome Powell will comment on its decisions at his press conference on Wednesday.
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 9.6% after it said that its vaccine appeared effective against new strains of the Covid-19 virus. It's still going to start work on modifications to address a particularly troublesome new strain first identified in South Africa. However, Merck, widely considered a leading force in immunology before the Covid-19 pandemic, fell 0.8% after saying it will abandon its experimental Covid drug following disappointing test results.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Death of diesel looms as carmakers accelerate to electric future,"By Gilles Guillaume
PARIS (Reuters) - The world's biggest diesel engine factory in Tremery, eastern France, is undergoing a radical overhaul - it's switching to make electric motors. 
From less than 10% of output in 2020, electric motor production at Tremery will double to around 180,000 in 2021, and is planned to reach 900,000 a year - or more than half the plant's peak pre-pandemic output - by 2025.
The shift is testament to a car industry in flux. Demand for diesel cars has slumped since a 2015 pollution scandal, while tough new EU regulations, which fine carmakers for exceeding emissions limits, are pushing them to make more electric models.
So, in the midst of a pandemic and with the level of consumer demand for battery-driven cars still uncertain, automakers from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to Nissan (OTC:NSANY) are ditching diesel models and ramping up output of electric drives. 
""2021 is going to be a pivotal year, the first real transition towards the world of electric models,"" said Laetitia Uzan, a representative for the CFTC union at Tremery.
But for Tremery's 3,000 workers, and the wider car industry, there's an added complication. 
Electric motors only have a fifth of the parts of a traditional diesel engine, putting a question mark over jobs. 
Uzan acknowledged a risk that fewer staff may be needed, but was optimistic that could happen ""quite naturally"" as workers retire without being replaced.
Tremery's owner Stellantis - newly created from the merger of Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler to help tackle the industry changes - has said it won't close factories and will seek to protect jobs.
But some industry researchers warn Europe's car manufacturers, already suffering from overcapacity, will have to make big cuts in order to deliver the investments needed to catch up with U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
French car lobby group PFA estimates 15,000 jobs linked to diesel are at risk in France, out of 400,000 employed by the industry as a whole.
IAB, a German labour research institute, calculates the arrival of electric vehicles could threaten 100,000 jobs in Germany, or about one in eight German auto industry jobs.
'UNPRECEDENTED YEAR'
The transition from diesel is particularly marked in Europe, where sales of diesel vehicles made up at least 50% of the total as recently as 2015, according to data from research group JATO Dynamics, far higher than in both North America and Asia. 
At least 20 car models will no longer offer diesel versions in 2021, from Volkswagen's Polo and  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s Scenic to Nissan's Micra and Honda's Civic, according to researchers IHS Markit, which says 2021 will be ""an unprecedented year"" in the shift away from diesel.
Meanwhile, a slew of new electric models will hit showrooms.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Britain's car lobby group, expects 29 new fully-electric and seven plug-in hybrid models will be launched in the country this year, compared with 26 internal combustion engine models - only 14 of which will have diesel variants.
There are encouraging signs that consumer interest in electric vehicles is picking up. 
In September, EU registrations of electrified vehicles - fully electric, plug-in hybrid or hybrid - overtook diesel registrations for the first time, according to JATO data. 
EU sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles surged 122% in the first nine months of 2020, at a time when overall vehicle sales fell 29% due to the pandemic. 
But they still only accounted for around 8% of total sales, with some drivers put off by the limited availability of charging points and higher cost of many electrified models. 
At Renault's Cleon plant near the northern French coast, the switch from diesel is well under way, with only half a building housing the assembly lines for diesel motors while hybrid and electric motors are spread over two whole buildings. 

""If an employee came back after several years away, they wouldn’t recognise the place,"" said Lionel Anglais, a union representative with oversight of manufacturing at Renault.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>","Online merchants linked to QAnon down, but not out, following platform bans","By Jeffrey Dastin, Sheila Dang and Anna Irrera
(Reuters) - Since last year, entrepreneur Dustin Krieger has faced bans by an expanding list of big tech companies: four blocked PayPal accounts, half a dozen Twitter deactivations, de-listed merchandise by Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and most recently Amazon's removal of his widely reviewed book promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.
But he's not giving up.
""We'll maintain our own presence everywhere we are allowed,"" Krieger, president of a Wyoming-registered company, told Reuters.
Technology firms including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), which have taken action against businesses peddling extremism in recent years, have come down hard after the deadly Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
Yet merchants like Krieger show how efforts to ""de-platform"" vendors, while lowering their revenues, have resulted in a game of whack-a-mole as individuals set up new accounts or shift to different sites, sometimes using cryptocurrency.
Krieger estimates he lost between $1 million to $2 million in sales from a crackdown that he said was being directed by a ""rabid leftist cancel culture mob,"" but he believes he can recover. ""The benefit of my business model is many legs to stand on, many patriots support one another and choose to shop patriot with our sponsors,"" he said over email. Krieger goes by ""Dustin Nemos"" on social media.
As of Sunday, Krieger's websites offered $19.99 ""Sleepy Joe"" sleep aids that refer derisively to President Joe Biden and a $15.45 per month ground coffee subscription named after the so-called ""Great Awakening"" linked to the QAnon theory, which claims Trump secretly fought a cabal of child-sex predators including Hollywood figures and prominent Democrats. Visitors can pay for some items through Visa (NYSE:V) Inc-owned Authorize.net using major credit card networks.
A Visa spokesman said, ""We are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on our network, and we require our affiliate banks to review their merchants' compliance with our standards.""
DE-PLATFORMING
While it is difficult to estimate how much far-right and fringe causes earn in the United States, experts who study extremist groups say it can add up to big business.
Following the Capitol riot, Stripe suspended payment processing for Trump's campaign website. Reuters found that Trump merchandise sales on top e-commerce platforms and the president's campaign site, as well as supporters' fundraising to maintain billboards and fly aerial banners over cities, have garnered about $30 million in the past year, according to data from web analytics firm SimilarWeb and studies from several researchers.
Last year, fringe groups in particular generated at least $2 million according to researcher findings and an estimate of e-commerce sales. This included over $150,000 crowdfunded by an author under the name Neon Revolt to publish a QAnon book. Also included were $559,000 in bitcoin payments to individuals or organizations that promote extreme right views, according to data from Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm. Bitcoin payments have reached $17,400 in 2021 so far, Elliptic said.
Amazon confirmed its removal of the QAnon products and declined further comment. EBay and PayPal likewise said they take action against merchants that promote violence per company policies.
The ""de-platforming"" after the Capitol raid and a retreat to less popular forms of payment like bitcoin will severely hamper fundraising, said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate.
Since Amazon recently removed 32 items sold by Florida-based MericaWear, its owner Andrew Arnold has considered quitting the business. A black Tee promoting the QAnon conspiracy was a best-seller, and Shopify required takedowns of QAnon goods from MericaWear’s website as well, he said.
""The unfair targeting of MericaWear has proven to be an economic calamity,"" Arnold told Reuters in written statements, estimating $10,000 of losses. 
As of Sunday, Reuters was able to prepare orders of Trump hoodies costing $17.76 each with his site. The price reflected the year of the United States' founding.
'RE-MONETIZE'
Others have survived by hunting for new ""unexploited"" platforms such as niche crowdfunding sites before potential bans by mainstream services and payment processors, said Mark Pitcavage, an expert at the Anti-Defamation League who studies right-wing extremism.
Though more rare, Pitcavage said some groups require membership dues to maintain consistent revenue, such as the Oath Keepers militia movement. Several of its members have been criminally charged after the Capitol siege.
Even when far-right personalities are booted off tech platforms, some have turned to alternative technology companies to skirt bans, said Megan Squire, a professor at Elon University who studies online extremism.
For instance, Nicholas Fuentes, a commentator who has voiced anti-Semitic views and hosts a show every weeknight, has used third-party websites including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Github to continue live-streaming on various YouTube channels in recent days, despite a ban on his own channel by the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc streaming service in February, Squire said.
Software from Entropy, which bills itself as ""creative streaming solutions in an era of mass censorship,"" lets Fuentes and other content creators who were blocked from earning money on YouTube continue receiving donations from their videos, Squire said. Entropy's website says it processes the transactions and takes a smaller cut of the money than YouTube does; however, it is unclear how much creators are earning.
When asked about Fuentes' use of Github, the software development platform said in a statement, ""We suspended user accounts ... that replicated activity that had been removed from other platforms for inciting violence.""
Fuentes did not respond to requests for comment through his website, which also marketed ""America First"" merchandise. YouTube said it had terminated multiple accounts trying to stream Fuentes' content, while Entropy representatives did not answer a request for comment.
Squire said she observed Fuentes on YouTube each night this past week, and that YouTube took down the channels after she reported them.

""The game of whack-a-mole continues,"" she said.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. goal to squeeze more COVID shots from Pfizer vials hampered by syringe production,"By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - The world's largest syringe maker does not have the capacity to substantially increase U.S. supplies of specialty syringes needed to squeeze more doses from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) COVID-19 vaccine vials in the coming weeks, an executive said in an interview. 
The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, one of two authorized for U.S. emergency use, is shipped in vials initially indicated to hold five doses. Six doses can be drawn with special syringes, called low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use. 
If healthcare providers can reliably extract the sixth dose it would allow supplies to be stretched 20% further and could be a financial boost for Pfizer, which is paid per dose. 
The U.S. government has begun giving healthcare providers new syringe kits to extract six shots from each vial. It said that three of the low dead space syringes in each six-needle kit would allow extraction, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. A CDC spokeswoman said the new kits would contain a ""majority"" of low dead space syringes.
Syringe maker Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) has contracted with the U.S. government to provide 286 million syringes for use with COVID-19 vaccines, including around 40 million low dead space syringes, and is fully prepared to deliver on that agreement, said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company's senior director of public relations. 
Low dead space syringes are a niche product and Becton Dickinson had not discussed plans with the U.S. government to substantially boost their output when they began preparing for the vaccine rollout last year, he said. 
""We are ready to support the U.S. government but we are trying to make sure everyone understands that those devices are not something we have infinite capacity to produce and bringing up new lines does take time,"" Kirkpatrick said. 
The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company is the largest syringe and needle maker in the world, according to 360iResearch, and Kirkpatrick said it has boosted overall production capacity by about 1 billion syringes for 2021, with most of the capacity allocated.
A new production line for syringes will be functional by July but was not designed to produce additional low dead space syringes, he said.
The federal government has contracts with other manufacturers, and it was not immediately clear whether they could supply more of the specialty syringes.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal organizer of the vaccination drive, told providers in an email reviewed by Reuters it has started giving healthcare providers packages including both types of needles. 
The email said early testing showed that three low dead space syringes used in combination with three standard syringes may yield the sixth dose. 
""Every effort is being made to reconfigure the ancillary kits with syringes that enable the six dose draw without impacting the availability or slowing the delivery of supplies to jurisdictions,"" the email said. 
President Joe Biden has described the vaccine rollout so far as a ""dismal failure"" and said he will use wartime powers to secure more supplies for the campaign, including low dead space syringes, but experts say that such efforts will still run up against production constraints.
Healthcare distributor McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) is responsible for assembling the accompanying kits of vaccination supplies, including syringes, that are paired with each tray of Pfizer vaccines. The supplies themselves are procured by the U.S. government. 

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which makes the other vaccine authorized for use in the United States, says it puts 10 doses in each of its vials, but New York State public health officials have said providers can extract 11 doses.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Huawei in talks to sell premium smartphone brands P and Mate - sources,"By Julie Zhu, Yingzhi Yang and David Kirton
(Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is in early-stage talks to sell its premium smartphone brands P and Mate, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, a move that could see the company eventually exit from the high-end smartphone-making business. 
The talks between the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker and a consortium led by Shanghai government-backed investment firms have been going on for months, the people said, declining to be identified as the discussions were confidential. 
Huawei started to internally explore the possibility of selling the brands as early as last September, according to one of the sources. The two sources were not privy to the valuation placed on the brands by Huawei.
Shipments of Mate and P Series phones were worth $39.7 billion between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, according to consultancy IDC.
However, Huawei has yet to make a final decision on the sale and the talks might not conclude successfully, according to the two sources, as the company is still trying to manufacture at home its in-house designed high-end Kirin chips which power its smartphones.
""Huawei has learned there are unsubstantiated rumours circulating regarding the possible sale of our flagship smartphone brands,"" a Huawei spokesman said. ""There is no merit to these rumours whatsoever. Huawei has no such plan.""
The Shanghai government said it was not aware of the situation and declined to comment further. 
The potential sale of Huawei's premium smartphone lines suggests the company has little hope that the new Biden administration will have a change of heart towards the supply chain restrictions placed on Huawei since May 2019, the two people said.
The Shanghai government-backed investment firms may form a consortium with Huawei's dealers to take over the P and Mate brands, according to the second person, a similar model to the Honor deal. Huawei is also likely to keep its existing P& Mate management team for the new entity, if the deal goes through, the two people said.
OVERCOMING U.S. CURBS 
Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment vendor and No.2 smartphone maker, last November announced the sale of its budget phone brand Honor to a consortium of 30 dealers led by a company backed by the Shenzhen government. 
The second source said the all-cash sale fetched more than 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion). Honor declined to comment.
The Honor sale was aimed at keeping the budget brand alive, as sanctions slapped on Huawei by the United States had hampered the unit's supply chain and cut off the company's access to key hardware like chips and software such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Mobile Services.
Huawei may have a similar objective in pursuing the sale of the mobile brands. The two sources said that Huawei's latest plans for the two high-end brands were motivated by insufficient chip supplies. 
Washington says that Huawei is a national security threat, which Huawei has repeatedly denied. 
On Friday, Honor indicated that the goal of the spin-off had been reached by announcing it had formed partnerships with chip makers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and launched a new phone.
Last year, the company's Consumer Business Group Chief Executive Richard Yu said U.S. restrictions meant Huawei would soon stop making Kirin chips. Analysts expect its stockpile of the chips to run out this year.
Huawei’s HiSilicon division relies on software from U.S. companies such as Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems Inc or Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) Inc to design its chips and it outsources the production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which uses equipment from U.S. companies.
The P and Mate phone series are among the top players in the higher-end smartphone market in China and compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp's Mi and Mix series and OPPO's Find series. 
The two brands contributed nearly 40% to Huawei's total sales over the third quarter of 2020, according to market research firm Counterpoint. 
Analysts have already noted recent insufficient supplies of the flagship P40 and Mate40 series due to a severe components shortage. 

""We expect a continuous decline in sales of P and Mate series smartphones through Q1 2021,"" said Flora Tang, an analyst at Counterpoint.

In a statement Altroconsumo said it was asking for damages of 60 million euros ($73 million) on behalf of Italian consumers tricked by the practice which had also been recognised by Italian authorities.
Altroconsumo said the lawsuit covers owners of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, sales of which in Italy totalled some 1 million phones between 2014 and 2020.
Apple said in an email that it had never done anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades. 
Two similar lawsuits against Apple have been filed in Belgium and Spain for the planned obsolescence of iPhones.

European consumer association Euroconsumers, which is coordinating the three lawsuits, said it was also planning to launch a class action in Portugal in the coming weeks.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>","U.S. corporate buybacks are on the rise, lifting investor hopes","By Caroline Valetkevitch and Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate share buyback levels are slowly increasing after last year's pandemic-driven drop-off in spending, and investors are eager to see how much buybacks may support market gains. 
Buybacks are not likely to return this year to pre-pandemic levels, but recent buyback talk from companies has lifted investor hopes that repurchase trends have turned the corner, thanks to optimism over the rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) last week said it would explore returning excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks, and investors have cheered recent buyback announcements from some big investment banks.
""Companies are starting to put their foot back in the water,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""That's a good sign, ... it means cash flow is available.""
S&P Dow Jones Indices projects share repurchases for S&P 500 companies to have totaled about $116 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, up from $102 billion in the third quarter.
That's still far below the $182 billion in the 2019 fourth quarter, and the record $223 billion in the last quarter of 2018. S&P 500 buybacks are projected to rise to $651 billion in 2021 from an estimated $505 billion last year, based on S&P's data.
Looking at buyback announcements from companies listed on U.S. exchanges, TrimTabs Research said U.S. companies became more bullish toward the end of last year and buyback announcements hit a 15-month high of $88.4 billion in December.
S&P 500 share buybacks reached a peak of $806 billion in 2018, according to S&P, when massive tax breaks for U.S. companies boosted cash levels. 
Share repurchases are often cited as a key support for U.S. stocks, and investors are weighing the potential for support with U.S. stocks already at record highs this year. Buybacks decrease the number of a company's shares outstanding, boosting per share earnings and driving down the price-to-earnings ratio, a key benchmark.
""With the market being as expensive as it seems, share repurchases could drive the market that much higher,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. 
""It adds to the Street's belief that there's an underlying bid, we're not in this alone, and someone else is going to support the stock and that's the company,"" he said. ""It turns out to be a good thing for share prices. But they run the risk of overvaluing stocks, and it speaks to the broader question about why companies are doing it.""
In his firm's 2021 outlook, David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP), said the firm's base case is for corporate stock buybacks to gradually increase through 2021, while a more favorable scenario would be for buybacks to ""accelerate back to pre-pandemic levels.""
Banks in particular have come into the spotlight.
Following the Federal Reserve's second ""stress test"" of banks for 2020 - which measures banks' financial health and determines if they have sufficient reserves to protect against losses - the Fed in December relaxed restrictions on buybacks. That was quickly followed by announcements from some large firms, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), that they planned to buy back stock beginning in 2021. 
JPMorgan's board authorized a share repurchase program of $30 billion. 
The S&P 500 Buyback index has tripled in value since the end of the global financial crisis, and its rebound from the pandemic recession was as abrupt as its plunge.
Graphic: SP buyback index and GDP - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwvkyjlqvm/buyback.png

Silverblatt said not all industries will be prepared to increase buybacks at this point, most notably hotel, entertainment and other industries that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Investor payouts and job cuts jar with U.S. companies' social pledge,"By Jessica DiNapoli, Ross Kerber and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - When Randall Stephenson joined 180 of his peers leading many of the richest U.S. companies in signing the Business Roundtable pledge on the ""purpose of a corporation"" in August 2019, the then-chief of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) promised to look out for the interests of all the wireless carrier's stakeholders, not just shareholders. 
Two months later, the Dallas-based company outlined a plan for cost reductions that also prioritized dividends and stock buybacks for shareholders, succumbing to pressure from $41 billion hedge fund Elliott Investment Management LP. 
Activist investor Elliott had said its proposals would deliver ""substantial benefits"" for shareholders, consumers and employees, but not everybody came out ahead.
By the end of September 2020, AT&T had eliminated 23,000 positions, or about 9% of its workforce, many of them during the pandemic. Already one of the corporate world's top dividend payers with $14.9 billion spent in 2019, AT&T raised its common dividend by 2% and bought back $7.5 billion of its stock.
""We are the face of AT&T and we go out of our way to help customers communicate with their families,"" said Darren Miller, a 35-year-old technician whose job was cut last July. ""But we are a dime a dozen to them. If they can get someone cheaper to do the job, they will do it.""
Miller, who worked in Reseda, California, said he accepted a buyout offer after managers told him he might be laid off later on less generous terms, something he said his local union representatives told him happened to dozens of other employees in the state.
AT&T spokesman Jim Kimberly said most of the workforce reductions ""were from voluntary departure offers and attrition"" and declined to comment on individual cases. He added the company had for years practiced a ""meaningful commitment to all stakeholders"" through programs that include worker retraining and environmental and social justice efforts.
Elliott declined to comment.
Some advocates of a socially-minded stakeholder capitalism say AT&T's case is representative of the hurdles they face in challenging the leverage investors have over U.S. companies.
The voluntary governance pledge signed by the CEOs didn't spell out specific actions, but had the stated aim of moving away from ""shareholder primacy"". https://s3.amazonaws.com/brt.org/BRT-StatementonthePurposeofaCorporationOctober2020.pdf
Yet while signatories subsequently reduced payouts to shareholders as companies put away cash to shield themselves from the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, they still give a greater share to investors than those companies that did not sign the pledge, according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by financial information provider Refinitiv.
The analysis found that the 171 publicly traded companies that signed the pledge returned a median 60% of net income to shareholders during the first three quarters of 2020 through dividends and buybacks, versus a 50% return among the 355 S&P 500 firms that did not sign the statement.
By comparison, in the first three quarters of 2019, the signatories returned a median 73% of net income to shareholders versus a 68% return among the firms that did not sign the pledge, the analysis found.
Tim Gaumer, Refinitiv's director of fundamental research, said pledge signatories returned more to investors because they had the ability to do so. ""It is easier to pay out dividends and buybacks with confidence if your income stream is less volatile,"" he added. 
Business Roundtable spokeswoman Jessica Boulanger said the analysis didn't account for how companies spent money they did not return to shareholders, nor for ""industry differences, company size and longevity and trends in shareholder returns over time."" She added that signatories had upheld their commitment to work for all stakeholders.

Graphic: Roundtable signatory dividends hold up Roundtable signatory dividends hold up - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-CORPORATIONS/STAKEHOLDERS/qzjpqmqaxpx/chart.png
'SIGNALING EXERCISE'
The CEOs signed the pledge without legally binding their companies and largely without approval from their boards. COVID-19 stress-tested their commitments, as large swathes of the economy were forced to shut down. 
The pledge's lack of detail gave signatories wide discretion in deciding how the pandemic pain would be spread among shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. 
""It's a political signaling exercise that doesn't mean very much,"" said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried, who is on the research advisory council of Glass, Lewis & Co which advises investors over how to vote on corporate governance. 
Defenders of the Business Roundtable pledge say many contributions to society cannot be measured as easily as shareholder spending or layoffs. For example,  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co pledged $30 billion to address racial injustices, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched a $100 million diversity drive. 
Indeed, some signatories have won praise from progressive-leaning organizations for standing by employees during the pandemic. 
Among them,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in July from $13, which was already well above the $7.25 national level. 
Some executives and investors argue that unless companies are attractive to shareholders and keep their stock highly valued, they won't have the money to invest in their businesses for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
""If you don't have access to capital, then you're not going to be around long enough to face tough societal issues like climate change,"" said Todd Ahlsten, chief investment officer for Parnassus Investments, a San Francisco-based firm with $40 billion under management.
EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION
Less than two years after the signing of the pledge, key protagonists at AT&T moved on. Stephenson passed the reins to a successor, and Elliott sold what was once a $3.2 billion stake in the company. 
AT&T's layoffs during the pandemic attracted the attention of Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who wrote to the company last July objecting to ""corporations using the pandemic as justification for continuing to make anti-worker decisions that are aimed at boosting share price.""
""The long-term interests of our communities and employees cannot be met without attracting investor capital,"" AT&T executive vice president Timothy McKone responded in a letter.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group Inc, whose CEOs also signed up to the pledge, were among the AT&T investors who voted down a proposal last April to have an employee representative on the company's board - a step its advocates argued would give stakeholders a voice. Both fund managers declined to comment.
SPENDING ON SHAREHOLDERS
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania researchers found that among signatories, the bigger share of profits companies subsequently returned to investors, the more likely they were to announce layoffs and furloughs. 
A study from the London School of Economics and Columbia University found signatories violated environmental and labor-related rules and paid their CEOs more than similarly-sized peers. 
Like AT&T, some companies that signed up continued payouts to shareholders even as they cut jobs during the pandemic. 
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) bought back $800 million of its shares during the three months ended Oct. 24, 2020. The network equipment maker had announced a restructuring plan in August to cut $1 billion in costs annually, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. 
""Cisco believes in the Business Roundtable pledge balancing the needs of all of our stakeholders and fulfilling our own company's purpose of powering a more inclusive future for all,"" the company said in a statement.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc repurchased $522 million of its shares from April through July. That month, the pharmacy operator cut 4,000 jobs, some 7% of its headcount, bumped up its dividend and nixed its stock buyback program.
Walgreens did not respond to a request for comment.
The chairman of the Business Roundtable, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc CEO Doug McMillon, downplayed the significance of the pledge in remarks to investors last February. He said ""it didn't feel like news"" because companies sought to balance the interests of all stakeholders anyway, and that ""of course, our shareholders are our priority.""

Walmart declined to make McMillon available for an interview. A company spokeswoman pointed to McMillon's previous comments on multi-stakeholder capitalism being ""the answer to addressing our challenges holistically.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Furniture giant IKEA said it is on track to cut its emissions further after an 11% reduction in its climate footprint in the 12 months to the end of August, partly because of temporary store closures.
Brand owner Inter IKEA said on Monday carbon emissions throughout the value chain - from the production of raw materials to customers' use and disposal - fell in its fiscal year (FY) 2020 to 21.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
The reduction per euro of retail sales - a measure that takes into account that government lockdowns meant most stores closed for several weeks - was 7%.
""Our expectation is that the trend that we started already in FY19 and continued in FY20 will also continue in FY21,"" Inter IKEA Chief Executive Jon Abrahamsson said in an interview.
""Looking at CO2 emissions divided by sales we do believe we will have a positive development compared to 2020.""
Head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac told Reuters the main contributors, beside the pandemic, to curbing emissions were more energy efficient lighting and appliances, followed by more renewable energy use in production and transport.
IKEA, whose emissions shrank for the first time in 2019, aims to be climate positive - to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than the value chain emits - by 2030. It said on Monday that translates into a cut of at least 15% from baseline year 2016 to 20.4 million tonnes CO2 equivalents. 
IKEA said in fiscal 2020 it reached its target that more than 98% of wood in its products be from responsibly managed forests - as certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) - or recycled. It launched a new target that at least a third of wood be recycled by 2030, up from 12% last year.

IKEA, one of the world's biggest wood buyers, in the year used 19 million cubic metres of wood in products and packaging.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen trading in a mixed fashion Monday, with the tech sector in focus ahead of a busy week of corporate earnings and a Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 41 points, or 0.1%, but S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 114 points, or 0.9%. 
This week is the busiest of the corporate season to date, with more than one-fifth of the S&P 500 index and a third of Dow Jones Industrial Average components scheduled to release earnings this week. The tech sector will be the primary focus, and expectations are running high.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports after the close on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a day later. The results could push the combined market cap of the FAANGs - Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - back above their all-time peak of $6.16 trillion.
Monday is comparatively quiet, with only  Kimberly Clark  (NYSE:KMB) of any note set to update.
All three main cash indices posted a gain for the week last week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its fifth positive week in six while the S&P 500 posted its third positive week in four. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its best week since November and fifth positive week in six.
One of the key drivers of these gains have been the idea that a Democrat sweep of Congress (and the White House) would lead to additional fiscal stimulus. Investors are still confident that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal will get through, to a large degree, despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers and the formal start of Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial.
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States has crossed 25 million, with approaching 420,000 fatalities, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. 
However, despite these numbers, there has been some positive virus-related news. The U.S. has administered over 20.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Saturday morning, while the hard-hit state of California is expected to lift its stay-at-home orders later Monday.
Also of note this week will be the latest get together of the Federal Reserve, with the two-day meeting set to conclude on Wednesday. The central bank is not expected to make any policy changes, and is likely to reiterate that the economy is still far from its goals of full employment and 2% inflation.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, rebounding from Friday’s losses on the back of a surprise rise in U.S. inventories by 4.4 million barrels in the week to Jan. 15, versus expectations for a small draw.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $52.31 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $55.33. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,860.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2154.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - For Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Verily, a healthcare venture that is one the tech giant's most prominent ""other bets,"" the coronavirus pandemic offered an immediate business opportunity.
Starting last February, the company shifted many of its about 1,000 employees to developing software for governments and employers to manage coronavirus testing. 
It quickly landed major customers including the state of California, which records show paid Verily $49.6 million to use its Baseline software to schedule virus tests.
Smaller deals included a previously unreported $3.1 million grant from the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to operate California testing sites.
Verily executives said the pandemic work was a chance to demonstrate the company's capabilities, and attract new customers. 
""The conversations are naturally flowing in that way,"" said Dr. Jessica Mega, Verily's chief medical and scientific officer.
Critics say the effort has been another distraction for Verily, which has bounced between dozens of projects without producing a stable revenue stream. The venture has drawn more than $1.8 billion in funding from Alphabet and outside investors including private equity firm Silver Lake.
Converting temporary buyers into long-term clients may be wishful thinking, four industry analysts said.
Two former executives and a current employee criticized the company for taking on another one-off opportunity instead of focusing on attracting recurring subscribers to its software for clinical research, disease management and other tasks. 
""I don't think COVID will give them significant tailwinds,"" said one of the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Chief Executive Andy Conrad has told employees Verily is driving toward an initial public offering, and more consistent sales would be essential for a successful Wall Street debut.
Verily's overall sales are not disclosed by Alphabet. Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey estimated 2020 ""other bets"" overall revenue at about $650 million, with Verily contributing under $175 million. The former executives described Verily's actual revenue as higher, and another analyst suggested $200 million to $300 million as more realistic.
'WE HAD TO HELP'
Spun out of Google in 2015, Verily develops devices and software aimed at improving data collection, treatment, research and patient care. 
It has enjoyed bursts of revenue from collaborations with healthcare companies, including work with DexCom Inc on a miniaturized blood glucose monitor and a scuttled, high-profile experiment with Alcon (NYSE:ALC) AG to create a smart contact lens for similar measurements.
But Verily's financial future hinges on software products led by Baseline, which helps drugmakers enroll participants for clinical trials and analyze study data. It aims to reduce paperwork and site visits compared with traditional methods.
Mega said the company refashioned Baseline to schedule coronavirus tests after governments such as California started asking for help. The software also powers scheduling for 460 Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp pharmacies, which provide testing as part of a partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services.
Baseline enabled about 2 million people to get tests nationwide last year, she said, a fraction of the 250 million administered overall. 
Dr. Vivian Lee, Verily's president of health platforms, said government COVID-19 projects helped jumpstart separate testing software dubbed Healthy at Work and Healthy at School.
The new tools have 20 customers between them, including Brown University and some biotech companies, Verily said. The University of Alabama, Birmingham has spent $6.9 million on Healthy at School, according to previously unreported records. 
Ralph Zottola, an assistant vice president at the university, said it is considering Verily for software to validate whether students have been vaccinated because the company has been ""a good partner."" 
When the need for coronavirus testing software ends, Verily aims to transition some new customers to Onduo, one of its core offerings alongside Baseline. The program includes sensors, diet coaching and other personalized tools that insurers and employers can provide for managing chronic diseases and general wellness.
Onduo counts Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and insurers such as CareFirst as customers.
Still, both Onduo and Baseline remain very small players in medical software markets researchers say are worth over $100 billion in the United States annually, and some larger rivals like Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc's Livongo and Omada Health Inc did not divert resources to the pandemic last year.
Livongo, which directly competes with Onduo, reported sales more than doubled to $267 million during the first three quarters of 2020 compared with same period a year earlier. 
Mega defended Verily's moves during the greatest public health crisis in a century.

""Across the company, we've raised our hands,"" she said. ""There was an opportunity, we had to help, but it's accelerating our core business.""

190,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Congressional Democrats face challenges in repealing Wall Street-friendly rules,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Democrats controlling the Senate, progressives want to repeal the Trump administration's Wall Street-friendly rules, but they may struggle to win enough votes in a thinly divided Congress and risk obstructing President Joe Biden's agencies from writing stricter new rules, said lobbyists and legal experts.
Sherrod Brown, expected chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said this month he was drawing up a list of rules passed by Trump regulators that he hopes to kill using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), a 1996 law that allows Congress to reverse recently finalized federal regulations.
Since 2017, regulators have eased dozens of rules created following the 2009 financial crisis and in the decades before, arguing they were outdated and stymied economic growth. Liberals say the changes saved Wall Street tens of billions of dollars while increasing systemic risks and hurting consumers. 
Reversing rules through an agency's internal process can take years whereas the CRA allows Congress to swiftly kill rules with a simple majority and the president's approval. 
Democrats, who already led the House of Representatives, on Wednesday took working control of the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote.
But with such a wafer-thin margin, Brown may struggle to win vital support from moderate Democrats, especially from those whom have publicly supported similar rule-changes in the past.
Several centrists, for example, voted for a 2018 law easing post-crisis banking rules and have backed bills containing rules similar to those implemented in 2020 by the securities regulator which critics say muzzle shareholders.
""It's a lot harder than people think to get something changed via the Congressional Review Act, particularly with thin majorities,"" said Paul Merski, an executive at the Independent Community Bankers (NASDAQ:ESXB) of Americas who lobbied in 2017 to reverse a rule banning forced arbitration via the CRA. 
Issues related to bank capital requirements and liquidity may be too arcane to compete for limited Senate floor time with healthcare, labor and immigration measures, said Gregg Gelzinis, a senior policy analyst at liberal Washington think tank the Center for American Progress, which is discussing CRA issues with lawmakers.
""That education process is underway now to feel out which of these rules can get unanimous support in the caucus,"" he said. 
Potential candidates could include a December rule relaxation that allows banks to hold more risky deposits, and a rule which could force banks to lend to contentious sectors, such as fossil fuel companies, said Gelzinis. See FACTBOX. 
Brown's office said it will consult with Biden's new regulators on which rules the agencies can fix and which would require congressional action. His office did not identify specific rules, but flagged those which ""gutted fair housing protections, undermined state consumer protection laws, and threatened"" financial stability. 
Cam Fine, a seasoned lobbyist and CEO of Washington consultancy Calvert Advisors, said recent consumer finance rules which progressives say do more harm than good would be savvy political targets, as Democrats generally agree on the need to boost consumer protections. 
""Brown would be more successful if he employed the CRA on consumer-focused issues - I think that's where he could unite his caucus,"" he added. 
NOVEL TERRITORY
The CRA allows a new Congress to reverse rules passed during the final 60 working days of the previous Congress.
Before Trump took office pledging to slash red tape, the CRA had been used successfully once. Republicans subsequently used it to reverse 16 rules created by Barack Obama administration regulators, according to Daniel Perez, senior policy analyst at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center.
Democrats, however, have never successfully used the CRA, according to Perez, and may veer into novel legal territory where their ultimate goal is to make rules tougher rather than scrap them. That's because once a rule is reversed using the CRA, agencies cannot write a ""substantially"" similar rule. 
While that is a vague provision that has never been tested, agencies have generally avoided revisiting rules Congress has overturned, said Perez.
""Where perhaps Democrats might want to do something more stringent, I think that might give them pause,"" he said. 
Navigating this provision is part of the discussions, said Gelzinis. Progressives may want to rewrite some rules but could risk legal challenges arguing the rule is substantially similar.

""The overall guiding principle here is what is the most efficient way to undo this universe of Trump harms,"" he said.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>","Global life insurers impose restrictions, worried about long-term pandemic risks","By Suzanne Barlyn, Carolyn Cohn and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Global life insurers are taking steps to curb payouts stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, including long-term health consequences that are not fully understood, industry sources told Reuters.
Life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), and  Aviva  (LON:AV) PLC, are now imposing waiting periods before COVID-19 patients, including those who have recovered, can apply for coverage, executives and spokespeople said. Some are also limiting coverage for certain age groups.
These changes come as some reinsurers demand new safeguards from life insurers they backstop, and as the industry struggles to ascertain the extent of problems caused by the novel coronavirus. 
COVID-19 has killed over 2.1 million people globally and infected nearly 100 million, according to a Reuters tally. (https://tmsnrt.rs/39Qa1d2)
Some victims suffer long-term consequences including severe respiratory problems, organ damage, circulatory impairment and chronic fatigue. Three weeks after recovery, 10% of COVID-19 patients are still unwell and up to 5% feel sick for months, according to scientists at King's College London.
The pandemic has also caused a mental-health crisis for those who could not say goodbye to loved ones or have been isolated for months, while exacerbating substance-abuse issues for others.
It is too early to know how many people will file claims for death, long-term illness or disability as a result, but insurers worry the consequences could last for decades.
""We have attempted as a company to strategize about modeling this and have made some headway but are far from the crystal ball that is able to predict this,"" said Dr. Paulo Bandeira Pinho, chief medical director of Optimum Re Insurance Co.
Optimum has met with life-insurer customers, including Prudential Financial, to map out long-term risks and possible financial impacts.
Prudential (NYSE:PUK) now imposes a minimum 30-day waiting period for recovered COVID-19 patients.
""Ultimately, many of the long-term implications of the pandemic are still unknown,"" said Prudential's Vice President of Operations Keith Bexell. ""As the long-tail effects become better understood, our approach to underwriting may adjust as necessary.""
Since April, British life insurer LV= has postponed applications from anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19, experienced symptoms or lived with someone who got sick, according to an underwriting policy on its website.
Aviva PLC also imposes a ""short"" delay for those who had COVID-19 or similar symptoms during the past 30 days, a spokesperson said.
VACCINE HOPES
Life insurers are in the business of hedging risks decades in advance. Since the start of the pandemic, the industry has said it would probably not cause major financial damage, partly because they were not seeing a swell of claims.
Global data are not available for 2020. In the United States, 8% of reported group life insurance claims from April to August attributed the cause of death to COVID-19, according to the U.S. Society of Actuaries.
Companies told Reuters the impact so far has been minimal – with LV= seeing COVID-19 affect just 2% of applications and Aviva still covering more than 9 in 10 customers – but they are taking precautionary steps anyway because of long-term risks.
Apart from those who had the disease, Optimum Re’s Pinho worries about a ""wave of widows and widowers, children and parents"" with shortened lifespans.
Plus, the pandemic reduced preventative health screenings, causing another set of risks, said Chris Behling, SwissRe's head of life and health underwriting for the Americas.
However, it is not all doom and gloom. Insurers expect vaccines to dramatically improve assumptions.
Some also pointed to better mortality statistics in countries that imposed tight restrictions on travel and socializing, as well as a study from Britain's Institute and Faculty of Actuaries that suggested surviving populations may have a higher life expectancy.
And, if insurers become too stingy with coverage, they may lose valuable customers.
For instance, LV= is excluding mental-health issues from some policies that cover critical illness and income protection for up to 12 months, said Justin Harper, the company's head of marketing.

""It's probably the appropriate decision to make, given we're trying to balance the access but also the risk management,"" Harper said.

192,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Boohoo Signals Expansion Beyond Fashion With Debenhams Move,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Online retailer Boohoo.com (OTC:BHOOY) signaled it's moving beyond its historic roots in fast-fashion by buying up the brand rights to the collapsed high-street chain Debenhams. 
The acquisition, for 55 million pounds ($75 million) greatly expands its footprint and propels it into segments that have thrived during the pandemic: sport and homeware.  A bit of exercise gear and some new cushions are just the thing to banish the blues when lockdown leaves you all dressed up with nowhere to go, after all.
JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports (LON:JD) and Dunelm (OTC:DNLMY), proxies for Boohoo's two new segments, may not have done quite as well over the last year as online fashion, but they have still held their value: JD stock is down only 2.7% from a year ago, while Dunelm (LON:DNLM) is up 1%, stoutly defending gains over 80% made over the previous two years. Both stocks edged lower on Monday, after a weekend that the U.K. spent talking about tightening its borders and fretting about its infection rate, even though new case numbers are falling sharply and the rollout of vaccines is proceeding reasonably quickly.   
Boohoo styled the acquisition 'transformative' in its statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday, but in some ways it merely builds on a precedent that the company had already set, having bought a suite of brands out of bankruptcy over the last couple of years. 
Not only that, but the group had once again resisted an opportunity to get into physical, brick-and-mortar retailing, passing up the opportunity to take on any of Debenhams' branch leases. The read-across for retail landlords is not encouraging.  Hammerson  (LON:HMSO) stock - an extreme proxy for the sector - fell 2.9%. 
Diversification is coming at the right time for Boohoo, which still hasn't shaken off the negative publicity around its supply chain issues.  A broader business will dilute the overall reliance on immigrant-staffed sweatshops in the English Midlands, ensuring alternative streams of revenue and allowing it to shut down the most problematic cases. The stock has struggled since its last update on that issue, which showed how sensitive investors are to legal liability risks. 
Boohoo wasn't alone in feasting on the carcass of the British high street sector on Monday. Its big rival ASOS (OTC:ASOMY) also confirmed that it's in exclusive talks to buy the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands from the administrators of Philip Green's collapsed Arcardia empire. Here again, there was - conspicuously - no talk of taking over any physical leases. Even the charms of TopShop's flagship store on London's Oxford Street are perfectly resistible for the modern fashion group, it seems.
The dynamics of both transactions are a stark lesson in the balance of power between the new and the old in fashion, with capital-light online names seemingly able to dictate their terms to the rest (JD Sports had shown the same principle at work in walking away from the Debenhams sale in December, while rival Frasers also decided last week it didn't need anything from either Debenhams or Arcadia). For Boohoo and Asos, however, the acquisitions just add more earning power at bargain prices. Boohoo stock rose 4.4% by mid-morning in London, while Asos stock was up 5.6%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares rose to levels just shy of record highs on Monday, as optimism over a $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus plan outweighed rising COVID-19 cases and delays in vaccine supplies.
European stock markets opened higher, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.3%. The continent's 50 biggest stocks were also up 0.3%. (EU)
Germany's DAX rose 0.2%, Italy's FTSE MIB index jumped 0.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.1%. Spain's IBEX and France's CAC 40 faltered, down 0.1% each. 
A rally in U.S. tech stocks to near record highs on Friday helped fuel gains in their counterparts in Asia and Europe. A European basket of tech stocks gained 1.2%. In Asia, Chinese tech giant Tencent soared 11%.
MSCI's All Country World index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, was up 0.3% on the day. 
Global equity markets have scaled record highs in recent days on bets COVID-19 vaccines will start to reduce infection rates worldwide and on a stronger U.S. economic recovery under President Joe Biden. 
Investors are also wary about towering valuations amid questions over the efficiency of the vaccines in curbing the pandemic and as U.S. lawmakers continue to debate a coronavirus aid package.
All eyes are on Washington D.C. as U.S. lawmakers agreed that getting the COVID-19 vaccine to Americans should be a priority even as they lock horns over the size of the U.S. pandemic relief package.
Financial markets have been eyeing a massive package, though disagreements have meant months of indecision in a country suffering more than 175,000 COVID-19 cases a day with millions out of work.
Global COVID-19 cases are inching towards 100 million with more than 2 million dead.
Despite the recent outperformance in tech stocks, investors have reiterated views that cyclical and value stocks will outperform as economies recover.
""While renewed lockdowns and mobility restrictions around the world have supported 2020 stay-home beneficiaries, we do not think the rotation into cyclicals is over,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Haefele said a broadening economic recovery, a normalization of economic activity as vaccination programmes continue, and attractive valuations for emerging-market stocks relative to developed markets were reasons for UBS shifting its preference to emerging markets.
On Friday, the Dow fell 0.57%, the S&P 500 lost 0.30% and the Nasdaq added 0.09%. The three main U.S. indexes closed higher for the week, with the Nasdaq rising over 4%.
""Small/Mid (SMID) cap earnings were more impacted by the pandemic, and we project an earnings rebound more than 2x larger than the S&P 500,"" said BoFA strategists in a note.
""Historically, when Democrats control both the White House and Congress, SMID-cap returns have exceeded large cap. Also, SMID-caps are more domestically-oriented, which should benefit from on-shoring and infrastructure spending.""
Sentiment in Asia was boosted by a report that China had surpassed the United States to be the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in 2020 with $163 billion in inflows.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to 726.46, close to last week's record high of 727.31. 
The benchmark is up nearly 9% so far in January, on track for its fourth straight monthly rise.
Japan's Nikkei rebounded from falls in early trading to be up 0.7%. 
Australian shares added 0.4% after the country's drug regulator approved the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with a phased rollout likely late next month.
Chinese shares rose, with the blue-chip CSI300 index up 1.1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index leapt nearly 2% led by technology stocks.
Rebounding sentiment in markets put further pressure on the dollar, which eased 0.1% to 90.163 against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in currencies, major pairs were trapped in a tight range as markets awaited the Federal Reserve's Wednesday meeting. 
The euro was flat at $1.2167, while sterling was last up at $1.3697. [FRX/] The Japanese yen was flat at 103.76 per dollar.

194,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>",GameStop Melt-Up Leaves Wall Street Price Analysis in Shambles,"(Bloomberg) -- To see how far GameStop (NYSE:GME) has outrun anyone’s ability to render sensible analysis, consider what its dizzying rally has done to Wall Street’s best guesses of its value.
Perched at $65 a share, hoisted by a short squeeze ignited and arguably organized in chat rooms, the stock has soared $53 above the average forecast of equity handicappers tracked by Bloomberg. The ratio between the two is by far the biggest in the Russell 3000 and jumped Friday, as crazed trading capped a stretch in which the 37-year-old game retailer burned bears who had shorted 140% of its shares.
It’s happening in a stock that before 2020 had fallen six straight years as earnings shrunk, and which isn’t projected to turn a profit before fiscal 2023. While fundamentals may one day matter again, for now GameStop has become the latest and greatest show of force by newbie day traders in a market that seems more like their plaything each day.
“It doesn’t make business sense,” said Doug Clinton, co-founder of Loup Ventures. “It makes sense from an investor psychology standpoint. I think there’s a tendency where there is heavy retail interest for those types of traders to think about stocks differently than institutional investors in terms of what they’re willing to pay.”
Right now, they’re willing to pay 426% more than what analysts consider reasonable, on average. While perhaps fairly priced relative to its annual sales of about $5.2 billion in the 12 months through October, those sales are down 40% in just two years. The company is expected to report a per-share loss in both fiscal 2021 and 2022. To get a price-earnings multiple it’s necessary to look two years into the future, where the P/E is around 58.
And that’s before the possibility of further gains: the stock more than doubled to $136.63 in U.S. premarket trading on Monday, before paring the advance. It traded at $93.80 as of 5:25 a.m. in New York.
While Wall Street may have no clue what GameStop shares are worth, it does have ideas on what the company should do with them: sell.
“GameStop can issue equity and should sell stock to pay down debt,” said Wedbush Securities Inc. analyst Michael Pachter, who had a price target of $16 for GameStop as of Jan. 11. Doing so would involve “minimal dilution at these levels” and provide protection against an economic downturn. “They should do as much as the market will absorb,” he said.
Whatever the future holds, the recent past has been a bonanza for anyone who dared own the stock -- or, even better, bullish options. Calls expiring Jan. 29 with a strike price of $60 were the most-traded GameStop contract on Friday, soaring 11-fold. Other similar wagers had correspondingly heady gains as contracts once seen as long-shot upward bets suddenly were in the money.
“It has become a cult stock because of Ryan Cohen’s success with Chewy (NYSE:CHWY),” Pachter said, referring to the activist investor and co-founder of online pet retailer  Chewy Inc  ., who joined the GameStop board this month. “I cannot discount Mr. Cohen’s past successes and don’t know what he has in mind going forward, but I need to see their strategy before I give them credit for materially higher earnings power.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear maker  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) on Monday urged Europe's second-highest court to annul an EU investigation into its Dutch tax rulings, saying the bloc's competition enforcers had failed to show these amounted to illegal state aid.
The European Commission launched an investigation into Nike's Dutch tax status in January 2019, part of a crackdown on multinationals' sweetheart tax deals with EU countries giving them an unfair advantage.
At issue are five tax rulings issued by Dutch authorities from 2006 to 2015, two of which are still in force, which endorsed a method to calculate royalty payments to Nike's Dutch entities - Nike European Operations Netherlands and Converse Netherlands - for the use of intellectual property.
EU enforcers said the royalty payments appeared higher than those which independent companies would have agreed between themselves, and may have unduly reduced the Dutch entities' taxable base and given Nike a selective advantage amounting to illegal state aid.
The Commission's preliminary assessment that state aid is involved contained legal errors, Nike said in its arguments, according to a filing on the Luxembourg-based General Court's website.
EU regulators also failed to provide ""sufficient reasons for finding that the contested measures fulfil all elements of state aid, especially why they should be regarded as selective"", the company said.
The sportswear company also faulted the Commission for rushing to open a formal investigation ""where there were no difficulties to continue the preliminary investigation.""
The Commission has a mixed record in its campaign against unfair tax deals, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) winning its legal fight against a 13 billion euro Irish tax order and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) against a 30 million euro Dutch tax order. 
It won the court's backing in Fiat's Luxembourg tax case. Judges will rule on Nike's challenge in the coming months. 

The case is T-648/19 Nike European Operations Netherlands et Converse Netherlands v Commission.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed on Monday, with investors keeping a wary eye on Covid-19 developments while earnings season kicks into top gear.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%. 
Equity markets have posted healthy gains over the last few weeks on bets Covid-19 vaccines will start to reduce infection rates worldwide and on a stronger U.S. economic recovery under President Joe Biden. 
However, the vaccine rollouts have been uneven, with relatively rapid progress in the U.K. but a much slower rollout in France. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) warned of further delays to deliveries of its vaccine in Europe on Friday, due to a production bottleneck at one of its manufacturing partners. Over the weekend, Italy threatened legal action over the weekend against both Astra and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)  over delivery delays. 
Additionally, the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported on Sunday that France, which is already operating a national 12-hour curfew, could impose a third lockdown. 
Dutch health technology company Philips (AS:PHG) stock gained 2.8% after it reported a 7% increase in fourth-quarter core profit, while Siemens Energy (DE:ENR1n) stock rose 2.5% after it swung to a core profit in its fiscal first quarter.
In the battered U.K. retail sector, ASOS (LON:ASOS) stock rose 3.5% after it said it was in ""exclusive"" talks to buy the Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge brands out of administration, while Boohoo.com (LON:BOOH) stock rose 3.8% after confirming that it is buying the Debenhams brand. Elsewhere, there were all-time highs for German online fashion chain Zalando (DE:ZALG) and automaker Volvo (ST:VOLVb).
In the U.S.., investors remain hopeful that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Biden will be passed by Congress soon, despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers.
Corporate earnings season gets into full swing this week, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting after the close Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a day later. 
The Federal Reserve meets for its first policy meeting of 2021 on Tuesday, with the policy decision to be handed down on Wednesday, while the World Economic Forum starts in a digital format later Monday, with European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane among those scheduled to speak. 
On the economic data front, Germany’s Ifo institute releases its business climate survey results for January later Monday.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, rebounding from Friday’s losses on the back of a surprise rise in U.S. inventories by 4.4 million barrels in the week to January 15th.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $52.65 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $55.56.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher Monday, with investors keeping a wary eye on Covid-19 developments at the start of a week which includes a Federal Reserve meeting, a virtual Davos get together, an abundance of corporate earnings and key GDP figures.  
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
Equity markets have posted healthy gains over the last few weeks on bets Covid-19 vaccines will start to reduce infection rates worldwide and on a stronger U.S. economic recovery under President Joe Biden.
However, the vaccine rollouts have been patchy, with Italy, for example, threatening legal action over the weekend against  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) over delays in deliveries of their vaccines.
Additionally, there are fears that these vaccines may not be as efficient at neutralizing new variants of the virus which appear to be behind the recent surge in cases. 
That said, investors remain hopeful that the $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposed by President Biden will be passed by Congress soon, despite some opposition from Republican lawmakers.
Also, in the U.S., the Federal Reserve meets for its first policy meeting of 2021 on Tuesday, with the policy decision to be handed down on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, the World Economic Forum starts in a digital format later Monday, with European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane among those scheduled to speak. 
On the economic data front, Germany’s Ifo institute releases its business climate survey results for January later Monday, but the focus this week will be on GDP data from the likes of the U.S., France and Germany. These numbers will provide the first look on how these key economies performed in the fourth quarter, although Germany has already released preliminary data for 2020.
The U.S. corporate earnings season gets into full swing this week, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting after the close Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a day later. 
In Europe, Philips (AS:PHG) will be in the spotlight Monday after the Dutch conglomerate maintained its 2021 guidance as its fourth-quarter net profit rose, while Siemens Energy (DE:ENR1n) said its first quarter earnings came in better than expected.
In the U.K., online fashion groups Asos and Boohoo will draw attention after weekend reports that they are set to buy the online assets of failed High Street rivals Top Shop and Debenhams, respectively.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, rebounding from Friday’s losses on the back of a surprise rise in U.S. inventories by 4.4 million barrels in the week to Jan. 15, versus expectations for a small draw.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $52.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $55.50.

202,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>",Toshiba Sees Shares Soar Over 16% as it Preps TSE-1 Return,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Japan’s  Toshiba Corp.  (T:6502) saw its shares surge to their highest level in three years after the company revealed plans to return to the TSE-1, or first, section of the Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges after an extended absence.
The company's shares soared 16.77% to JPY3,460 ($33.34) as of 12:17 AM ET (5:17 AM GMT), the biggest intraday gain since July 2017.
Toshiba has reportedly set the move date for Jan.29, in turn meaning that its shares will be added to market indexes and enabling domestic active funds to buy the stock. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) senior analyst Atul Goyal also described the move as “inexpensive” in a report.
Toshiba was relegated to the second section of the two Japanese exchanges in August 2017, and narrowly avoided an outright delisting. It saw multibillion-dollar losses at the Westinghouse U.S. nuclear unit, which pushed liabilities beyond its level of assets and forced the sale of the semiconductor business. The company was also forced to take an infusion of cash from a sizeable contingent of activist shareholders, and the write-downs as well as accounting scandals saw outsider Nobuaki Kurumatani appointed as CEO.
The return to TSE-1 will enable Toshiba to rejoin the Topix index at the market close on Feb. 25, special-situations analyst Travis Lundy told Bloomberg. Lundy also estimated that the inclusion will require passive funds to buy 58 million shares, or 13% of outstanding stock.
“A Topix inclusion of this size is a rare species … long-suffering activists may rejoice. This creates liquidity for a partial exit,” he added in a report.
The move also comes after Kurumatani signaled Toshiba is ready to again pursue acquisitions and business expansion, albeit in a more circumspect and cautious manner than previously, in December. He also reaffirmed Toshiba’s intent of divesting its stake in former flash memory unit Kioxia.
“One thing that changed is that I’m in charge now … the board is also applying very stringent standards to acquisitions. It’s a completely different company when it comes to the rigor brought to thinking about and screening deals,” Kurumatani told Bloomberg."

On Sunday, in a stock market filing, the company said it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) regarding a Section 337 investigation filed against it by U.S.-based  Amphenol Corp  (NYSE:APH), alleging IP infringement.
Luxshare said it had hired a team of lawyers to respond and would ""follow procedure"" on the investigation, without elaborating, but re-iterated that the case ""will not have a material impact"" on its current operations and production.
Amphenol filed a section 337 complaint against Luxshare and its subsidiaries in December, alleging that certain electric components imported into the United States from Luxshare infringe on Amphenol's patents for connector cables.
Days later, Luxshare issued a statement saying it had learned of the complaint via USITC's website, and added it had established an internal working group to investigate the claims.
Founded in 2004, Luxshare has in recent years become a fast-rising supplier for Apple. It has steadily moved up the hardware giant's value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.
Last year the company acquired two iPhone assembly plant from Taiwan-based Wistron Corp.
That move unnerved some executives at Foxconn, the dominant maker of the handsets, and is seen by analysts as a sign of more indigenous Chinese companies making deeper inroads into Apple's supply chain.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, but a worsening COVID-19 pandemic and prospects for U.S. stimulus measures remain challenges to global economic recovery.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.43% by 9:24 PM ET (2:24 AM GMT). The city’s first ever lockdown, affecting around 10,000 people living in the Jordan and Yau Ma Tei areas, was lifted earlier in the day as a COVID-19 testing program was completed.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.39% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.30%, with the country continuing to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak. The National Health Commission recorded 124 cases on Jan. 24, up from 80 today earlier and the worst wave of new infections seen since March 2020.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.45% and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.54%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.41%.
Despite stocks’ positive start to the week, the global economy is facing a tougher-than-anticipated start to 2021 thanks to numbers of new COVID-19 cases globally that show no signs of slowing down and lags in COVID-19 vaccine rollouts. Doubts are also starting to creep in on whether U.S. President Joe Biden will muster Republican support to pass his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress.
The number of global COVID-19 cases is fast approaching 100 million, with the number of deaths surpassing 2 million as of Jan. 25, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Vaccine rollouts have been hampered by delays in consignments by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) of their respective vaccines, described by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as “unacceptable” in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. Further bad news came as U.K. health minister Matt Hancock warned on Sunday that existing vaccines could be less effective against new COVID-19 variants.
“There was one negative COVID-19 news story after another on Friday and which equity investors ultimately couldn’t ignore,” National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) head of forex strategy Ray Attrill.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak at the World Economic Forum’s “The Davos Agenda 2021” online event later in the day. Topics to be discussed at the event include fair economic and social systems, as well as digitization and the climate crisis.
On the central bank front, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang and European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane are both due to speak at a conference later in the day. The Federal Reserve is also due to hand out its policy decision on Wednesday, amid hopes that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will reassure investors that $120 billion worth of monthly bond purchases won’t be reduced any time soon.
The U.S. is due to release a slew of data during the week, starting with the Conference Board (CB) Consumer Confidence and S&P/Case-Shiller House Price indexes on Tuesday, followed by fourth-quarter GDP, initial jobless claims and new home sales data will be released on Thursday."
205,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 09:00PM ET</span>",BP's oil exploration team swept aside in climate revolution,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Nothing escapes the winds of change now sweeping through BP (NYSE:BP), not even the exploration team that for more than a century powered its profits by discovering billions of barrels of oil.
Its geologists, engineers and scientists have been cut to less than 100 from a peak of more than 700 a few years ago, company sources told Reuters, part of a climate change-driven overhaul triggered last year by CEO Bernard Looney.
""The winds have turned very chilly in the exploration team since Looney's arrival. This is happening incredibly fast,"" a senior member of the team told Reuters.
Hundreds have left the oil exploration team in recent months, either transferred to help develop new low-carbon activities or laid off, current and former employees said.
The exodus is the starkest sign yet from inside the company of its rapid shift away from oil and gas, which will nevertheless be its main source of cash to finance a switch to renewables for at least the next decade.
BP declined to comment on the staffing changes, which have not been publicly disclosed.
Reuters spoke to a dozen former and current employees of BP who highlighted the massive challenges the company faces in its transition from fossil fuels to carbon neutrality.
Looney made his intentions clear internally and externally by lowering BP's production targets and becoming the first oil major CEO to promote this as a positive to investors seeking a long-term vision for a lower-carbon economy.
BP is cutting some 10,000 jobs, around 15% of its workforce, under Looney's restructuring, the most aggressive among Europe's oil giants including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total. 
The 50-year-old, a veteran oil engineer who previously headed the oil and gas exploration and production division, aims to cut output by 1 million barrels per day, or 40%, over the next decade while growing renewable energy output 20 fold.
Despite the changes, oil and gas will remain BP's main source of revenue until at least 2030. 
And Looney's drive to reinvent BP has done nothing to boost its shares, which hit their lowest level in 25 years late in 2020 and dropped 44% in the year, mostly over doubts whether it will be able transform and make the profits it aims for.
The change marks the end of an era for exploration teams from Moscow and Houston to BP's research headquarters in Sunbury near London, with farewell gatherings held on Zoom in recent months, they added.
""The atmosphere was brutal,"" a former employee said at the time of last year's lay-offs.
For BP's whittled down exploration team, led by Ariel Flores, the former North Sea boss, the focus has narrowed to searching for new resources near existing oil and gas fields in order to offset production declines and minimize spending. 
""We are in a harvest mode and what isn't being said is that BP is going to be a much smaller company without exploration,"" a second source in BP's oil and production division said.
Flores was not available for comment.
Data from Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy shows BP acquired around 3,000 square kilometres of new exploration licences in 2020, its lowest since at least 2015 and far less than at Shell, which acquired around 11,000 square kilometres, or Total, which bought some 17,000 square kilometres.
Although global exploration activity slowed last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the drop at BP was mainly a result of the change in strategy, four company sources said.

(Graphic: BP exploration spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-EXPLORATION/yzdvxgqxnpx/chart.png)
Oil and gas exploration has been the spearhead of companies' evolution into huge multinationals that delivered enormous profits to shareholders over the decades.
BP began reducing its spending on exploration under former CEO Bob Dudley in response to the 2014 oil price crash, aiming to use technology to unlock more oil and gas reserves.
Looney is driving the exploration budget even lower, to around $350 to $400 million per year. That is around half of what BP spent in 2019 and a fraction of the $4.6 billion spent on exploration in 2010.
BP last year also wiped $20 billion from the value of its oil and gas assets after slashing its outlook for energy prices. At those lower price assumptions, BP no longer considered many of its oil and gas reserves worth developing.

BEYOND PETROLEUM
BP, which started as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1908 and has since discovered massive fossil fuel resources in places such as Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, has attempted to diversify into renewables before.
Under CEO John Browne BP launched ""Beyond Petroleum,"" investing billions in wind farms and solar power technology, but the vast majority of the investments failed.
Looney believes his plan will succeed with unprecedented government support for the energy transition and technological advances that make renewable energy more affordable than ever. He has enlisted Giulia Chierchia, a former McKinsey executive to oversee the development of BP's strategy.
And a team of geologists and data crunchers led by Houston-based Kirsty McCormack, who was previously in the exploration unit, will now apply analytics used to study and map rock structures in search of fossil fuels to develop low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) and geothermal energy, company sources said. 
Absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting industries and injecting it into depleted oil reservoirs is seen as key in the energy transition by helping to offset emissions.
Other oil veterans have also been reassigned, with Felipe Arbelaez, who previously headed BP's oil and gas operations in Latin America, now leading its renewables business and Louise Jacobsen Plutt, an experienced oil engineer, now senior vice president hydrogen CCUS. 
BP also poached staff from Uber (NYSE:UBER), Toyota and Silicon Valley to boost its understanding of electric vehicles, power markets, renewables and expanding its capabilities in big data. 
Franziska Bell, a former Toyota employee, is vice president for data and analytics at BP while Justin Lewis joined the company in July to head its high-tech start-up venture after working as a software engineer at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
The transformation has been met with a mix of awe and concern among employees who are wondering if the pace is sustainable and whether it is enough for BP to compete in a rapidly-changing energy world. 
Some senior current and former employees warned that BP risks rushing into investments in new fields before fully understanding how they will fit into a transformed company, while abandoning long-standing sources of cash. 
""There is so much internal change that it will be a big job to pick up the organisation and get things going,"" a senior employee in the exploration division said.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 08:05PM ET</span>",Big Oil hits brakes on search for new fossil fuels,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Top oil and gas companies sharply slowed their search for new fossil fuel resources last year, data shows, as lower energy prices due to the coronavirus crisis triggered spending cuts.
Acquisitions of new onshore and offshore exploration licences for the top five Western energy giants dropped to the lowest in at least five years, data from Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy showed.
The number of exploration licensing rounds dropped last year due to the epidemic while companies including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and France's Total also reduced spending, Rystad Energy analyst Palzor Shenga said. 
""Acquiring additional leases comes with a cost and it demands some work commitments to be fulfilled. Hence, companies would not want to pile up on additional acreages in their non-core areas of operations,"" Shenga said.
(GRAPHIC: Slowing exploration - https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-EXPLORATION/azgpolnldvd/index.html)
Of the five companies, BP (NYSE:BP) saw by far the largest drop in new acreage acquisition in 2020. Bernard Looney, who became BP's CEO in February, outlined a strategy to reduce oil output by 40% or 1 million barrels per day by 2030. BP has rapidly scaled back its exploration team in recent months.
Exxon, the largest U.S. energy company, acquired the largest acreage in 2020 in the group, with 63% in three blocks in Angola, according to Rystad Energy.
Total was second with two large blocks acquired in Angola and Oman.
Acquiring exploration acreage means companies can search for oil and gas. If new resources are discovered in sufficient volumes, the companies need to decide whether to develop them, a costly process that can take years.
As a result, the drop in exploration activity could lead to a supply gap in the second half of the decade, analysts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global green bond issuance reached a record high of $269.5 billion by the end of last year and could reach $400-$450 billion this year, a report by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) showed on Monday.
Green bonds are a growing category of fixed-income securities that raise capital for projects with environmental benefits, such as renewable energy or low-carbon transport.
Although issuance reached a new record in 2020, the figure was just above 2019's total of $266.5 billion as issuance slowed in the second quarter due to the effects of the coronavirus crisis before rebounding in the third quarter.
""The impact of COVID-19 in 2020 proved a huge economic and social negative. In that context, the resilience of green finance markets led to a record year of issuance,"" the report said.
""2021 may enable a sustained resurgence,"" the CBI added.
The CBI is a London-based non-profit which promotes investment in the low-carbon economy.
Supporting factors for green bond issuance this year include U.S. President Joe Biden's intention to return the country to the international Paris Agreement to fight climate change and investors and policymakers' growing focus on decarbonising industrial sectors.
The green bond market started up in 2007.
Although they make up a small fraction of the overall debt market, green bonds are attracting attention because the need to meet emissions-reduction targets will need trillions of dollars of capital from public and private sectors.
Last year, the United States issued the most green bonds, with a total value of $51.1 billion, followed by Germany at $40.2 billion and France at $32.1 billion, the report said.
The proceeds of green bonds were mainly aimed at energy sector investments, followed by low-carbon buildings and low-carbon transport, it added.

As a group, the most successful managers earned half of the $127 billion that all hedge funds made last year, LCH Investments, a fund of funds firm that tracks returns and is part of the Edmond de Rothschild group, reported.
Despite the pandemic that triggered a historic stock market sell-off in March, shut down large sectors of the economy and swallowed up millions of jobs, the 20 best hedge funds topped their 2019 returns of $59.3 billion. That was despite 2020 not being as profitable as the previous year for hedge funds as a whole, which saw earnings fall from $178 billion in 2019. 
The average hedge fund returned 11.6% in 2020, according to Hedge Fund Research data, lagging behind the S&P 500 index' 16% gain.
""The net gains generated by the top 20 managers for their investors of $63.5 billion were the highest in a decade. In that sense, 2020 was the year of the hedge fund,"" Rick Sopher, LCH's chairman, said in a statement.

Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors earned $7.0 billion and Ken Griffin's Citadel earned $6.2 billion, according to LCH data.
Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, founded in 1975, held on to the No.1 ranking since inception, with $46.5 billion earned, even after a terrible 2020 during which LCH data show Dalio lost $12.1 billion.
George Soros' Soros Fund Management, which no longer manages money for outside clients, held on to the No. 2 spot followed by Mandel, Griffin and managers at D.E. Shaw who rounded out the top five performers of all time.
In 2020 only Dalio and John Paulson's Paulson & Co., which earned billions from housing market bets during the financial crisis, lost money, the data show.
Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies, often ranked among the world's most successful funds because of its Medallion portfolio returns, dropped out of the top 20 performers after the funds it offers to outsiders fell between 20% and 30% last year.

""Conditions favored man over machine and it was notable that Renaissance Technologies, a machine-driven manager, has dropped out of the top 20,"" Sopher said.

The internal probe was triggered by client complaints last year, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the process, adding that the investigation initially focused on the desk in Spain, which sells hedges, swaps, derivatives and other financial products.
An audit had found that the bank wrongly categorised client firms under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) rules, which require banks to separate their clients by levels of financial sophistication, according to the newspaper.
Sources told the newspaper that the lender believes some of its staff knowingly sold inappropriate or unsuitable products to customers who may not have been able to understand and shoulder the risk they were taking with these positions.
The probe, called Project Teal, is also looking into accusations that there was collusion between the German bank's employees and staff at some of the clients who bought the inappropriate products.
The scope of the investigation was subsequently extended to the rest of Europe, but it was believed only Spain and Portugal-based clients were impacted, a source told FT.
The probe is drawing to a conclusion and the bank will have to soon make final disclosures to regulators, the newspaper said, adding that the bank's primary regulators, BaFin and the European Central Bank, have been informed.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 05:20PM ET</span>",Foley-backed SPAC nears $7.3 billion deal with Blackstone's Alight: sources,"By David French
(Reuters) - A blank-check acquisition firm backed by veteran investor Bill Foley is nearing an agreement to take Alight Solutions LLC, the U.S. benefits services provider owned by buyout firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, public at a valuation of $7.3 billion including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The deal illustrates how Alight has become an attractive investment target during the COVID-19 pandemic, capitalizing on the outsourcing of human resources functions by many companies that are seeking cost savings to preserve capital.
The transaction calls for Alight to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp, and could be announced as soon as Monday, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.
Blackstone declined to comment, while Alight and Foley Trasimene did not respond to requests for comment.
Buyout firms have traditionally cashed out on their investments by selling companies outright or taking them public. The potential deal for Alight underscores how Blackstone sees SPACs as a viable alternative.
Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to businesses, including 70% of the Fortune 100, serving 188 countries, according to its website.
It was acquired by Blackstone in 2017 from insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc, in a deal that valued it at up to $4.8 billion.
Blackstone pursued an $800 million initial public offering of Alight two years ago, but abandoned the effort amid concerns it would not fetch the terms it was seeking.
Foley Trasimene raised $900 million in an IPO last May to merge with a private company. Like all SPACs, it did not tell investors in advance what that company would be.

The deal will be the second involving Blackstone and a Foley SPAC in recent weeks. The private equity firm and its peer CVC Capital Partners announced last month they would merge Paysafe Group with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II in a transaction that valued the payments processor at $9 billion.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A pipe-laying vessel has started work in Danish waters ahead of the resumption of construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, the consortium behind the project said on Sunday, amid pressure from the United States and European Union to halt it.
The project, designed to boost Russian gas supplies to Europe and bypass Ukraine, has met resistance from Washington, which wants to sell its own sea-borne liquefied natural gas to the European Union and cut the region's reliance on energy supplies from Moscow.
European Union lawmakers passed a resolution on Thursday calling for the bloc to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 in response to the arrest of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
The construction of the pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream link from Russia to Germany, was suspended in December 2019 following a threat of sanctions from the United States and withdrawal of pipe-laying company, Allseas.
Last week the United States imposed sanctions against the pipe-laying vessel, Fortuna, and its owner, a firm called KVT-RUS, as the Trump administration sought to raise pressure on the project on its last full day in office.
Their assets are blocked and U.S. citizens are generally prohibited from dealing with them.
""The laybarge Fortuna has started works in the construction corridor in the Danish EEZ, ahead of the resumption of the Nord Stream 2 construction,"" Nord Stream 2 said.
""All works are performed in line with relevant permits.""
Nord Stream 2 cited a Danish Maritime Authority notice about resuming work on Jan. 15. The group had earlier said activities would include preparatory work and tests before pipe-laying started.
Work resumed for a brief period in last month on a 2.6-km (1.6-mile) stretch in German waters. A Danish regulator said construction would restart in Danish waters from mid-January, with Fortuna, which had worked in the German zone.
More than 90% of the project, led by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), has been already completed.

Gazprom's western partners in the project, estimated to cost 9.5 billion euros ($11.5 billion), are Germany's Uniper, BASF's Wintershall Dea, Anglo-Dutch oil major Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV and French energy company Engie.

First-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) before special items came in at 366 million euros ($445 million), the group said, compared with a 74 million loss in the year-earlier period.
In a statement outlining preliminary results, the group also confirmed its outlook, still expecting sales to rise by 2-12% in the year to September, while the margin on adjusted EBITA before special items is seen at 3-5%, up from a negative 0.1%.
Spun off from Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) last year, Siemens Energy makes and services steam turbines for gas- and coal-fired power plants and also owns a 67% stake in Siemens Gamesa, the world's second-largest maker of wind turbines.
New orders fell 26% to 7.4 billion euros in the first three months of the group's fiscal year, while sales were up 2.6% at 6.5 billion euros.

Siemens Energy, in which Siemens AG owns 35% directly and 10% via its pension fund, will publish full results for the first quarter on Feb. 2. Siemens Gamesa is scheduled to report results on Jan. 29. ($1 = 0.8218 euros)

The company said the staff had been asked to stay at home as a precautionary measure and it was examining whether the measures would impact production at the site.
Health officials were still investigating what caused the outbreak, a spokesman of the Hamburg health authority said.
It was also still unclear whether the workers had caught the more contagious variant of the coronavirus which was first discovered in Britain and is now rapidly spreading across Europe, he added.
Health authorities first ordered the quarantine on Friday and would probably be able to give more details on the virus type in the second half of next week, the official said.
Airbus employs more than 12,000 people at its Hamburg-Finkenwerder site, making it the northern city's largest industrial employer.
""The cause of the cases is still under investigation. We are fully supporting the authorities,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
On Saturday, health authorities put Berlin's Humboldt hospital under quarantine after 20 patients and staff tested positive for the more infectious variant.

The quarantine covered about 1,500 doctors, nurses and technicians working at the hospital as well as more than 400 patients.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain's Gulf Air is in talks with Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to delay some aircraft deliveries as the pandemic continues to distrupt global travel, its acting chief executive said on Sunday. 
Airlines around the world have pushed back deliveries and cancelled orders, expecting a years-long recovery from the pandemic that has crushed global travel demand.
State-owned Gulf Air expects Airbus A320neo deliveries to be put on hold until 2022, though it hopes to receive at least three larger A321neos this year, Acting CEO Waleed Abdulhameed Al Alawi told Reuters. 
It is also in talks with Boeing over a new delivery schedule for five 787-9 Dreamliners it has on order, though it will receive some this year, he said. 
Airbus and Boeing declined to comment.
Unlike some other carriers, Gulf Air lacks a domestic market to cushion it against international border closures.
The airline is currently flying to around half of the 49 destinations it operated to before the pandemic and expects it could resume flying to all destinations by the end of 2023.
""We are very optimistic that things will improve and that we will be utilising most of our fleet from now until the end of the year,"" Al Alawi said.
""We think we will weather the storm and will come out of the situation strong. We are very positive. It is only a question of time but for sure we will remain in the market.""
He said he was hopeful the availability of vaccines would help the public regain confidence in travel.
The airline last year cut an undisclosed number of jobs and according to a government bond prospectus, seen by Reuters, received 36 million dinars ($95.6 million) from its state owner.

It also cancelled its order for 10 Airbus A220s, signed when it was the Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) CSeries.

BERLIN/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines due to problems in the delivery of semiconductors, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former Trump administration's actions against key Chinese chip factories.
The shortage has affected Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) VOWG_p.DE, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co F.N, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp 7270.T,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp 7203.T, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd 7201.T, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers.
In a letter seen by Reuters on Sunday, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier asked his Taiwanese counterpart Wang Mei-hua to address the issue in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker and one of Germany's main suppliers.
""I would be pleased if you could take on this matter and underline the importance of additional semiconductor capacities for the German automotive industry to TSMC,"" Altmaier wrote.
Altmaier said the aim was to enable additional capacities and deliveries of semiconductors in the short and medium term.
The German automobile industry was already in direct talks with TSMC about hiking deliveries and there had been ""very constructive"" signals from TSMC to solve the problem, he wrote.
A German economy ministry spokeswoman said it was monitoring the situation very closely and that it was in talks on the issue with the car industry.
DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY
To reduce dependencies from Asian suppliers and avoid similar problems in the future, Berlin is now planning to increase state support to ramp up production capacities of semiconductors in Germany and Europe, the spokeswoman added.
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said it has received requests through diplomatic channels to help ease a shortage of chips for the auto sector although it was not aware of Altmaier's letter.
It said it had begun talks with domestic chip suppliers in response to requests from other countries and asked them to ""provide full assistance"".
""The relevant supply and demand situation is also closely related to the plans of automotive chip factories to reduce inventory during the off-season,"" the ministry said.
TSMC, in a statement, said the issue of chips shortages for auto companies was very important to them.

""It is our top priority, and TSMC is working closely with our automotive customers to resolve the capacity support issues,"" it said.

Toshiba, which filed an application for the return in April last year, will move back to the first section on Jan. 29. The company has said the return could help lure buying from investors in stock indexes.
The Japanese company was relegated to the second section in 2017 after massive writedowns at its U.S. nuclear power business caused liabilities to exceed assets - a condition for automatic demotion.
The TSE's decision comes as two large shareholders - Singapore-based Effissimo Capital Management and U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management - demand an extraordinary shareholders meeting for governance-related issues. 
Effissimo Capital has called for an investigation in Toshiba's annual general meeting held last July, at which the company said the voting rights of several shareholders were compromised.

Farallon Capital is asking the firm to seek shareholder approval over what the fund said is a change in investment strategy.

Mexico's populous capital and several states are in partial lockdowns as authorities grapple with a surge of coronavirus infections that have strained hospitals. Mexico ranks fourth worldwide for most confirmed deaths.
In Mexico City and elsewhere, eateries without outdoor seating have been restricted to take-out only, which restaurant association CANIRAC warned could be a death knell for businesses that depend on delivery apps.
""Keeping the same commissions that applied before the pandemic has become unsustainable for thousands of restaurants,"" the group said in a statement this week, adding that the apps typically charge around 30% commission.
In areas with the strictest health measures, Rappi said it would cut its commission to 16.5% in February, while Uber Eats said it would reduce its to 17%. Both will charge 19% in March, and 22% in April.
Didi Food, another app that delivers restaurant meals, said earlier this week it would offer a reduced commission of 22%.

Since the coronavirus crisis began, 13,500 restaurants in Mexico City and the surrounding urban zone have closed, representing at least 80,000 job losses, according to CANIRAC.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Executive James Gorman's annual pay rose by $6 million, or 22%, last year, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday.
Gorman will receive $33 million for his work in 2020, compared with $27 million the year before, the bank said. Gorman's pay had fallen by 7% in 2019.
Morgan Stanley directors based the decision on the firm's record financial performance in 2020 and Gorman's progress in implementing the bank's long-term strategy, it said.
Under Gorman, Morgan Stanley produced net income of $11 billion, compared with $9 billion a year ago and a return on tangible common equity of 15.2% compared with 13.4% a year ago.
He also engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions, those of  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) and E*Trade, to bolster its investment management and broking arms.
Gorman's compensation is comprised of four parts: a base salary of $1.5 million; a cash bonus of $7.875 million; a deferred equity award of $7.875 million; and a performance-vested equity award of $15.75 million.
The board again required that 75% of Gorman's incentive compensation be deferred over three years subject to a claw-back, and for all of that compensation to be paid in the form of equity in the company.

Rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon will not get a raise in his annual pay and will receive $31.5 million for his work in 2020, that bank said on Thursday.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",Tech shares could retake market reins as earnings heat up,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bevy of major U.S. earnings reports next week led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could help technology and growth stocks reassert their dominance after a recent run by banks, energy and other potential beneficiaries of an economic reopening.
After leading markets higher for most of 2020, technology-related stocks took a backseat late last year to so-called value or cyclical plays, whose businesses are expected to gain the most from the economic revival promised by vaccines against COVID-19.
That shift has stalled in recent days as investors weighed lackluster outlooks from big banks and a blockbuster quarterly report from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) that lifted its shares by 17%. The Russell 1000 growth index was up 3.3% in the past week as of Friday morning, while its value counterpart fell 1.5%.
Next week's crop of fourth-quarter results - with about a quarter of the S&P 500 reporting - could help determine whether the resurgence in growth stocks will continue, potentially threatening the recent rally in value and cyclical shares, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.
“That is probably going to be the story of earnings season,” he said. “What will earnings mean in terms of the sustainability of this rotation that has occurred in the last eight, nine weeks.”
Steady growth and resilience in the face of the coronavirus pandemic made technology stocks desirable to investors, who poured money into the sector as widespread lockdowns devastated swaths of the U.S. economy.
But a resumption in tech outperformance could also revive concerns over investor crowding into popular names. The biggest five technology-related companies account for about 22% of the weight of the S&P 500.
Aside from Apple and Microsoft, other tech sector companies due to report next week include payment processing firms Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), whose explosive share price turned the electric car maker into one of the world's most valuable companies, reports on Wednesday.
So far, corporate profits have been strong across the board: Of 66 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings, 87.9% have beaten Wall Street estimates, well above the long-term average of 65%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Investors are particularly watching corporate outlooks, given the expectation of an economic rebound this year. Earnings are expected to rise 23.7% this year after falling 14.1% in 2020, according to Refinitiv.
While the tech sector's earnings held up relatively well in 2020, its expected profit growth of 14% in 2021 is below the S&P 500 overall and lags areas such as financials, industrials and materials. “The risk is in situations where you have had such a good 2020, which is going to be capped off by this reporting next week, what do you do for an encore?” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.
Demand for Apple's iPhone 12 will be a key issue when the company reports on Wednesday, said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. Analysts on average expect the company to report a 13% rise in quarterly earnings.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, is eager to learn how well Microsoft is making inroads with its work-from-home products. The software giant is expected to post an 8.7% rise in earnings.
Facebook, estimated to report a 25% rise in earnings, could field questions around any fallout for the social media business from the U.S. elections and banning of President Donald Trump from various platforms, investors said.
Earnings season is heating up as the S&P 500 has risen to records to start 2021, worrying some investors who say corporate results in the coming year will need to justify high stock valuations.

""Stocks have had a great run since October and you have to wonder with all the talk about the market possibly pulling back, when will it come or what will cause it,"" Pavlik said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 ended modestly lower on Friday, dragged down by losses in blue-chip technology stalwarts Intel and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) following their quarterly results, as hopes for a full economic reopening in the coming months waned.
IBM Corp slumped 9.91% and was the top drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after it missed estimates for quarterly revenue, hurt by a rare sales decline in its software unit.
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) slipped 9.29% as new Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger's post-earnings comments suggested the lack of a strong embrace of outsourcing.
However, losses in the tech sector were offset by gains from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), keeping the declines on the main U.S. stock indexes in check and lifting the Nasdaq slightly.
Energy and financials were the worst performers among the 11 S&P sectors on Friday, while the defensive utilities and real estate groups advanced. 
""Any delay or setback in the reopening theme is probably going to be a headwind for the energy sector,"" said Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridien in Wichita, Kansas.
""(But)the market is telling you that its confidence in the cyclicals are diminished right now.""
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pared some losses shortly after the opening bell as data showed U.S. manufacturing activity surprisingly surged to its highest level in more than 13-1/2-years in early January, in contrast to a disappointing result in the purchasing manager data in Europe earlier.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.03 points, or 0.57%, to 30,996.98, the S&P 500 lost 11.6 points, or 0.30%, to 3,841.47 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.15 points, or 0.09%, to 13,543.06.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.79 billion shares, compared with the 12.68 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Despite the weakness, the three major indexes notched weekly gains, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq tracking for its best weekly performance since Nov. 6 as investors piled into Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in anticipation of their earnings reports in the coming weeks.
For the week, the S&P rose 1.94%, the Dow added 0.59% and the Nasdaq unofficially gained 4.19%.
With stock valuations nearing levels not seen since the Dotcom era, some market participants said new COVID-19 variants and hiccups in vaccine rollouts pose near-term risks.
President Joe Biden said on Friday the U.S. economic crisis was deepening and that the government needs to take major action now to help struggling Americans.
""The absolute assurance that investors felt a week ago ...some of that is starting to fade out of the market."" Mies added, regarding the decline in the virus and the reopening of the economy.
The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Janet Yellen's nomination as the first woman Treasury secretary, indicating that she will easily win full Senate approval.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 189 new highs and 7 new lows.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) and state authorities narrowed their gap in a potential settlement deal over the Brumadinho mining disaster to 11 billion reais ($2 billion) before talks fell apart, a person close to the negotiations told Reuters on Friday.
The 2019 disaster in the town of Brumadinho in Minas Gerais state killed some 270 people when a dam ruptured at a Vale facility and unleashed a torrent of mining waste.
The Minas Gerais state government lowered its demands for a settlement to 40 billion reais in a meeting with Vale on Thursday, down from the 54 billion reais in damages it previously sought, the source said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the negotiations were closed. 
Vale offered 29 billion reais, the person said, with the talks breaking down over the difference.
Vale in an emailed statement did not comment on specific settlement figures. 
""Although the parties have not reached consensus, the divergence centers on aspects related to amounts to be paid and their destination,"" the company said.

Following the failed talks on Thursday, Minas Gerais Secretary General Mateus Simões delivered an ultimatum, saying that a lawsuit would proceed on Feb. 1 if Vale does not make a new offer.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Buyout firm TPG in lead for stake in AT&T's DirecTV - sources,"By Krystal Hu and Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Private equity firm TPG has entered into exclusive talks to acquire a minority stake in AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s satellite TV division, DirecTV, in a deal that would allow the U.S. wireless carrier to trim its net debt of close to $150 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The exact price TPG is willing to pay could not be learned, but sources said the deal could value DirecTV at more than $15 billion. Were the negotiations to conclude successfully, a deal could be announced in the coming weeks, added the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
AT&T and TPG declined to comment. 
AT&T shares rose close to 1% on the news to an intraday high of $29.05, giving the company a market capitalization of nearly $210 billion. The shares unofficially closed Friday at $28.92, up 0.3%.
The advanced talks with TPG are the culmination of an auction that AT&T ran for DirecTV for several months. The deal would crystallize a financial hit for AT&T, which valued DirecTV at about $67 billion including debt when it agreed to acquire it in 2014.
Since then, DirecTV has been bleeding subscribers, with users shifting to less costly online streaming services such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime service. 
AT&T has said it lost 590,000 subscribers in the third quarter spanning its DirecTV, U-verse and AT&T TV platforms. It is under pressure to trim its swelling debt pile as it invests more in 5G and other wireless services.
AT&T's biggest deal, its $85 billion acquisition of media conglomerate Time Warner in 2018, has soured in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a plunge in movie theater attendance weighs on its film revenue. 
WarnerMedia, the segment that contains HBO and the company’s movie and TV studio, generated revenue of $7.5 billion in the third quarter of 2020, down from $8.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
Thanks to more people seeking entertainment at home, however, AT&T reported 38 million subscribers in the United States for both its premium TV channel HBO and HBO Max during the third quarter, reaching its goal for 2021 a year early.

TPG, which previously invested in companies in the sector such as U.S. regional cable TV operator Astound and Spanish language broadcaster Univision, has about $85 billion in assets under management, according to its website.

Last month an Italian administrative court removed regulatory curbs that capped Vivendi's voting stake in Mediaset at 10%, potentially giving back to the French group voting rights on its full 29% holding.
That could give Vivendi powers to block any extraordinary resolutions at Mediaset shareholder meetings as well as help it to secure some representatives on the board of the Italian firm, which is controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
The two groups have been locked in a legal battle since 2016 when Vivendi ditched an accord to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit and built a stake which Mediaset considers hostile.
Mediaset declined to comment. Vivendi could not be immediately reached for comment.

A United spokeswoman confirmed that the company was ""strongly considering"" making vaccines compulsory, though it isn't a policy yet.
""I think the right thing to do is for United Airlines, and for other companies, to require the vaccines and to make them mandatory,"" Kirby said. 
""If others go along and are willing to start to mandate vaccines, you should probably expect United to be amongst the first wave of companies that do it.""
CNBC had earlier reported the news of Kirby wanting to mandate the vaccine for employees.
Private U.S. companies can require employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19, but are unlikely to do so because of the risks of legal and cultural backlash, experts have said.

Companies are still in the early stages of navigating access and distribution of vaccines against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but inoculation is considered the key to safely resume operations at crowded warehouses, factory lines and on sales floors.

Donald Trump's White House issued an executive order in November banning Americans from investing in companies the U.S. Defense Department says have ties to China's military - an assertion many of the firms deny and that China's government says lacks evidence.
While a number of the 44 firms listed on the Defense Department list have been cut from various equity indexes or seen their securities delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, fixed income markets are still grappling with the impact as many bonds are issued through subsidiaries rather than main companies.
In a note to clients written earlier in the week and ahead of the publication of a full list of subsidiaries that are owned 50% or more by Communist Chinese military companies, JPMorgan estimated that around ""US$55-60 billion of bonds would be affected if/when the Treasury acts.""
Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office on Wednesday, has not spelled out any plans for his predecessor Donald Trump's executive order forcing the divestment but could easily revoke it. 
Much focus was on debt issued by China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) - of the affected issues the most widely owned by U.S.-based investors or those with a U.S. presence, according to JPMorgan. 
ChemChina had already suffered $1 billion of forced selling in the wake of the executive order and could see another $1.3 billion of outflows from affected investors, JPMorgan calculated. 
Looking at China National Offshore Oil Corp's (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) $19.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated debt, over $3.2 billion was held by funds domiciled in the United States and $3.5 billion could be affected if the scope was broadened to all asset managers with U.S. presence, JPMorgan found. 
""However, we think that for investors who can buy the bonds, they should use that round of selling, which we think would be the last round, if at all, to take the opposite view and buy some of these affected bonds,"" JPMorgan said. 
For the companies themselves, removing U.S. investors from the equation would only have a limited impact, JPMorgan added.

""Their dependence on offshore investors for funding needs is low with offshore USD bonds forming a very small part of their capital structure,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Boeing says its fleet will be able to fly on 100% biofuel by 2030,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Friday it will begin delivering commercial airplanes capable of flying on 100% biofuel by the end of the decade, calling reducing environmental damage from fossil fuels the ""challenge of our lifetime.""
Boeing's goal - which requires advances to jet systems, raising fuel-blending requirements, and safety certification by global regulators - is central to a broader industry target of slashing carbon emissions in half by 2050, the U.S. planemaker said. 
""It's a tremendous challenge, it's the challenge of our lifetime,"" Boeing Director of Sustainability Strategy Sean Newsum told Reuters. ""Aviation is committed to doing its part to reduce its carbon footprint.""
Commercial flying currently accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions and about 12% of transport emissions, according to data cited by the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG).
Boeing essentially has just a decade to reach its target because jetliners that enter service in 2030 will typically stay in service through 2050. 
The world's largest aerospace company must also confront the task hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic and the 20-month grounding of its best-selling jetliner after fatal crashes, which has strained its finances and engineering resources. 
Boeing isn't starting from scratch. In 2018, it staged the world's first commercial airplane flight using 100% biofuel on a FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) 777 freighter.
Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) also work on reducing carbon emissions through weight and drag reduction on new aircraft.
As it is now, biofuels are mixed directly with conventional jet fuel up to a 50/50 blend, which is the maximum allowed under current fuel specifications, Boeing said.
Boeing first must determine what changes to make to enable safe flight on alternative fuels derived from used vegetable oil, animal fats, sugar cane, waste and other sources.

Boeing needs to work with groups that set fuel specifications such ASTM International to raise the blending limit to allow expanded use, and then convince aviation regulators globally to certify the planes as safe, Boeing said.

RLX's shares opened at $22.34, well above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $12 per share. Shares were up 58% in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The Beijing-based company offered 116.5 million shares in its IPO, raising $1.4 billion, after having earlier targeted a price range of $8 to $10 per share.
RLX's debut comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Chinese listings from the U.S. government. Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation last month to delist Chinese companies that do not adhere to American auditing standards.
Chinese firms in 2020 raised $13.5 billion in IPOs in the United States, up from $3.5 billion in the previous year.
Founded in 2018, the company sells vaping products under the RELX brand name and is headed by Kate Wang, the former head of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's China operations.
RLX posted a net income of 108.6 million yuan ($16.76 million) on net revenue of 2.2 billion yuan ($339.45 million) for the nine months ended Sep. 30, 2020, according to a filing. https://

Microsoft's cloud business is well-positioned to double in value, according to Goldman. 
“Microsoft stands out very uniquely in the technology world given its strong presence across all layers of the cloud stack including applications platforms and infrastructure,"" CNBC Pro reported Goldman as saying. ""Our investment thesis is that Microsoft is well positioned to double its $60bn+ commercial cloud business (Azure, Office 365, Dynamics, and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) Commercial) into a $120bn to $140bn business longer term.”
The firm set a price target of $285, which compares to the average $252, according to data compiled by Investing.com. 
""Microsoft’s installed base of on premise Windows Servers (25-30mn GSe) alone represents $80bn to $90bn in potential Azure business. New customers and new workloads from existing customers would represent upside to this number,"" StreetInsider reported Goldman as saying. The company is on the way to generating about $15.83 in earnings per share in 2026.
Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, sees one or more catalyst helping Microsoft's price jump in the next 15 to 60 days, StreetInsider said. 
“MSFT represents a rare combination of strong secular positioning AND a reasonable valuation in software. With shares lagging the overall software group over past 3 months, we see an attractive setup into the print,"" Morgan Stanley wrote in a note.
Among their reasons: Covid-19 headwinds are easing to ease, strong PC shipment data and the potential for continued gross margin expansion in coming years. The firm has a price target of $260 on the Bill Gates-founded company. The shares are currently trading around $228.

240,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 10:52AM ET</span>",Etsy was a Pandemic Darling. How it Can Keep the Magic Going,"By Christiana Sciaudone and Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- It’s hard to feel special when someone hands you another generic set of tropical-scented moisturizers. That’s Etsy’s staying power.
The e-commerce purveyor of unique and handcrafted items makes people aspire for more than just another Bath & Body Works gift basket picked up without a second thought -- who needs a new variation on shower gel?
But for investors, there might not be much more room for gains after a stunning rise last year. Investing.com’s Christiana Sciaudone explains why Etsy is still a buy, while Liz Moyer takes the bear case.
The Bull Case
The numbers speak for themselves.
 Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s gross merchandise sales for the third quarter rose 119% from a year earlier; revenue rose 128%; and profit was up 520%.
For comparison, take eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN), examples of new and old school rivals.
eBay reported third quarter gross merchandise volume up 22% with sales ahead 25% and profit rising 27% from a year earlier. Nordstrom, meanwhile, saw revenue drop 16% in the third quarter, and profit fall 58%. Not so swell.
The strong results are “evidence of our focused execution, engagement with our buyers and sellers, and our strong brand, underpinned by the unique inventory in our marketplace,” said Chief Executive Officer Josh Silverman in a statement in October, when the stock got a slew of price target increases (it got a bunch more this month, post-holidays).
“Consumer shopping habits have been greatly influenced by the events of 2020, and Etsy truly stands for something different. We’ve been able to sustain growth by driving retention and frequency of our existing buyers as well as becoming an important shopping destination for new buyers.”
The key to the future, of course, is growth, and Etsy’s poised for it in spades.
“2020 demonstrates the scalability and value of our marketplace business model,” said Chief Financial Officer Rachel Glaser in the same statement. “We have a very disciplined approach to our investments with a goal to deliver profitable long-term growth.”
Etsy reported about 69 million active buyers in the third quarter. That’s versus eBay’s 183 million, which was founded in 1995, 10 years prior to Etsy. The potential is massive.
Last month, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) called Etsy a “primary beneficiary of home nesting,” StreetInsider said. Analyst John Colantuoni reiterated a buy rating on the stock.
“While most e-commerce players are competing to sell the same products, ETSY’s marketplace sells unique and handmade goods. By offering products consumers can’t find elsewhere, ETSY is able to stay relevant even as other e-commerce players like AMZN are making unprecedented investments in logistics and delivery capabilities,” Colantuoni said. “We think ETSY’s competitive moat allows it to operate from a position of strength with sellers, affording them ongoing monetization opportunities without risking material churn.”
He pointed out, too, that Etsy represents a blush of the total market despite strong growth in 2020 -- a signal of so much more to come.
“Total retail spending is $1.7T across all relevant categories in ETSY’s top 6 geographies. While not every purchase occasion is for something unique, at just ~$10B in gross merchandise sales (GMS (NYSE:GMS)) ETSY is still a small fraction of the total market,” Colantuoni said.
Earlier this month, Roth Capital analyst Darren Aftahi reiterated a buy rating and $235 price target on Etsy thanks to traffic data that accelerated from one quarter to the next and in each month of the fourth quarter, suggesting gross merchandise sales remained on par with the 90% bump seen in September and October.
“While mask related sales could aid, we believe the holiday could have a further impact due to ETSY’s much larger buyer base y/y, along with enhanced marketing initiatives,” according to a Jan. 14 note by Roth Capital’s Aftahi, StreetInsider reported. “All said, while topline growth may decelerate on the margin, fundamentals remain strong as does the capture of initial COVID related sales.”
Forget the mass-produced white tea and sage gentle foaming hand wash. Go for something truly distinctive, like a personalized engraved wood ballpoint pen or a drawing of your future soulmate paired with a psychic reading. And buy Etsy.
The Bear Case
Etsy has been quite a hit with the stay-at-home and shop the internet crowd. Its 73% increase in Cyber Monday online customer spending smashed that of  Target  (NYSE:TGT) (43%) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (19%), according to data reported by The Wall Street Journal. Enchanting television ads featuring unique gifts and unusual craft items undoubtedly lifted holiday sales in general.
Shares of Etsy are up more than 19% in one month while the S&P 500 is up about 2.6%. Earnings per share are expected to be 57 cents for the fourth quarter, up 136% from the same period in 2019. Revenue is expected to jump 90%.
So what’s the problem? Masks.
According to Forbes, more than $600 million of the $5.3 billion spent on Etsy last summer and fall came from the sale of face masks, or 11%. The strong number was behind the doubling of sales volume on Etsy in the third quarter.
But people aren’t going to be buying face masks forever, and there’s probably a maximum saturation point for how many a household needs to have on hand. In addition, the big shopping season is behind us, leaving less of an excuse to scroll online for unique gift items.
Simply put, Etsy’s had a remarkable run, but the stunning growth during pandemic times could be “as good as it gets,” according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which recently reiterated a sell-equivalent on the stock and put a $93 price target on it, which is far below the $212 where it currently trades.
Based on analyst forecasts, growth is expected to slow this year. The EPS estimate for year-end 2021 per share profit is $2.17, which is just 2% higher than the year-end consensus for 2020.
In fact, many of the current Street price targets are below the current trading price, despite several analysts being optimistic on the near term.
Another contrarian is Stifel’s Scott Devitt, who last month downgraded it to hold and a price target of $170, saying the stock trades at 12 times his 2021 revenue estimate.
“We believe the pandemic has generated significant awareness for the platform pulling forward several years of buyer acquisition,” Devitt wrote.
Potential challenges this year for Etsy: The reopening of business and return to life as semi-normal (though to be fair, masks will continue to be worn). That all means people will return to malls and stores and order less stuff online, if only for a break and the chance to stretch their legs and leave the house.

Investing.com --  Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s ecommerce efforts as a result of the coronavirus will continue paying dividends, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Shares are up 0.56% on Friday as the firm reiterated a buy rating and a $177 price target on the retailer. Walmart is currently trading around $145. 
Analyst Stephanie Wissink said Walmart's extensive physical presence and its evolving omnichannel offer margin upside, according to StreetInsider. 
""WMT's store based fulfillment and labor investments enabled the co. to further transition to e-com mode during the height of the pandemic, resulting in robust growth and significantly lower e-com losses YTD,"" Wissink said in a note.
The company should show improving general merchandise mix and picking up/shipping efficiencies that will add to digital share gains and profitability, Wissink said. 
The analysts raised earnings estimates on Walmart as a result. 
Earnings per share for the most recent quarter came in at $1.34 compared to $1.16 a year earlier. Wissink estimates profit for the fourth quarter of 2021 at $1.53, StreetInsider said.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Walmart expands vaccinations in boost to U.S. COVID-19 program,"By Melissa Fares and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK/ LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said it is preparing to offer COVID-19 vaccinations in seven more states, as well as in Chicago and Puerto Rico, this week and next, expanding beyond the two states where its pharmacists are offering inoculations.
The move from the world's largest retailer comes as U.S. President Joe Biden races to accelerate a frustratingly slow vaccination campaign that has stranded about half of the 38 million shots distributed in freezers rather than in arms.
This week and next, Walmart will start providing inoculations in Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas as well as in Chicago and Puerto Rico, a company spokeswoman told Reuters late on Thursday. The shots will only be available to specific populations decided by each state and only at a handful of stores in each state.
Walmart is already vaccinating healthcare workers in New Mexico and its home state of Arkansas.
Alabama's health officer, Scott Harris, on Thursday said the state would partner with Walmart to provide COVID-19 vaccinations. Walmart confirmed that deal, which falls under a federal partnership that Biden on Thursday said would launch in early February.
Harris said another deal, with a major pharmacy chain, is coming soon.
Walgreens, CVS, Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) have also stepped up to vaccinate Americans in what is the largest and most complex immunization effort in U.S. history. Those shots are needed to help stop the virus, which has killed more than 400,000 and infected more than 24 million people in the United States.
The Trump administration punted vaccine planning to states, which were asked to come up with their own plans, a move that left many pharmacy chains and supermarket-based pharmacies in limbo.
“We’re having to be flexible as we try to operate state-by-state, but we feel like it’s absolutely the right thing to do, to lean into this and help figure it out,” Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said at the Consumer Electronics Show last week. “That’s the approach that we’re taking.""
He said Walmart is “making sure that we can handle the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine, the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine and do so appropriately and safely.”
Walmart said in a blog post on Friday it expects to be able to deliver 10 million to 13 million doses per month at full capacity, using its network of more than 5,000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico.
The retailer also said it is positioned to serve “healthcare deserts” - rural areas lacking in healthcare facilities - and will host COVID-19 vaccination events in underserved communities at churches, stadiums and youth centers.
A spokesperson from the Texas Department of State Health Services said many of Walmart’s pharmacies have enrolled as vaccine providers in the state, but that “only a handful” have received the doses so far due to limited supply. “Once there’s a broader supply and we can regularly start allocating to more pharmacies, they will be included,” the spokesperson said.

Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson told Reuters it plans to “continue and expand” its existing partnership with Walmart, and that as additional vaccine doses become available, Walmart has agreed to be a key part of its distribution plan.

Rent and occupancy will likely drop 22% in San Francisco in 2021, the largest decline in the U.S., as technology companies embrace remote work, according to a report by Green Street.
The second-biggest drop, at 17%, will be in New York, where office towers have been largely empty for months as finance firms ride out the pandemic with most of their employees at home.
“San Francisco and New York will likely see a permanent resetting of rents as people and businesses look more toward the middle of the country for expansion,” said Danny Ismail, an analyst at Green Street. “It’s unlikely that rents and occupancy will return to a level pre-Covid over the next few years.”
San Francisco and New York, longtime hubs for tech and finance companies, have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. As tenants try to cost costs, they’re reevaluating how much space they need and looking to cheaper states to open offices.
Some cities are benefiting from the migration. Nashville, Tennessee; Charlotte, North Carolina; Austin, Texas; and Atlanta are each expected to post slight growth in rent and occupancy, according to Green Street.
Overall, demand for office space in the U.S. is expected to fall by roughly 15% through 2025 due to growing work-from-home trends, Green Street said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday on fears that the Covid-19 pandemic will do more damage over a longer period than thought, even despite the rollout of vaccines across the world.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 217 points, or 0.7%, at 30,864 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%. 
On Thursday, President Joe Biden had warned of another 100,000 deaths in this U.S. in the coming month, in an abrupt change of style from his predecessor, as regards the management of popular expectations. The emergence of new strains of the virus across the world, including some that are more easily transmitted than the original variant, has increasingly weighed on global markets this week, with regional lockdowns in parts of China and Europe all casting doubt over the narrative of a vigorous economic rebound in 2021.
On a light day for data, the U.S. bucked the trend seen in most of the world by reporting an improvement in economic activity in January, according to the purchasing managers index compiled by IHS Markit. Its U.S. manufacturing PMI rose surprisingly to 59.1 from 57.1, defying expectations of a drop. The services PMI also rose. By contrast, the Eurozone and U.K. PMIs in Europe had both fallen, under the impact of lockdowns that have been extended and tightened through the month. 
Elsewhere overnight, the Japanese government was forced to deny reports that it had already resigned itself to rescheduling the summer Olympic Games this year, which had already been rescheduled once last year due to the pandemic. Outbreaks of Covid-19 in various cities in China have also stoked fears that the world's second-largest economy may not be able to stay fully open.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) stock stood out among early movers with a 10.7% decline on the back of yet another disappointing quarterly update, in which revenue fell for a fourth straight quarter. The company's CEO Arvind Krishna promised a return to growth in 2021. 
Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) stock, another big index heavyweight, also weighed on the broader market, falling 6.9% after new CEO Pat Gelsinger said he wanted to outsource more chip production. The change in strategic direction overshadowed what was a better-than-expected fourth quarter for Intel, thanks to strong sales of PC and other appliances driven by the trend to remote working and learning.
The two blue chips overshadowed another hot set of data from the housing market, which showed existing home sales rose to their highest level in 14 years in December."
248,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 09:35AM ET</span>","Turning coronavirus corner, Volkswagen's profit falls less than feared","By Kirsti Knolle, Nick Carey and Christoph Steitz
BERLIN/LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s profit almost halved last year due to the impact of the pandemic, but a rebound in premium car sales in China and stronger deliveries in the fourth quarter helped keep the world's largest carmaker in the black.
The group said on Friday operating profit, excluding costs related to its diesel emissions scandal, came in at 10 billion euros ($12.2 billion), compared with 19.3 billion in 2019. 
Analysts had expected an operating profit of 4.8 billion euros, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Net cash flow at its automotive division was around 6 billion euros and car deliveries picked up towards the end of the year, the German group said in a statement.
""The magnitude of the beat is welcome and supportive of upcoming full-year results across the industry,"" analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) wrote in a note.
The performance caps a turbulent 2020 for Volkswagen and the auto industry. A pandemic-fuelled sales slump led to a loss in the second quarter before Volkswagen swung back to profitability in the third quarter on the back of soaring demand for luxury vehicles in China, the world's largest car market. 
Volkswagen's shares hit their highest in 11 months after Friday's earnings release. They were up 2.7% at 166.4 euros in early afternoon trading.
Top shareholder Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which holds 31.4% of Volkswagen and 53.1% of the group's voting rights, said it would likely post a significantly positive profit after taxes for 2020 thanks to Volkswagen's performance.
Volkswagen's truck making unit Traton SE also posted a full-year adjusted operating profit of 135 million euros, far better than a loss of 625 million euros analysts had predicted. Traton said sales had ""continued to recover strongly in the fourth quarter."" 
Sales at Volkswagen rose 1.7% in December, at a time when new car registrations in Europe dropped nearly 4%, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed.
Volkswagen and its rivals still face challenges due to the pandemic, including a global shortage of chips needed for production and ongoing shutdowns in various markets to combat the outbreak, meaning 2021 will be another tough year. 
It also faces tough competition in developing electrified and self-driving cars. The merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-owner PSA to create the world's fourth-biggest automaker Stellantis adds to the pressure.
Volkswagen said on Thursday it missed EU targets on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its passenger car fleet last year and faces a fine of more than 100 million euros.

The group is expected to release detailed 2020 figures on March 16.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 09:26AM ET</span>","After Brexit, Ireland and France cut out the middleman: Britain","By Richard Lough and Padraic Halpin
CHERBOURG, France/DUBLIN (Reuters) - From his office overlooking Cherbourg docks, general manager Yannick Millet points to trailers destined for Ireland that belong to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), new customers and a signal of a potential big shift in post-Brexit trade.
Confronted by red tape and delays after Britain's messy exit from the European Union, Irish traders are shipping goods directly to and from European ports, shunning the once-speedier route through Britain.
""You see the shift in supply chains right here,"" he said. 
All five operators connecting Ireland to mainland Europe have increased ferry services in the past nine months, with some bringing forward planned sailings and others moving larger ships away from quieter British routes to meet new demand.
Millet forecast Cherbourg would handle 9,000 trucks in January, equivalent to almost a quarter of what passed through the French port annually before the COVID-19 crisis.
For decades, the land bridge offered Irish traders the swiftest, most reliable route to continental Europe. It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route. 
But post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.
""This is a game-changer,"" said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland's Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added. 
Cherbourg's business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.
""I thought traffic would double but it has tripled,"" he said. ""The question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.""
AVOIDING THE MIDDLEMAN
Stena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January. 
Irish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.
Danish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were ""pretty much full"". Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of ""land bridge"" traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week. 
""We're blown away by the demand,"" Coffey said.
No one knows if the shift is permanent.
The Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes. 
Eddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland's transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.
Ferry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena's operations chief in Cherbourg. Reverting to land bridge routes was simple, he said. ""We just take the ships off and go back to the old system."" 
RENAISSANCE
It gives ports like Cherbourg and Ireland's Rosslare a narrow window to persuade traders that the longer sea crossing between Ireland and mainland Europe is commercially viable for just-in-time logistics.
Eighteen months ago, Rosslare on the southeastern tip of Ireland was struggling. Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth. 
Now its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.
Carr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.
""I was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, 'Glenn, are you putting on more services?'""
An 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port's Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.
""Brexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,"" he said.

DETROIT/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian state's move to block General Motors (NYSE:GM) from shutting a plant and exiting the country defies the state's business friendly image and sends a ""concerning message"" to potential future investors, the U.S. automaker said on Friday.
GM's comments came after authorities in Maharashtra earlier this week rejected the automaker's application to cease operations at its plant in the western Indian state amid protests by workers who demanded GM continue production or keep them on the payroll indefinitely, according to local media. 
The decision runs counter to Maharashtra's business-friendly reputation, a GM spokesman said in a statement. ""It sends a concerning message to any potential future investors who want to bring jobs and investment to the state.""
GM stopped selling cars in India, the world's second most populous nation, at the end of 2017 after years of low sales. It sold one of its two factories in the country to China's SAIC Motor Corp and continued to build vehicles for export at its second plant until Dec. 24.
In January 2020, it agreed to sell its second factory in the state's Talegaon district to Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co, but tensions between India and China have delayed completion of that deal.
GM said it planned to seek a reversal of the state's order as soon as possible. 
""Effectively, the state's decision amounts to a requirement that GM either produce vehicles for which there are no customer orders, or pay workers indefinitely for doing no work. We reject both suggestions,"" the spokesman said, adding production would not resume. 

GM is offering higher than the statutory severance pay to its roughly 1,500 workers at the plant, amounting to nearly two years of salary and is willing to negotiate further, said a source with knowledge of the matter.

Weekly Wirtschaftswoche reported on Friday that two law firms, Hausfeld and Tilp, are pressing civil charges with a court in Cologne, Germany, on behalf of investors who were affected by the drop in the share price in the wake of the Roundup litigation and later settlement.
Bayer acknowledged in a statement it was being sued and said it would defend itself against what it described as unfounded claims.
""Bayer conducted appropriate due diligence regarding the acquisition process. This has also been confirmed by the studies of independent experts,"" a Bayer spokesman said in a statement.
The German drugs and pesticides maker agreed to acquire seed maker Monsanto in 2016 and its shares plunged in 2018 when it lost court cases in the United States to plaintiffs who alleged that the use of Roundup caused their cancer.
An $11 billion outline settlement of those cases in June last year has turned out to be $750 million more expensive amid a struggle to finalise the deal.
The shares are down about 45% since Bayer lost the first Roundup court case in August 2018.

Wirtschaftswoche said that the court hearings in Germany were not expected to begin before the end of 2021.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - The United States remains a ""beacon of technology"" to be emulated and China's Huawei Technology should consider cutting products in the wake of U.S. actions against it, the Chinese firm's founder Ren Zhengfei said in remarks made public on Friday.
Ren's comments, in a letter to staff dated June of last year, were shared for the first time on a company message board, making them the first public word from the company since Joe Biden took over the presidency from Donald Trump.
Huawei has remained largely silent about its prospects under the Biden administration, after being targeted with several rounds of sanctions under Trump, who said Huawei's equipment poses a security risk. The company denies the charge.
In a parting shot on Monday, the Commerce Department told semiconductor makers it would deny or revoke licenses for companies including chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to sell products to Huawei, people familiar with the matter told Reuters..
Ren's letter said that U.S. actions had left Huawei ""with a great mismatch between our strategy and our abilities, and that the company will have to revaluate some product lines, and consider cutting some products and staff that are unproductive.
The letter was posted publicly after former Huawei subbrand Honor announced new supply partnerships with major chip companies including Intel and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) that it had previously lost access to due to the U.S. action against the parent.
Huawei sold Honor to a consortium of the latter's agents and dealers in November in a bid to help it regain access to chips.
Ren's letter also said that while the company will keep its pay structure unchanged over the next three to five years, hundreds of senior 'cadres' had voluntarily taken demotions.
The letter did not mention the Biden administration specifically, though analysts have said the company will need a reprieve from Washington to revive its hobbled phone and 5G infrastructure businesses. 
""The United States is still the world's beacon of technology, and we must learn everything we can from advanced people,"" Ren said.

255,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Fall 232 Pts; IBM And Intel Weigh,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen weakening Friday, after disappointing news from a couple of tech giants and as a record-breaking week, highlighted by Joe Biden’s inauguration, comes to a close.
At 7:25 AM ET (1225 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 262 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 29 points, or 0.8%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 79 points, or 0.6%. 
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs on Thursday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average just missed the same fate, ending marginally lower. All three indices are set to close the week with strong gains, the fifth higher week in six.
Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, and will mark his third day in office by signing executive orders to boost food benefits for impoverished Americans as well as workers’ rights.
However, it’s the passage of his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package through Congress that is attracting attention, amid opposition from Republicans who question the size of the bill given last month’s $900 billion deal.
Staying in Washington, the Senate is expected later Friday to confirm Janet Yellen, a former head of the Federal Reserve, as Biden’s Treasury secretary. 
In corporate news, the tech sector is set to be in focus Friday after both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) reported quarterly results late Thursday. Both stocks are expected to head sharply lower, Intel weighed by the news that financially sensitive information had been hacked as well as plans to do more licensing deals with rivals, while IBM missed revenue expectations.
The earnings season continues Friday, with oilfield services company Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and transportation holding company Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) due, both offering slightly lower profiles than the two tech giants.
The data slate includes the final PMI data for January, but investors may study the existing home sales release for December to see whether the uptick in Covid-19 sales is hurting this previously buoyant sector.
Oil prices weakened Friday on concerns that a rise of Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s largest importer, will severely impact demand, given the reintroduction of restrictive measures.
Shanghai reported the first locally transmitted cases in two months on Thursday, while Beijing is now urging tens of millions of urban workers not to travel back to their largely rural families during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release its weekly inventory report later Friday, a couple of days later than usual. This follows the American Petroleum Institute recording crude inventories rising 2.6 million barrels earlier in the week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $52.30 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.6% to $54.64. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,848.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2175.

The world's fourth-biggest carmaker was officially created on Saturday from the merger of Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Peugeot-maker PSA, with former PSA boss Tavares becoming group CEO.
FCA and PSA pledged to achieve the savings without closing any plants, and Tavares earlier this week also committed to not cutting jobs.
In a gesture welcomed by Italy's unions, the CEO is visiting some of the group's main production sites in the country: Turin's Mirafiori on Wednesday, Melfi in the south on Thursday and Cassino in the centre on Friday. 
Marco Lomio of the UILM union in the Basilicata region, where Melfi is located, said Tavares took time to listen to and answer all questions.
""It had never happened that a CEO had sat down to take questions from representatives at such a grassroot level,"" he said.
FCA CEO ""Mike Manley had never paid us a visit at the plant. Tavares seems to be more in line with the style of former CEO Sergio Marchionne,"" Lomio added.
Earlier in the week, Tavares held a virtual meeting with the heads of Italy's national metalworker unions. The meeting was scheduled shortly after it was requested and was seen as an ""act of respect"" by Francesca Re David, who leads leftist metalworker union FIOM.
""It is important that he met all the unions and that he highlighted the need to invest in intellect, creativity and skills of Italian workers,"" she said.
Italy and France are Stellantis' two main production hubs in Europe, but Italian unions fear that after the merger the group's centre of gravity could shift towards Paris.

257,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 05:58AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Siemens Rides Chinese Demand to All-Time High,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The days when German engineering giant  Siemens  (OTC:SIEGY) was a bellwether for all European industry are long gone, but there is still a big read-across from its surprise update this morning, which again underlined the importance of the Chinese economy for the rest of the world.
Siemens (DE:SIEGn) stock in Frankfurt rose as much as 6.1% to another all-time high, before retracing a bit to be up 4.9% by 5:35 AM ET (1035 GMT). They’re now up 30% from their pre-pandemic high, something that reflects both the outperformance of manufacturing versus services in general in recent months, but also the unlocking of value through outgoing CEO Joe Kaeser’s decentralization strategy.
An upward revision to guidance would take the pressure off a valuation that, at over 21 times trailing 12-month earnings, is looking stretched by historical standards. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization were more than 40% ahead of consensus in the core Digital Industries segment and 30% ahead in the Smart Infrastructure segment. Only Mobility lagged, due largely to the chilling effect of the pandemic on mass transport.
The numbers, coming on the heels of fresh assurances by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday, suggest that the company will have no problems with a heavy refinancing schedule this year.
It was China’s factories that were principally responsible for the orders that drove Siemens’ revenue and profits so far above expectations in the three months through December that it had to tell the stock exchange it may revise its guidance when it releases its full quarterly results in 10 days’ time.
That underlines what’s at stake as the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden determines the extent to which it will continue Donald Trump’s economic war on China.  
Comments from Secretary of State designate Anthony Binken this week, which endorsed the use of the term ‘genocide’ to describe China’s treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority in the province of Xinjiang, reinforce impressions that Biden will be slow to relax the pressure on Beijing. In such a context, an expansion of sanctions against individual Chinese officials and companies seems quite possible.
But efforts to form a united front with Europe against China will be complicated as long as big employers like Siemens thrive on doing business with it – especially if other sources of demand are lacking. The EU has just signed an investment treaty with China that will open further doors to European industry there, and business will be eager to exploit that. The harsh reality is that European capital goods companies like Siemens do very well out of fulfilling China’s ambition to be the workshop of the world. It will take a fiendishly clever combination of carrot and stick on the U.S.’s part to change that."

259,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>","Long road for Tesla in India with infrastructure, supply chain woes","By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is gearing up for an India launch but the U.S. electric carmaker is likely to remain a niche player for years, catering only to the rich and affluent in the world's second-most populous nation.
India's fledgling electric vehicle (EV) market accounted for only 5,000 out of a total 2.4 million cars sold in the country last year. A lack of local production of components and batteries, negligible charging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs mean there have been few takers in the price-conscious market.
It's also difficult to see how Tesla's sought-after and expensive autonomous driving features will work on India's congested roads.
Ammar Master, a forecaster at consultancy LMC Automotive, said he expects Tesla to annually sell only 50-100 of its Model 3 electric sedans in India, at least in the first five years. 
""As a country, India is still not so environmentally conscious to pay that much of a premium,"" Master said. 
""It always comes down to the price point. There will be some high net-worth individuals like movie stars and top business executives who will look at it for the brand value. But then, how many buyers are there?""
The world's most valuable automobile manufacturer registered a local company in India earlier this month, a step towards its entry in the country, expected to be as early as mid-2021.
Tesla plans to import and sell the Model 3 in India for around $65,000-$75,000 - roughly double the price in the U.S. market, sources familiar with the plans said.
This means it will compete in India's even smaller luxury EV segment that has recently started seeing interest from the likes of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes Benz.
The Mercedes Benz EQC, India's first luxury EV launched in October for $136,000, and has since sold 31 units, according to auto researcher JATO Dynamics. British luxury carmarker JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), plans to launch its I-PACE EV before March. It sells in the United States for around $70,000.
Although India's road infrastructure has improved in recent years, traffic discipline - like lane driving - is still rudimentary. Auto analysts say that means many of Tesla's features like the automatic lane changing function will be tough to deploy on crowded Indian streets. 
Stray animals, including cattle, and potholes on the road are a further problem.
""Most of Tesla's high technology features will be redundant and users will not get the bang for the buck despite paying premium prices"", said Ravi Bhatia, president for India at JATO Dynamics.
LOCAL PRODUCTION
Rohan Patel, a senior public policy executive at Tesla in the United States, is among those leading efforts around its India launch, the sources familiar with the plans said. The EV giant is looking to hire 15-20 people mainly for sales and marketing, one source said.
Tesla and Patel did not respond to a request for comment.
India has some of the world's most polluted cities and wants more clean cars on its roads, but the federal government still does not have a comprehensive policy like China which mandates carmakers to invest in the segment.
One reason is that auto manufacturers have pushed back saying there is no demand for EVs in India as costs of components like batteries remain high, and push up prices.
And Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself expressed concern about India's high import taxes on cars.
In contrast to India, China sold 1.25 million new energy passenger vehicles, including EVs, in 2020 out of total sales of 20 million.
Tesla is a major player in China, which last year accounted for more than a third of the carmaker's global sales, according to JATO Dynamics, and where it also has a factory.
Daniel Ives of U.S.-based Wedbush Securities said however that within 7-8 years, India could account for 5% of Tesla's total sales. The key to success, however, will be local manufacturing, he said.
""It is a matter of when, not if, they build out a factory in India,"" said Ives, adding that building out a local supply chain will be a multi-year effort. 

""India is a potential sweet spot and Tesla does not want to be late to the game.""

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global shares slipped off record highs on Friday as gloomy data reminded investors of the struggles facing the economic recovery, curbing a rally fuelled by hopes of U.S. stimulus by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden. 
Sentiment in Europe was already more cautious after Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, in which the bank's message was perceived as more hawkish than expected.
The yield on Italian 10-year benchmark bonds touched its highest since early November on reports that Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte may be tempted by the prospect of a snap election.
The Euro STOXX 600 was 0.8% weaker as investors digested weaker flash PMI readings for January. Lockdown restrictions to contain the coronavirus pandemic hit the bloc's dominant service industry.
The FTSE 100 index slipped 0.5% as data showed British retailers struggled to recover in December from a partial coronavirus lockdown the previous month.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in almost 50 countries, was 0.2% softer following three straight sessions of gains. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 stumbled 0.53%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific stocks outside of Japan was 0.8% lower.
The risk-off mood followed a period of relief after the transition of power in the United States, culminating in Biden's inauguration on Wednesday and strong expectations that U.S. stimulus will provide continued support for global assets. 
""The fact that there would be U.S. stimulus was well known and the size of the package and the very high-level details of what they're aiming for with the package was well known some while ago,"" said James Athey, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""The realities of what is likely to be achievable relatively quickly are not supportive of just blindly buying cyclical assets. There's a lot more nuance and a lot more politics to go on before we get there.""
Republicans in the U.S. Congress have indicated they are willing to work with Biden on his administration's top priority, a $1.9 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus plan, though some are opposed to the price tag.
Democrats took control of the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, though they will still need Republican support to pass the program.
China's composite stock index slid 0.4%, while the blue-chip CSI300 index edged up 0.1%.
Travel plans were in limbo for tens of millions of people in China's northern cities. They have been under some kind of lockdown amid worries that undetected coronavirus infections could spread quickly during the Lunar New Year holiday, which is just weeks away. 
China reported 103 COVID-19 cases on Friday. 
In currency markets, the U.S. dollar paused after three straight days of losses, though it was still on track for its biggest weekly loss since mid-December. The currency was flat on the day at 90.118.
The Japanese yen was down around 0.1% against the dollar, at 103.63.
Data from Japan overnight showed that factory activity slipped into contraction in January and the services sector was more pessimistic as emergency measures to combat a COVID-19 resurgence hit sentiment.
The dollar's recent slide has been led by investors ploughing money into higher-yielding currencies on optimism about a rapid economic recovery led by the U.S. stimulus.
In commodities, oil prices were weighed down by worries that new pandemic restrictions in China will curb fuel demand in the world's biggest oil importer. [O/R]

Investing.com - European stock markets traded lower Friday, ending a generally positive week on a cautious note amid concerns that growing Covid-19 cases will stunt economic growth.  
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.6%.
U.K. retail sales only grew 0.3% in December, weaker than expected, as retailers struggled to recover in the crucial holiday period from a partial coronavirus lockdown the previous month, marking a weak end to their worst year on record.
Additionally, the euro-zone composite PMI, which fell to 47.5 from 49.1 in December, suggested the region was struggling to show any economic growth in the first month of the new year.
This follows European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warning Thursday that ever-increasing Covid-19 numbers and restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to curb the spread of the virus could challenge the region’s economic outlook.
Lagarde also indicated more clearly than ever that the ECB would not use the full amount of its chief bond buying program if it doesn't need to.  
European governments are having to cope with a surge in Covid-19 cases, with Britain, for example, posting a fresh record in daily deaths on Wednesday, for the second day running.  
Equity markets have posted strong gains so far this week, reflecting relief over an orderly transition of power in the United States and strong expectations that U.S. stimulus will provide continued support for global assets.

The non-performing loan ratio of the banking sector was 1.92% at the end of 2020, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a statement.

""Currently, the risk level of single banking institutions, regional banking sectors, or the whole financial system, are all under control,"" Xiao said.
In terms of regional financial stress, Xiao urged mid-sized and smaller banks to ""resist the temptation of blind expansion"" and stick to home markets. 
China's commercial banks posted 2 trillion yuan in net profits in 2020, down 1.8% from a year earlier, the CBIRC Friday data showed, a rare annual profit fall for the sector because the economy has been weakened by the coronavirus pandemic.

""There are big bubbles in consumer, health care and liquor stocks, with valuations of some of these shares exceeding their previous record highs,"" said Dong Baozhen, chairman of Beijing-based private securities fund Lingtong Shengtai Investment Management. 
""Their rally has nothing to do with fundamentals now and poses huge risks for investors,"" he added.
In the latest example of retail frenzy, a Chinese mutual fund attracted a record $37 billion worth of investor subscriptions on the first day of sales.

The rise in stock prices has been fuelled by foreign and domestic money, as Chinese authorities unleashed massive stimulus to deal with the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic and the country's economy recovered faster than others.
As worries increase over frothy valuations, some investors are turning to cheaper Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong, particularly as U.S. exchanges delist these firms and American investors are forced to offload their shares.
""The (U.S.) bans actually tell people what good assets are in Hong Kong,"" said Xia Tian, managing director at Shanghai-based asset management firm Minvest. 
Investor buying via Stock Connect from the mainland to Hong Kong hit a record high of HK$26.6 billion ($3.43 billion) on Tuesday, and the total southbound purchases in the new year hit HK$221.8 billion as of Thursday, according to exchange data.
The Stock Connect scheme gives investors access to both markets when investing in A-shares in the mainland and H-shares in Hong Kong.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) reckons the robust flows into Hong Kong owe to mainland policymakers' encouragement of outbound investment and an elevated premium of domestic A-shares over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. Companies' A-shares listed in China are currently trading at a more than 30% premium over their Hong Kong-listed shares.

JUSTIFIED EXUBERANCE?
The rally in China's A-share market has also been driven by foreign investment. As of Thursday, foreign investors had purchased a total of 48.7 billion yuan ($7.53 billion) worth of A-shares via the Stock Connect this year, which is already a fifth of what they bought in 2020. 
UBS expects flows of 200 billion yuan into the A-share market in 2021, citing improvement in China's legal protection for investors, better information disclosure by major shareholders and more capable leading firms in various industries.

Some investors believe the exuberance onshore is justified due to China's solid economic recovery, continued policy support and further opening up of its capital markets. 
""There is no frothiness in leading large-cap stocks, seen as safer bets as China pushes forward with registration-based IPO reforms in the market,"" said Wang Mingli, executive director of Youpu Investment, a Shanghai-based private securities fund.
""Investors would come back even later if they reduce exposure for now as there are few options out there that represent the country's future economic development,"" he added.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Friday, ending a generally positive week on a cautious note amid concerns that growing Covid-19 cases will stunt economic growth.  
At 2:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned Thursday that ever-increasing Covid-19 numbers and restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to curb the spread of the virus could challenge the region’s economic outlook.
Lagarde also indicated more clearly than ever that the ECB would not use the full amount of its chief bond buying program if it doesn't need to.  
European governments are having to cope with a surge in Covid-19 cases, with Britain, for example, posting a fresh record in daily deaths on Wednesday, for the second day running.  
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that it was too early to say when the national coronavirus lockdown in England will end, after researchers warned that this lockdown appeared to be having little impact on rates of the coronavirus in the first 10 days.
U.K. retail sales disappointed in December, climbing just 0.3% on the month, compared with expectations of a rise of 1.2%. This still represented an improvement from November’s fall of 3.8%.
The final PMI figures for Europe for January are scheduled for later in the session and are expected to show a slowdown in the services sector during these periods of lockdown.
Equity markets have posted strong gains so far this week, reflecting relief over an orderly transition of power in the United States and strong expectations that U.S. stimulus will provide continued support for global assets.
Oil prices weakened Friday on concerns that a rise of Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s largest consumer, will severely impact demand given the reintroduction of restrictive measures.
Shanghai reported the first locally transmitted cases in two months on Thursday, while Beijing is now urging tens of millions of urban workers not to travel back to their largely rural families during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release its weekly inventory report on Friday, a couple of days later than usual, and follows the American Petroleum Institute recording the country’s crude inventories rising 2.6 million barrels earlier in the week.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Wall Street hedges against possible bumps in U.S. vaccine rollout,"By April Joyner and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stock prices have marched to record highs, futures contracts for Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" show some investors are buying insurance against market turbulence that could erupt if surprise glitches hit the U.S. rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. 
This hedging can be seen in futures on the Cboe Volatility Index expiring in March and beyond, which are trading well above the index's current levels.
Uncertainty over the rollout has also helped keep the ""fear gauge"" hovering above its long-term average near 20, even as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 have rallied to record highs this week.
Investors said they would watch how close President Joe Biden can come to his goal of administering 100 million doses of the vaccine in the first 100 days of his term. On Thursday, he signed executive orders aimed at expanding testing and vaccinations.
""The next 100 days or so will be focused on the vaccine rollout and employment,"" said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management. ""If unsuccessful, that could potentially be negative for the market.""
Breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccines and assumptions that life will return by summer to a semblance of normalcy have helped boost the S&P 500, now up more than 70% from its March lows.
There have been rallies in shares of banks, small caps and other companies that would benefit most from economic reopening.
The VIX in turn has drifted lower since March, when it surged to a record closing high of 82.69 after years of muted swings in U.S. stocks. Massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, along with optimism toward an economic recovery, have helped subdue the fear gauge. 
Yet missed vaccination targets could bolster the case for investors looking to take profits, potentially ushering in more market swings. Fund managers in a recent BofA Global Research survey named potential problems with vaccine distribution as the market's top ""tail risk"" - an event that could cause severe dislocations in asset prices.
""I don't think we can put virus-related risks behind us,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ""There's a lot of good news priced into markets this year.""
Some investors are seeking to take advantage of high volatility expectations while preparing for possible turbulence in the future.
Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group, is advising clients to sell February call options on the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) iPath Series B Short-Term Futures ETN, an exchange-traded note tied to the VIX, while buying March call options on the same ETN. VXX call options are often used to protect against a pickup in volatility.
For broad reopenings to take place this summer, vaccinations need to be completed for most priority groups by early in the second quarter and access to the general population established by the end of June, said Matthew Harrison, biotech analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
""The vast majority of incoming questions has been around the pace of the rollout,"" he said. ""It's clear that investors are trying to figure out what the impact is.""
Some 15.1 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States - short of former President Donald Trump's goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans by the end of 2020.
The total number of U.S. COVID-19 deaths has surpassed 400,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network, is willing to be patient for now.

""It's a rockier road than we thought but anybody really thinking about it knew it was going to be difficult,"" he said. Still, he added, ""if we don't get vaccines really underway by the end of the month … markets might start to get concerned.""

270,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Intel floats possibility of licensing deals but would TSMC and Samsung be interested?,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) executives have raised the possibility of licensing chipmaking technology from outside firms, a move that could see it exchanging manufacturing secrets with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that both designs and manufactures its own chips, but the business model has come into question in recent years as the company lost its manufacturing lead to the Taiwanese and Korean companies.
One option urged by some investors would be to outsource manufacturing. The company said, however, on Thursday that while it plans to increase its use of outside factories, the majority of its 2023 products would be made internally.
But licensing technology could help Intel avoid major investments in rivals' factories that outsourcing deals would likely entail.
""Broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well,"" outgoing Chief Executive Bob Swan told an earnings call.
That said, questions remain over how much a licensing deal would cost and whether a rival firm would even be interested.
Intel did not name companies it might license from but TSMC and Samsung (KS:005930) are its only competitors for high-end chips.
""It seems a little weird to me that TSMC would give away to the keys to the kingdom unless there's a sizeable payment that went with it,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 12:15AM ET</span>","Not company earnings, not data but vaccines now steering investor sentiment","By Marc Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Forget economic data releases and corporate trading statements -- vaccine rollout progress is what fund managers and analysts are watching to gauge which markets may recover quickest from the COVID-19 devastation and to guide their investment decisions.
Consensus is for world economic growth to rebound this year above 5%, while Refinitiv I/B/E/S forecasts that 2021 earnings will expand 38% and 21% in Europe and the United States respectively.
Yet those projections and investment themes hinge almost entirely on how quickly inoculation campaigns progress; new COVID-19 strains and fresh lockdown extensions make official data releases and company profit-loss statements hopelessly out of date for anyone who uses them to guide investment decisions.
""The vaccine race remains the major wild card here. It will shape the outlook and perceptions of global growth leadership in 2021,"" said Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC), head of currency strategy at TD Securities. 
""While vaccines could reinforce a more synchronized recovery in the second half (2021), the early numbers reinforce the shifting fundamental between the United States, euro zone and others.""
The question is which country will be first to vaccinate 60%-70% of its population -- the threshold generally seen as conferring herd immunity, where factories, bars and hotels can safely reopen. Delays could necessitate more stimulus from governments and central banks.
Patchy vaccine progress has forced some to push back initial estimates of when herd immunity could be reached.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) says late autumn is now more realistic than summer, though it expects the northern hemisphere spring to be a turning point, with 20%-25% of people vaccinated and restrictions slowly being lifted.
But race winners are already becoming evident, above all Israel, where a speedy immunisation campaign has brought a torrent of investment into its markets and pushed the shekel to quarter-century highs.
SHOT IN THE ARM 
Others such as South Africa and Brazil, slower to get off the ground, have been punished by markets.
Britain's pound meanwhile is at eight-month highs versus the euro which analysts attribute partly to better vaccination prospects; about 5 million people have had their first shot with numbers doubling in the past week.
Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management expects double-digit GDP bouncebacks in Britain and the United States but noted sluggish euro zone progress.
""It is harder in the euro zone, the outlook is a bit more cloudy there as it looks like it will take longer to get herd immunity (due to slower vaccine programmes),"" he added. 
The euro bloc currently lags the likes of Britain and Israel in terms of per capita coverage, leading Germany to extend a hard lockdown until Feb. 14, while France and Netherlands are moving to impose night-time curfews.
Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior European economist at Capital Economics, said the slow vaccine progress and lockdowns had led him to revise down his euro zone 2021 GDP forecasts by a whole percentage point to 4%.
    ""We assume GDP gets back to pre-pandemic levels around 2022...the general story is that we think the euro zone will recover more slowly than US and UK.""
The United States, which started vaccinating its population last month, is also ahead of most other major economies with its vaccination rollout running at a rate of about 5 per 100.
Deutsche said at current rates 70 million Americans would have been immunised around April, the threshold for protecting the most vulnerable.
Some such as Eric Baurmeister, head of emerging markets fixed income at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management, highlight risks to the vaccine trade, noting that markets appear to have more or less priced normality being restored, leaving room for disappointment.
Broadly though the view is that eventually consumers will channel pent-up savings into travel, shopping and entertainment, against a backdrop of abundant stimulus. In the meantime, investors are just trying to capture market moves when lockdowns are eased, said Hans Peterson global head of asset allocation at SEB Investment Management.
""All (market) moves depend now on the lower pace of infections,"" Peterson said. ""If that reverts, we have to go back to investing in the FAANGS (U.S. tech stocks) for good or for bad.""

Investing.com – Japan’s Shiseido Co. Ltd. (T:4911) is in advanced talks to sell its shampoo and affordable skincare business, including its Tsubaki hair-care products line, to CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to fetch between JPY150 billion to 2000 billion, or $1.45 billion to $1.93 billion.
Shiseido shares were up 4.94% to JPY7110 ($68.69) by 12:15 PM ET (4:15 AM GMT). They climbed up to 6.5% earlier in the session, the biggest intraday climb since November 2020.
The Japanese company’s board is reportedly preparing to vote on the deal soon. It confirmed it was in discussions with CVC Capital to sell the unit, and that “no formal decisions have been made as of yet.” However, negotiations could still be delayed or even fall apart, people with knowledge of the deal warned.
Founded in Tokyo’s Ginza district as a pharmacy in 1872, Shiseido has been seeking to revamp its portfolio by exiting non-core businesses by the end of 2021. The company's Chief Executive Officer Masahiko Uotani also said in 2020 that asset sales could be necessary as it prioritizes cash.
The revamp was triggered by the change in cosmetic and personal care routines during COVID-19, which has dealt a blow to beauty companies.
A tenth of the company’s revenue in 2019 came from its lifestyle and personal care business, with annual sales of about JPY100 billion. The focus has shifted in recent years to the company’s high-end prestige beauty portfolio, which includes brands like Cle de Peau, NARS and the eponymous Shiseido brands. Shiseido has also made acquisitions to augment the portfolio, paying $845 million for the Drunk Elephant brand in 2019."

Amazon Senior Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs Jay Carney, who announced the plan in a news conference with Washington Governor Jay Inslee, said a company executive will be working with Washington State's Vaccine Command Center.
The clinic will be hosted in partnership with Virginia Mason Franciscan Health. 
The move came a day after Reuters reported that Amazon had offered to help with the United States' efforts involving the COVID-19 vaccine, citing a letter addressed to President Joe Biden.
The State currently allows people aged 65 and older and people 50 and older living in a multi-generational household to get vaccinated. It has yet to grant doses for the vaccination of warehouse employees, such as Amazon's.
The company employs more than 800,000 people in the country and more than 19,000 U.S. workers at Amazon had contracted the virus as of September, underscoring the vaccine's importance in keeping its staff safe and warehouses operational.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, retreating from Thursday’s rally. Investors digested earnings expectations and expectations that the increased U.S. fiscal spending promised by U.S. President Joe Biden could spur economic recovery.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.37% by 9:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT). Data released earlier showed that the national Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 1.2% year-on-year in December, the biggest annual fall recorded since September 2010. The index dropped 0.9% in November.
South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.55%, while in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.30%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.86%. It dropped as much as 1.3% after reports that the city's Yau Tsim Mong district will begin its first ever lockdown this weekend, impacting tens of thousands of residents.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.77% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.68%.
U.S. shares saw another record high during the previous session, with the S&P 500 boosted by advancing tech shares. Biden’s push for additional spending of up to $2 trillion and plans to ramp up the U.S. COVID-19 response also boosted U.S. shares.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci was cautiously optimistic that COVID-19 infection rates may be plateauing in the U.S. based on seven-day averages.
Benchmark treasury yields remained higher after a small decline in initial jobless claims was reported on Thursday. There were 900,000 claims filed over the past week, against the 910,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 926,00 claims reported during the previous week.
Some investors wondered whether global shares have already reached their peak.
“The markets had such a strong run yesterday after the presidential inauguration in the U.S. [on Wednesday] and the run-up to that, that the lead coming in from the U.S. is a bit messy,” AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital (ASX:GLIN)chief economist Shane Oliver told Reuters.
“A lot of the good news is out there. I suspect a fairly flat day,” Oliver added.
However, some investors were more optimistic, with expectations still high for a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package proposed by Biden earlier in the month. Republicans in Congress have expressed willingness to work with Biden on the top-priority plan, although some are arguing for a less expensive price tag.
Although Congress is now Democrat-controlled, Republican support is still required for the plan to be pushed through.
“While the recent rally clearly suggests that some of this recovery is already priced in, we see plenty of scope for investment flows to rotate from cash and other assets towards equities, once the recovery becomes more visible,” Janus Henderson Investors head of multi-asset Paul O’Connor told Bloomberg.
Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) handed down its policy decision on Thursday that kept interest rates steady. The central bank also pledged to provide more support for the economy if required.
ECB President Christine Lagarde also warned that ever-increasing COVID-19 numbers and restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, to curb the spread of the virus could challenge the region’s economic outlook."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it will recall 3 million vehicles for air bag inflators that could rupture, at a cost of $610 million.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday ordered Ford to issue the recall for driver-side air bag inflators, rejecting the automaker's 2017 petition to avoid it.
The defect, which in rare instances leads to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled.
The recall includes 2.7 million U.S. vehicles. Ford will include the cost in fourth-quarter results.
The vehicles were previously recalled for passenger-side inflators. ""We believe our extensive data demonstrated that a safety recall was not warranted for the driver-side airbag. However, we respect NHTSA’s decision and will issue a recall,"" Ford said.
NHTSA also required Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp to recall 5,800 air bag inflators in 2007–2009 B-Series vehicles.
Takata inflators have resulted in at least 400 injuries and 27 deaths worldwide - including 18 U.S. fatalities with two in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger trucks. 
The Ford vehicles being recalled include various 2006-2012 model-year Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles.
In November, NHTSA rejected a petition filed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to avoid recalling 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. GM said the callback covered 7 million vehicles worldwide and would cost $1.2 billion.
Ford separately disclosed on Thursday it expects to record a pretax remeasurement loss of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter related to pension and other post-employment benefits plans, driven by lower discount rates.

Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to reduce net income by about $1.2 billion, but did not change expectations for 2021 pension contributions.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",Biden administration pauses federal drilling program in climate push,"By Nichola Groom and Jennifer Hiller
(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has temporarily suspended oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters in the latest of a series of rapid-fire orders aimed at fighting climate change and tamping down the U.S. fossil fuel industry.
The order appeared to be a first step in delivering on newly sworn-in Biden's campaign pledge to permanently ban new drilling on federal acreage. Federal leases account for close to 25% of the nation's crude oil output, making them a big contributor to energy supply but also to America's greenhouse gas emissions. 
Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had sought to maximize production of oil, gas and coal on federal acreage, and routinely downplayed threats from global warming.
The suspension was welcomed by environmentalists but derided by the oil and gas industry, which is struggling to secure a future under a new administration that has vowed to make countering global warming a top priority.
The 60-day pause strips Interior Department agencies and bureaus from their authority to issue drilling leases or permits while the administration reviews the legal and policy implications of the federal minerals leasing program, according to a Department of Interior memo. The order does not limit existing operations, it said.
Shares of U.S. shale producers with federal lands exposure fell following the news on Thursday. 
EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) and  Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC) closed down 8.6%,  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN) fell 7.9% and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) closed down 6.4% on the New York Stock Exchange.
""This is a frack ban,"" Anne Bradbury, chief executive of the drilling trade group American Exploration & Production Council, said in an interview. ""Even just for 60 days, it's a really aggressive move.""
Many of the largest onshore drilling companies had stockpiled permits https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29Q1S5 in anticipation of a change in federal policy ahead of Biden's election, insulating them from a ban.
The order came close on the heels of a raft of other executive actions aimed at fighting climate change, including re-engaging the United States in the Paris climate accord and canceling a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. 
JOBS VERSUS CLIMATE
Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director of the environmental advocacy group Center for Western Priorities, said ""the Biden administration is rightfully attempting to take stock of the damage and make sure the agency is following the law.""
But big industry groups American Petroleum Institute and Western Energy Alliance swiftly issued statements condemning the pause and framing it as a threat to the economy.
""With this move, the administration is leading us toward more reliance on foreign energy,"" API President Mike Sommers said.
Limits on federal drilling will have the biggest impact on major Western producing states like New Mexico and Wyoming, which depend on revenue from their share of extraction royalties.
In a statement, the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association said that restricting development ""risks the loss of more than 60,000 jobs and $800 million in support for our public schools, first responders, and healthcare services.""

White House officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short bets on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc were the most unprofitable trade in 2020, as the electric automaker saw its shares surge over 740% en route to becoming the world's most valuable automaker. 
In a note to clients, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said mark-to-market short losses for Tesla totaled over $40 billion, as it was ""far and away the most unprofitable trade in 2020 and had the largest yearly loss we have seen historically."" 
Overall, shorts were down $245 billion, net of financing, in 2020 as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallied back from pandemic selling early in the year to near record highs as 2020 was closed out. 
Investors who sell securities ""short"" borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
Dusaniwsky noted that most of the most unprofitable shorts of 2020 were technology or ""stay at home"" plays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the next most unprofitable short play at about $6.7 billion in losses. 
Rounding out the top five were Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) at $5.8 billion, U.S. listed shares of  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc at $4.8 billion and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) at $4.7 billion. 
On the flip side, there were only five short positions that drew over $1 billion in mark-to-market profits, according to S3. The top short play was  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) as the oil major slumped more than 40% in 2020 in large part due to a plunge in oil prices caused mainly by a lack of demand during the pandemic. 

Only four other short positions topped over $1 billion according to S3 - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co, which was acquired by United Technologies in April to become Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, U.S.-listed shares of  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Thursday, propelled by optimism about more pandemic relief under the Biden administration to support the economy after data showed a tepid labor market recovery.
The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits dipped to 900,000 last week but still remained stubbornly high as the COVID-19 pandemic tears through the nation, raising the risk that the economy will shed jobs for a second straight month in January.
(GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xklvylqbrpg/joblessclaims.png) 
But other data showed the housing and manufacturing sectors as areas of strength to help buttress the economy. 
""We've had a very strong momentum going into this year and coming into the Biden administration... because of prospects of a bigger stimulus check and more spending in general,"" said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.37 points, or 0.04%, to 31,176.01, the S&P 500 gained 1.23 points, or 0.03%, to 3,853.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 73.67 points, or 0.55%, to 13,530.92.
The Nasdaq Composite advanced, boosted by a jump in shares of megacap stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ahead of their earnings reports in the coming weeks.
It follows Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s blowout results on Wednesday that revitalized the ""stay-at-home"" beneficiaries, adding $262 billion in overall market capitalization to the FAANG group of stocks.
""Given the possible surge in COVID cases, investors are going to go back to the old playbook that worked well at similar times last year... (The) technology sector is performing well and (so is) anything related to working from home,"" Aama added. 
In a reversal of the trend earlier this month, the Russell 1000 growth index, which includes technology stocks, is this week far outperforming the Russell 1000 value index, which is heavily comprised of cyclical stocks such as financials and energy.
President Joe Biden has launched several initiatives during his initial days in office, including ramping up testing and vaccine rollouts.
Technology, consumer discretionary and communication services which includes Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), were the only S&P sectors in green. 
Energy was the biggest drag among 11 major S&P sectors, following news Biden revoked the Keystone XL oil pipeline project's presidential permit.
With valuations near a 20-year high, corporate results could present an important test of whether the stock market rally has run ahead of fundamentals.
Earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to rise by 24% in 2021 after falling 15% in 2020, according to Refinitiv data as of Jan. 15.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc dropped after posting a fourth straight quarterly loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic but said it aims to cut about $2 billion of annual costs through 2023.

Investing.com - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported Thursday upbeat guidance and fourth-quarter earnings that markedly topped expectations as the work from home trend boosted demand for notebooks.
Intel ended the day up 6% as its quarterly was released just before the closer. Shares were slightly lower in after-market trade.
The company forecast first-quarter EPS of $1.10 on revenue of  $18.6 billion, above consensus for EPS $0.96 on revenue of $16.36 billion.  
The bullish guidance was supported by fourth-quarterly results that exceed the company's expectations. “We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year,” said Bob Swan, Intel chief executive.
Intel announced earnings per share of $1.52 on revenue of $19.98 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.1 on revenue of $17.45 billion.
Data-centric revenue fell 11% for the quarter year-on-year, paced by weakness in its internet of things and the memory business.
PC-centric revenue was up 9% in for the quarter, underpinned by record sales of notebook as the work- and learn-at-home trend continued.
The company also hiked its annual dividend by 5% to $1.39 per share.
As Intel gets ready to enter a new dawn of leadership, the outgoing Swan said the company was ""strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.""
The leadership change will likely drastically improved the company's outlook, Investing.com's Haris Anwar said. 
""Intel’s chances of breaking out of a sluggish growth cycle has drastically improved after the appointment of a new CEO, who has a strong technical background, and the involvement of an activist investor, Dan Loeb of Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC.Combined with a strong roadmap of future products and the management’s ability to execute on this roadmap, Intel may have a winning combination which could speed up its turnaround and stem the share losses,"" said Investing.com analysts Haris Anwar."

Investing.com -- Markets didn't go much of anywhere Thursday after hitting records after Joe Biden's presidential inauguration a day earlier. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Ford helped prop things up while energy stocks tumbled on a surprise build in weekly U.S. crude supplied. Industrials slumped with air travel failing to bounce back. 
Gold prices stayed relatively strong on Thursday in their rebound from $1,800 lows as the Biden administration’s plans to aggressively stimulate the U.S. economy with huge spending further weakened the dollar.
The new president is also taking aim at the coronavirus, with a coordinated federal response and rolling out strategies related to vaccinations and testing.
The goal is to administer 100 million shots, which is enough to cover 50 million Americans with vaccines that require two doses, in his first 100 days in office, CNN said. Here's hoping (for those who believe in the vaccine. For those who don't, no biggie).
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Existing Home Sales
Low inventories and the uptick in Covid cases will likely continue to weigh on existing home sales. Consensus for December is a 2.1% decline to 6.55 million from November's 6.69 million, which itself was a drop from the previous month.
2. Earnings continue to roll in
No offense to those we're about to mention, but it's not exactly an exciting slate of companies due to report. For those that love the oil industry, there's Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Ltd. If you're into trains, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) is due. And if regional financial companies are your thing, there's, Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF).
3. Welcome RLX, PAX
Two newbies are set to join the ranks of publicly traded companies Friday. Later today, Chinese e-cigarette maker RLX Technology will look to raise as much as $1.17 billion by selling 116.5 million American Depositary Receipts at $8 to $10 each. Patria Investments is a private equity firm focused on Latin America. It's hoping to raise about $426 million through the sale of 16.7 million shares at $14 to $16 each. Both begin trading on Friday.

Investing.com – The euro rose to a one-week high against the greenback even as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde stoked fears the eurozone is set for double-dip recession as the pandemic ravages economies across the bloc.
EUR/USD rose 0.47% to $1.2161.
The ECB left its rates unchanged and maintained its current pace of bond buying on Thursday. But Lagarde suggested that the prolonged coronavirus restrictions across the bloc had likely caused eurozone growth to fall again in the final quarter of 2020.
""Risks surrounding the euro-area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but less pronounced,” Lagarde said. Still, there was reason for optimism as the roll-out of vaccines, which started in late December, ""allows for greater confidence in the resolution of the health crisis,"" she added.
The European Central Bank also signaled it may not need the full extent of its emergency purchase program to support the recovery. Though added that the program could be increased to ensure the euro area economy remains well financed. ""If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full,""  according to the monetary policy statement.
Lagarde, however, did not elaborate on how it would assess whether financing conditions were favorable, saying that the central bank would adopt a ""holistic approach.""
Some analysts, however, believe the central bank will primary focus on curbing in rising sovereign bond yield in countries across the bloc with high levels of debt like Italy.
""[T]he ECB is probably primarily concerned with limiting the yield spreads of the bonds of particularly highly indebted countries,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said, adding that it would likely do so through bond buying.
Lagarde, however, stressed that the bank was not seeking to curb bond yield spreads of certain governments. ""We are not riveted to any particular yield, we take into account multiple indicators that relate to the financing of the economy.""
Italian bond yields extended gains to end the day at seven-week highs."
293,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",Restaurants Get a Long-Awaited Boost as Stimulus Payments Flow,"(Bloomberg) -- The beleaguered restaurant industry is experiencing a boost as $600 stimulus checks make their way into American households.
Restaurant sales were at their strongest since the start of the pandemic during the Jan. 4 to 17 period, according to the Facteus U.S. Consumer Spend Index, which tracks credit- and debit-card spending. TGI Friday’s, Dave and Buster’s Entertainment Inc. and Hooters of America have cited the stimulus when discussing higher demand.
“People are getting real money in their pockets and getting back out,” Hooters Chief Executive Officer Sal Melilli said. “I’m hoping we have a bridge here, that the stimulus helps get us to the mass vaccinations.”
He added that same-store sales -- an important gauge of performance for restaurants -- have inched up in January and customers are spending more on orders and ordering more frequently.
Economic aid will be crucial for sustaining restaurants, especially for sit-down eateries that have been decimated by the pandemic and social-distancing measures. The industry has said the aid will help keep many businesses afloat until vaccinations become more widely available. In the U.S., vaccinations began on Dec. 14 for health-care workers, and 17.2 million shots have been given -- about 5% of the population.
‘Noticeable Uptick’
Despite the slow pace, spending at restaurants saw a clear increase in the new year, jumping 16% for the week ended Jan. 11 after being negative for all of December, according to Facteus data. There was also a “noticeable uptick” in spending across food delivery providers, including Grubhub Inc. and Postmates Inc., Facteus said in a statement.
Casual-dining restaurants, whose sales have been hardest hit, are benefiting because “they tend to be a little bit more discretionary,” said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities analyst Lauren Silberman.
“If I have extra income, that might be the first place I go,” Silberman said. The boost could be sustained if trends follow those observed after the first round of stimulus last April, she said. Getting customers “back into a routine helped drive some of that and keep it at the same level.”
More stimulus could be on the way as President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion of relief that would include higher direct payments to consumers.
Michael Halen, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said the stimulus “helped pretty significantly” in April and predicted improvements in the coming months.
“December was pretty terrible -- we think January should be a pretty decent improvement and February should improve over January, but we’ll see,” Halen said. “Hopefully we’ll see some of those governors start to reopen economies.”
Fast food, which has gained market share during the pandemic thanks to its socially distant drive thrus and carryout, is also benefiting from the stimulus. Even with three-quarters of its dining rooms closed, Church’s Chicken, which has 1,500 locations in 25 countries, has seen double-digit same-store sales growth at its U.S. franchised restaurants so far in January. Part of that is likely the government aid, CEO Joe Christina said in an interview.
“You’ve got to feel for folks that are hurting out there. I believe in stimulus checks,” he said. “I believe in helping those that are struggling because of the pandemic. It helps our business.”

294,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Facebook hands decision on Trump ban to oversight board,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said on Thursday it was referring its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former U.S. President Donald Trump to its independent oversight board.
Trump will remain suspended while the board, a recently created body that can overrule the company's decisions on content, reviews the decision. 
Facebook blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by the former president's supporters. 
""I'm very confident of our case,"" Facebook's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, told Reuters. ""I'm very confident that any reasonable person looking at the circumstances in which we took that decision and looking at our existing policies will agree."" 
""But of course this is a decision which has had reverberations around the world,"" he added. It is the first time the company has blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state. 
Facebook did not ask for an expedited review so the board, which said on Thursday it had accepted the case, will have a maximum of 90 days to make a ruling and for Facebook to act on it. An Oversight Board spokesman said it would likely be sooner than that.
The administrators of Trump's Facebook page will have the option to submit a written statement challenging Facebook's decision.
Facebook had also asked the board to provide recommendations on when political leaders can or should be blocked. Facebook does not have to act on this recommendation, unlike the board's case decision which is meant to be binding.
The oversight board, which currently has 20 members, was created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content.
""That's why we're here, to not leave these decisions to the leadership of Facebook but actually use the Oversight Board to look at this in a principled way,"" said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a board co-chair and the former Danish prime minister.
The board, which has been criticized for its delayed start and limited remit, has not yet ruled on its first batch of cases.
Facebook said when it suspended Trump that the block would last at least until the end of Trump's presidential term and perhaps indefinitely. Trump's term expired on Wednesday when Joe Biden was sworn in as president. 
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) has suspended Trump permanently. 
'CRYSTAL-CLEAR LINK'
Trump was not made aware in advance of Facebook's decision to suspend him indefinitely, Clegg said. 
""Whilst it was a controversial decision because he was the president of the United States, it actually wasn't a particularly complicated one to take,"" he said, adding he felt there was a ""crystal-clear link"" between the words of Trump and the actions of people at the Capitol.
Facebook and other social media companies have come under fire for the proliferation of violent rhetoric and election misinformation on their platforms, including by Trump and his allies. That criticism only increased around the unrest at the Capitol, which was also incited and organized on social platforms. 
Asked if Facebook bears partial responsibility for the actions that led the storming of the Capitol, Clegg said: ""I accept there will always be people who say we knew this was going to happen. Dare I say it, I think it's never quite as straightforward as that."" 
He said he did not expect other major policy changes as a consequence of recent events.
""I'm ... keen not to raise expectations that because of one event we will therefore make very significant course corrections which then have to apply, because we're a global company with global standards, to the rest of the world as well,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Thursday rejected the National Rifle Association's bid to dismiss or move a lawsuit by New York Attorney General Letitia James seeking to dissolve the gun rights group.
Justice Joel Cohen of Manhattan Supreme Court ruled six days after the NRA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to protect itself from lawsuits, and said it would reincorporate in the more gun-friendly Texas after 150 years in New York.
James had sued the NRA, Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre and others last August.
She accused the group of violating state laws governing nonprofits by diverting millions of dollars to fund luxurious trips for its officials, no-show contracts for associates, and other suspect expenses.
The NRA argued that if the case continued it belonged in the state capital of Albany, where it had its only New York office, and perhaps in federal court, where it has filed a countersuit accusing James of violating its members' First Amendment rights.
""This is a case of historic constitutional importance,"" the group's lawyer Sarah Rogers (NYSE:ROG) argued.
The judge said accepting the NRA arguments would be ""elevating form over substance,"" and that it was a ""big lift"" to tell James she could not sue in state court.
""It would be inappropriate in these circumstances to find that the attorney general cannot pursue her claims in state court just because one of the defendants would prefer to proceed in federal court,"" Cohen said.
The NRA has said it was ""dumping"" New York to escape its ""toxic political environment.""
It accused James, a Democrat, of suing for political gain and because she dislikes what the group stands for.
Bankruptcy filings normally halt existing litigation, but the attorney general believes her lawsuit deserves an exemption because she is enforcing her ""police and regulatory power."" 
James Sheehan, a lawyer for James, told the judge a trial could occur early next year.

The case is New York v. National Rifle Association et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 451625-2020.

(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, is adding bitcoin futures as an eligible investment to two funds, a company filing showed.
The company said it could use bitcoin derivatives for its funds BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc.
The funds will invest only in cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.
A BlackRock representative declined to comment beyond the filings when contacted by Reuters. 
Earlier this month, Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, hit a record high of $40,000, rallying more than 900% from a low in March and having only just breached $20,000 in mid-December. 
Bitcoin tumbled 10.6% in midday U.S. trading Thursday. 
Other U.S.-based asset managers will likely follow BlackRock's lead and add exposure to bitcoin in some form to their go-anywhere or macro strategies as the cryptocurrency market becomes more liquid and developed, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. 
""It’s easy to see how strong the performance has been of late and look at a historical asset allocation strategy that would have included a slice of crypto and how returns would have been enhanced as a result,"" he said. ""Large institutional investors are going to be able to tap into the futures market in a way that a retail investor could not do.""
There is currently no U.S.-based exchange-traded fund that owns bitcoin, limiting the ability of most fund managers to own the cryptocurrency in their portfolios.

Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the states, led by Colorado, to begin next month to turn over materials they planned to use in the case, rejecting a mid-March date the states has suggested.
With regard to the Justice Department case, John Schmidtlein, an attorney for Google, said the material the search engine and software unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc had received so far from the government did not include anything provided by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), a Google rival. Schmidtlein said he expected a large amount of material Microsoft .
Kenneth Dintzer, who represents the Justice Department, said he expected much of that material to be turned over to Google's lawyers on Jan. 29. 
He noted that some data that was collected involved such large files that it had to be put on a hard drive by a person physically at the Justice Department, which is inside the area where security was high following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. 
The Justice Department's lawsuit, filed in October, focused on Google's search and search advertising while the state case, which was filed in December, also accused Google of seeking to extend its dominance to devices like speakers, televisions and even smart cars.
Google denied wrongdoing.
In a previous status hearing, Judge Amit Mehta tentatively set a trial date of Sept. 12, 2023. The two cases have been put together in terms of pre-trial matters.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has slowed a planned ramp-up of A320 aircraft production, the European planemaker said, as the coronavirus travel slump takes a growing toll on its airline clients.
Output of the single-aisle A320 jet family will increase from 40 a month to 43 in the third quarter and 45 in the last three months of 2021, Airbus said on Thursday, scaling back a previous July target rate of 47 ""in response to the market environment.""
The production curtailment comes after Reuters reported that Airbus was in discussions with suppliers over the timing of increases, with delays thought likely. Airbus had until now publicly stuck to its output schedule.
Production plans for widebody aircraft remain unchanged, Airbus said. The decision to maintain stable output of five A350s and two A330s per month ""postpones a potential rate increase for the A350"", the company added - in a sign that it aims to avoid a production cut.
The latest setback comes amid deepening uncertainty over the outlook for airlines, notably in Europe.
While Airbus beat its internal deliveries goal in 2020, industry sources say the availability of delivery financing remains blurred by uncertainty over the pace of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the broader economic outlook.
""It's still a lot of airplanes for the market to take,"" one senior aviation financier said of the revised schedule.

Assembly of the smaller A220 jet will increase from four to five aircraft per month at the end of the first quarter as previously announced, Airbus said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital ended 2020 with a 5.2% gain thanks to a dramatic fourth quarter comeback when bets on a homebuilder, jet leasing company and home security services company turned into a 25% return, the firm said in a letter to investors on Thursday.
The hedge fund, run by David Einhorn, lagged far behind the broader S&P 500 index's 18.4% gain but celebrated its late year surge which it described as ""the best quarterly result in Greenlight's history."" Reuters obtained a copy of the letter.
Homebuilder Green Brick Partners (NASDAQ:GRBK), jet leasing company Aer Cap Holdings and relatively new positions in Resideo Technologies (NYSE:REZI), NCR (NYSE:NCR) Corp and Change Healthcare (NASDAQ:CHNG) fueled the portfolio's gains as optimism about a vaccine roll-out and a conclusion to the U.S. presidential election pushed stocks to new highs.
Greenlight also said that it invested in streaming provider FuboTV and biopolymer manufacturer Danimer Scientific, which both went public in recent months. 
Einhorn, who is well-known for his long-running short bet against Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), said the fund ""managed to sidestep"" most of electric car company's late year run-up but acknowledged that the stock was still the firm's biggest loser last year. Tesla's stock surged roughly 733% in the last 52 weeks.
The letter also highlighted Einhorn's whistleblower award from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, received in November after he pushed for it, noting that the regulator had agreed with the firm's analysis of problems at land developer The St. Joe Company more than a decade ago, ultimately fining it for improper accounting of its real estate assets.
Looking ahead to this year, Greenlight said it is positioned for higher inflation, a strong housing market and rising interest rates. 
""If things generally go this way, value stocks should continue their recent outperformance. We are excited to turn the page into 2021,"" the letter said.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it still sees strong growth prospects with ecommerce penetration (still!!) so low. Seriously. 
The firm bumped its price target on Amazon to $4,000 from $3,650, maintaining a buy rating while admitting there are tough comps ahead. Shares are up 2%.
Supporting that increase will be an uptick in fulfilment capacity and an ongoing shift to the cloud, according to analyst Justin Post, StreetInsider reported. 
""COVID-19 should accelerate Cloud demand in 2021, and retail business margins have positive tailwinds (annualizing over $10bn in COVID related costs),"" Post wrote in a note. ""Despite strong 2020 Amazon stock performance, the advertising and ecommerce marketplace sectors did better; applying comp multiples to each of Amazon’s segments would suggest further upside.""
Amazon rose more than 60% in 2020.
Post is not alone in his thinking, despite the piles of boxes outside your door every day.
Amazon has 31 buy ratings, one hold and nary a sell, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
The company reported sales of $96 billion for the quarter ended in September, which compares to $70 billion a year earlier. Amazon's most recent profit came in at $12.37 per share, versus $4.23 a year earlier.

MUNICH (Reuters) - BMW aims to return to its pre-pandemic operating margin target as the global economy recovers, but big investments in electric cars mean the automaker will have to simplify its vehicle portfolio, its finance chief told Reuters. 
Nicolas Peter said orders had fallen because of the latest pandemic-related lockdowns, but added: ""if activity starts again after the middle of February, we should be able to deliver a reasonable first quarter.""
Improving market conditions, a Brexit deal and the German company's plans to increase its share in its Chinese joint venture to 75% from 50% in 2022 should all help push BMW back to its pre-pandemic operating margin target of 8% to 10%.
""We're not talking about far away in the future, but it is a goal that we're looking at systematically in the short term,"" Peter said during an interview at BMW's Munich headquarters. The company will publish its 2021 margin target in March. 
A surge in premium car sales in China, the world's largest autos market, provided much-needed help for BMW's business - it also boosted German rivals Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and VolkswagenDE> - and it should report a 2020 operating margin of between 2% and 3%, Peter said.
Changing car line-ups from petrol and diesel to electric versions to meet emissions targets in China and Europe, not to mention trying to compete with electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), is hugely expensive, and was a driving factor in the recent merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker. 
Further consolidation is expected as carmakers struggle with electrification and investing in self-driving technology, but Peter said BMW could handle the transition.
""We are very confident we can make it alone,"" he said. 
But because electric vehicles (EV) are expensive to develop and still account for a small portion of sales, they are less profitable for BMW, Peter said.
""That's why investment is so important,"" he said. ""We have to find ways to get to a different cost level, especially with cells and batteries.""
So the premium carmaker is embarking on a push to cut complexity - reducing engine variants and options for different vehicles, scrapping features customers don't use, plus overhauling software to focus on a simpler, more efficient way of building vehicles. 
In 2020, BMW's global EV sales rose 31.8% versus 2019 and the carmaker says it plans to double its sales of fully-electric vehicles this year.
Traditionally, BMW has considered Germany's other carmakers as its rivals, but Peter said increasingly it is looking to San Francisco and companies like China's Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc - with its focus on interaction between car and driver - for inspiration.
He said that in polls two thirds of Chinese consumers have said they will switch to other brands and products if they provide a better digital experience.

""Those are the themes that have to be in focus,"" Peter said.

Investing.com -- Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) shares are up almost 8% as Oppenheimer says the TikTok loss is no biggie.
The firm bumped the stock to outperform from perform and raised the price target to $125 from $108.
In August, Oppenheimer sidelined Fastly on tougher 2021 comps and the loss of TikTok as a customer, which has been priced in already, Seeking Alpha reported. But analyst Timothy Horan said he's incrementally more positive after channel checks for the fourth quarter, which suggest record traffic volumes, and the positive launch of compute@edge, which omits the need to use a server, according to StreetInsider.
Covid-19 lockdowns have provided a boost for the company, which should nonetheless continue once they are finished. 
""An important part of our bull thesis is that FSLY should trade at par with Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), and for a moment this summer it traded at a premium, but recently FSLY has massively underperformed its peer group,"" Oppenheimer said. 
Cloudflare is up about 40% since mid-October, when shares of Fastly dropped by 50% before recovering after the loss of TikTok. The stock is still down about 18% since then.
TikTok, which once was Fastly's largest customer, may be back with a new president in charge in the U.S. and Donald Trump off in Florida by the pool at Mar-a-Lago.

Investing.com -- SolarEdge rose 2.3% after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) initiated the photovoltaic inverter maker with a buy-equivalent rating.
U.S. President Joe Biden's executive orders bolstering the clean-energy industry may also be impacting the stock, TheStreet said.
""SolarEdge is the world leader in the solar PV inverter market, a position that we believe will allow the company to continue to gain share in a fast growing space and penetrate other equally exciting markets,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said in a note, according to StreetInsider. He set a price target of $354, which compares to the average $290, according to data compiled by Investing.com. 
The U.S. will rejoin the Paris climate agreement in 30 days, reversing former President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw. Biden also signed an executive order imposing a moratorium on oil leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  
The news comes a day after analysts urged investors to buy any weakness in SolarEdge and rival  Enphase Energy Inc  (NASDAQ:ENPH) after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) said it created a new solar inverter that could compete with them, CNBC reported. SolarEdge fell Friday on the Tesla news.
“We believe the selloff is overdone and recommend buying the weakness,” JPMorgan’s Mark Strouse wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said concerns may be overstated, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) noted Enphase and SolarEdge hold about 90% of U.S. residential market share for microinverters and power optimizers, and both are growing internationally.
That said, Tesla's new product may impact SolarEdge since the two have historically had a supply partnership, but Tesla sales are likely only about 2% of SolarEdge's annual revenue.

While the former president was being permanently banned from the social media platform in the wake of the riot at the U.S. Capitol, investors were seeing the value of their holdings shrink.
Twitter stock is down 12% thus far in 2021, based on its early trading on Thursday, at one stage slipping back below the $45.10 at which the stock opened on the day of its initial public offering in November 2013. The January performance is the weakest among components of the S&P 500 Index, which itself is up about 2.5% year to date.
The decision to ban Trump, who had more than 88 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account, could have a negative impact on users and engagement, at least in the short term, according to analysts. Rosenblatt Securities said the move “all but secures” a “dismal” near-term outlook as it leaves “little room to deliver positive ’21 results.”
Separately, Argus Research speculated that Twitter “could lose several million” daily active users as a result of the ban, and that the move could “further push Congress to move ahead with its anti-monopoly activities.”
Twitter representatives didn’t immediately return emails seeking comment.
Twitter’s January stock decline is notable among social-media stocks.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., which suspended Trump’s account, is down a more modest 2.1%. Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc. is up 10% and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). -- which permanently banned the former president -- has risen 4.3%. Both were standout performers last year, with Snap tripling and Pinterest up more than 250%.
Twitter also outperformed in 2020, rising nearly 70% over the course of the year despite some weak quarterly reports. Many analysts remain optimistic about its longer-term prospects, especially given an improved view for digital advertising.
Earlier this week, Bloomberg Intelligence wrote that Trump’s ban should have a “muted” impact on social-media companies over the long term, as improved average revenue per user, higher engagement, and “ad budgets shifting to digital may offset any deceleration in monthly active users.”
Twitter, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results in February, was trading 0.7% higher in premarket trading.

Some countries were believed to be withholding some vaccines for fear of a shortage for the required second dose, meant to be administered three weeks after the first vaccination.
Pfizer said last week it would have to reduce deliveries of the shots to Europe until early February in order to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost.
Speaking in an interview with monthly Manager Magazin, the managing director of the investment vehicle of biotech investors Thomas and Andreas Struengmann, who hold about half the shares in BioNTech, said Denmark was taking the delivery cuts in its stride and was not withholding any volumes for the second booster dose of the two-shot regimen.
""Denmark, for example, is being a role model,"" said Helmut Jeggle, head of the Struengmann brothers' holding company Athos, told the magazine, when asked why Europe was falling behind in its vaccination campaign.
He said in parts of Germany, half of the apportioned vaccine doses were stored to reserve a booster shot for every recipient of the first shot within the prescribed three-week interval.
""That degree of stock keeping is not necessary because we will do everything to really deliver the committed volumes in the first quarter, irrespective of some hiccups at the Belgian site in Puurs for one or two week,"" Jeggle was quoted as saying.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's exit from the European Union has pushed swathes of derivatives trading from London to the bloc and the United States in a further blow to the capital's financial sector.
Britain left the EU's single market on Dec. 31, forcing EU banks and asset managers to stop using London for trading heavily used derivatives like interest rate swaps (IRS).
EU market users must now trade swaps on platforms in the bloc, or on a swap execution facility or SEF in the United States which has EU market access.
IHS Markit, a financial information company, said the share of euro denominated rate swaps trading on SEFs doubled from 11% in December to almost 23% in the first two weeks of January.
""Of course, the real cost of fractured global liquidity is more expensive hedging and ultimately higher costs to end users,"" said Kirston Winters, managing director at IHS Markit.
Britain has called on the EU to grant access to trading platforms in London, the world's biggest centre for swaps, but Brussels has declined so far.
The shift mirrors a move in euro denominated share trading worth 6.5 billion euros a day that left London on Jan. 4 for trading platforms in the EU. Trading in euro-denominated government bonds left London for the continent after Britain voted in 2016 to exit the bloc.
Eric Litvack, group director of public affairs at French bank SocGen said firms were adapting to ""new realities"" as some swaps trading left London for EU and U.S. platforms.
""Generally, the U.S. has been the big winner, though the EU has won some business in euro denoninated swaps,"" a derivatives industry insider added. 
The Bank of England said in December that around $200 billion of daily interest rate swap trading in Britain would be affected by curbs on trading swaps between the UK and EU.
At the last minute, Britain eased some of its restrictions to avoid a complete rupture in trading.

With Asian stocks reaching new highs overnight and Wall Street pointing higher again, MSCI's global index covering nearly 50 countries added 0.3% to its 76% rally since the COVID crash last March.
Republicans in the U.S. Congress have indicated they are willing to work with Biden on his administration's top priority, a $1.9 trillion U.S. fiscal-stimulus plan. Some remain opposed to the price tag, but the final amount is still expected to be worth at least 5% of U.S. gross domestic product. 
""Biden has got the benefit of the doubt as far as markets are concerned and has had for some time,"" said Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) investment management.
""The benefit of higher stimulus is viewed as outweighing any negative impacts of higher corporate taxes and regulation. And I think they are right to think that. Monetary policy is also likely to remain loose,"" he said. 
Bond yields barely budged, with debt markets now focusing on the ECB's meeting, as the bank kept its key ""deposit"" interest rate at -0.5% as widely expected, after boosting its 1.85 trillion-euro emergency bond- buying programme by 500 billion euros ($606.30 billion) in December.
Since then, many European countries, including France and Germany, have tightened coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Vaccination programmes have also been slow to ramp up, adding to the doubts over the speed of economic recovery.
ECB President Christine Lagarde was due to hold a news conference at 1330 GMT.
""We don’t expect many fireworks from the European Central Bank meeting,"" ING strategists said, foreseeing ""a fairly uneventful day for the euro,"" which was up 0.3% at $1.2145 but well within its recent $1.20 to $1.23 range.
FAANGSTASY LAND
In the currency markets the dollar was off 0.15% against the yen at 103.37 amid the expectations of a Biden stimulus push and after the Bank of Japan left its policies unchanged overnight. 
The broader dollar index was down 0.17% to 90.254, while benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes yielded 1.0785%, down from a U.S. close of 1.09% on Wednesday. 
Wall Street was set to open riding its latest tech rally.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares had surged nearly 17% on Wednesday after it would no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its TV shows and movies.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had jumped 5.3% too and along with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix, the so-called FAANGs group added $262 billion, taking their market cap to $6.15 trillion.

There was weekly jobs data to look forward to but most of the focus was on Biden's policies around the key issues such as the pandemic response, the economy and trade tensions that dominated Donald Trump's term over the last four years.
Around the time Biden was sworn in as president on Wednesday China announced sanctions against ""lying and cheating"" outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former President Donald Trump.
""Imposing these sanctions on Inauguration Day is seemingly an attempt to play to partisan divides,"" Biden's National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement to Reuters. 
Mark Rosenberg, CEO of high-frequency political risk data firm GeoQuant, said rather than an easing of U.S.-China tensions, the key indicators that his firm monitor currently point to them worsening further.
""There is a brief stabilisation with the new administration but then a reacceleration thereafter,"" Rosenberg said, highlighting U.S. relations with Taiwan and issues over Hong Kong and the South China Sea all as flash points. ""It looks particularly volatile in the second half of 2021."" 
In commodity markets, oil prices eased on an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, though hopes for an economic revival kept losses in check. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dipped 0.24% to $53.18 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.16% to $55.99 per barrel.
Industrial metals such as copper, nickel and iron ore all rose while spot gold was a shade lower at $1,866 per ounce.

Autostrade reached an agreement with the Italian government over the tariff plan last year, but is still waiting for it to be finally signed off, CEO Roberto Tomasi said at the presentation of the company's strategic plan.
The delay in approving the tariff plan, known as PEF, is also slowing negotiations between Atlantia and a consortium of investors aiming to buy Autostrade.
Negotiations to sell Autostrade are part of Atlantia's effort to end a long-running dispute over the future of the motorway unit, which was triggered in 2018 after a deadly collapse of a motorway bridge operated by Autostrade.
Atlantia owns 88% of Autostrade with Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), France's EDF (PA:EDF) Invest, DIF Infrastructure and China's Silk Road fund holding the remaining 12%.

Analysts expect the recovery in railroad volumes to continue in 2021, with a pick-up in demand giving way to broader-based gains in rail traffic, spurred by industrial and commodity end markets.
Volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads, rose 3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. Freight revenue, however, fell 1% to $4.80 billion.
The company's net income fell to $1.38 billion, or $2.05 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.40 billion, or $2.02 per share, a year earlier.
Total operating revenue fell to $5.14 billion from $5.21 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $2.36 per share.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.30 per share, according Refinitiv data.

324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Day-Trader Frenzy for Trendy Stocks Is Defying Decades of Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- Day traders getting rich buying trendy companies from solar power to cloud computing are defying two decades of money-losing history in ETFs that follow the approach.
Stuffed with overvalued stocks, exchange-traded funds targeting the hottest investment themes actually lost as much as 5% per year on a risk-adjusted basis between 2000 and 2019, according to new research.
It should serve as a reminder that good times don’t last, yet the speculative euphoria surrounding thematic funds keeps growing. One out of every three dollars flowing to U.S. equity ETFs in January has gone to the sector at $12.6 billion in total.
“Demand for specialized ETFs comes from unsophisticated investors who chase investment ideas that, in their view, will produce higher expected returns,” academics at Ohio State University, Swiss Finance Institute and Villanova University wrote in the paper. In practice, “the underlying assets of these ETFs are overvalued and therefore underperform after issuance.”
Thematic ETFs in the U.S. now manage a record $142 billion in assets after almost trebling from a year ago.
With ambitions in new, high-growth industries like robotics and space travel, they tend to hold companies surrounded by media hype with a corresponding run-up in the stock price, according to the paper. As a result, they typically include equities with tell-tale signs of over-valuation, like high market-to-book values or elevated short interest.

The authors studied over 1,000 U.S.-listed equity products, tracking both broad-based funds following indexes like the S&P 500 and specialized ETFs tracking sectors and themes. Leveraged, inverse and actively managed funds were not included.
The results were striking: A portfolio of these thematic and sector funds lost 3.1% a year on a risk-adjusted basis after fees. Poor performance typically kicked in at launch. New ETFs fared even worse, shedding 5% per year.
The retail investor is likely to be bearing the brunt of these losses.
Using data directly from the Robinhood platform, the researchers found that users overwhelmingly favor thematic ETFs over broad-based products. Meanwhile, based on 13F forms, they showed average institutional ownership of broad-based ETFs shortly after launch was about 43%, yet for specialized funds it was just 0.39%.
Of course, it’s possible that thematic funds have come of age. The study period ends before the unprecedented events of 2020, when some of the highest-profile themes were boosted by the global pandemic.
It also excludes active funds like those offered by Ark Investment Management, which have exploded in popularity after successful bets on the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. and Bitcoin.
Either way, for issuers it’s a no-brainer: The research notes that thematic and sector products held just 20% of assets in all ETFs at the end of 2019 -- but brought in a third of industry revenue thanks to their higher fees.
“ETF issuers attract investor attention by designing products that cater to investors’ expectations of high future returns,” wrote Itzhak Ben-David, Francesco A. Franzoni, Byungwook Kim and Rabih Moussawi. “The most important financial innovation of the last three decades, originally designed to promote cost-efficiency and diversification, has also provided a platform to cater to investors’ irrational expectations.”

325,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",Volkswagen faces EU fine for missing 2020 emissions targets,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) faces a fine of more than 100 million euros ($121 million) for missing EU targets on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its 2020 passenger car fleet, the world's largest carmaker said on Thursday.
It cut average CO2 emissions in the fleet in the European Union by around 20% to 99.8 g/km, but that was around 0.5 g/km above its target, Volkswagen said.
That implied EU fines amounting to a ""very low triple-digit million amount,"" a spokesman said.
Concerned about global warming, as well as air pollution, European policymakers have clamped down on exhaust emissions, forcing carmakers to spur development of low-emission technology or face a penalty of 95 euros per gram of excess CO2 they emit.
""We narrowly missed the fleet target for 2020, thwarted by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" CEO Herbert Diess said in a statement, adding he hoped to meet the target this year as the company's main brands bring out new electric models.
The group said it had already made provisions for the fines to avoid a hit to its fourth-quarter earnings.
German rivals Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW have said that they had achieved their CO2 goals following a rise in sales of electric models.
Volkswagen said deliveries of electric models in the EU, plus Britain, Iceland and Norway, more than quadrupled in 2020 to 315,400 vehicles, making the group the clear market leader with about a quarter of the all-electric market in western Europe.
The company said its core Volkswagen and Audi brands more than fulfilled their CO2 fleet targets due to the launch of popular electric models, with more on the way. Its Cupra sports car and Skoda brands will also present new electric models.
VW was helped closer to its target by a pooling system that allows carmakers above their limit to pay competitors who are below.
Volkswagen is reducing the number combustion-engined cars it offers and retooling more factories to build electric vehicles to try to keep up with electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
It has said the EU's more stringent emissions targets will force it to boost the proportion of hybrid and electric vehicles in its European car sales to 60% by 2030, up from a previous target of 40%.
Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines, a scandal that has cost it more than 30 billion euros in regulatory fines and vehicle refits, mostly in the United States.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nuveen, the $1.1 trillion asset management arm of TIAA, has sold out of its holdings in the Chinese companies that will be barred to U.S. investors by recent sanctions, it said in an email to Reuters.
The disposals come as U.S. investors scramble to exit stocks subject to the sanctions, which ban Americans from owning companies deemed to have links with China's military.
Nuveen had held positions in several of the blacklisted companies, including China Telecom (NYSE:CHA), SMIC, Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp, CNOOC (NYSE:CEO), China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong, according to Refinitiv data up to the end of November last year. Of those, the largest was a 0.12% holding in the Hong Kong listing of China Telecom, the data showed.
TIAA is the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, a leading retirement provider for people in the education, not-for-profit, healthcare and government fields.
Other U.S. investors have made similar moves. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, had sold almost all its stake in China Telecom, a stock market filing showed last week.
About $323 billion of Nuveen's assets under management are invested in equities, its second-largest asset class behind fixed income, its website shows. 
Big U.S. funds are expected to liquidate more holdings before the rules take effect in November 2021.

Before leaving office, Donald Trump's administration slapped sanctions on 44 Chinese companies with alleged ties to the Chinese military, a move expected by financial executives to remain in place under Joe Biden's presidency.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",Britain's IG to buy tastytrade for $1 billion in U.S. foray,"By Muvija M and Indranil Sarkar
(Reuters) - Britain's IG said it plans to buy U.S. trading platform tastytrade for $1 billion, venturing into North America after a stellar year for the new breed of retail investment brokerages. 
Coronavirus-driven volatility has fuelled a surge in revenue and profit for IG and British rivals including CMC Markets and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP), while Robinhood.com and its app-based trading have risen to prominence in the United States.
IG, which dates back to 1974, said on Thursday that tastytrade shareholders will get $300 million in cash and 61 million IG shares, valued at $700 million, in the London-listed company's biggest deal to date.
News of the planned acquisition, part of June Felix's diversification strategy since becoming IG Chief Executive in late 2018, saw IG shares fall 2.3% by 0812 GMT.
The company, which also reported a 129% increase in first-half earnings, said it expected the deal would be low single- digit accretive to its adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after closing.
Half of the cash portion of the purchase would be funded through company resources and the rest through new debt facilities, IG said.
IG's expansion into the United States coincides with the arrival of President Joe Biden, who was sworn into office on Wednesday.
Wall Street is awash with speculation about the kind of financial sector regulatory changes his administration might seek, while Janet Yellen, Biden's Treasury Secretary nominee, has also raised the possibility of taxing unrealized capital gains.
UK regulators have already tightened certain rules to ensure ""mom and pop"" investors are protected from big losses when betting on complex financial instruments some retail traders do not fully understand.
Massachusetts securities regulators have accused Robinhood of engaging in aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors. 
'10-YEAR WAIT' 
Tastytrade, which was founded a decade ago, has more than 105,000 active trading accounts and some 900,000 unique registrations, while its YouTube channel boasts 206,000 subscribers and 8 hours of live programming a day.
By comparison, Robinhood, which had 13 million user accounts in May and was valued at $11.2 billion as of December, has 3,560 subscribers on the video sharing platform. 
The retail share trading boom seen in 2020 has not shown any signs of waning in 2021. 
Illustrating the pent-up demand, Signal Advance's share price skyrocketed to $70 from 70 cents in under a week after it was mistaken for a similarly named unlisted texting app used by billionaire mogul Elon Musk.
Tastytrade's senior leadership will stay on after the takeover, which the companies expect to close in the first quarter of the next financial year.

""While our long-term goal has always been to go global, we waited almost 10 years until we found the right partner and perfect match,"" Co-CEO of tastytrade Tom Sosnoff said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Thursday, continuing to trade in record territory in the wake of President-elect Joe Biden inauguration.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 77 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 60 points, or 0.5%. 
The three main cash indices all closed at record levels on Wednesday, with the  Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 0.8% higher, the S&P 500 up 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 2%. 
Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday, and immediately set about undoing some of the trademark policies of the Donald Trump-era. 
He signed an executive order rejoining the U.S. into the Paris climate accord, moved to rejoin the World Health Organization, ended the travel ban against some predominantly Muslim and African countries and stopped construction of a border wall.
However, it’s his $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal which has buoyed investors of late, and they continue to bet that his administration will be able to get the bulk of this through Congress even as hopes for bipartisan support appeared to dim.
With U.S. deaths due the Covid-19 virus now over 400,000 and economic activity curtailed by the associated mobility restrictions, Biden has put the pandemic at the top of his to-do list. 
He is expected to sign a number of executive orders, including ordering the use of disaster funds to help open schools once more and mandating the wearing of protective masks on planes and buses.
The weekly jobless claims data are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are likely to vividly illustrate the economic damage caused by the pandemic. Initial claims are expected to be 910,000 and continuing claims 5.4 million. At the same time, the first data of the year on housing starts and building permits are due.
The earnings season continues apace Thursday, with results from the likes of  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR),  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV) before the bell, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) after the close.
Oil prices weakened Thursday after a surprise rise in U.S. crude stocks, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute, reignited concerns about the impact on demand from the pandemic in the world’s largest consumer.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to release its weekly inventory report on Friday, two days later than usual due to the holiday and the inauguration.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $53.02 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $55.73. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,870.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2146.

333,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 05:56AM ET</span>",StockBeat: IG Group Pays up for a Ticket on the U.S. Retail Trading Bandwagon,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- IG Group (OTC:IGGHY) is paying up heavily for a piece of the action in the fast-growing market for retail derivatives trading in the U.S.
It’s paying $1 billion for tastytrade, a 10 year-old startup that combines a popular online brokerage service with educational content for the swelling hordes of ‘self-driven’ traders. It’s betting that the trend toward increased democratization of stock markets will outlive the current perfect conditions created by loose monetary policy, high market volatility and the enforced semi-idleness of millions of people locked down at the pandemic.
The strategic rationale looks sound enough, bringing clear diversification benefits. Regulatory crackdowns on the legacy business of contracts for differences in its home European market are still a fresh memory, and there is no arguing with increasing its footprint in the world’s biggest and deepest financial market, which accounted for only 4% of revenue in the first 11 months of last year.
The target also looks, well, tasty. Tastytrade’s core market of U.S. options grew at a compound rate of over 24% in the last four years, and growth accelerated sharply in 2020. With EBITDA margins of 47% last year and a highly-scalable technology base, there are no obvious red flags about the underlying health of the business. Adjusted underlying earnings rose just under 50% last year on a 44% increase in revenue.
Even so, the market’s reaction on Thursday was to baulk at the price being paid. By mid-morning in London, IG Group (LON:IGG) stock was down 1.4%.
The $1 billion price tag is around 30% of IG’s market value as of Wednesday’s close, and the company will have to borrow over $200 million and issue 61 million new shares at a valuation of $700 million. That values IG stock at only 843 pence, a 7% discount.
The discount, however, is a modest one, considering that Wednesday’s close was a 27-month high that comes at the end of a big rally: the shares have almost doubled from their lows of early 2019, when the threat from European regulation was at its most severe.
There may be some concern among investors that the ideal current conditions for retail traders may not last forever, and that the willingness of tastytrade’s owners to sell out now may reflect a desire to get out at the top. But its owners will exchange largely IG shares for their own, and will be locked up for five years. Key staff will be retained through a four-year share-related scheme.
Most of all, IG is surely right when it says that the secular trend embodied by the likes of tastytrade is likely to endure.  As the company noted, retail participation has increased to nearly 25% of the entire U.S. equity market in 2020 from a range of 10% to 15% over the previous four years, driven by improvements in technology and trader education, as well as greater market accessibility. The underlying structural shift is real, even if things do slow down a bit when the 'stimmies' are all spent."
334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>","Brookfield, KKR Said to Weigh Bids for Aramco Pipeline Stake","(Bloomberg) --  Brookfield Asset Management  (TSX:BAMa) and KKR (NYSE:KKR) are among top infrastructure investors weighing bids for a stake in Saudi Aramco’s oil pipelines, people familiar with the matter said.
Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) and China’s state-backed Silk Road Fund Co. have also been studying whether to make offers, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The stake sale could fetch Aramco (SE:2222) around $10 billion, the people said.
The world’s top oil producer has asked for expressions of interest and aims to receive non-binding offers next month, according to the people. Aramco’s advisers are also gauging interest from other potential bidders including sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp., the people said. Some bidders may team up given the size of the transaction, they said.
Aramco has been seeking to raise funds by selling stakes in non-core assets, mirroring a strategy adopted by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. An investor group including Brookfield and GIC Pte invested $10.1 billion in Adnoc’s natural-gas pipelines last year.
While large Canadian pension funds often pursue such assets, some may shy away from the Aramco deal given political tensions between their government and Saudi Arabia, according to the people. Deliberations are at an early stage, and details of the potential transaction could change, the people said.
Representatives for Apollo, Aramco, Brookfield, CIC and KKR declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Silk Road Fund didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Aramco is lining up a loan of about $7.5 billion that will be offered to potential investors in the oil pipelines, people familiar with the matter said last week. The oil producer is seeking new sources of capital to maintain annual dividend payments of $75 billion at a time of lower crude prices. Most of those payouts go to the Saudi state, which needs the money to fund its budget.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>","European firms improve diversity scores in pandemic year, study finds","By Aida Pelaez-Fernandez
(Reuters) - The number of major European companies with high participation of women in leadership positions has doubled over the past year, but there was less progress on top jobs, a study by a EU-sponsored non-profit organization showed on Thursday.
Brussels-based association European Women on Boards, which analysed 668 Europe's top listed companies included in the STOXX 600 index and national benchmarks, said the number of those with high scores on its Gender Diversity Index rose to 62 from 32 in 2019.
It defined as high score index readings of 0.8 and above where zero means no women on company boards and in other senior management positions and 1 is the ideal value with a 50% representation. 
Women made up just over a third of the analysed companies' boards, but held only 14% of ""C-suite"" jobs, such as chief executive, chief operating or finance officer. Only 6% of companies had female CEOs, the association said, though that marked an improvement from 4.7% in 2019.
The study said women were hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic, suffering higher unemployment and greater stress juggling work and family, but did not discuss its impact on the gender diversity scores.
The United Nations has set a 2030 goal for achieving gender equality and several EU countries, including its largest member Germany, have laws promoting it. Still, one report estimated that at current path, the bloc was at least 60 years away from accomplishing that goal. 
Companies from Norway, France, Britain, Finland and Sweden led the rankings, with Switzerland and newly represented Poland at the bottom of the table.
Three real state companies added to the STOXX 600 index in 2020, British groups Assura and Grainger, and Sweden's Wihlborgs Fastigheter AB, led with a perfect score.

Six of the tracked companies had no women on their boards, executive boards or committees, including two from Germany - Nemetschek and Rational - the study showed.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: Jack Ma's reappearance fails to soothe all investor concerns about regulatory crackdown,"By Megan Davies, John McCrank and Tom Westbrook
NEW YORK/BOSTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Billionaire Jack Ma's 50-second video reappearance has done little to resolve  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group's troubled relationship with regulators that is making some investors hesitate about owning the Chinese e-commerce giant's stock.
Relief at Ma's first public appearance added $58 billion in market value on Wednesday as Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed stock soared, though doubts crept in a day later and the stock fell more than 3% as the broader market steadied near two-year highs. 
Ma had not appeared in public since Oct. 24, when he blasted China's regulatory system. That set him on a collision course with officials and led to the suspension of Alibaba fintech affiliate Ant Group's blockbuster $37 billion IPO.
A source familiar with the matter said Ma cleared his schedule late last year to keep a low profile, prompting discussion at Alibaba about when and how he should reappear to assure investors. It was decided he should do something that would appear as part of his normal routine, rather than anything overt that could irk the government. 
While Ma has stepped down from corporate positions, he retains significant influence over Alibaba and Ant, and the regulatory crackdown on his business empire coupled with his absence was a concern for some investors.
There was skepticism that Ma's brief reappearance meant all was well with his businesses.
""The coast is not all clear for Alibaba and it is a judgment call whether you believe the company can still thrive in the changing environment,"" said Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Singapore's Nuvest Captial, which owns Alibaba stock.
""Without some skepticism, the price would be a lot higher,"" he said, adding his firm had increased exposure to China and with it Alibaba, which he believes can prosper over the medium to longer term.
Two of the company's investors in the United States who have sold out or reduced positions in Alibaba said they needed more reassurance about the company and the regulatory environment before reconsidering the stock. 
""One of our top criteria is leadership and we were investing in Alibaba because I really respect Jack Ma as a leader,"" said William Huston, founder and director of institutional services at independent investment advisory firm Bay Street Capital Holdings in Palo Alto, CA, with assets under management of $86 million. 
""We all know that just because he showed up ... doesn't necessarily explain what is going on.""
Huston, whose firm cut its holding in the Chinese firm last year from 8% of its portfolio to less than 1%, said the halting of the Ant IPO in November had caused uncertainty, and that Alibaba was ""not a prudent investment"" for it going forward.
'NOT IN THE CLEAR'
David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, Florida, which has about $4 billion in assets, said he held Alibaba last year but also sold as the Ant IPO was pulled. 
""When you don't know what to do in an evolving situation like this you can't use traditional securities analytics to reach decisions. We are standing aside and watching,"" Kotok said.
Chinese regulators have set about reining in Ma's financial and e-commerce empires since the Ant IPO suspension, which has weighed on its stock that remains below levels prior to the cancellation of the Ant IPO.
""What his actual state is will be completely up to Beijing to reveal to us,"" Leland Miller, CEO of U.S.-based consultancy China Beige Book. ""What we do know is whether Jack is running around, Jack is hiding or something else, Alibaba is not in the clear. There is a lot more of the story still to see.""
Some investors are, however, betting on long-term potential for Alibaba in the world's second-largest economy. 
Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading, who holds Alibaba shares, said he had protected against a potential fall when speculation about Ma's whereabouts began by buying put options. 
He covered those puts earlier in January on a report that Ma was OK and retains a long position in the stock.

""We have been investors for many years ... there's a very strong team of executives and Alibaba is bigger than just one person,"" said a Hong Kong based long-only investor, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.

It’s a fairly safe bet there will be another stimulus package with more direct payments to consumers and individuals and more help for small businesses,” GLOBALT Investments portfolio manager Keith Buchanan told Bloomberg.
Biden got straight to work after the inauguration, signing 15 executive actions on Wednesday, covering COVID-19, climate change, and immigration among other issues, stating “these are just all starting points.”
However, Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen encountered early Republican resistance to Biden’s $.1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan during her Senate confirmation hearing.

The automaker reported better-than-expected 2020 vehicle deliveries earlier this month, driven by a steady rise in electric vehicle adoption, even though it narrowly missed its ambitious full-year goal of half a million deliveries during a punishing year for the global auto industry.
The report released on Wednesday showed registrations in California, a bellwether for the electric carmaker and its largest U.S. market, recovered from a third-quarter low of about 16,200 vehicles to around 22,117 vehicles in the three months ended December. 
At about 11,417, registrations in the state for Tesla's Model Y compact crossover utility vehicle surpassed those for the Model 3. California registrations for Tesla's Model 3 mass-market sedan fell 34% on a yearly basis to 7,044. 
Total fourth-quarter vehicle registrations in the 23 states, where data was collected, stood at 44,749, with Model Y accounting for nearly half the registrations.
Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the United States typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.

Tesla, whose shares surged over 700% in 2020, is expected to report fourth-quarter results after market close on Jan. 27.

348,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 07:00PM ET</span>",United Airlines pledges more cost cuts after pandemic-driven quarterly loss,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc said on Wednesday it aims to cut about $2 billion of annual costs through 2023 as it charts a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that drove its fourth straight quarterly loss.
Airlines are counting on COVID-19 vaccines to boost travel demand later this year but warn that the strength of a rebound will largely depend on the pace of vaccine rollouts, particularly as coronavirus cases keep rising.
Chicago-based United said 2021 would be a ""transition year that's focused on preparing for a recovery."" Its shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.
The company burned an average of $33 million per day in the fourth quarter, including about $10 million of severance and debt payments, even as it continued to slash costs.
United furloughed thousands of employees last October when an initial round of payroll aid for airlines expired. It brought back those workers following a fresh $15 billion in payroll aid for the sector but warned the recall could be ""temporary"" as travel demand remains depressed.
United is set to receive about $2.6 billion in payroll support through March and said it expects to offer employees options like voluntary leaves to reduce furloughs after that time.
Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which last week labeled 2021 a year of recovery, expects to halt its daily cash burn rate of about $12 million in the spring and does not expect any furloughs.
United has the greatest exposure of major U.S. airlines to international travel, the sector hardest hit by the pandemic and the one likely to be the slowest to recover.
U.S. President Joe Biden, who was inaugurated on Wednesday, plans to maintain a ban on travelers from Europe and Brazil that his predecessor, Donald Trump, had signed an order to lift beginning on Jan. 26. 
United's adjusted net loss was $2.1 billion, or a loss of $7 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $676 million a year earlier. That missed analysts' estimates for a loss of $6.60 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue fell 69% to $3.4 billion, in line with forecasts. In the current quarter, United said it expects revenue to fall by 65% to 70% from a year ago and its flight capacity to shrink by at least 51%.
The airline had $19.7 billion of liquidity as of Dec. 31 and expects to have a similar amount at the end of March, it said.

Oil prices are now hovering around $55 a barrel on vaccine rollouts, and in the week to Jan. 15, U.S. energy firms added oil and natural gas rigs for an eighth week in a row. 
""By our calculations, you're getting close to a rig level in the Permian that could get you back to flat volumes to where we were pre-pandemic,"" Kim Dang, president at Kinder Morgan said at a post-earnings call.
""And so it's not clear how much they would ramp up capex in response to increasing prices,"" he added.
While Bakken is off to a good start for the year, Eagle Ford has still been weak, he said.
U.S. oil production peaked at nearly 13 million barrels per day (bpd) in late-2019, but is now around 11 million bpd after the coronavirus-induced lockdowns crushed fuel demand and oil prices. 
Kinder Morgan, which transports nearly 40% of the natural gas consumed in the United States, said natgas shipment volumes rose more than 6% sequentially, while total refined product volumes fell marginally. 
Pipeline companies are seeing a recovery in transport volumes after the pandemic wreaked havoc on demand and forced operators to slash fees to ensure customers keep using their networks to move oil, gas and refined products. 
Excluding items, Kinder Morgan earned 27 cents per share, versus estimates of 24 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

Revenue also rose sequentially to $3.12 billion, above analysts' estimates of $3.05 billion.

NEW DELHI/SYDNEY (Reuters) - India's IndiGo has emerged as one of the world's biggest airlines by capacity, aided by a swift recovery in the domestic aviation market to nearly 80% of pre-pandemic levels and the financial strength to boost market share as rivals struggle.
The airline is now the world's seventh biggest by capacity and the largest outside the United States and China, according to data firm OAG. It is a rare bright spot in a battered global aviation industry, providing a lifeline to squeezed lessors and aircraft manufacturers by paying bills on time and in full.
IndiGo took 44 planes from Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) last year - the most of any customer and topping Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd - as it replaced older planes with more fuel-efficient newer models. It is also gearing up to expand its fleet further from 2023.
With a 52% domestic market share in 2020 versus 47% in 2019, and profitability in sight after a loss last fiscal year, IndiGo is expanding its reach to smaller Indian cities such as Ranchi, Patna and Gorakhpur to replace a fall in business travel on larger routes like New Delhi-Mumbai, CEO Ronojoy Dutta told Reuters.
It is also betting that faster growth and higher margins will come from non-stop flights to international destinations like Moscow, Cairo and Manila which it can reach with its narrowbody planes, eliminating the need to complicate its fleet with widebody aircraft.
""As things stabilise, I'm very optimistic that by the end of 2021, I think we'll be totally back to normal,"" Dutta said, referring to the calendar year rather than the financial year ending March 31.
""And I think 2022 will be a great year for us in terms of growth and profitability,"" he added.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought global air travel to a halt, plunging airlines into the red. India imposed one of the toughest lockdowns and even now airlines can only fly 80% of their total capacity on domestic routes.
IndiGo already had free cash of 89.3 billion rupees ($1.22 billion) as of March 31, 2020, a week after India went into lockdown, which it bolstered by raising more than 30 billion rupees over the next six months through the sale and leaseback of some assets and other cost-cutting measures.
Once IndiGo can operate at full capacity, it wants to ramp up its utilisation rate to a breakeven level of around 12 hours per day, compared with 10 hours currently, said Dutta, adding it would also be able to fill more seats and reduce unit costs.
Parent Interglobe Aviation Ltd's shares have doubled from pandemic lows in March 2020 to trade within 10% of their October 2019 record high.
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH
Before the pandemic, IndiGo deployed around 25% of its capacity on international routes, where flights are now often restricted to certain countries or charters. This means it is currently operating only about 20% of international flights.
The international business typically offer margins around 10% higher than the price-sensitive domestic market, Dutta said, adding that for now IndiGo would expand using its narrowbody fleet, meaning places like London, where it has slots, are out.
IndiGo's strong financial position relative to domestic and regional rivals like SpiceJet Ltd, Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd and Indonesia's Lion Air should help it dominate flights within a seven-hour radius, some analysts say.
""IndiGo has cleverly identified its bases within India and is now getting ready to spread its tentacles all across the sub-continent,"" said Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.
Despite the recent turbulence, Dutta expects the proportion of capacity deployed to international markets to rise a few percentage points each year.
IndiGo has 580 planes on order with Airbus that have yet to be delivered and is receiving them at a rate of around 50 a year. Even so, Dutta feels that, with the growth it is eyeing, it may not have enough planes to fly everywhere it wants to.
""Somewhere around 2024-2025 we'll probably pause and say could we bring some of the deliveries forward and then order more for later years,"" he said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed at record highs on Wednesday as Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th U.S. president, while solid results from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) sparked a rally in shares of ""stay-at-home"" beneficiaries.
Shares of the world's largest streaming service Netflix surged 16.85% after the company said it would no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its TV shows and movies.
The rest of the FAANG group, due to report results in the coming weeks, jumped with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc rising 5.36%. The NYSE FANG+TM index gained 4.77%.
""It's a tech outperformance day which is pretty rare over the past two or three months as the cyclical rotation has kind of gotten underway,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He added a lot of the move can be traced to Netflix.
""(Today was) just a reminder that the tech run had gotten extended... the FAANG names and some of the other S&P 500 tech names are still incredible operators and are going to be putting out incredible earnings quarters for the foreseeable future,"" Mayfield said.
Biden will waste little time turning the page on the Trump era, aides said, signing 15 executive actions in the afternoon on issues ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy to climate change.
""I'm not sure that the politics of inauguration day did much but certainly the expectation for a trillion plus in stimulus,"" Mayfield added, referring to Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion spending plan.
The Dow has gained about 57% and the S&P 500 advanced about 68% since Donald Trump assumed office on Jan. 20, 2017, which compares with a 65% jump in the Dow and 75% gain in the S&P during the first term of the Obama administration.
Wall Street's main indexes scaled record highs in the past few months, with the blue-chip Dow jumping about 13% since the presidential elections in November, as investors bet on a strong economic recovery in 2021 on the back of COVID-19 vaccine rollout and a bigger pandemic relief plan. 
Nearly all of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in afternoon trading, with communication services, consumer discretionary and technology among the biggest gainers.
Wrapping up results from major U.S. banks,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) slipped 0.2% despite posting quarterly profit that blew past estimates driven by strength in its trading business.
The broader banks index shed about 1.34%, declining for the third day.
With stock market valuations sitting near a 20-year high, investors are hoping corporate results and profit outlooks will help them determine to what degree the valuations are justified. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 257.86 points, or 0.83%, to 31,188.38, the S&P 500 gained 52.94 points, or 1.39%, to 3,851.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 260.07 points, or 1.97%, to 13,457.25.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co raised its full-year sales forecast for a second time as it benefited from sustained coronavirus-driven demand for cleaning products. Its shares, however, fell 1.25% after it warned that the pace of sales might slow as vaccines roll out. 
UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) dipped 0.38% after the health insurer's quarterly profit slumped nearly 38%, weighed down by costs related to its programs to make COVID-19 testing and treatment more accessible for its customers.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 336 new highs and four new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.66 billion shares, compared with the 12.83 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz on Wednesday unveiled the EQA, a new electric compact SUV as part of plans to take on rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and offer more emission-free vehicles to consumers to meet targets in Europe and China.
The EQA, the first of several electric models Mercedes-Benz plans to launch this year, will initially have a range of 426 kilometres (265 miles), with a 500km model coming later, the premium brand carmaker said in a video presentation.
The SUV will go on sale in Europe on Feb 4 at what board of management Britta Seeger described as ""very attractive price points"".
Electric vehicle (EV) sales took off in Europe last year as carmakers scrambled to meet European Union CO2 emissions targets. Sales received a boost from subsidies included in economic stimulus measures rolled out in France and Germany, in particular.
Sales of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models rose 122% across the EU through the first three quarters of 2020.
Mercedes-Benz describes the EQA as an ""urban entry model"" and board member Seeger touted its ""sustainability, versatility and fresh look"".
Electric carmaker Tesla got a head start on traditional carmakers with their vast investments in fossil-fuel vehicles and has dominated global sales. The mass-market Tesla Model 3 is the world's best-selling EV, followed in distant second place by  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s Zoe. 
As well as emissions targets, carmakers face bans on fossil-fuel vehicles that come into effect as early as 2030 in some markets.

355,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>","Biden Agenda, Intel Profit, Jobless Claims: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- Stocks rose as investors looked to the U.S.’s next chapter and the rising certainty that an additional injection of stimulus is not far off.
President Joe Biden was inaugurated at 12:00 PM ET (1600 GMT) on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, which only two weeks ago was the target of an angry mob of Donald Trump supporters.
The outbound President Trump left office with the lowest approval in recent memory and a country still ravaged by a deadly pandemic and the economic fallout. 
But corporate earnings are strong and bode well for a recovery. Former Federal Chairwoman Janet Yellen in her confirmation hearing as Treasury Secretary on Tuesday called on lawmakers in Congress to “act big” and support further stimulus to boost the economy. She could be confirmed as early as this week.
Here are three things that could affect stocks tomorrow:
1. New day, new leader
Biden has an ambitious agenda for his first 10 days in office as he has to come to grips with a number of crises, not least of which is the pandemic and the botched vaccine rollout. But he has a few positives working on his side, including a Congress that will have a slightly Blue majority after the swearing in of two Democrats from Georgia, who won their hotly contested seats earlier this month.
A new single-dose vaccine candidate expected to be considered for approval in the coming weeks could alleviate the strain on the vaccine rollout. That candidate, from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), would come more than a month after the approval for emergency use of vaccines by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)
2. Big company earnings
It’s entering the heart of earnings reporting season, and Wednesday brings results from Intel,  IBM  and Travelers, among others.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)is expected to report earnings per share of $1.10 on revenue of $17.45 billion. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is seen reporting EPS of $1.81 a share on revenue of $20.6 billion, and The Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) is expected to report EPS of $3.16 on revenue of $7.3 billion.
All estimates are by analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. Treasury nominee hints at stimulus spending
Hints might not be the right word. Janet Yellen, the former Fed Chair who is now nominated to become Treasury Secretary, told the Senate big spending would be necessary to steer the U.S. economy out of its Covid malaise. 
On Thursday the weekly jobless claims numbers come out, and the number -- combined with a disappointing jobs report for December -- could help convince lawmakers to act. Initial claims are expected to be 910,000 and continuing claims are expected to be 5.4 million.

Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski, meanwhile, indicated she was not hurry to throw her support behind another stimulus, saying it would require a ""fair amount"" of debate.

(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) on Wednesday reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, as medical costs came in lower than Wall Street estimates even with increased spending related to the surge in COVID-19 cases in December.
For much of 2020 health insurers incurred lower healthcare costs as people avoided doctors offices and hospitals out of fear or contracting COVID-19 and elective medical procedures were put off.
UnitedHealth said benefits from the deferred care was largely offset by coronavirus testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter. Its share were off slightly at $350.99.
Healthcare spending, which had returned to more normal levels early in the quarter, rose in late November and December with the spike in COVID-19 costs, the company said on a conference call. 
The insurer, however, reported a medical loss ratio (MLR) - the percentage of premiums paid for medical services - of 83.2% for the quarter, less than analysts' forecasts of 84.36%, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes called the quarter's MLR ""a positive surprise."" 
Since the pandemic started, COVID-19 has claimed over 401,000 lives in the United States and more than 24.1 million people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, with cases and deaths still rising in most of the country.
UnitedHealth said it expected COVID-19-related cost trends in 2021 to remain similar to 2020 despite the vaccination efforts.
COVID-19 accounted for about 11% of all care activity during the fourth quarter compared to about 6% in the third, Chief Financial Officer John Rex said. 
The company reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share, beating Wall Street estimates by 11 cents, according to Refinitiv data. 
UnitedHealth maintained the 2021 profit forecast it issued last month for adjusted net earnings of $17.75 to $18.25 per share. That includes $1.80 per share in treatment and testing costs related to COVID-19.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: Europe Inc earnings in no man's land between recession and recovery,"By Julien Ponthus and Danilo Masoni
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Europe Inc's fourth-quarter reporting season will test investor confidence in profit recovery as a new round of social restrictions is expected to have driven earnings down more than 25% while further blurring the outlook.
Boosted by COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs and massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, European stocks have rallied more than 50% since the March pandemic crash lows and analysts see them sticking to their bullish course.
But faced with the fresh dip in economic activity, management teams will most likely stay prudent, potentially creating room for disappointment on markets which look to have already priced in better times ahead.
""Third-quarter results showed how quickly the economy rebounded after the lockdowns. That clearly won't be the story of the fourth quarter during which new social distancing measures triggered a loss of momentum"", said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in London. 
The focus this season will be more about which companies are resilient rather than which ones will benefit from the recovery and investors will pay close attention to numbers from the likes of LVMH, SAP, Shell (LON:RDSa), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and BNP over the next couple of weeks.
""Manufacturing should prove resilient in comparison with say, tourism or other discretionary sectors"", Cau added.
As a whole, companies listed on the STOXX 600 are expected to report 26% earnings drop in the fourth quarter, almost two percentage points worse than the fall recorded in the previous three months, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
In any event the impact of results on share prices will be hard to call with CEOs being constrained by the current uncertainties to give a clear steer on profit recovery. 
""The visibility is quite poor in terms of what may be published by companies and how investors will react,"" said Jerome Schupp, a member of the asset allocation team at Prime Partners in Lausanne.
Another headwind for Europe is the rising euro. 
""It will impact negatively earnings growth in Europe because all the profit done in the U.S. translated into euros will be slightly lower,"" he added. 
But the short term hurdles faced by the European economy are not discouraging some investors. 
Some strategists even expect European equities to catch up with Wall Street which had a stellar 2020. Last year the STOXX 600 fell 4% whereas the S&P 500 jumped 16%.
The case for such optimism is based on the anticipation of a massive rebound in European corporate profits, culminating in an expected 81% growth in the April to June period compared with the 2020 quarter at the height of the first COVID-19 wave.
Even forecasts for the first quarter of 2021, which has started with lockdowns still in place, point to an almost 44% jump as factories continue to work and consumers keep spending. 
For a graphic on European earnings offer catch-up potential: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprnkbrpe/Europe%20Inc%20catch%20up%20potential.JPG
PROFIT-TAKING RISKS 
Other strategists urge caution, at least for the short term.
Companies ranging from Just Eat Takeaway to plumbing supplies maker Geberit and computer peripherals group Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) saw their share prices slump despite strong trading updates, possibly signalling how the market rally has created room for profit taking.
Similarly on Wall Street, shares in big banks from Goldman to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) tumbled even though they reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits.
There were also some bright spots. In Europe solid results were lifting shares in ASML and Richemont on Wednesday.
JPMorgan analysts said this week the reaction to results has been mixed so far even though the big profit decline expected for both Europe and the United States has set the bar quite low.
Refinitiv I/B/E/S points to a 7.8% contraction of S&P 500 quarterly earnings, over three times less that of Europe. But in the subsequent quarters, S&P 500 earnings growth is expected to lag behind that of the STOXX.

365,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 11:08AM ET</span>","Tesla, GM, Ford Looking at a Good Year: Analysts","By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  It's looking good for carmakers, and not just Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
Oppenheimer gave the Elon Musk-led company its highest price target yet at $1,036, compared to the previous high of $950.
Meanwhile  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is calling General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) a buy and adding Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to its short-term Catalyst Buy List with a better-than-expected 2021 ahead, according to StreetInsider. Analyst Emmanuel Rosner also cited electric vehicles at both old-school manufacturers as part of the excitement.
Tesla was little changed, GM was up close to 2% and Ford rose almost 5%.
Oppenheimer said it expects Tesla to be a leader in autonomous vehicles and continue to stay ahead in electric cars. The firm acknowledges the insane run up in shares over the past year, with the stock doubling again since November, and investors at a bit of a loss. 
“We believe bulls are betting on TSLA leading commercialization of autonomous vehicles technology,"" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said, raising the price target by more than double from $486, and maintaining a buy-equivalent rating.
Oppenheimer is somewhat hesitant over Tesla's lack of incorporating LiDAR technology into its vehicles but, ""the learning cycles enabled by having over 1M vehicles on the road is an extraordinary advantage.""
GM, in the meantime, may provide an update on its electric and autonomous vehicle plans when it reports fourth quarter earnings, and Ford is expected to present a redesigned EV strategy, Deutsche Bank's Rosner said.
Rosner reiterated a buy rating and initiated a 'Catalyst Call Buy' on GM, expecting it to possibly provide better-than-expected 2021 guidance in the $6 to $7 range vs. consensus of $5.92. The upside is expected to come from strong full size truck pricing and volume, ongoing structural cost savings and the non-repeat of the $1.2 billion Takata recall charge. 
For Ford, Rosner added the hold-rated company to its short-term Catalyst Call Buy List on a robust product cycle, favorable pricing for U.S. trucks and restructuring savings. 
Ford could reboot its global restructuring program, and present a redesigned EV strategy, Rosner said. 
""For 2021, we are forecasting Ebit/EPS of $7.5bn/$1.20, above consensus of $6.8bn/$1.00, and think management could guide Ebit/EPS well above $7bn/$1.00,"" the analyst said, according to StreetInsider. ""Ford is on the cusp of an attractive product launch cycle (new F-series, Bronco, Mach-E), which should boost volume/price.""
Ford's also likely to obtain restructuring savings from its efforts in South America where it recently exited Brazil. ""These tailwinds should more than offset the negative impact from higher commodity costs,"" Rosner said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A 1000% jump in the penny stock of a company with no staff and a high school investing club that doubled its money are just two examples of the big gains to be made from a retail share trading boom that shows no sign of flagging in 2021.
Three weeks into the year, as world markets hit new record highs, retail investors, often trading from home on mobile phones, are credited with boosting the fortunes of the small-cap Russell 3,000 share index, where 10 of the top 20 best performers have surged by around 75% since the start of 2021.
There is little or no research coverage on some of these companies in the Russell index, such as cannabis data aggregator Akerna (NASDAQ:KERN) which has doubled in value already this year.
Shares in an over-the-counter traded U.S. healthcare company Signal Advance soared to $70 from 70 cents in under a week after Signal was mistaken for an unlisted texting app also called Signal that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk had tweeted about, saying ""use Signal.""
""These are not normal markets!!"" --  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said.
Signal Advance shares have since dropped to $7, but early punters would have netted hefty gains.
Retail broker eToro told Reuters it registered more than 380,000 new users in the first 11 days of 2021, adding to the five million who used it to trade last year. It says a third of its base joined in 2020 when trading on its platform surged five-fold from 2019 to $1.5 trillion.
Retail investors' participation in U.S. equity order flows increased to nearly 20% in 2020 from 15% in 2019, while orders from long-only funds fell to 6.4% last year from 9.7% in 2019, data from Swiss bank UBS showed.
""Historically, people have had to sort of give up their day jobs if they wanted to be a day trader... this is a much different and probably stickier phenomenon than we saw during the dotcom bubble,"" the head of equity trading strategy at a U.S. bank said.
He was referring to the late-1990s tech stocks run-up which ended with a crash in 2000.
FROTHINESS
The reasons for the retail rush are well-documented -- lockdowns that boosted savings rates, policy stimulus that has put money into people's pockets, the lack of sporting events to bet on and zero return on cash savings.
More importantly the mushrooming of mobile trading apps have made it easy for amateur stock pickers to access the $85 trillion global stock market.
Robinhood, one of the biggest apps, said it had 13 million users as of last May, half of them first-time investors with a median age of 31 years. It declined to reveal more up-to-date figures.
Some wannabe investors are just teenagers.
Rob Almeida, a portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management said his 16-year old son was mocked by his friend, who runs an investment club at school, for making a 30% return from a MFS fund last year while they were doubling or tripling their money by investing in stocks via mobile apps.
""His buddies were teasing him, because they considered that a pretty meager return. So all of that points to me ... frothiness,"" Almeida said.
He noted too that the cash flooding into the markets was colliding with tight net supply of new equity, something evident in the performance of new listings, such as AirbnB and DoorDash. Both companies doubled on debut.
A Renaissance ETF that measures the performance of U.S. IPOs is up 200% since March, versus 57% for the benchmark index.
There are signs that retail players are moving to trade derivatives. Almeida noted ""a lot more"" buying of single-stock options, derivatives that allow holders to buy shares at pre-determined prices.
Volumes of such option contracts surged last month to 60.1 million, almost triple January 2020 levels, based on data from the Options Clearing Corporation, the world's biggest derivatives clearing house.
The trend is worrying because dealers who sell these derivatives must hedge their risk with a long position on the corresponding stock, inflating prices further.
The sheer momentum and prospect of double-digit returns is sucking in more players to the markets. Some market professionals are worried a crash is inevitable.
Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities brokerage, blames an ""explosion"" of chatter on internet forums for ""speculative bubbly moves in illiquid small cap names.""
""This has not ended well historically,"" he said.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Alibaba-backed logistics firm Best weighs sale in strategic review - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - New York-listed Best Inc, a Chinese logistics firm backed by e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, is considering a sale as part of a strategic review, six people with knowledge of the matter said.
With the endorsement of Alibaba, its biggest shareholder, Best has tapped financial advisers to explore options as its shares have been underperforming and are worth a fifth of its IPO price in 2018, two of the people involved in the discussions said.
Billionaire Jack Ma's Alibaba, which owns 33% of the firm, as well as Best founder and CEO Johnny Chou, who has a 11% stake on a fully diluted basis, could both end up selling their stakes, five of the people said.
Best's stock was up 8.8% in morning trade in New York on Wednesday, after having jumped as much as 14.6% earlier in the session.
No formal sale process has been launched, and the company and Alibaba have not decided which option to take as the strategic review is still underway, cautioned the individuals, including two who were approached about a sale.
The people declined to be named as the information is confidential.
A Best spokeswoman denied that a sale was under consideration. She said Chou continued to believe in the ""bright future and long-term value"" of the company's integrated smart supply chain and logistics solutions, and had no plan to sell his stake.
The company, which has a market value of $790 million, did not comment on other issues including whether it was conducting a business review.
Alibaba said in an emailed statement the information was incorrect, but did not elaborate.
The Best discussions are happening against the backdrop of a regulatory crackdown by Chinese authorities on Ma's business empire including an anti-trust probe of Alibaba and sharpening scrutiny of its financial affiliate Ant Group.  
    Reuters was unable to determine whether the potential sale is linked to the probe.
The e-commerce group started considering a stake divestment late last year after it found it difficult to integrate Best with other logistics companies under its portfolio, two of the people involved in the discussions told Reuters.
Best tapped advisers to suggest strategic options towards the end of 2020, and they have approached a number of buyers including domestic delivery major S.F. Holding Co Ltd and private equity firms for the sale of the stakes, they said.
One of the potential buyers said his firm had received what he described as a deal ""teaser"" about a sale of shares by Best towards the end of last year and later about fundraising for one of its units.
S.F. did not respond to a request for comment.
Other options the company is considering include fundraising for its freight delivery unit, three of the sources said. Best could also sell its finance leasing business, one said.
The deal, if launched and completed, will add to a logistics sector consolidation in China. Reuters reported in December retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and Carlyle, among others, are bidding for South Korean CJ Group's China logistics business.
Best was founded in 2007 by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) executive Chou and debuted in New York in 2017. With a 12% share of the Chinese express delivery market in 2019, it is one of several couriers that work with Alibaba's logistics division Cainiao.
The company's shares fell nearly 70% over the past 12 months, as of Tuesday's close, as its earnings have been hit hard by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, the S&P/BNY Mellon China Select ADR Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed in New York, has gained 45% over the same period.
Reuters reported in August that Best was seeking a Hong Kong listing for its express delivery and freight delivery businesses, keen to boost its valuation and establish an investor base closer to China.

But the listing prospects have been dented by its falling stock price and weak quarterly results, said the two people cited earlier.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley boosts targets after blowout trading quarter,"By Ambar Warrick, Matt Scuffham and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) boosted both its short and long-term operating targets on Wednesday after coronavirus-induced volatility in financial markets helped the Wall Street bank post a quarterly profit that sailed past estimates.
The company also confirmed plans to buy back $10 billion of shares this year, more than three times the figures announced by its retail banking peers, as it wrapped up results for U.S. lenders, which pointed to a modest rebound in the economy.
""We are in the growth phase of this company for the next decade,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts on a conference call.
Morgan Stanley increased its two-year target for return on tangible equity to 14%-16%, from an earlier forecast of 13%-15%. The metric measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit.
The company also raised its longer term target for the same metric to more than 17%, from its previous outlook of 15%-17%.
""If we'd said to you 3 years ago, our aspiration was to have a 17-plus ROTCE, you would have thought we're off the planet,"" Gorman said, responding to one analyst, who commented that the target looked conservative.
Gorman's comments came after high trading volumes during the final quarter of 2020, stemming from the U.S. elections and the release of coronavirus vaccines, benefited Morgan Stanley's trading unit, which is housed within the institutional securities business.
The bank's revenue from sales and trading rose to $4.22 billion from $3.19 billion a year earlier.
Net revenue rose to $13.64 billion from $10.86 billion last year, while revenue from the company's investment banking division rose to $2.30 billion from $1.58 billion.
Gorman has, however, been taking steps to insulate the bank from its reliance on trading, and engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions, those of  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) and E*Trade, to bolster its investment management and broking arms.
Morgan Stanley's equity underwriting revenue soared 81% from a year earlier, driven by high profile IPOs and follow-on offerings as clients continued to access capital markets.
Morgan Stanley was among underwriters for IPOs of companies including Airbnb Inc, gaming firm Playtika Holding Corp, fintech startup Affirm Holdings Inc and cloud-based data warehouse firm Snowflake Inc.
""The environment is clearly exceptional, and we are not counting on it to persist in our forward estimates. Nevertheless, there is nothing not to like in these results,"" Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said in a note.
The bank's shares, which rose about 34% in 2020, hit their highest level in over 20 years in early trading.
Morgan Stanley's most comparable rival,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), on Tuesday posted a blockbuster fourth-quarter profit that dwarfed Wall Street estimates, but executives warned that capital markets activity fueling results lately will probably slow down.
Morgan Stanley reported a net income applicable to common shareholders of $3.27 billion, or $1.81 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $2.09 billion, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of $1.27 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co raised its full-year sales forecast for a second time on Wednesday as it benefited from sustained coronavirus-driven demand for cleaning products, while also warning that the pace of sales might slow as vaccines roll out.
The Cincinnati-based conglomerate reported an 8% rise in net sales for its second quarter, slower than 9% growth in the first quarter but showing the boom in household cleaning purchases was continuing. 
P&G said Americans were cleaning and sanitizing 30% more than before the pandemic. Dishwasher cycles were run 15% more and air fresheners sprayed 20% more often while in-home paper towel usage was up 15%. 
The company saw a 30% rise in organic sales of its home care products in the second quarter, while consumer willingness to pay for more premium brands over store-branded goods helped sales of items like Downy laundry beads and Tide pods.
P&G's shares, which rose as much as 2.5% initially, lost all those gains after executives warned that the rollout of vaccines was liable to cool those trends.
""Could there be some reduction in top line growth rates if, God-willing, the situation gets better, and therefore, I need less in my pantry as protection? Yes, that could occur,"" finance and operating chief Jon Moeller said.
Still, P&G raised its fiscal 2021 sales growth forecast to a range of 5% to 6%, from 3% to 4%, mainly on the back of a strong first half.
It also lifted its core earnings per share growth forecast to 8% to 10%, from 5% to 8%, and said organic sales are now expected to grow 5% to 6%, compared with 4% to 5% it anticipated earlier.
The company will also buy back up to $10 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2021, up from the $7 billion to $9 billion target it set earlier, and Moeller pointed to the likelihood of a boost from new fiscal stimulus under Joe Biden's presidency.

""It's a rather uncertain environment, but where stimulus has existed it has helped and more of it will help more,"" he said.

Investing.com --  U.S. stocks ended the Trump presidency on a high note on Wednesday, amid signs that the peak of the Covid-19 infection curve has passed and in anticipation of aggressive efforts to reflate the weakened economy by the new administration, due to be sworn in in a couple of hours.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 83 points, or 0.3% at 31,014 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, meanwhile, was up 0.4%, testing a new all-time high.
Stocks have been supported this week by Janet Yellen's forceful arguments for more fiscal spending this year to support the economy through the pandemic. Yellen, who is incoming President Joe Biden's Treasury Secretary designate, told her confirmation hearing in the Senate on Tuesday that the high debt levels that such spending will create should be seen as a matter for another day.
The Nasdaq was lifted in particular by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock, which surged 14.4% after the streaming giant said it expects to be cash-flow positive this year and thus no longer dependent on the debt markets to fund new content. The company added 8.5 million new subscribers in the last quarter, taking the overall base above 200 million for the first time and cementing its leadership in an increasingly competitive field for video entertainment.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock also powered 1.6% higher to its highest since the wheels fell off the subprime credit boom in 2007, after the bank reported a sharp rise in profits powered by its trading and underwriting businesses.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 4.9% after founder Jack Ma reappeared in public for the first time since China's regulators forced him to abandon the proposed initial public offering of his giant financial services holding Ant Group. The scrapping of the IPO, and the publication soon afterwards of new regulation that will greatly limit its profitability, had been widely interpreted as reflecting a political campaign to reduce the influence that Ma's spectacular rise to riches has brought him.
As earnings season cranks up, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock slipped 0.7% despite raising its guidance for profit and shareholder returns over its current fiscal year, which ends in June. Online luxury store TheRealReal, by contrast, hit a new all-time high after solid results from two European luxury names, Burberry (OTC:BURBY) and  Compagnie Financiere Richemont  (OTC:CFRUY)."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA's drug development programme has suffered a setback with the most important clinical trial of its cancer drug hopeful bintrafusp alfa stopped because the treatment does not appear to work.
The halt also puts a damper on the oncology ambitions of Britain's GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), which is co-developing the drug with Merck under a 2019 agreement that could have seen it pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.5 billion) to the German company.
In a statement on Wednesday, Merck KGaA said the late-stage trial dubbed INTR@PID Lung 037, testing the novel drug against U.S. namesake Merck & Co's bestseller Keytruda in newly diagnosed cases of a certain type of lung cancer, would be discontinued.
It said independent supervisors concluded the drug was unlikely to show the desired efficacy.
Merck KGaA's shares dropped as much as 7% but had pared losses to trade 3.3% lower at 1355 GMT.
Keytruda dominates a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, and is expected to generate $17 billion in revenues this year.
Merck KGaA and Merck & Co Inc, known as MSD outside North America, share historic roots but have been under separate ownership since World War One.
The bintrafusp alfa drug is a so-called fusion protein designed to trigger both checkpoint inhibition and another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion.
While several other experimental drugs are based on TGF-beta-inhibtion, the combination is a unique approach in the pharma industry.

Loss-making Alitalia has endured 11 years of turbulent private management and three failed restructuring attempts, with the government now seeking to nationalise and relaunch the ailing flag carrier after the coronavirus crisis scuppered plans to sell it.
""The Alitalia brand should not be retained by the NewCo, since it is an emblematic indicator of continuity,"" the European Union said in the letter published by L'Espresso.
The letter, dated Jan. 8, also asks Rome to launch an ""open, transparent, non-discriminatory and unconditional tender"" to shed Alitalia assets, rejecting the idea that the old carrier could sell its belongings to the new company in a private negotiation.
A Commission representative said the EU executive had no comment on the press report and that it is in contact with the Italian authorities on the matter and cannot comment on ongoing discussions.
The EU can block the injection of 3 billion euros ($3.63 billion) earmarked by the Italian government for the new company, thwarting Rome's ambitions for the airline.
""The NewCo should not retain the combined aviation, ground handling and maintenance businesses,"" the EU competition watchdog is quoted as saying in the letter.
Brussels suggests that the ground-handling and maintenance businesses should be sold separately to a third party.
A spin-off of the old Alitalia, which employs more than 11,000 workers in total, is a political hot potato for the government because it would mean potential job cuts for employees outside the aviation business.
A representative of the Italian industry ministry, which is responsible for the nationalisation of Alitalia, was not immediately available for a comment.

Managed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the $1 billion IShares Micro-Cap ETF, known by its ticker symbol (NYSE:IWC), has seen nearly $26 million of net outflows over the past 12 months. The $129 million First Trust Dow Jones Select MicroCap Index Fund, or (NYSE:FDM), has seen withdrawals of $19 million.
“Given the rally in small caps, you might not expect that to be the case,” said Ryan Issakainen, a strategist with First Trust Advisors LP. Investors have been favoring more sector-themed funds, such as those tied to the hot segments of clean energy and cyber security, he said.
The outflows reflect the fact that funds just don’t offer the same kind of jaw-dropping gains that day traders bidding up individual penny stocks are becoming addicted to. So far this year, shares in IWC have gained about 13%, while FDM is up almost 8%, paling in comparison to some of the hottest individual microcaps: health-care companies Zomedica Corp. and TransEnterix Inc. have soared roughly 370% and 450%, respectively.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Macro zen quietens stock bubble clamour,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - The historically eye-popping equity valuations emerging from the pandemic clearly unnerve company analysts - but the macro market take on pricey stock movements appears far more zen.
A flood of global money supply required to keep business and households afloat through the economic stop demanded by COVID-19 appears to some to have blown serial bubbles in everything from Big Tech to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), bonds to bitcoin, and anything green to gold.
The expected V-shape in corporate profits through the shock and rebound makes it easier to see beyond soaring price/earnings ratios, temporarily bloated by the government-mandated stops on the earnings side of that metric over the past year.
But even 12-month forward P/Es - not least those on electric car doyen Tesla north of 200 - still look alarming. Even catch-all indices show global stock multiples of more than 20 times, approaching levels last seen during the dotcom bubble.
And that's before you get to the 215% jump in cryptocurrency bitcoin in just 3 months, or the 500-1,500% gains in hydrogen fuel cell stocks over the past year - or a 1,000% jump in just days this year by a little known U.S. medical applications firm after a misinterpreted tweet by Tesla boss Elon Musk.
It appears investors are now starting to see bubbles and froth around every corner.
A  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) client survey this week showed almost 90% see bubbles being blown across markets, with bitcoin the most extreme. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s monthly fund manager poll also saw bitcoin and Big Tech as ""most crowded trades"" and almost 1 in 5 saw a Wall Street bubble as the biggest ""tail risk"".
GLOBAL MACRO ZEN?
And yet many economists reckon handwringing about pockets of apparent overvaluation miss the bigger picture of an ossifying interest rate horizon, relative equity prices and premia over rock-bottom bond yields, historically low future earnings discounts and - crucially for some - relative equity exposure.
""What works at the micro-level does not necessarily work at the macro-level,"" wrote liquidity specialist Michael Howell at Cross Border Capital.
The 44% jump in world equity relative to actual earnings last year may have put markets near a bubble top with prices a blistering 27 times actual earnings. But this misses the nature of the shock, the forward comparison and the fact investors have not been aggressively chasing stocks at all, Howell said.
Cross Border Capital reckons P/E is always distorted by waves of excess liquidity and both by sentiment-driven and fundamentally-driven shifts in asset allocation. ""Cheap"" or ""Expensive"" labels are very different from them being under-owned or over-owned in asset allocation terms relative to benchmarks.
A global liquidity multiple like P/L - portfolio exposure in effect - may be the best valuation measure, Cross Border claims. And this measure has been fairly stable for the past decade and is far below bubble peaks of 1999/2000.
Regional variations show very different pictures, with U.S. asset allocation very skewed to equity while it's barely changed in Europe or emerging markets outside China over the past 10 years. But even in the United States, it's not at extremes, Cross Border claimed
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou's flows team at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have for two months insisted relative non-bank investor positioning in stocks, bonds and cash implies room for another 20% plus gain in world equities before indigestion or historic excess emerges.
They also downplay rising fears that a gradual backup in real bond yields alone would change the picture. As long as the assumed central bank ""reaction function"" ahead is not disturbed, expected liquidity or money supply expansion is more important.
Hedge fund manager Stephen Jen at EurizonSLJ takes a different tack by examining whether central bank money printing ""flattered"" equity prices in the 12 years before the pandemic. Curiously, he found the ratio of aggregate world equity capitalisation to global gross domestic product was unchanged between 2007 and 2019, but masked big regional variations.
U.S. equity prices far outstrip GDP while Europe and emerging markets underperformed and Jen claimed this was largely due to structural issues such as globalisation and offshoring, tech and innovation, and margins and labour pricing. These would not revert back to some historical mean after the pandemic and U.S. outperformance on those scores would likely persist, undermining arguments for a weaker dollar as recoveries broaden.
""The pandemic’s impact on aggregate GDP will likely turn out to be temporary, but some of its implications for the various sectors may be permanent and structural,"" Jen said.
So, bubble or not? Pick your measure, your stock or your region. But the greater the angst about it, then the less likely we see mass over-exposure. The rest then hinges on years of easy policy sustaining clearly higher multiples.
""We likely have a rapid rebound in earnings growth ahead and it will not take much time to erase a lot of this over-valuation with growth - even with bubble phenomena,"" said Goodbody global adviser Joe Prendergast. But he added: ""For the conservative investor, it's important to not be distracted by shiny new things for their own sake.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares gained on Wednesday on bets of hefty U.S. spending after U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen urged lawmakers to ""act big"" to save the economy and worry about debt later. Oil rose and the dollar slipped in response. 
At her confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Yellen said the benefits of a big stimulus package to counter the coronavirus pandemic were greater than the expenses of a higher debt burden.
Pandemic relief would take priority over tax increases, she said, calling for corporations and the wealthy - both winners from Republican tax cuts in 2017 - to ""pay their fair share"".
Investors in European equities welcomed the comments, with the Euro STOXX 600 climbing 0.5%, gathering steam in morning trading. Indexes in Frankfurt and Paris were up 0.5% and 0.2% respectively, though London shares were flat.
Luxury stocks gave the biggest boost, with Richemont quarterly sales climbing 5%, led by strong growth at its jewellery brands in Asia and the Middle East.
The buoyant mood mirrored that in Asia, where MSCI's Asia-Pacific index outside Japan rose 1% to its highest ever. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.1% to near its 2019 peak. Australian shares hit a record high. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn into office on Wednesday, last week laid out a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal to boost the economy and speed up the distribution of vaccines. 
""They realised that there is some limits to what monetary policy can do to effect change in the real economy,"" said Shaniel Ramjee, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. ""The Fed will continue buying bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury in order to fund the fiscal programs.""
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in almost 50 countries, was last up 0.1%.
On Wall Street, Nasdaq futures gained 0.8%, as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 12% after the close on strong growth in subscribers and projections it will no longer need to raise debt. S&P 500 futures were also up 0.4%.
Biden will take office on Wednesday under unprecedented security measures after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. 
DEFENSIVE DOLLAR 
The dollar slipped for a third straight session after Yellen's comments, losing ground from a one-month high. 
Against a basket of currencies, it was last down 0.1% at 90.285, having climbed 1.2% from a three-year nadir hit two weeks ago. 
Positioning data showed investors are overwhelmingly short on the dollar, betting budget and current account deficits will weigh on the greenback. 
""We remain bearish U.S. dollar, and expect the downtrend to resume as U.S. real yields top out,"" said Ebrahim Rahbari, FX strategist at CitiFX. 
Safe-haven gold climbed 0.6% to $1,850 per ounce.
The euro lost a sliver of ground to trade at $1.2116, and off Monday's month-and-a-half low. It drew support from an investor sentiment survey that beat forecasts and the Italian government's surviving a confidence vote. 
Italy's benchmark borrowing costs dropped to their lowest in over a week on Wednesday after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte narrowly managed to stay in office - albeit now heading a minority government.
Italian 10-year bond yields dropped to their lowest since Jan. 11 - before Conte lost his majority - at 0.533%, down 2 basis points on the day.
Oil prices rose on hopes that Biden's proposed stimulus will lift economic output.
U.S. crude futures added 0.7% to $53.65 a barrel. International benchmark Brent futures rose 0.5% to $56.37 per barrel.

382,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 07:09AM ET</span>",Netflix Soars After Hit Shows Push Subscribers Past 200 Million,"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). ended its biggest year in company history with a bang, adding more customers than expected and saying it no longer needs to borrow money to build its entertainment empire.
The world’s leading paid streaming service attracted 8.51 million new subscribers in the final three months of the year, helped by the popularity of hit shows such as “Bridgerton” and “The Queen’s Gambit.” That outpaced Netflix’s own forecast and the 6.06 million projected by Wall Street, and its shares rose 14% in pre-market trading.
The earnings report included two key milestones for Netflix: The company passed the 200 million-subscriber mark for the first time and said its cash flow will allow it to stop relying on debt to fuel its growth. With $8.2 billion in cash -- and a credit line that hasn’t been drawn down -- Netflix said it no longer needs external financing. It’s also considering stock buybacks, something it hasn’t done in about a decade.
The pandemic has provided a huge boost to Netflix’s business, forcing people inside and limiting other entertainment options like movie theaters and concerts. The company added 25.9 million customers in the first six months of last year, and ended up adding 36.6 million customers in all -- a record.
“It’s accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment,” Spencer Neumann, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a call with investors and analysts Tuesday.
Netflix has repeatedly warned that the surge in the first half of 2020 would limit its growth in subsequent quarters -- what it calls the “pull-forward” effect. Neumann cautioned this would continue to affect growth in 2021, and Netflix gave a conservative estimate for the current quarter. It expects to add 6 million new subscribers in the period, compared with an average analyst estimate of 7.45 million.
But Netflix found more runway than expected in the latest period.
Its growth during the last year dispelled two common critiques of the company. Skeptics of Netflix have long identified its debt as a looming disaster, arguing an economic recession would cripple the company and cause customers to cancel subscriptions en masse.
Burning Cash
While Netflix has consistently reported profits, it had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its spending on new programs. It had negative free cash flow of $3.3 billion in 2019, its worst on record. Since then, it’s turned a corner. Free cash flow will be close to the break-even point in 2021, Netflix said Tuesday. Analysts had projected negative $619.7 million. Against that backdrop, Netflix’s debt spree looks like a worthy investment. It borrowed some $15 billion to boost its market capitalization by more than $200 billion.
Critics have also argued Netflix would suffer when rival media companies pulled their most popular titles from the service and created their own competitors. Yet Netflix posted its best performance yet in the same year that several new competitors entered the fray and Disney+ added 87 million paid subscribers.
“Our strategy is simple: If we can continue to improve Netflix every day to better delight our members, we can be their first choice for streaming entertainment,” the company said in a letter to shareholders. “This past year is a testament to this approach.”
Netflix shares climbed as high as $570.79 in premarket trading. The stock rallied 67% last year, but concerns about slowing growth had weighed on Netflix in 2021. Through Tuesday’s close, it was down 7.2% since the start of the year.
“Investors come out of the fourth quarter incrementally more bullish on the potential of a powerful developing shareholder return story for Netflix in the coming years,” Evercore ISI analyst Lee Horowitz wrote in a note.
Analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said the company is likely to begin share buybacks in the second half of the year.
Global Service
Netflix, based in the Silicon Valley town of Los Gatos, California, is leaning more on international markets now that its home market of North America is largely saturated. The service has relied on Europe and Latin America to supply most of its new customers in the last few years, and is just starting to crack Asia. More than 60% of its customers now live outside the U.S. and Canada, and 83% of its new additions in 2020 came from abroad. Europe supplied 41% of its new customers -- almost 15 million people -- while Asia added 9.3 customers, the second most.
Netflix has thrived by creating pipelines of new programs from all over the world that appeal to viewers outside of the native tongue. In the fourth quarter alone, Netflix released popular series in German, Korean, Japanese and French.
The English-language “Queen’s Gambit” and “Bridgerton” were both major hits for Netflix. “Queen’s Gambit” was viewed by 62 million households in its first 28 days on the service, while “Bridgerton” is on track to reach 63 million accounts.
But a newer show, released this month, underscores Netflix’s global reach. “Lupin,” a French crime series starring Omar Sy, has become the second-biggest debut in the company’s history. It’s on track to be watched by 70 million households in its first 28 days on the service.
This diversity of shows is what will help Netflix continue to grow, both at home and abroad, in the face of growing competition.
“We’re still a very small share of even just pay-TV penetration in most markets around the world and small share of viewing,” Neumann said.

384,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Higher Ahead of Biden Inauguration,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher Wednesday, with investors cautiously awaiting President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will also be in the spotlight after stellar results.
At 7:25 AM ET (1225 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 33 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 100 points, or 0.8%. 
Biden is set to become the 46th President of the United States, around 12 PM ET (1700 GMT), replacing Donald Trump. The ceremony will take place amid heightened security in Washington in the wake of the riots in early January.
Biden is likely to appeal for unity, but investors will also be looking to see if he comments further on his spending plans after his nominee for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, told the Senate Finance Committee late Tuesday that the federal government needed to “act big” to repair the economic damage caused by the pandemic.
It’s ”important to point out that this is only the first package from Joe Biden. He is already working on a second, focused on infrastructure and green energy. This could help maintain economic momentum in the coming years,” said ING analyst James Knightley, in a research note.
Biden could also signal that his administration intends to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, reverse Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization, and look for more cooperation with regard to international trade.
Away from the political fanfare in Washington, the corporate spotlight will be on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) after the world’s largest streaming service reported strong growth in subscriber numbers and a big improvement in cash flow after the close Tuesday. 
The company added it expected free cash flow to break even in 2021, stating it may no longer need to raise external financing and will explore returning excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks. 
The earnings slate continues Wednesday. The last of the big six banks is set to post results before the open, and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is expected to follow its rivals by posting stellar trading results. Consumer goods heavyweight Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) earlier raised its guidance for shareholder payouts in the current fiscal year after another pandemic-assisted quarter for sales. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) are also reporting Wednesday.
Oil prices pushed higher, helped by expectations that Biden's stimulus plans will boost fuel demand.
U.S. crude inventory data due from the American Petroleum Institute will be in focus later Wednesday, a day later than usual due to Monday’s holiday.
U.S. crude futures futures traded 1.2% higher at $53.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $56.36. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,847.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2111.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Canadian exchange operator TMX to start 23-hour derivatives trading to lure Asian investors,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - The owner of Canada's biggest stock exchanges is seeking to attract more Asian derivatives investors, aiming to boost the share of its overall revenues from outside the country to half from one-third currently.
TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange and the Montreal Exchange, plans to extend derivatives trading to 23 hours in the second half of 2021 from 14-1/2 hours now to attract Asia-Pacific institutional investors, Chief Executive John McKenzie told Reuters in an exclusive interview.
""We've been engaged in dialogue with asset managers in those regions; we know there's demand to get access to North American product,"" McKenzie said. ""But we don't make it easy to come to Canada.""
Late last year, TMX added two-year government bond futures and new environmental, social and governance-based equity futures, McKenzie said, and plans to introduce 30-year interest-rate and equity dividend futures this year.
McKenzie said TMX hopes both to expand outside Canada and beyond its traditional equities trading operations, which already accounted for less than a tenth of revenues in fiscal 2019, half the level of a decade earlier.
""The general view is that the equity trading business is a little more mature and very competitive,"" said Colin Stewart, CEO of investment manager JC Clark. ""Derivatives are more of a growth area.""
TMX hopes the derivatives push will help drive its goal of double-digit profit growth. This in turn could lift its stock price. Its shares rose 5.8% over the past year, far less than the 14% gain for Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Ltd, 20% for Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) and 79% for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.
Revenues from TMX's derivatives offerings, which are traded on the Montreal Exchange, were up 21% in the fourth quarter of 2019 from two years earlier before the extension of trading to European hours.
CAPITAL FLOWS
Asia-Pacific pension funds are seeking more global investments for assets under management that, according to a September report from Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), have grown faster than counterparts' in other regions.
""Capital has become much more global,"" said Marius Zoican, assistant professor of finance at the University of Toronto. ""If you don't serve the European and Asian markets, you end up with blind spots... When your market is open, there is information that was already processed on other markets.""
Net flows from Japan into Canadian bonds, for instance, rose over 300% in the first 11 months of 2020 from the same period a year earlier, according to Statistics Canada.
Increasing access to products like interest-rate futures allows investors to take risks in Canadian bonds or hedge existing holdings, McKenzie said.
After TMX expanded into European hours in 2018, derivatives trading from the region contributed between 6% and 10% of volumes in 2020, he said.
International peers with global trading have 15% to 30% of total volumes coming from after-hours sessions. They also get as much as 60% of derivatives trading flow from outside their home markets, versus 40% at TMX, McKenzie said.
""That's the upside potential... that's what success will look like if we do those things well,"" said McKenzie, who became chief executive in August.
TMX is working with Canadian participants to ensure there is market-making through the night, McKenzie said, adding that the cost of extending hours isn't major.
But Canada's market remains small and shallow compared to the U.S. and Europe, so attracting investors may be an uphill battle for TMX, Stewart of JC Clark cautioned.
Even so, recent political turmoil and uncertainties in the United States make Canada more attractive to global investors who view its stability and strong regulation as a plus, Zoican said.
""People in Europe and Asia look at Canada as the U.S's little sister,"" he said.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>","Big U.S. banks hunger for loans, capital relief as deposits pile up","By Imani Moise and David Henry
(Reuters) - A swell of deposits during the coronavirus pandemic has put big U.S. banks on the back foot, with executives saying they hope regulators provide relief on rules that punish bloated balance sheets until loan demand snaps back.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) took in more than $1 trillion in deposits last year, compared with a $92 billion increase in 2019.
In a more normal economy, that kind of boost would be great, allowing banks to lend more or simply invest the money in short-term, low-risk securities, like Treasury bonds.
But the stimulus payments and easy-money policies by the government that led to the inundation of deposits has also created a few problems for the banks: low interest rates that crimp lending profitability and stunted loan demand as customers and companies awash with cash spend less.
Combined with rules that require more capital for bigger balance sheets, that makes deposits more expensive to hold, instead of profitable.
""Excess liquidity is piling up,"" Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said during a conference call on Tuesday after the bank reported record deposit growth.
Profit margins on new deposits are ""practically zero,"" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said last week.
Citigroup's $210 billion deposit increase pushed it into a new bracket under Fed rules, requiring the bank to hold more capital, the bank said last week.
Big banks will not shun deposits due to the dynamic, executives said, because doing so could hurt their franchises. However, they did push regulators to extend capital relief programs that expire March 31. Banks also want adjustments for holdings that are not high risk, like U.S. Treasury securities.
""It is an issue for us in the near to medium term should we not get the extension,"" Piepszak said.

391,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 05:58AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Margin Expansion Cheers Burberry Despite Sales Drop,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- If you’re going to be a luxury brand, then price accordingly.
That’s the lesson  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) and others took from misguided attempts to broaden their appeal a few years back, and the U.K. fashion group with the distinctive checkered pattern took another big step toward correcting that error on Wednesday.
Admittedly, Burberry’s sales down 5% in constant exchange rates and down 9% in comparable store terms, missed its own and analysts’ estimates in the three months through December. But investors were willing to forgive a development that was down to the renewed closure of its stores during the key Christmas season, rather than any new mistakes of its own.
The market pushed Burberry stock up by 4.8% by mid-morning in London, focusing instead on CEO Marco Gobbetti’s summary that “We saw a strong increase in full-price sales as our collections and communication resonated well with new, younger clientele as well as existing customers.”
The younger clientele appears to have been attracted not least by a high-profile Instagram marketing campaign featuring Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford, whose campaign for free meals for underprivileged children unable to get them at school during the pandemic may have soothed a few consciences about the indulgence implied in any Burberry purchase.
Burberry has been focusing since Gobbetti’s arrival on selling a higher proportion of its goods at the full price and a lower share through discounts. That paid off in the quarter, with full-price sales in leather goods and the group’s signature trenchcoats rising by between 13%-15%. The group was especially successful in selling at full prices through its online channel – seen by some analysts as a relative weakness – where sales grew 50%. In China, full-price online sales more than doubled.
Burberry’s relative reliance on its physical stores and tourism spending has made it one of the worst performers in high-end fashion in the last year. Even after Wednesday’s gains, it’s down nearly 20%, while Amundi’s Global Luxury ETF (PA:GLUX) has risen 23% in the same period. Trading at less than four times trailing 12-month sales, it looks a lot cheaper than many other names in the luxury space.
Anyone watching Burberry’s stock on Wednesday from the headquarters of luxury rival Richemont (SIX:CFR) may have had reason to feel aggrieved, though. The Swiss-based group eked out a 3% gain in sales, with its jewellery business posting a particularly impressive 9% rise. It too managed to raise online sales by some 13% overall, mitigating the effect of store closures worldwide. However, its growth now looks alarmingly reliant on Asia, where sales rose 21%. European sales fell by a similar amount, while North American revenue fell by 4%.
For both stocks, as for the sector in general, the end of lockdowns and the resumption of tourism can’t come quickly enough."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group founder Jack Ma made his first public appearance since October on Wednesday when he spoke to a group of teachers by video, easing concern about his unusual absence from the limelight and sending shares in the e-commerce giant surging.
Speculation over Ma's whereabouts has swirled in the wake of news this month that he was replaced in the final episode of a reality TV show he had been a judge on, and amid a regulatory clampdown by Beijing on his sprawling business empire.
The billionaire, who commands a cult-like reverence in China, had not appeared in public since Oct. 24, when he blasted China's regulatory system in a speech at a Shanghai forum. That set him on a collision course with officials and led to the suspension of a blockbuster $37 billion IPO for Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Group.
Until then Ma often appeared in public, speaking at conferences and other events, though less frequently than in 2019 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Alibaba and his charitable foundation both confirmed Ma, a former English teacher, participated in an online ceremony for rural teachers organised by the foundation on Wednesday. They declined to provide further comment. 
In the 50-second video, Ma, wearing a navy pullover, spoke from a room with grey walls, a large painting and floral arrangements. It was not clear where the room was.
Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares jumped to finish 8.5% higher on the news, which was first reported by Tianmu News, a media outlet backed by the government of Zhejiang, the province where Alibaba's headquarters are based.
The video also contained footage, dated Jan. 10, of Ma visiting with colleagues a school in Tonglu county, part of Hangzhou city, the capital of Zhejiang.
""Jack Ma's reappearance has given investors peace of mind after a lot of rumours, allowing them to pile into the stock which had been a laggard in the market,"" said Steven Leung, sales director at brokerage UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
The stock has erased losses suffered after Alibaba became the target of an antitrust investigation launched last month by Chinese authorities, but remains some 11% below levels prior to the cancellation of the Ant IPO. 
The topic ""Jack Ma makes his first public appearance"" and his video address to the teachers soon began trending on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), triggering heavy discussion.
Although Ma has stepped down from corporate positions and earnings calls, he retains significant influence over Alibaba and Ant and promotes them globally at business and political events. He also continues to mentor management talent in the ""Alibaba Partnership"", a 35-member group of company managers.
The company plans to raise at least $5 billion through the sale of a U.S. dollar-denominated bond this month.

ASML stock rose 2.3%, and helped propel the whole sector higher, with the EURO STOXX Technology index climbing to an all-time high. IQE (LON:IQE) stock rose 3.4% and Germany's Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) rose 1.3%.
In the luxury retail sector, Richemont (SIX:CFR) stock climbed 4% to its highest in 18 months, as growth in Asia helped drive 5% sales growth in its fiscal third quarter. 
 Burberry  (LON:BRBY) stock rose 4.7% after an earnings update, while  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock added 4.6% after Mike Ashley-led Frasers (LON:FRAS) said it boosted its stake in the company.
These updates have helped alleviate the mood after Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed late Tuesday to tighten Germany’s coronavirus restrictions to check the spread of the disease. These moves included closing non-essential stores in hard-hit areas until Feb. 14, although stopped short of imposing a national curfew as in France.
There have been some signs that the incidence of coronavirus cases has been lessening in Europe, but the Dutch government warned Tuesday of the likelihood of additional measures on top of the current lockdown in place until at least Feb. 9, while the U.K. and Portugal reported record numbers of deaths.
In political news, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte won a confidence vote in the upper house Senate on Tuesday, ensuring he stays in power after a junior partner quit his coalition last week, albeit without a solid majority in parliament.
In the U.S. overnight, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen defended the need for the $1.9 trillion fiscal relief package, proposed by incoming President Joe Biden, urging lawmakers to “act big” in efforts to boost economic recovery from Covid-19.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 02:45AM ET</span>",Irresistible? Pension funds plot move on China's $16 trillion bond market,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - China's $16 trillion bond market is the proverbial elephant in the investment room. But it's becoming too big to ignore, even for the most risk-averse Western investors.
A large, A+ rated market that pays 3% yields, with minimal volatility? It's looking increasingly alluring for European pension funds swimming in sub-zero bond yields as aging populations stretch their finances.
For some, the benefits are beginning to outweigh the political risks, and they are upping allocations to China, or considering doing so, according to Reuters' interviews with half a dozen firms that advise and manage money for pension funds.
""Not all our clients invest in China's bond market, but they are all looking into it,"" said Sandor Steverink, head of Treasuries at APG, which manages a third of the assets of the 1.5-trillion-euro ($1.8 trillion) Dutch pension industry. 
Dutch 10-year bond yields are languishing at around -0.4%, spelling losses for any investor who holds them to maturity, a picture reflected across Europe. 
Such fund interest is a boon for Beijing, which is seeking to internationalise its financial markets and lure big-ticket overseas investors as its once-mighty trade surpluses dwindle. Europe's pension industry alone is worth $4 trillion.
China's sovereign debt market is the world's second-largest after the United States. Yet while foreigners own a third of the U.S. Treasury market, they hold just 9.7% of China's sovereign debt, according to government data.
Western pension funds make up a tiny cohort of the foreign investors in yuan bond markets, but their presence is growing. 
Of the $9.5 trillion of assets under management from corporate and public pension funds globally, 0.26% was held in Chinese bonds as of the third quarter of 2020, up from 0.04% in 2015, according to data from institutional asset managers shared with financial data provider eVestment.
Beijing's drive to draw foreign money has taken a whack of late as tensions with the United States have resulted in the ejection of several Chinese companies from U.S. equity indexes and curbs on U.S. government pension funds investing in China. There have also been defaults by state-owned firms.
Investors also cite potential pitfalls such as less market transparency and liquidity, with some Japanese investors protesting China's inclusion into FTSE Russell's World Government Bond Index. 
In addition, some say the country still has further to go in opening up its markets and worry that while capital controls, which made repatriation of profits difficult, have been eased, they could also be tightened. 
China's relatively successful handling of the COVID-19 crisis and brighter economic prospects has buoyed confidence, though.
APG runs around 100 million euros in a local Chinese bonds strategy it started just over a year ago. Steverink acknowledged that political risks gave clients ""cold feet"", but predicted that would change as more cash swept into the debt. 
""You have to explain if you invest in China. You don't need to explain if you don't invest. That's how it is for the time being,"" he said. 
""In the decades to come, it will be the other way around.""

2020: WATERSHED YEAR
Pension funds themselves are famously secretive about their investment allocation trends, and more than two dozen contacted by Reuters, mostly European, declined to comment on this.
However, their money managers, and certain central banks that track investment flows, can provide a window.
China has only stepped up efforts to open up bond markets in the past decade, so foreign investment is starting from a low base. While an increase in broader investment interest is not a new phenomenon, pension funds - the biggest and most cautious players - are now beginning to go with the flow. 
The investors interviewed by Reuters said 2020 had been a watershed year, with more developed world bond yields collapsing into negative territory on the back of massive monetary stimulus, combined with China relaxing restrictions on foreign investment.
Insight Investments is looking into setting up a Chinese bond fund on behalf of UK pension funds, Sabrina Jacobs, a fixed-income investment specialist at the $1 trillion asset manager told Reuters.
She declined to give details to protect the anonymity of her clients but said her company, part of the BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Group, had also been asked by other UK and European-based pension funds to explore Chinese debt investment. 
Jacobs said China met many of the criteria pension investors had when investing overseas - besides size and credit ratings, the yuan is less volatile than other emerging currencies. 
Essentially, that means daily swings with the potential to wreck returns are less common; in fact yuan volatility is lower than some G10 currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Jacobs also said Chinese markets moved less in tandem with global peers.
""While you have a very high correlation between, say (German) Bunds and Treasuries, Chinese government bonds are only 15 to 20% correlated to other bond markets, the big ones globally. So, it is an attractive diversifier as well.""
Insight currently holds around $400 million of Chinese debt within its emerging market and global government bond funds.
Some other investors who allocate funds on behalf of European pension fund clients, including Pictet Asset Management and Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), also said they were seeing more interest in Chinese bonds from the pension industry.

'A LOT FURTHER TO GO'
Pictet, with assets of $600 billion, does not break down flows by investor type but said inflows to its Chinese bond fund had risen from $144 million to $770 million in 2020. 
Shaniel Ramjee, part of Pictet's multi-asset team, is confident that Chinese debt has moved past being a niche asset for large institutions like pension funds, but said the trend was in its early stages.
""We haven't seen those dedicated allocations come through in large amounts yet, so there's a lot further to go on this,"" he added. 
Dutch pension funds held 22.4 billion euros in overall investments in China as of the third quarter of 2019, mainly in stocks, with just 300 million euros in bonds, the Netherlands central bank said. That's up from 200 million euros in bonds in 2017. 
Latest available data from Germany's central bank shows that German funds, including pension funds, invested a total of 2.5 billion euros in Chinese bonds in November 2020 alone, a 62% rise from the same month a year earlier. 
Sweden's AP2, a national pension fund and a rare example of one that publishes its allocation to China, has had a stable 1% allocation to Chinese government bonds since 2017. It manages roughly $43 billion of assets. 
'LOOKING HARD AT CHINA'
China, for its part, needs overseas pension money as its shift towards a consumption-driven economy has diminished its trade surpluses. 
Pension money also has a particular cachet, because of size - retirement savings in the top 22 economies currently top $45 trillion - and its ""sticky"", long-term nature.
All this has motivated China to smooth access to its markets, enabling its bonds to join high-profile debt benchmarks compiled by FTSE Russell and Bloomberg/Barclays.
China's interbank bond market regulator did not respond to requests for comment on foreign pension fund holdings in Chinese bonds. 
Data from the Central China Depository & Clearing Co (CCDC), shared with Reuters, shows almost 200 foreign funds had invested in Chinese bonds as of end-September via the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM), 42% above year-ago levels. The CCDC does not compile specific data on pension fund flows.
""Pensions funds say they are now looking hard at China as an alternative,"" said Robin Marshall, FTSE Russell's director of bond market research. ""They would not have looked at it a few years ago.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had given a full pardon to a former Google engineer sentenced for stealing a trade secret on self-driving cars months before he briefly headed Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's rival unit.
Anthony Levandowski, 40, was sentenced in August to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty in March. He was not in custody but a judge had said he could enter custody once the COVID-19 pandemic subsided.
The White House said Levandowski had ""paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good."" 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo, a self-driving auto technology unit spun out of Google, declined to comment. The company previously described Levandowski's crime as ""a betrayal"" and his sentence ""a win for trade secret laws.""
The pardon was backed by several leaders in the technology industry who have supported Trump, including investors Peter Thiel and Blake Masters and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, according to the White House.

Levandowski transferred more than 14,000 Google files, including development schedules and product designs, to his personal laptop before he left, and while negotiating a new role with Uber.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Pricey U.S. stock valuations put burden on earnings to keep rally going,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate results and profit outlooks are becoming increasingly important in sustaining investor optimism in a stock market rally that has driven valuations close to a 20-year high.
With fourth-quarter reports starting to pour in, the benchmark S&P 500 is trading at 22.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv Datastream. That price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) -- a common benchmark for valuing stocks -- is well above the 15.3 long-term average and has been climbing since the market bottomed in March.
Investors’ rationale for the historically high valuations has rested on expectations of a growth bounce as the economy emerges from COVID-19 shutdowns, massive fiscal and monetary support, and equities' relative attractiveness to bonds.
But with the S&P 500 up about 70% from its March lows, the earnings season could present an important test of whether the rally has run ahead of fundamentals, a key worry of investors who believe unparalleled fiscal and monetary spending have fueled excessive risk-taking.
Stock ""return expectations are greatly dependent on the earnings rebound in 2021,” said Chris Haverland, global asset allocation strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise by 24% in 2021 after falling 15% in 2020, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday, with reports that could shed light on prospects for 2021 starting to come in more heavily this week.
So far, results have been stellar: Of the 26 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of last week, 88% beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, a rate tracking to be ""one of the strongest in history,"" BofA Global Research said in a note on Tuesday.
Among those recently reporting was  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which posted a blockbuster fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday. Goldman executives warned, however, that the capital markets activity that fueled results lately will probably slow down.
Haverland draws parallels between the current market and the emergence from the financial crisis a decade ago. Similar to 2020, expanding valuations helped fuel the stock market in 2009, as investors anticipated an economic rebound, Haverland said.
""In 2010, that’s where you saw the earnings growth kind of catch up, ... and we think that’s going to play out similarly in 2021,"" Haverland said.
Investors also hope the earnings season will help them determine to what degree equity valuations are justified. The equity risk premium, which compares the earnings yield on stocks to the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, currently favors equities, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. The S&P 500 has beaten the one-year return for the 10-year Treasury note by an average of 10.3% when the level of the risk premium was where it stood at the end of 2020, he said.
“Absolute valuations, by any historical measure, are extremely high,"" said Lerner. ""However, so is everything else, and you still have to look for relative investment opportunity.”
Many are also keeping a close eye on the size and timing of fiscal support under President-elect Joe Biden, which is expected to be a key factor in determining investor risk appetite in coming months.
In her Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen urged lawmakers to “act big” on the next coronavirus relief package after Biden last week outlined a $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal as part of a domestic policy agenda heavy on government spending.
Supportive fiscal and monetary policy ""puts a floor under the market"" that signals policymakers ""will do whatever it takes to get both the market and the economy from this point to the other side of this,"" said Liz Young, director of market strategy at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Investment Management.

403,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: Stimulus plans fuel Biden trade, but Wall Street wonders if it can continue","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Joe Biden takes over the presidency, investors are trying to determine how much fuel is left in trades betting on his policies, which have sparked outsized rallies in everything from cyclical stocks to shares of solar-powered companies.
Overall, the broad S&P 500 has rallied nearly 13% since the Nov. 3 presidential election, with gains concentrated in sectors expected to benefit the most from policy shifts expected under a Biden administration.
While stimulus, green policies and infrastructure have pushed the broad market to record highs, some investors are growing concerned that the rally may have run too far ahead.
Democrats’ slender majority in Congress mean the final shape and timing of many Biden policies - including a proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package - remain uncertain. Meanwhile, valuations on the S&P 500 are approaching levels last seen in the Dotcom era, while hiccups in the U.S. vaccine rollout have dented optimism over a broad economic reopening.
""If you ask me to predict if the next 5 to 10 percent move is more likely up than down, I would say it's more likely down,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management. “The market has so relentlessly gone up and valuations are frothy.""
As a result, Ramos is becoming more bullish on cyclical and value stocks that would benefit from a sharp rebound in the economy at the expense of large technology stocks that powered much of the S&P 500's rally in 2020.
""You do have elevated valuations, no question about it, but value is comparatively cheap and we don't think a 6 percent GDP growth rate this year is fully priced in,"" he said.
Overall, value stocks in the S&P 500 trade at 17.1 times forward earnings, while growth stocks in the S&P 500 trade at 29.2 times forward earnings, according to data from Refinitiv.
STIMULUS SURGE
Biden outlined a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan last week, arguing that bold investment was needed to jump-start the economy and accelerate the distribution of vaccines to bring the coronavirus under control. Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee for Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers in her confirmation hearing on Tuesday to ""act big"" on the next coronavirus relief package.
Analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) raised their 2021 U.S. growth forecast for the second time this month, to 6.6% from 6.4%, in the wake of Biden's stimulus proposal. [L1N2JR0I2]
Yet analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research cautioned in a report on Monday that stocks are already trading as if the vaccine roll-out and economic rebound will be smooth over the spring and summer, limiting further upside. The bank kept its year-end target for the S&P 500 at 3,800, flat with current levels.
Investors should instead focus on sectors such as electric vehicles and cyber-security that will see a long-term benefit from Biden's policy moves, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
""One of the core underpinnings of the Biden platform will be around pushing clean energy,"" he said. That will likely continue to lift shares of companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co higher.
Charles Lemonides, portfolio manager of hedge fund ValueWorks LLC, said the broad rally in the stock market in anticipation of stimulus spending will narrow as investors hone in on the companies that are taking market share from rivals.
He has been rotating some of his portfolio into cyclical value stocks such as  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) and Tidewater (NYSE:TDW) Inc, while expecting that the so-called FANG stocks, such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), will flat line after their strong outperformance over the last 12 months.
""There will be a huge difference between winners and losers from the changes in Washington and the trends in place over last year will not be the same trends going forward,"" he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening mixed Wednesday, given the competing influences of tighter German restrictions to fight the coronavirus and hopes of increased U.S. fiscal stimulus ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
Late Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders agreed to tighten Germany’s coronavirus restrictions to check the spread of the disease. These moves included closing non-essential stores in hard-hit areas until Feb. 14, although stopped short of imposing a national curfew as in France.
There have been some signs that the incidence of coronavirus cases has been lessening in Europe, but the Dutch government warned Tuesday of the likelihood of additional measures on top of the current lockdown in place until at least Feb. 9, while the U.K. and Portugal reported record numbers of deaths.
In political news, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte won a confidence vote in the upper house Senate on Tuesday, ensuring he stays in power after a junior partner quit his coalition last week.
In the U.S. overnight, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen defended the need for the $1.9 trillion fiscal relief package, proposed by Biden, urging lawmakers to “act big” in efforts to boost economic recovery from Covid-19.
Republican resistance has been building towards the plan, mainly over concerns about a higher debt burden, but Yellen’s comments helped to lift sentiment as she laid out the benefits of a big stimulus package.
Biden will take office later Wednesday under unprecedented security measures after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.
There are a number of earnings and trading releases to digest Wednesday. ASML, the Dutch maker of chipmaking equipment, set the bar high by raising its dividend and launching a 6 billion euro buyback, in addition to posting a solid rise in profit and revenue in the fourth quarter.
 Richemont  (SIX:CFR),  Burberry  (LON:BRBY), WH Smith (LON:SMWH), J D  Wetherspoon  (LON:JDW) and  Pearson  (LON:PSON) are also all due to report, while December consumer inflation data for the euro zone are also due.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday, helped by expectations that Biden's stimulus plans will boost fuel demand.
U.S. crude inventory data due from the American Petroleum Institute will be in focus later Wednesday, a day later than usual due to Monday’s holiday.
U.S. crude futures futures traded 0.8% higher at $53.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $56.30.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 11:30PM ET</span>",Analysis: China's would-be chip darling Tsinghua Unigroup bedevilled by debt and bad bets,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese conglomerate that has long sought to become a semiconductor powerhouse, is now caught between a rock and a hard place as debt woes mount while key chip units are failing to thrive, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Best known for an unsuccessful $23 billion bid for U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) in 2015, Unigroup in November shocked investors with a default on a 1.3 billion yuan ($200 million) bond. Including that bond, Unigroup has now either defaulted or had cross-defaults triggered on seven onshore and offshore bonds worth about $3.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The state-backed conglomerate, which has warned it may not be able to make upcoming bond payments, had some $31 billion in debt as of late June, more than half of which was due to mature in a year's time, filings show. In contrast, it had roughly $8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
The crisis has raised questions about Unigroup's long-term stability and how much backing the conglomerate, which is 51% owned by Tsinghua University, will continue to be given by Beijing. The central government, keen to develop a weak domestic chip industry, has invested billions of dollars in Unigroup projects as well as in other chipmakers such as SMIC.
Unigroup's efforts to raise more capital have, however, been stymied by the university's attempts to offload its stake, in line with a change in government policy in 2018 which called for higher education institutes to divest their business holdings.
Many banks have been reluctant to lend money because Unigroup may soon be without its parent company but at the same time, it can't easily find a new strategic investor due to its heavy debt load, said a source with knowledge of the matter.
""And lots of the company's subsidiaries are still not mature enough to go to capital markets, and not mature enough to generate positive cash flow,"" the source said.
Some attempts to sell the university's stake to local authorities, such as the Shenzhen government, have fallen through, according to public filings. Sources familiar with the matter said Unigroup is continuing talks with other local governments about potential investment.
Sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. Unigroup did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
In 2015, Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo declared he would spend $47 billion in five years to turn the company, then a little-known maker of chemicals and scanners, into China's next chip giant, primarily through acquisitions.
But three sources - all current or former senior officials within Unigroup - told Reuters its chip units have not generated hoped-for revenue and its investment strategy was haphazard, with too much money going into unrelated, often unprofitable businesses ranging from real estate to online gambling and an Indian phone maker.
""A majority of the company's investments are pretty poor, and that's how they got themselves into this kind of trouble,"" said a former Unigroup executive involved in investment.
Unlisted Unigroup does not break down its revenue and profit figures in detail. According to bond analysis firm YY Ratings, chips accounted for at most 20% of Unigroup's 332 billion yuan in revenue for the first half of 2019, with 69% coming from servers and IT equipment.
CHIP STRUGGLES
Its unit Unisoc, a maker of logic chips for mobile phones, is emblematic of the company's problems. Formerly called Spreadtrum, it was acquired for $1.8 billion in 2013 and its promise then was such that it attracted a $1.5 billion investment from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) a year later.
But Unisoc struggled after losing Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Ltd as a client when the Korean giant reorganised its parts procurement, according to a former Unisoc executive.
As the high-end smartphone sector consolidated, Unisoc was left with mostly inexpensive, third-tier brands as customers.
""If you don't have a top tier customer like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) or Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), it puts a lot of pressure on the financial side,"" said the former executive.
Unisoc then scrambled to diversify into the Internet of Things, automotive chips and even bitcoin mining.
Another major investment that has yet to prosper is YMTC, which Unigroup founded in 2016 with state-backed funding, marking China's entry into the cut-throat market for NAND chips. 
YMTC has since begun mass production of 64-layer NAND flash chips and recently announced it has developed 128-layer NAND flash, which technologically would bring it close to Samsung and SK Hynix. 
But in an industry dominated by rivals with decades-long relationships with customers, its market share remains tiny, one of the sources said. 
Gu Wenjun, an analyst at research firm ICWise, says that despite its technological strides, YMTC is not competitive due to weak economies of scale and must improve its yields. He estimates that getting to a 20% market share would require an additional $100 billion in investment.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, following a modest rise in U.S. shares during the previous session over hopes for more, and bigger, U.S. stimulus measures to combat the impact of COVID-19.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.29% by 10:16 PM ET (3:16 AM GMT), and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.55%. The People’s Bank of China announced January's loan prime rate, with no changes expected in both the one-year and five-year loan prime rates.
Investors also weighed comments from members of President-Elect Joe Biden’s administration suggesting a continued tough line towards China. They vowed to fight “abusive” trade practices and bar products from Xinjiang, the province housing the ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, on Tuesday.
Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen said during her Senate confirmation hearing that the U.S. is “prepared to use the full array of tools” to address actions such as “dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving illegal subsidies to corporations.”
Meanwhile, Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken added he agreed with the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump in designating China’s crackdown on Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang a genocide. He also told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should bar imports of Xinjiang-produced goods and prohibit exports to companies participating in human rights violations in the region.

South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.10% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.56%.
Investors are also betting that Biden and his team will use its Congressional majority to drive economic recovery and growth. However, Republican resistance is already building towards the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan proposed by Biden during the previous week.
However, Yellen, who could be confirmed as soon as Thursday, also stoked hopes for more U.S. stimulus measures. She also said during her hearing that aid for the unemployed and small businesses would provide the “biggest bang for the buck” and urged lawmakers to “act big” in efforts to boost economic recovery from COVID-19.
The comments helped to lift investor sentiment.
“Yellen is a positive,” Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) International strategist Mohit Kumar told Bloomberg.
“We should have greater co-operation between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, with both the monetary and fiscal policy working together and supportive. This is a good backdrop for risk sentiment,” Kumar added.
Trump is now in the final day of his term, ahead of Biden and his administration taking office later in the day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co must recall 3 million vehicles with potentially defective driver-side Takata air bags, the U.S. auto safety regulator said on Tuesday, rejecting a bid by the second-largest U.S. automaker to avoid a recall.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was denying petitions filed by Ford and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp in 2017 seeking to avoid recalling vehicles with potentially dangerous inflators. The decision also will require Mazda to recall and repair driver air bags in approximately 5,800 vehicles. The recalls will cover various vehicles from the 2006 through 2012 model years.
The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying - especially after long-term exposure to high humidity - prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled.
The NHTSA said the ""evidence makes clear that these inflators pose a significant safety risk.""
Earlier this month, the auto safety agency said at least 17 million vehicles with Takata air bags remain unrepaired.
Takata inflators have resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people worldwide and 18 in the United States, and over 400 reported injuries,
Ford said on Tuesday that the vehicles the NHTSA was ordering be recalled were subject to an earlier Takata recall for the passenger-side airbag, but did not comment further.
Mazda did not immediately comment. 
The recall will apply to various Ford Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles, along with Mazda 2007–2009 model year B-Series vehicles. The Mazda vehicles were designed by Ford, built on the same platform, and used the same air bag inflators as the Ranger trucks.
The regulator said Ford must within 30 days ""submit to NHTSA a proposed schedule for the notification of vehicle owners and the launch of a remedy.""
Two people died in Takata air bag ruptures in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger vehicles with the most recent death in 2017.
In November, the NHTSA said it was rejecting a petition filed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to avoid the recall of 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. 

In November the agency said GM must recall the 2007-2014 model-year trucks and SUVs. GM estimated in securities filings that it would cost $1.2 billion if it were required to replace air bag inflators it had sought to avoid fixing and said it would recall 7 million vehicles worldwide.

The settlements with so-called ""end-user"" consumers and with more than 30 commercial purchasers were disclosed in filings on Tuesday in federal court in Chicago.
Eight days ago, Tyson agreed to settle related antitrust claims by purchasers who bought chickens directly from the Springdale, Arkansas-based company.
Tyson has also faced price-fixing claims by large restaurant and supermarket operators such as Chick-fil-A, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
Terms of the settlements were not disclosed, and court approvals are required. Tyson had no immediate comment.
Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp, owned mainly by Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), agreed on Jan. 11 to pay $75 million to settle claims by direct purchasers of chickens.
Restaurants, supermarkets, food distributors and consumers accused chicken producers of having conspired since 2008 to inflate chicken prices, through tactics such as restricting production and sharing nonpublic data about supply and demand.
Perdue Farms Inc and  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc are among the other defendants in the litigation, which began in 2016. A few smaller producers have settled related claims.
The U.S. Department of Justice last year filed criminal price-fixing and bid-rigging charges in Denver against 10 poultry industry executives. All have pleaded not guilty.

The pandemic dealt a major blow to the company's theme parks and movie studio business, while people sheltered at home during the lockdown pumped up sign-ups on its Disney+ streaming service.
Iger received a total compensation of $21 million for fiscal year 2020, significantly lower than the $47.5 million he had received in the prior year, Disney disclosed in a regulatory filing.
The compensation package of Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek, who took on the role last February, totaled to $14.2 million.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday as U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen advocated for a hefty fiscal relief package before lawmakers to help the world's largest economy ride out a pandemic-driven slump.
At her confirmation hearing, Yellen said the benefits of a big package outweigh the costs of a higher debt burden.
President-elect Joe Biden, who will be sworn into office on Wednesday, outlined a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal last week to jump-start the economy and accelerate the distribution of vaccines.
""Today it's really all about Janet Yellen, and the push that she is taking for stimulus,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, adding that the focus on stimulus ""sets an underpinning for the markets to continue to move higher.""

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' wholly-owned regional subsidiary PSA Airlines plans to resume new pilot hiring this year, a positive sign for an industry that was ravaged last year by the coronavirus pandemic but is now preparing to ramp up flying.
As COVID-19 vaccines continue to roll out, airlines are hoping for a significant improvement in domestic air travel by the summer, even if demand does not fully yet recoup pre-pandemic levels.
""As we continue to work with American Airlines to identify our flying needs this year, and in combination with recent attrition numbers for our Pilot group, we will be initiating hiring efforts for First Officer team members,"" Keith Stamper, vice president of PSA's air operations, said in a memo reviewed by Reuters.
A PSA spokeswoman confirmed the plans, which also include new flight attendant hiring, but said: ""We are declining disclosing specific hiring numbers at this time.""
For years, airlines including PSA were aggressively recruiting to address projected pilot shortages during an era of industry growth, but hiring and training programs were halted last year as the pandemic forced thousands of furloughs.
Dayton, Ohio-based PSA, which operates domestic routes for American, furloughed 723 pilots and 323 flight attendants last October when an initial COVID-19 relief plan for U.S. airlines expired. Employees were recalled last month following a fresh $15 billion in government aid for the struggling industry.
Major airlines like American rely on regional carriers, which have a cheaper workforce, to operate a large share of their domestic networks.
Over time, regional pilots work their way up to the majors, which are preparing for a wave of retirements in coming years even after many pilots took early departure deals during the pandemic.
American, for example, expects over 11,149 pilots to reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 between 2021 and 2041, with 455 expected to retire this year alone, according to internal company projections updated on Jan. 18.

Markets were optimistic that the outlook is positive, driving shares of tech and energy stocks higher. Oh, and, of course, yet more stimulus talk. 
Case in point: Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in her confirmation hearing as Treasury Secretary called on lawmakers in Congress to “act big” and support further stimulus to boost the economic recovery.

We have one more bank to go tomorrow as well hold our collective breaths that inauguration day will pass without violence and death.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. U.S. President 46
Out with the old, in with the older. Joe Biden starts his term as the 46th U.S. President, and markets may welcome the relative calm after the Trump years. Still, expect a flurry of executive actions in the first few days, not to mention the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief plan he's already laid out.
2. Morgan Stanley

421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",Goldman hints at cost cuts to hit targets as trading gains look ready to slow,"By Anirban Sen and Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) posted a blockbuster fourth-quarter profit that dwarfed Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, but executives warned that capital markets activity fueling results lately will probably slow down and that the bank's consumer business will take longer to get in the black.
Analysts pressed Chief Executive David Solomon and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr about whether Goldman can hit profit targets they established if trading revenue declines meaningfully and if growth in Goldman's retail business, Marcus, is much slower than expected.
They maintained firm-wide targets for efficiency and return-on-equity, suggesting that Goldman may lean on cost cuts instead of revenue growth to reach them. 
""We've got levers to pull on expense,"" Scherr said.
Management also backed away from an earlier goal to turn Marcus profitable in 2021.
Goldman hit the brakes on expanding consumer loans due to the coronavirus pandemic, while also investing more heavily in Marcus's infrastructure. The business is on track to reach a deposit-growth goal, but it will take at least another year to turn a profit, Solomon said.
Goldman shares fell 1.6% to $296.27 in afternoon trading.
Solomon made Marcus a cornerstone of his broader strategy to make Goldman look more like a full-service lender catering to individuals and global corporations alike. But his strategy has faced questions from the start – about whether Goldman was out of its depth with consumer lending, whether it could compete against the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) or  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) when providing services to companies or whether it could deliver aggressive growth targets without a major acquisition.
Just last week, Goldman agreed to take over General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s credit-card portfolio. The bank is considering further deals to bulk up Marcus, Reuters reported.
Nonetheless, Marcus represents a tiny portion of Goldman's overall revenue – just 2.7% last year, as its Wall Street businesses flourished – underscoring how hard it will be for the bank to build a consumer franchise that becomes a household name like Chase or Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) without a substantial acquisition.
UBS analyst Brennan Hawken asked management why they would invest Goldman's own capital in technology and other infrastructure if there was an easy way to grow through M&A.
""The bar to do something significant is extremely high, and it's not an easy thing to do,"" said Solomon.
Management re-affirmed targets to reduce costs to 60% of revenue and produce a 13% return-on-equity by 2022. Last year, Goldman's costs were 65% of revenue and its ROE, which measures how much profit the bank can squeeze from shareholder funds, 11.1%.
Goldman still intends to grow consumer deposits to over $125 billion by 2024, up from $97 billion in 2020.
BUMPER YEAR
Analysts mostly celebrated Goldman's fourth-quarter results, which were driven by huge trading gains as well as a surge in underwriting fees.
The bank's net income attributable to common shareholders more than doubled, to $4.4 billion, or $12.08 per share, from $1.7 billion, or $4.69 per share, in the year-earlier period.
Analysts had expected a profit of $7.47 per share on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""It was an exceptionally strong quarter,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski.
Revenue at all four of Goldman's businesses rose in the final quarter, but trading added the most to its bottom line, jumping 23% to $4.3 billion on robust volumes and asset values.
Goldman's trading operation registered its best annual performance in a decade as investors churned portfolios during a rollercoaster year. Dips and turns in coronavirus infection rates and policy responses, combined with social-injustice protests and a historic U.S. election created lots of volatility.
Trading accounted for 47% of Goldman's revenue in 2020, up from 40% the prior year.
Investment banking revenue jumped 27% to $2.6 billion during the fourth quarter, driven mainly by equity underwriting, which was up 195% from the same period in 2019. 
Total revenue climbed 18% to $11.7 billion.

The results helped Goldman absorb a $3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators over its role in Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal. The bank also set aside $3.1 billion to cover bad loans, compared to $1.1 billion last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 02:55PM ET</span>",Supreme Court justices lean toward FCC bid to loosen media ownership rules,"By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices signaled sympathy on Tuesday toward a bid by President Donald Trump's administration, backed by broadcast companies, to loosen regulations that critics have said promote a diversity of views in local broadcast media and ownership by racial minorities and women. 
During arguments by teleconference in the case, conservative justices asked questions that appeared to indicate they believe the Federal Communications Commission did not overstep its authority in repealing certain media ownership regulations in 2017. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.
The justices were considering appeals by the FCC, companies including News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), Fox Corp and Sinclair Broadcast (NASDAQ:SBGI) Group Inc and the National Association of Broadcasters of a lower court ruling that blocked the rule changes for failing to consider the effects on ownership diversity. 
The broadcast industry wants a freer hand to consolidate operations, and the FCC's move helped that goal. But critics of the FCC's action have said loosening ownership rules as the agency did could jeopardize a wider array of news and information sources at the local level. 
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has thwarted the FCC's efforts to revise the rules since 2003 in a series of decisions.
Chief Justice John Roberts and other conservative justices focused during the arguments on the FCC's obligation to extensively analyze potential impacts on women and minorities. 
Roberts wondered whether the FCC should have to justify changing its focus from one priority to another that it thinks is more important, such as cross-ownership between broadcast and print media as opposed to ownership by minorities and women.
""Reasonable people can disagree on that,"" Roberts said. 
Fellow conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch said that a 1996 law directing the FCC to periodically review ownership rules had a ""deregulatory impulse and yet that impulse idea has never been exercised.""
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the FCC has ""for decades"" considered minority and women ownership when making its rules and that legal precedent requires an adequate explanation if that approach is rejected. 
At issue in the case is a 2019 ruling by the 3rd Circuit, which ordered the FCC to reconsider the issue. 
In 2017, the Republican-led FCC voted to eliminate a ban in place since 1975 on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, for local stations to jointly sell advertising time and for companies to buy additional radio stations in some markets. 
The new rules were challenged by a number of community advocacy groups led by Prometheus Radio Project.

(Reuters) - Self-driving car maker Cruise and majority shareholder General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Tuesday they would partner with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to accelerate the commercialization of driverless vehicles.
Microsoft will join GM, Honda Motor Co and institutional investors in a combined new equity investment of more than $2 billion in Cruise, bringing the post-money valuation of the San Francisco-based startup to $30 billion.
GM shares continued their recent climb, trading at $54.09, up 8.2% just after U.S. markets opened.
The new investment pushes Cruise to the forefront of companies developing self-driving vehicles and technology.
Waymo, the self-driving company majority owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is valued at just over $30 billion, according to investor website PitchBook.
Argo AI, the Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup backed by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), is valued at $7.25 billion.
Cruise will use Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, for its self-driving vehicles. 
Other automakers, including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, have used Azure for operations and services other than self-driving.

GM will work with Microsoft to accelerate the automaker's digitization initiatives, including artificial intelligence, and explore opportunities to streamline operations across digital supply chains and bring new mobility services, including robotaxis and last-mile deliveries, to customers faster.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Average U.S. airfare prices in the three months ending in September fell to the lowest inflation-adjusted price since the government began tracking the issue in 1995, the Transportation Department said Tuesday.
The average ticket price was $245, down 30% over the same period in 2019 and down 7% over the second quarter, when average prices were $262 a ticket. 
Prices have declined as air demand has fallen sharply, especially for business travel. U.S. airlines reported 27 million passengers in the third quarter, down from 86 million passengers a year earlier.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major airlines, says tickets sold by travel agents for corporate travel remain down 88% as of this month. Business travelers often book close to departure and pay more for tickets than do vacationers.
The airline group said the decline in business travel has ""pummeled airline revenues,"" which were down 74% in the third quarter. To fill some empty seats, airlines have slashed prices for many leisure fares.
Airlines have also waived fees to change tickets on most tickets since the pandemic began but are still collecting fees for baggage, seat assignments and other amenities.

The Transportation Department report said U.S. passenger airlines collected 65.1% of total operating revenue of $38.6 billion from passenger fares during the first nine months of 2020, down from 88.5% in 1990.

“A large number” of the bank’s ultra-rich clients cut or exited their holdings in China’s largest e-commerce firm after reports of the probe emerged, Citi Private Bank’s Lab for Family Offices said in a report released Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co on Tuesday predicted a recovery in the global oil and gas industry from the second quarter after the oilfield services provider beat profit estimates on cost cuts and modest gains in activity following last year's slump.
Crude oil prices are holding to gains from a rebound in late-2020 from a coronavirus-induced slump, with Brent crude hovering around $55 per barrel on Tuesday after averaging around $45 in the last three months of 2020. 
This has encouraged producers to complete more wells and add rigs. North America rig count was 410 at year-end, compared with 341 in the third quarter.
""We view 2021 as a bit of a transition year, and 2022 is when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said on a post-earnings call, adding that he expected more consolidation in the industry.
Miller said he is optimistic that the upturn in activity in North America would continue, while international markets would bottom out during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds.
However, he expects pressure to improve shareholder returns will hold output flat this year to 2020 exit levels. 
Halliburton, which kicked off fourth-quarter earnings for service providers, said revenue from North America jumped 25.8% from the third quarter, while international revenue rose 0.4%.
Completion and production business revenue was 15% higher in the fourth quarter, compared with the preceding three months. 
The company expects revenue from the business to rise 3% to 5% in the current quarter from the fourth, though operating margins are expected to fall 150 to 200 basis points. 
Drilling and evaluation revenue rose 1.9% sequentially and is expected to increase in the low single digit in the first quarter from the fourth.
Total revenue of $3.24 billion beat analysts' estimates of $3.21 billion, while adjusted net income was 3 cents above estimates at 18 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Halliburton, like its customers, has cut its capital spending and reduced its workforce, as energy demand and prices tumbled last year.
The cost cuts helped the company generate free cash flow of $1.15 billion in 2020, above the $1 billion it had targeted.
Still, profit slumped 43.9% and revenue tumbled 37.6% from the fourth quarter of 2019 as activity levels were still well below year-ago levels.
Rivals Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes are scheduled to report results later in the week.

Investing.com -- Betting on gambling is losing its luster. 
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is down more than 4% after Berenberg initiated coverage with a sell. The shares were also called a best idea short by Hedgeye.
The online gambling company had rallied since going public last year as U.S. states have begun to legalize the activity amid a need for tax revenue and closures of businesses because of efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. 
According to Hedgeye, DraftKings has ""a big valuation"" that ""may not withstand"" the expected decelerating growth post vaccination along with ""the impact of market share pressure on sentiment,"" The Fly reported. 
Berenberg gave the gambling group a price target of $41. That compares to Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR)'s price target of $100, a Street-high that was set last week, according to Investing.com.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",Bank of America eyes loan growth after first decline in six years,"By Imani Moise, David Henry and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) executives said on Tuesday they were optimistic the bank could return to loan growth this year, after the coronavirus pandemic caused its loan book to shrink on an annual basis for the first time since 2014. 
Total loans and leases at the second-largest U.S. bank slid 6% in 2020. Appetite for new loans waned during the pandemic as customers spent less and saved more and large companies relied on capital markets for funds rather than their bank. 
But bank executives said on calls they are starting to see signs of a rebound if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to abate.
""We're grinding out of this health crisis,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a conference call with reporters. ""We should be able to grow NII because we are adding deposits and we are adding loans."" 
Net interest income (NII) at the bank, a key measure of how much it can make from lending, tumbled 16% in the fourth quarter.   
Lower rates meant to prop-up the economy during the pandemic have limited how much banks can charge for their lending services at the same time fiscal stimulus programs and flagging consumer confidence have softened loan demand. As a result Bank of America,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  each posted double-digit overall revenue declines this month.
NII grew slightly from a low point in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue to increase in 2021 with the biggest gains in the last half of the year, Donofrio said.
Megabank peers Wells Fargo and Citigroup said last week NII could decline by 4% due to the rock-bottom interest rates Fed officials have signaled will stay in place throughout the year while JPMorgan predicted modest growth in 2021.
Bolstering the bank's upbeat view are signs of improving financial health among its customers.
Consumer and small business transaction volume across the second-largest U.S. bank managed to grow 2% in 2020 despite plunging 21% to a record low as the coronavirus gripped the U.S. economy in the spring. 
Debit card spending jumped 12% during the quarter as customers who had been spending less amid lockdowns, reopened their wallets over the holidays, the bank said. 
Underscoring its confidence in the economy, the bank joined peers JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) in releasing $828 million from its reserves to cover bad loans after adding more than $8 billion through the first three quarters of the year. 
Roughly 75% of the reserve release is tied to the bank's consumer portfolio as customers entered the new year in better-than-expected financial health due to fiscal stimulus. The commercial reserve release was mostly driven by a pullback from industries heavily impacted by the pandemic.
Revenue from its sales and trading business rose 7%, but underperformed peers as its fixed-income trading desk missed estimates. 
Net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.21 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $6.75 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 55 cents per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv, helped by lower credit costs. Shares gained 1.2%.

Separately, the second-largest U.S. bank said its board approved a $3.2-billion share repurchase program in the first quarter.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Merck & Co Inc's bid to revive a $2.54 billion jury verdict it won against rival drugmaker  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) for infringing a patent in a dispute over a blockbuster hepatitis C treatment.
The justices declined to take up Merck's appeal of a lower court's ruling that overturned the massive damages verdict after finding that Merck's patent was invalid.
The case concerns a new generation of highly effective drugs for hepatitis C, a viral infection that can cause serious liver damage, able to cure more than 90% of patients, with few side effects. 
New Jersey-based Merck's Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2013 accused California-based Gilead of infringing its patent on a family of compounds with the same basic chemical structure that is effective against the hepatitis C virus. 
After a federal court trial in 2016, a jury sided with Idenix, awarding $2.54 billion for Gilead's infringement with its drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, invalidated the patent in 2019 after determining that its claims on the family of compounds were overly broad, in violation of U.S. patent law.
In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Merck said that the Federal Circuit's ruling undermined biotechnology breakthroughs in which discoveries often begin with a family of compounds that share a particular property. 

A group of intellectual property scholars backed Merck in a written brief, telling the justices that the Federal Circuit ruling made it ""unreasonably difficult for a pharmaceutical company that comes up with an innovative new class of drugs to protect that class against imitation. That result threatens innovation.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli's request to be freed from prison, rejecting his claim that his deteriorating mental health justified compassionate release.
U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said Shkreli, who claimed his mental health has ""taken a steep toll,"" failed to offer ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" to be released.
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, declined to comment on the Jan. 16 decision.
Shkreli, 37, who has asthma, has served about half of his seven-year sentence for securities fraud and conspiracy at a low-security prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania.
He claimed that tighter confinement conditions to combat COVID-19, including limited contact with others and a diet heavy on peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, has weakened his immune system and increased his risk of contracting the disease.
Shkreli also said he has been unable to effectively defend against a civil lawsuit where the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and seven states said he tried to block generic versions of the lifesaving drug Daraprim.
But the judge said mental health disorders are not a risk factor for COVID-19, and a mental health expert found Shkreli ""stable.""
Matsumoto also said that ""although litigating from prison may be more difficult, it is far from impossible.""
Shkreli is eligible for release in September 2023.
Nicknamed ""Pharma Bro,"" Shkreli was convicted in 2017 for cheating investors in two hedge funds and trying to prop up the stock price of a biotechnology company he ran.
He was widely vilified for boosting the price of Daraprim, which treats a potentially fatal infection known as toxoplasmosis, by more than 4,000% overnight to $750 from $17.50 when he ran another company, Turing Pharmaceuticals.

Turing was later renamed Vyera Pharmaceuticals. Vyera, now part of Phoenixus AG, is also a defendant in the FTC case.

Investing.com -- Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON)'s high ride was cut short as the stock got downgraded with a post-Covid world in sight.
UBS bumped the bike maker to sell from neutral -- the company's only sell rating, according to data compiled by Investing.com -- with a price target of $124 from $115, StreetInsider reported. Shares tumbled about 7%. The stock rose by more than 500% from its trading debut in 2019 to a record last month.
Peloton gained steam after the spread of the coronavirus forced gyms to close and people to seek out alternatives to keep fit while stuck at home. Sales were so successful, in fact, that the company has struggled to supply the demand, prompting some customers to look elsewhere, and Peloton to buy a U.S. manufacturer of gym equipment to try to keep up.
""While we still think Peloton has a long term opportunity to disrupt traditional fitness business models, we downgrade it to Sell to risk/reward skewed to the downside from current levels,"" UBS's Eric Sheridan wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""Additionally, we update our model to reflect the Precor acquisition (expected in close in early calendar year 2021) and lower our out-year revenue estimates (FY'23-'25) to reflect more normalized growth rates after COVID-19."" 
Most analysts are loving Peloton, which has 20 buy ratings, two holds and Sheridan's lone sell. 
Sales have grown from $228 million in the quarter ended Sept. 2019 to almost $758 million a year later, with a loss per share of $1.29 flipping to a gain of 20 cents a share.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) International will grow in a post-coronavirus world, Chief Executive Bracken Darrell said on Tuesday, as the rise in home working and playing during the pandemic pushed the computer peripherals maker to its best-ever quarterly results.
Booming sales of web cams, covers and keyboards for tablet computers used by schoolchildren and video conferencing devices for online meetings were behind an 85% surge in the Swiss-U.S. company's sales during the last three months of 2020.
""No doubt the trend of people working from home helped us grow our business,"" Darrell told Reuters.
""When the pandemic ends, and starts to fade… you are going to see people working from home and in the office,"" he added. ""That is an opportunity for us to upgrade spaces in both places, and also to video enable offices.""
The strong third-quarter performance led Logitech to raise its guidance for the third time in its 2021 business year, which runs to the end of March.
The maker of keyboards, mice and headsets expects annual sales to rise by 57% to 60%. It will give a sales outlook for 2022 at its upcoming investor day, which usually takes place in early March. 
""I would be surprised if we grew 57% to 60% next year,"" said Darrell, who has been Logitech CEO since 2013. ""But I will be really clear... long term we have really strong growth potential. 
""There are so many video rooms to enable, so many people upgrading their workspaces... gaming is not going to slow down... and we are in the streamers and creators business.""
Darrell said there are 1.7 million podcasters who need cameras, microphones, mice and keyboards, while chefs, make-up artists, and singers are also creating and streaming content.
He said he expects most companies to move to a hybrid model of working in the future, with staff working from home some days and in the office on others.
This increases the potential market size, with people also choosing keyboards and other products for their home office to match their home decor, as well as ergonomics and performance, he added.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Global hedge funds posted average returns last year of 11.6%, the best year for the industry since 2009, as they took advantage of market volatility due to the pandemic, according to data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research (HFR).
Hedge fund assets rose to $3.6 trillion at the end of 2020 after adding another $290 billion in the final three months of the year, according to the data.
Firms managing more than $5 billion added $4.8 billion of investor cash between them in the fourth quarter while firms managing less than $5 billion were hit with net outflows.
Stock-picking hedge funds made gains of 17.4% last year while strategies that focused on mergers and acquisitions landed returns of 8.8% and those that bet on macroeconomic events made 5.3%, the data showed.
""Institutions globally are making forward-looking allocations to hedge funds, anticipating and positioning for the near-term uncertainty of the virus containment, as well as intermediate-term macroeconomic uncertainties of the U.S., European and Asian economies into 2021,"" Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR, said in the release.
While hedge funds enjoyed strong performance during 2020, an index tracking the S&P 500 would have gained 18.4% over the same time period, HFR said.

FedEx acquired European operator TNT Express, which specializes in shipments between businesses, in 2016 as part of its plan to expand in Europe. 
The duplication from two European networks connecting similar geographies will result in job cuts across operational teams and back-office functions, the company said.
Weak shipment sales in Europe over the past few years have led to sluggish growth in the TNT unit and weighed on FedEx's results.
The plan is expected to result in savings of between $275 million and $350 million on an annual basis beginning in fiscal 2024, FedEx said, adding that it expects to incur severance charges of between $300 million and $575 million through fiscal 2023.

MILAN (Reuters) - Global shares climbed and the dollar eased on Tuesday before Janet Yellen's Treasury Secretary confirmation speech, in which she is expected to bolster the case for heavy fiscal stimulus in the world's largest economy.
Concern that pandemic lockdowns could slow the road to economic recovery faded as markets prepared for possible positive surprises from the earnings season.
Asian shares posted strong gains and in Europe upbeat earnings reports, including from computer peripherals maker Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), helped the STOXX 600 index edge up by 0.1%, offsetting a possible extension of lockdowns in Germany.
Wall Street looked set for a strong start, with S&P 500 futures rising 0.7% and Nasdaq futures up 0.8% after the long holiday weekend. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.4% by 1231 GMT. 
""Yellen ... will attempt to sell U.S. President-elect (Joe) Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan (arguing that low interest rates allow a big fiscal stimulus),"" Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. 
""If the growth rate generated by government investment in infrastructure or people exceeds the cost of borrowing, it is a worthwhile exercise.""
Yellen will tell the Senate Finance Committee that the government must ""act big"" with its next coronavirus relief package, according to her prepared statement seen by Reuters.
Asian shares had climbed on investor expectation that China's economic strength would help to underpin growth in the region. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5% to a record high.
Data on Monday confirmed that the world's second-largest economy was one of the few to grow over 2020 and actually gathered pace as the year drew to a close.
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) felt the coming earnings season could brighten the mood, given the consensus in Europe was for a 25% fall year on year, setting a very low bar.
""The projected EPS (earnings per share) growth in Europe now stands at the lows of the crisis, which seems too conservative and could likely lead to positive surprises over the reporting season,"" they wrote.
The same could be true for the United States. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares rose in pre-market trade after results while investors were awaiting for results from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) later on Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are slated later this week. 
Despite the risk-on mood on Tuesday, some dealers were wary before President-elect Biden's inauguration on Wednesday, fearing more mob violence. 
Wall Street is also bracing for tougher regulations now that the Democrats control the Senate, with Biden set to nominate two consumer champions to top financial agencies.
In foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar slipped from close to its highest in nearly a month as caution set in before Yellen's speech, where she is expected to reaffirm commitment to a market-determined exchange rate. 
The dollar index fell 0.3% to 90.48 but remained comfortably above its recent trough of 89.206.
The euro rose 0.5% to $1.212 after touching a six-week low of $1.2052 in the previous session. The dollar weakened by 0.3% against the safe-haven yen at 103.9. 
In fixed-income markets, Italian 10-year bond yields fell to 0.584% before a confidence vote in the Senate that could force Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to resign. 
But expectations that snap elections are unlikely, coupled with European Central Bank stimulus to fight the adverse impact of the coronavirus crisis, limited any sell-off. 
Gold rose 0.1% to $1,838.3 an ounce, recovering from a six-week low of $1,809.90 briefly hit on Monday. [GOL/] 

Optimism that government stimulus will buoy global economic growth and oil demand lifted crude oil prices. Brent crude futures rose 1.1% to $55.36 a barrel and U.S. crude was up 0.3% at $52.5. [O/R]

Instead of fearing bear territory, Goldman strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a note that the market is in the early stages of a bull phase following an “explosive” valuations-led rebound in equities that tends to start in recession and marks the start of a new cycle.
“The market is rising on good news but choosing to largely ignore weaker data and rising infection rates,” the strategists wrote on Tuesday. “There is a risk of a correction, but without a bear market inflection.’
Global equities have surged more than 70% since a coronavirus-induced selloff in March last year, reaching a record earlier this month on bets of a vaccine-fueled economic bounce and expanding U.S. stimulus. The sharp rebound is “almost identical” to the recovery from the trough of the financial crisis in 2009, which was followed by a correction, Goldman notes.
The MSCI All-Country World Index rallied strongly from a March 2009 low, before entering a correction in May the following year. Still, circumstances are different this time around, Goldman said.
While the global financial crisis generated a “structural bear market,” the coronavirus-led recession and selloff were driven by events, according to the firm.
“The unprecedented speed and scale of policy support during the pandemic, designed to reduce the risk of longer-term scarring, has also reduced the risks of structural scarring and tail risks for investors, allowing them to ‘look through’ the downturn into a recovery,” the strategists wrote.

The ID.4 Crozz is built on VW’s MEB electric vehicle manufacturing platform, which is also used in some models of Audi and Skoda. The car is cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s recently launched Model Y crossover, which starts at 339,900 yuan and isn’t eligible for subsidies.
The vehicle can run as far as 400 kilometers (249 miles) on a single charge. VW is also selling a version with a range of 550 kilometers, starting at 219,900 yuan.
China is a critical market for Germany’s VW; its sprawling Chinese operations account for about 40% of global vehicle deliveries and a large chunk of profits. In May, it struck deals with two Chinese companies, broadening its strategic footprint as the coronavirus sparks the worst economic contraction in decades.

A model similar to the ID.4 Crozz, built by Volkswagen and another local partner SAIC Motor Corp., will be unveiled soon.

The EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is one of the last major regulators to approve changes to the MAX and its anti-stall software, blamed for two deadly crashes that grounded the jet in March 2019.
The European agency, which published a draft airworthiness directive in November, has made largely presentational adjustments after public consultations, Executive Director Patrick Ky said in an online media briefing.
""We expect to publish it next week, which means the MAX will be cleared to fly again,"" Ky said. A separate certification of the MAX-200 variant will likely follow in ""coming weeks"", he added, allowing flights to resume before summer.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Brazilian authorities both cleared the MAX for flight in November. Canada is expected to follow suit on Wednesday.
Following the crashes, EASA insisted on carrying out a broader and deeper review than it typically conducts on Boeing jets under the FAA's primary authority.
Emirates President Tim Clark last week credited the European regulator's ""very hard line"" for helping to restore public trust in the MAX.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, bouncing back from last week’s losses ahead of President-elect Joe Biden inauguration and the upcoming earnings season.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 189 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 28 points, or 0.8%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 127 points, or 1%. 
This move higher in the U.S. equity futures comes after Wall Street suffered its worst week since October, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.9%.
Incoming President Joe Biden is due to be inaugurated on Wednesday amid heightened security after the riot in Washington in early January. Ahead of this, his nominated Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will appear before the Senate Finance Committee later Tuesday as part of her confirmation process. 
Yellen is set to argue forcefully in favor of Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan, with her prepared remarks calling for the federal government to “act big.” 
The need for additional stimulus has been clear for some time, with the U.S. on the verge of 400,000 deaths through the Covid-19 virus. That said, there have been doubts that the full package will get through Congress given opposition from Republican lawmakers.
Away from Washington, Tuesday kicks off a busy week of corporate earnings, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) due to report before the open. This follows on from disappointingly received numbers from the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) last week.  BofA's report mirrored the earlier ones, with the release of earlier loan loss provisions bolstering the bottom line while the underlying business weakened. Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also due to release its fourth-quarter figures after the close. 
The economic data slate is pretty empty Tuesday, and the major focus will be on the first PMI data of 2021 from the U.S., euro zone, U.K. and Japan on Friday, which could be weaker than anticipated given the fresh restrictions and surging virus numbers.
Oil prices pushed higher, helped by signs of growth in China, the world’s largest crude importer, and optimism over U.S. stimulus measures.
These gains occurred despite the International Energy Agency lowering its forecasts for global oil demand in 2021 as a whole by 300,000 barrels a day, on the back of renewed lockdowns to contain the pandemic.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $52.60 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.4% to $55.51. There was no settlement for the U.S. contract on Monday as American markets were closed for a public holiday.

454,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Windfall for Shipping Companies Starts to Pressure Retailers,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Tech may have been the biggest beneficiary of lockdowns in the U.S., but in Europe some of the biggest windfalls have been in a much more old-world sector: shipping.
The trend seems likely to continue at least for some months, as tight capacity underpins container freight rates at historically high levels: as this week’s Chinese export data showed, demand for manufactured goods has proved highly elastic as consumers have redirected their spending away from services to everything from fitness bikes and home appliances to leisure wear.
Supply, however, is far less elastic, and the situation isn’t improved by the structural asymmetry in the container market created by China’s massive trade surplus.
Shares in AP Moeller-Maersk (OTC:AMKBY), the world’s biggest container shipper, have risen 34% since mid-November, when the Danish-based company raised its profit guidance for the year and started what was, in 2020, the rarest of things: a $1.6 billion share buyback.
Its big German rival, Hapag Lloyd  (DE:HLAG), has risen an even more impressive 86% in that time and has more than doubled since October, when the renewed onset of Covid-19 in Europe and North America condemned the two biggest consumer markets in the world to another winter of being shut up at home.
The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the cost of shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to Europe has risen from around $2,000 in November to over $9,000 today, with costs for importers being further inflated by congestion at ports that is leading to longer waiting times.
The squeeze is starting to find its way through into retailers’ profit warnings. U.K.-based fashion chain Superdry’s stock fell 15% on Tuesday after the company – which warned its may go out of business as recently as October – published another gloomy trading update ravaged by closed stores.
In among the broader tale of woe, Superdry (LON:SDRY) warned that “as a consequence of the impact of Covid-19 on global trade, the Group and the company are aware of constraints to the global supply of containers for shipping goods for resale from Asia to Europe, and while the Group remains confident that the majority of goods will be shipped, it is expected that the cost of these shipments will increase and that there may be some movement in the shipping dates from Q3 and Q4 FY21 to Q4 FY21 and Q1 FY22.”
The squeeze is particularly likely to hit the likes of Superdry, which needs to move seasonal inventory relatively quickly and which is too financially stretched to get into bidding wars for scarce capacity.
Although the squeeze may loosen a bit over the Chinese New Year, it seems probable that it only goes away for good when lockdowns end, and when consumers can get back to spending their money at the restaurant, the ball game and the movies. Right now, though, governments are in the process of shutting out that possibility: France and Austria tightened restrictions at the weekend and Germany is set to follow later Tuesday, at a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors.
For the shippers, all winds are fair right now."

(Reuters) - European stocks inched higher on Tuesday, as possible extension of German lockdowns drew investors into defensive sectors such as healthcare and telecoms.
After gaining almost half a percent at the open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose just 0.1% by 0938 GMT, while Germany's DAX and London's blue-chip index rose 0.2% each.
Gains at the open were fuelled by Asian stocks closing in on all-time highs as investors wagered China's economic strength would help underpin growth in the region after data confirmed the world's second-largest economy was one of the few to grow over 2020. [MKTS/GLOB] 
However, the prospect of longer lockdowns in Europe kept investors on edge, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel set to agree with regional leaders to extend a lockdown for most shops and schools until mid-February, sources told Reuters.
Defensive sectors that tend to remain immune to economic cycles such as healthcare, telecom and utilities gained the most, while retail stocks took the biggest hit. 
""With the extension of lockdowns, Q1 GDP growth will be negative, in Germany and euro area as well,"" said Matthias Bausch, senior cross asset strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""However, the current situation is not the important driver for equity markets. If investors realise that lockdowns might be extended into Q2 or Q3, there is a much bigger risk."" 
Tech stocks gained 0.4%, led by Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), which jumped 2.5% as it raised its 2021 sales growth and profit outlook for the third time, benefiting from a pandemic-driven boost in demand for work-from-home products and gaming accessories.
UK-listed shares of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) was flat despite reporting a 2.4% rise in fourth-quarter iron ore shipments, helped by industrial activity in top consumer China. 
Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli fell 2.2% after it said organic sales fell 6.1% in 2020, with only a lukewarm improvement in the second half as COVID-19 restrictions and the absence of travel weighed.
Analysts are forecasting a 26.3% decline in fourth-quarter profit for companies listed on the STOXX 600, as per Refinitiv IBES. 

Investors were also monitoring the political situation in Italy ahead of a confidence vote in the upper house Senate that could force prime minister Giuseppe Conte to resign.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s purchase of Acacia Communications (NASDAQ:ACIA) Inc has been approved by China's antitrust regulator on condition that the companies ensure fair competition, the watchdog said on Tuesday.
The State Administration for Market Regulation's (SAMR) green light brings the $4.5 billion dollar deal to a close after approval from other countries including the United States.
Network gear maker Cisco first announced its intention to acquire optical components manufacturer Acacia in 2019, looking to capture more business from telecoms companies.
China's approval was the only remaining closing condition for the deal, Cisco said in July last year..
SAMR on Tuesday said the Acacia acquisition can proceed provided the companies continue to service existing contracts in China and continue to supply customers in China ""in accordance with the principles of fairness, reasonableness and non-discrimination"".
One of China's top market regulators, SAMR has authority akin to the European Commission to approve acquisitions involving multinational corporations. 
In the past, China has gone against decisions by other regulators overseas.
In 2018 Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's planned $44 billion takeover of Dutch chipmaker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) collapsed after the regulator stalled on issuing public approval.
That deal's dissolution came months after Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) withdrew its bid to purchase Qualcomm after a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration stated that the deal would give China an upper hand in technology development.
Last year, however, China approved two smaller acquisitions in the increasingly politicised microchip industry - Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies' $10 billion purchase of U.S.-based Cypress Semiconductor and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s $6.9 billion deal for Israel's Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) Inc.
Semiconductor machinery maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)' planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric remains subject to SAMR approval, as does Nvidia's pending $40 billion purhase of British chip designer Arm..
Accelerating a crackdown on anticompetitive behaviour in China's booming internet space, SAMR recently launched an antitrust probe into e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Qatar fund put pandemic bets on distressed debt, high-grade bonds - sources","By Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Investment Authority is generating strong returns on a multi-billion dollar bet it made on distressed debt and highly rated bonds at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, two sources familiar with its move said. 
QIA, a sovereign wealth fund with assets of $300 billion, owns department store owner Harrods and stakes in  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and prime properties such as Canary Wharf in London, bet that investment grade bonds would rebound from lows hit in March, investing in both sovereigns and corporates, they said. 
It was not alone in such a shift, as sovereign wealth funds invested a net $4.5 billion across U.S. fixed income in the third quarter of 2020, the most since at least the end of 2017, latest data from eVestment shows.
The S&P 500 Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index has gained about 20% since hitting a low of 417.88 in mid-March. 
And in a departure from its previous portfolio purchases, QIA also put significant sums into so-called distressed credit, including funds that help struggling companies.
This too has paid off for the fund, with S&P U.S. High Yield Corporate Distressed Bond Index up by more than 80% since hitting a record low of 119.44 in late March.
The financial sources, who were familiar with the details of the deals, declined to be named because they are not public. 
QIA confirmed its moves into both investment-grade bonds and distressed debt in an email, but did not provide details. 
""QIA saw the opportunity to help struggling companies become more sustainable, while generating strong risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders,"" a QIA spokesperson said. 
The sources said this reflected a maturing of the QIA's strategy under Mansoor al-Mahmoud, a former head of risk management at the fund who became chief executive in 2018.
It also owned a stake in U.S. jeweller  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF), which it sold as part of LVMH's $15.8 billion acquisition, making a gain of around $892 million, according to analyst estimates and data from filings.
CREDIT SHIFT
Other Gulf funds also bulked up on riskier assets during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Saudi Arabia's $400 billion Public Investment Fund investing more than $7 billion in U.S. and global stocks in the first quarter.
It raised its overall exposure above $10 billion by the second, before shedding $3 billion in the third quarter of 2020.
As part of its shift into credit, QIA has also teamed up with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on a joint platform to provide financing to upper middle market and larger companies in the United States and Europe. 
""We deployed capital in investment grade, high yield, distressed and structured credit markets using a combination of our in house expertise and external fund managers, including the previously announced Credit Suisse lending platform,"" the QIA spokesperson said in the email to Reuters.
QIA's investment via the deal was estimated at $1 billion by Global SWF, a data provider that tracks sovereign wealth funds.

QIA does not publicly disclose its annual returns, however Global SWF estimates that across all sovereign wealth funds, returns dropped to 2.2% in 2020, from 18.3% growth in 2019.

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%. 
The earnings season is getting fully underway in Europe. Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) stock soared 6% after the Swiss-U.S. computer peripherals maker raised its 2021 outlook for sales growth and profit for the third time, benefitting from the Covid-inspired work-from-home trend.
Additionally, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock rose 0.6% after the mining giant reported a 2.4% rise in fourth-quarter iron ore shipments, helped by industrial activity in top consumer China.
On the flip side, Superdry (LON:SDRY) stock slumped 8.5%, dragging the fashion sector lower, after the retailer’s losses deepened due to fresh restrictions in the U.K. imposed during the key Christmas season.
Later in the session, U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen will testify before the Senate Finance Committee later Tuesday as part of her confirmation hearing, and is set to defend the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan unveiled by President-elect Joe Biden during the past week.
Some fear that the relief plan, designed to boost growth in the world’s largest economy, will have to be watered down to get through opposition from Republican lawmakers in the Senate. 
Back in Europe, the Covid-19 virus continues to cause havoc. France's average daily new infections hit a six-and-a-half week high on Monday, Portugal's daily death toll reached a record high, while in Germany Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for an extension and tightening of lockdown measures that are due to expire on Jan. 31. German federal and state government officials are due to meet later to decide on fresh measures. 
The release of the latest survey of economic sentiment from Germany’s ZEW will attract attention later Tuesday, but the 3.3% drop in passenger car registrations in December in the European Union provided an indication of the impact of the new mobility restrictions hitting the region.
Oil prices pushed higher, helped by signs of growth in China, the world’s largest crude importer, and optimism over U.S. stimulus measures with fears for fuel demand as Covid-19-induced lockdowns continue globally.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and affiliates rebounded on Tuesday, reversing losses stemming from Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee's receiving a two-and-a-half year prison term on Monday.
Analysts said the short-lived impact of Lee's detention on share prices is similar to what happened the first time Lee was imprisoned in 2017, despite what may be more reactivity to news and rumours because of increased retail investor participation in the stock market. 
But corporate governance experts fear Lee's pledge to make compliance a top priority may lose steam, especially because it is no longer a part of his case for leniency.
Lee entered a detention centre on Monday after the Seoul High Court sentenced him to prison for bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye and other charges. Because he has already served one year in prison, he will serve 18 more months. 
In his final statement to the court in December, Lee pledged a ""new Samsung"", including guaranteeing labour union activities and not handing over management rights to his children at the family-controlled conglomerate. 
Moreover, he promised ""stricter compliance and transparent operation"" of the so-called Business Support Task Force, a team in Samsung Electronics, some of whose executives a Seoul court found guilty of destroying evidence about an affiliate's accounting practices, said to be aimed at helping boost Lee's control of the tech giant.
""I will transform my mind and stance and create a thorough compliance system that can resist undue pressure,"" Lee said. 
'CHALLENGING THE OWNER FAMILY'
An independent compliance committee, set up last year after the Seoul High Court began proceedings, said it would continue meeting with CEOs and making recommendations despite being dismissed by the court on Monday as ineffective. 
""Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the committee is determined to continue its responsibilities faithfully,"" a committee official told Reuters, adding that the members have a two-year term, which can be extended. 
But corporate governance experts expressed scepticism, noting that such efforts are likely to peter out. 
""The committee is an organisation hastily formed for the trial. There were and still are extensive compliance organisations within each affiliate, but the problem was that none of them could check the actions of the conglomerate's owner family,"" said Park Sang-in, professor at Seoul National University and a corporate governance expert. 
Samsung shares may show more volatility in the short term in particular with the recent influx of retail investors riding a liquidity boom, including those hoping for more generous dividend payouts by Samsung intended to ""create a good corporate image"" in Lee's defence, said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.
After falling on Monday and early Tuesday, shares in Samsung Electronics and affiliates Samsung C&T and Samsung Life Insurance reversed losses and rose 2.5%, 0.7% and 0.5% respectively as of 0621 GMT, compared with a 2.6% rise in the wider market. 
""On the day (Lee) went to jail in 2017, stocks fell, but in the long run, it did not affect the price much. The vice chairman's imprisonment does not change the company's fundamentals,"" Park of Cape Investment added.
In 2017-2018, during Lee's year-long detention, Samsung Electronics shares rose 27% on the back of strong memory chip demand. 

Retail investors were net buyers worth 177 million won of Samsung Electronics stocks in 2020, buying from foreign investors and South Korean institutions, according to Korea Exchange data.

466,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 09:21PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Up, Yellen Likely to Take “Reassuring Stance” at Senate Confirmation","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen due to deliver comments on U.S. stimulus measures and the dollar later in the day.
Investors continue digesting positive economic data from China and there are hopes that it could underpin growth in the region amid the threat of COVID-19 lockdowns lengthening the road to economic recovery in other regions.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 1.22% by 9:13 PM ET (2:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.04%. In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 1.24%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.74%. A 12-member government advisory panel on Monday unanimously recommended the approval of COMIRNATY, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), for emergency use in the city.
The recommendation, which took three hours to reach, will go before Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan for a final decision. The city’s vaccine rollout program is targeted to start in mid-February, after the Lunar New Year holiday.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.09%. Monday’s National Bureau of Statistics data showed that industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December. It also showed that GDP rose 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter but grew 2.6% quarter-on-quarter.
Yellen will testify before the Senate Finance Committee later in the day as part of her Senate confirmation hearing. The hearing is likely to touch on topics ranging from foreign-exchange policy to taxes and serve as the first congressional forum where lawmakers will vet the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan unveiled by President-elect Joe Biden during the past week.
In her testimony, Yellen is reportedly expected to affirm the U.S.' commitment to market-determined exchange rates and indicate that the country doesn’t seek a weaker dollar for competitive advantage.
“The extensive advance discussion of Treasury nominee Yellen’s views on the dollar suggests that she does not want her nomination hearings to be market moving,” Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc head of North American macro strategy Steven Englander said in a note, which added that “reassuring is likely seen as the preferred stance.”
Global shares are losing steam after starting 2021 on a strong note, with investors looking to the upcoming earnings season. Biden’s proposal is also widely expected to face Congressional opposition from Republicans and could cause some taxes to rise.
Biden and his administration will be sworn into office on Wednesday, with investors also monitoring incumbent President Donald Trump’s last full day in office.
On the central bank front, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will hand down their policy decisions on Thursday."

Yellen’s Senate confirmation hearing is likely to feature foreign-exchange policy, and will also serve as the first congressional forum where lawmakers will vet Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan, parts of which have already drawn opposition. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported Yellen is expected to affirm the U.S.’s commitment to market-determined exchange rates.
Bullion has fallen more than 3% this year as benchmark Treasury yields and the greenback climbed on forecasts that coronavirus vaccines and stimulus packages will aid the economic recovery. In early Asian trade on Tuesday, a gauge of the currency was steady after climbing over the past two weeks.
Spot gold was little changed at $1,839.06 an ounce at 8:43 a.m. in Singapore, after rising 0.7% on Monday. Silver fell, palladium was flat, and platinum gained. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%.
Traders are also monitoring President Donald Trump’s last full day in office, when he may issue a slew of pardons. Biden’s swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday will come amid an unprecendented level of security given the still-simmering threats of violence in Washington.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 06:55PM ET</span>",Bankers call for 'hybrid' shares to plug COVID corporate capital gap,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European companies hit by COVID-19 could issue ""hybrid"" shares to plug a predicted capital gap of up to 600 billion euros ($723.48 billion) when government relief measures expire as vaccination programmes are rolled out, a report said on Tuesday.
The report compiled by consultants PwC and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), which represents banks and other market participants, said economic recovery is under threat unless the capital gap is bridged.
It proposes a new European-Union-wide hybrid security like preferred shares, a form of stock that has features of ordinary shares and bonds, typically offering a priority in dividend payments but with no voting rights.
""This is where hybrid and equity markets can play a key role in supporting Europe's recovery,"" AFME CEO Adam Farkas said in a statement.
Despite relief from governments and the private sector since the start of the pandemic, 10% of European companies have cash reserves to only last six months, the report said.
The EU has already passed a package of ""quick fix"" measures to make it more attractive for companies to rebuild their finances by issuing shares on the stock market rather than the more common route of taking on debt such as bank loans.
But many mid-sized and SME corporates do not want to give up control of their business by issuing ordinary shares, the report said, and are willing to pay a premium not to dilute their voting rights.
""Hybrid instruments are ideally suited to address these needs,"" it said.
Policymakers could also explore further use of dual class shares to address the control concerns of companies, as well as debt for equity swaps to reduce leverage, the report said.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 06:26PM ET</span>",Outlook darkens for Wall Street as Biden's regulators take shape,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street may be facing an uncomfortable four years after President-elect Joe Biden's team confirmed on Monday it planned to nominate two consumer champions to lead top financial agencies, signaling a tougher stance on the industry than many had anticipated.
Gary Gensler will serve as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Federal Trade Commission member Rohit Chopra will head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Progressives see the agencies as critical to advancing policy priorities on climate change and social justice. 
Wall Street-friendly Republicans on Monday criticized Biden for bowing to leftists, warning the picks would be divisive. 
""The Biden team is pandering to members of the far-left,"" Patrick McHenry, lead Republican on the House of Representatives finance panel said of Chopra, while warning Gensler should ""resist pressure to commandeer our securities disclosure regime to try to fix non-economic issues or social problems.""
The chair of the derivatives regulator from 2009 to 2014, Gensler implemented new swaps trading rules created by Congress after the financial crisis, developing a reputation as a tough operator willing to stand up to powerful Wall Street interests. 
Chopra helped set up the CFPB after the crisis and served as its first student loan ombudsman. At the FTC, he campaigned for tougher rules for big tech companies on consumer privacy and competition, and for stricter enforcement penalties.
DEMOCRATS IN CONTROL
With Republicans appearing to have a good chance to maintain control of the Senate following the Nov. 3 election, financial executives had hoped Biden would pursue more moderate picks. But Democratic victories in two Georgia run-off elections earlier this month mean Democrats will have effective control of the chamber once Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are sworn in on Wednesday. 
Those wins also mean anti-Wall Street firebrand Sherrod Brown will lead the powerful Senate Banking Committee. He has said he plans to try to repeal Wall Street-friendly rules introduced by President Donald Trump's regulators.
On Monday, Brown hailed Chopra as a ""bold"" choice who would ensure the CFPB ""plays a leading role in combating racial inequities in our financial system,"" while Gensler would ""hold bad actors accountable"" and put ""working families first.""
Gensler is expected to pursue new corporate disclosures on climate change related-risks, political spending, and the composition and treatment of company workforces, and to complete post-crisis executive compensation curbs, among other rules.
Chopra is expected to review payday lending and debt-collection rules, which influential consumer groups say won't protect Americans. They also hope he will stamp out exorbitant lending rates and abusive debt-collection practices, address the student debt burden and gaps in minorities' access to credit. 
""The CFPB has an incredibly important job to do, including stopping financial rip-offs,"" said Lisa Donner, executive director at Americans for Financial Reform, a think tank. ""It also has an urgent role to play in helping families survive and recover from the pandemic-induced economic crisis.""
Biden, though, will first have to fire Kathy Kraninger, the current CFPB director, a power he will have thanks to a ruling last year by the Supreme Court which said the CFPB director served at the president's will.
But Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, rejected the idea that Biden should automatically use that power. 

""CBA does not believe it is in the best interest of consumers to have a new Director with each change in Administration. This whip-saw effect will stifle innovation and prevent consistent regulations,"" Hunt said in an usually forceful statement.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>",Venezuela orders arrest of new Citgo board member named by opposition,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant for a new member of the board of directors of U.S.-based refining firm Citgo Petroleum Corp named by the opposition this month, chief prosecutor Tarek Saab said on Monday.
Saab said Jose Ramón Pocaterra was ""illegally designated"" to the board of Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, and announced charges against him for alleged crimes including conspiracy, usurpation of public functions, and obstruction of justice.
The opposition took control of Citgo in 2019 after the United States, along with dozens of other countries, recognized Juan Guaidó - the speaker of the opposition-held National Assembly - as Venezuela's rightful leader. They argued that President Nicolas Maduro had rigged his 2018 re-election. 
Maduro remains in power, and his government controls PDVSA's operations within Venezuela. His allies frequently accuse Guaidó of trying to ""steal"" Citgo, which is headquartered in Houston.
""These are just excuses to continue the theft they have been undertaking,"" Saab said during a state television appearance. 
Neither Pocaterra, a financial specialist, nor Citgo immediately replied to requests for comment. Pocaterra is living in Madrid, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
The opposition has sought to protect Citgo from creditors and others attempting to seize control of the company to collect on unpaid debts and arbitral awards from Venezuela. 
Saab criticized the decision in U.S. courts allowing Guaidó allies to represent Venezuela in those cases, arguing the government was denied the right to adequate defense. 
Saab also announced charges against Andres Yrigoyen, who he said had been named chair of Citgo's board. Citgo has not announced that designation, and Yrigoyen told Reuters he had not accepted the role.

Citgo announced last September that board chair Luisa Palacios would step down, the first in a string of high-level departures.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>","Oil companies, aid groups plan to press Biden to allow Venezuela fuel swaps","By Luc Cohen
(Reuters) - Representatives of fuel suppliers to Venezuela, importers of Venezuelan oil and advocacy groups said this month they plan to press the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to reverse a ban on crude-for-diesel swaps.
The Trump administration since the last quarter of 2020 has barred companies from sending Venezuela diesel in exchange for crude. Those deals were exempted for more than a year from sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse. 
That has prompted concerns about the humanitarian impact of a possible deficit of diesel, widely used in Venezuelan public transportation, agriculture, and as fuel for generators used as a backstop for frequent blackouts. Farmers are already warning that shortages are impeding sugar harvesting and rice planting. 
A more acute scarcity of diesel would add to widespread gasoline shortages in Venezuela, as domestic refineries are working at a fraction of their installed capacity. Washington has not authorized PDVSA's customers to supply the crisis-stricken OPEC nation with gasoline for over a year.
""Public transit uses a lot of diesel,"" said Feliciano Reyna, president of Caracas-based aid group Accion Solidaria focusing on HIV/AIDS treatment and other medical relief activities. 
""We hope that the incoming Biden administration can take a more strategic look at the purpose of the sanctions, and can lift those that don't change the position of the group in power and instead create problems for the population,"" Reyna said.
A spokesperson for Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, declined to comment. Biden has labeled Maduro a dictator, and advisers said he was likely to maintain some sanctions while seeking more consensus among U.S. allies about how to apply them. 
Companies that frequently engaged in the swaps with U.S. government authorization include India's Reliance Industries Ltd, Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) SA, and Italy's Eni SpA. The permits allowed the firms to refine Venezuelan crude in exchange for diesel even amid sanctions.
A person close to Reliance said the company had sent Biden allies briefing materials on the potential humanitarian fallout of the ban on diesel swaps in the hopes the new administration would reinstate the exemption. 
""Our objective is, do it on Day 1,"" said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The person added that the Trump administration in November turned down a request from the company to participate in a swap offered by PDVSA that would have let the firm import Venezuelan crude in exchange for diesel. 
Reliance did not respond to a request for comment. 
A Repsol spokesman said the company ""is in constant dialogue with the authorities in Venezuela and the U.S. to ensure that the company remains compliant,"" and said the company would ""continue its engagement with the incoming Biden administration."" An Eni spokesman said it was ""premature"" to comment on the issue.
CONTINUED CUBA EXPORTS
Internal PDVSA documents seen by Reuters show Venezuela has not received imports of diesel since November, and consultancy Gas Energy Latin America warns the country's diesel inventories could run out by March or April. Venezuela is now heavily dependent on Iran for fuel imports, especially gasoline.
A person close to PDVSA's Paraguana refining complex said its two main plants are together producing around 30,000 barrels of diesel per day; Gas Energy estimates consumption ranged from 42,000 to 59,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2020. 
PDVSA's 1.3 million bpd refining network is operating at minimal capacity after years of underinvestment and mismanagement, while PDVSA has continued to export some diesel to Venezuela's political ally Cuba under a long-term supply agreement. 
PDVSA's diesel shipments to Cuba averaged around 4,000 bpd in the final three months of the year, a small fraction of the total 75,000 bpd it sent the island during that time period, internal PDVSA documents show.
Elliott Abrams, the U.S. State Department's Special Representative for Venezuela, has pointed to those shipments as a sign ""the regime feels its supplies are sufficient."" 
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's information or oil ministries responded to requests for comment. 
Neither the State Department nor the Treasury Department, which enforces sanctions, responded to requests for comment. 
The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a rights group, sent Biden's transition team a policy memo recommending his administration re-establish the crude-for-diesel swaps. 

""Even if Maduro stops sending anything to Cuba, it is a question of months before the country runs out of diesel,"" said Geoff Ramsey, WOLA's Venezuela director. ""The people that are going to be most affected by that are the population.""

472,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Couche-Tard CEO would love second shot at Carrefour deal,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Alimentation Couche-Tard would revive its $20 billion bid for France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) if the Canadian convenience store operator saw a change in the French government's stance on the proposed deal, its chief executive said on Monday.
Couche-Tard dropped its surprise bid for the European retailer over the weekend after the plan ran into opposition from the French government. Some French politicians said the issue was a matter of national food safety.
""We'd love to do the transaction .... if we got signals that the environment could change or would change from the French government or other key stakeholders,"" Brian Hannasch told an analyst call.
News of the approach from Couche-Tard, which operates convenience outlets and fuel stations, broke only last week but unravelled swiftly in the face of opposition from French politicians including finance minister Bruno Le Maire.
With a deal effectively blocked, the companies said they had decided instead to examine opportunities for sharing practices on fuel purchases, partnering on private labels and distribution in overlapping networks.
""This is a better approach. We lose neither control nor food safety and opening partnerships that can be fruitful for Carrefour as well as for its Canadian peer,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio.
Despite its opposition to the takeover of Carrefour by Couche-Tard, France remained open to foreign investments and remained ""the most attractive country in Europe for foreign investments,"" he added.
Shares in Carrefour closed down 8.9% in Paris to 15.46 euros on Monday as the prospect of the 20 euro per share offer evaporated, for now at least. Couche-Tard shares rose 3.4%.
""In terms of politics, I think we went into this with eyes wide open knowing that this was a risk, and I certainly do believe that the pandemic has heightened the food security issue, particularly in France,"" Hannasch said.
""And so whether that changes over time, it's hard to say.""
Hannasch also Couche-Tard saw ""tremendous"" opportunities for growth in Asia.
Couche-Tard entered the Asian market through a deal to buy Convenience Retail Asia Ltd's Hong Kong unit for HK$2.79 billion ($359.85 million) in November.
'TRUE BARRIER'
In a note to clients on Monday, Bryan, Garnier & Co retail analyst Clément Genelot blamed France's 2022 presidential elections as the ""true barrier to the deal,"" amid fears that the sale of the country's leading private employer could strengthen far-right opposition to incumbent Emmanuel Macron.
Carrefour employs 105,000 people in France and runs around 8,000 convenience stores as well as its traditional hypermarkets and supermarkets.
One top ten Couche-Tard shareholder, already skeptical about the merits of a tie-up with a grocer, said the company would face questions for moving away from its core business.
""I think in the interim there will continue to be some form of overhang or discount I think applied to the equity just because there will be that concern that the management team has started to get outside what's considered their area of competence,"" he said on condition of anonymity.
Analysts at investment bank Citi said there was still a chance Carrefour and Couche-Tard could revive talks at a later date, while the possibility remained for Carrefour and domestic rival Casino to examine a merger deal.

Separately, Air Canada said it would resume Boeing 737 MAX commercial operations on Feb. 1.
The airline said the aircraft would gradually return to its North American route network.

MILAN (Reuters) - Stellantis, the carmaker created by combining Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-owner PSA, enjoyed a positive start on Monday, its shares rising 8% on their European market debut and valuing the business at around 42 billion euros ($51 billion).
With annual production of around 8 million vehicles and revenues of more than 165 billion euros, the world's fourth largest auto company is expected to play a key role in the industry's jump into the new era of electrification.
Stellantis will have 14 brands, from FCA's Fiat, Maserati and U.S.-focused Jeep, Dodge and Ram to PSA's traditionally Europe-focused Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Citroen, Opel and DS.
""We have the scale, the resources, the diversity and the knowhow to successfully capture the opportunities of this new era in transportation,"" Chairman John Elkann said in a video on the Borsa Italiana website to mark the occasion.
Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the merger would add 25 billion euros in value for shareholders over the years, thanks to projected cost cuts.
""I can tell you that the focus from day one will be on the value creation that is the result of the implementation of those synergies,"" Tavares said in the same video.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA have said Stellantis can cut costs by more than 5 billion euros a year without plant closures.
Milan-listed shares of Stellantis started trading at 12.758 euros and at 1330 GMT were up 8.1% at of 13.59 euros. The Paris-listed shares traded around the same level.
That compares with Fiat Chrysler's (FCA) close on Friday at 12.57 euros.
Over the weekend, PSA shares were exchanged into new FCA shares. All FCA shares were then renamed as Stellantis.
A Milan-based trader said part of the rise can be explained by technical reasons, with funds buying shares to adjust their portfolio exposures to the new company. 
Also, former FCA investors are reinvesting part of the proceeds of a 2.9 billion euro special divided FCA paid them last week, a second trader said. 
The stock will debut in New York on Tuesday, when Tavares will also hold his first news conference as the head of Stellantis.
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) analyst Monica Bosio said she expected markets would start pricing in synergies at Stellantis only once their impact becomes visible from the second half of this year.
""However, even excluding synergies, ... we continue to view Stellantis as underappreciated on all metrics in comparison with its most direct peers,"" Bosio said in a note.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union needs a ""masterplan"" to move euro financial services from London to the bloc if it wants to expand the single currency's role in a global economy dominated by the U.S. dollar, a senior EU lawmaker said on Monday.
Markus Ferber, a senior member of the European Parliament, said if the EU wants to compete with the greenback, it needs a financial system to match it.
""We need a clear step-by-step masterplan that helps key financial sector businesses move from the United Kingdom to the European Union,"" Ferber said.
He was speaking ahead of Wednesday's publication of a European Commission paper on promoting the global role of the euro which sets out ways to rely less on the City of London, Europe's biggest financial centre, after Brexit.
""The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted vulnerabilities in the dollar-dominated international financial system,"" the commission paper says. 
""The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU strengthens the need to further deepen the Union's capital markets.""
The paper recommends better enforcement of EU sanctions, and making EU-based financial market infrastructures less vulnerable to unilateral sanctions from third countries.
EU-based securities depositories Clearstream and Euroclear, and messaging services like Swift were affected by President Donald Trump's actions against Iran.
Euro-denominated trade in debt securities, commodities and other instruments should also be encouraged, the paper said.
Reform of EU ""MiFID"" securities and benchmark rules should aim to help euro-denominated energy indices emerge, and increase the attractiveness of euro bonds and shares, it said.
The EU executive and the European Central Bank will also review policy, legal and technical issues emerging from a possible digital euro.
The Commission, ECB and the bloc's banking and markets watchdogs will work with industry to assess ""possible technical issues"" related to shifting derivatives positions from London to the EU, the paper said.
The paper could make it less likely that the EU will grant UK financial services access to the EU beyond the temporary access it has granted for derivatives clearers to mid-2022.
Some 6.5 billion in euro share trading switched from London to the bloc overnight on Jan. 4 and City officials do not expect this to return, with swaps trading by EU investors also under pressure to leave.
""A related source of risk is the excessive reliance of EU banks on foreign exchange swap markets,"" the paper said.
When looking at company takeovers, the Commission would also check whether they make an EU company ""more prone"" to complying with sanctions from third countries, the paper said.
There is also a need to cut the bloc's ""excessive reliance"" on foreign investment banks and funding in foreign currencies, it said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets sank on Monday as soaring COVID-19 cases offset investor hopes of a quick economic recovery, even after data showing that the Chinese economy rebounded faster-than-expected in the fourth quarter of 2020.
European stocks as measured by the STOXX 600 index traded 0.1% lower as of 1134 GMT, after failed merger talks between French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Alimentation Couche-Tard. The continent's 50 biggest stocks were down 0.3% (EU)
Germany's DAX traded flat, France's CAC 40 index fell 0.1% and Italy's FTSE MIB index gained 0.1%. Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 0.3%.
In Asia, Chinese blue chips gained 1.1% after the economy was reported to have grown 6.5% in the fourth quarter, on a year earlier, topping forecasts of 6.1%.
Industrial production for December also beat estimates, although retail sales missed expectations.
""The recovery in domestic demand still lacks a solid backing,"" said Lauri Hälikkä, fixed income and FX strategist at SEB. ""Sporadic virus outbreaks have intensified downside risks in the near term.""
China reported more than 100 new COVID-19 cases for the sixth consecutive day, with rising infections in the northeast fuelling concern of another wave when hundreds of millions of people travel for the Lunar New Year holiday.
Tough new controls in the city of Gongzhuling in Jilin province, which has a population of about 1 million people, brings the total number of people under lockdown to more than 29 million.
Hallika said the impact of the latest regional lockdowns and mass testing is likely to be limited and short-lived.
The pick-up in China was a marked contrast to the United States and Europe, where the spread of coronavirus has hit consumer spending, underlined by dismal U.S. retail sales reported on Friday.
Poor U.S. consumer spending data last week helped Treasuries pare some of their recent steep losses and 10-year yields were trading at 1.097%, down from last week's top of 1.187%.
The more sober mood in turn boosted the safe-haven U.S. dollar, catching a bearish market deeply short. Speculators increased their net short dollar position to the largest since May 2011 in the week ended Jan. 12.
Also evident are doubts about how much of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's stimulus package will make it through Congress given Republican opposition, and the risk of more violence at his inauguration on Wednesday.
Elsewhere in Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei slipped 1% and away from a 30-year high.
MSCI'S All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, fell 0.1%, down for a second session after hitting record highs only last week.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 traded flat, though Wall Street will be closed on Monday for a holiday.
BUBBLE?
Investors have discussed the question of whether markets are in or may be headed for a bubble.
In a monthly letter to clients last week, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said all of the preconditions for a bubble are in place.
""Financing costs are at record lows, new participants are being drawn into markets, and the combination of high accumulated savings and low prospective returns on traditional assets create both the means and the desire to engage in speculative activity,"" he said, warning that in the months ahead, investors will need to pay particular attention to ""risks of a monetary policy reversal, rising equity valuations, and the rate of the post-pandemic recovery.""
Haefele said however that while he sees pockets of speculation, the broader equity market is not in a bubble.
Cryptocurrency Bitcoin traded up 1.2%, fetching $36,236.
The dollar index firmed to 90.908, its strongest since Dec. 21,, and away from its recent 2-1/2 year trough at 89.206.
The euro had retreated to $1.2070, to its lowest since Dec. 2, while the dollar gained 0.1% against the yen at 103.78 and well above the recent low at 102.57.
The Canadian dollar eased to $1.2792 per dollar after Reuters reported Biden planned to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
Biden's pick for Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, is expected to rule out seeking a weaker dollar when testifying on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Gold prices gained 0.4% to $1,833 an ounce, compared to its January top of $1,959. 
Crude oil prices ran into profit-taking on worries the spread of increasingly tight lockdowns globally would hurt demand, a fall that also dragged the Russian rouble lower by 1.1%.

The U.S. company employs around 2,800 people in the country of 5.5 million, where unemployment has risen to 7.4%, from 5.2%, since the global coronavirus pandemic hit in March.
AT&T said in a statement it was working to ""manage the impact on our people"" from the cuts, which were part of previously announced initiatives and not only due to the crisis.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for IPOs, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The IPO could raise at least $2 billion, one of the sources said, which would likely make it the largest overseas share offering by a Southeast Asian company.
""The market is good and the business is doing better than before. This should work well for public markets,"" he said.
The plans, including the size of the issue and timing, have not been finalised and are subject to market conditions, said the sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak about the matter.
Singapore-based Grab declined comment on the potential IPO.
Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp and Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region's most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion.
The company, which also offers financial services and recently gained a digital bank licence in Singapore, said this month that group revenue had recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. It has also said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of the year.
The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were dropped.

Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for a $18 billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>",Samsung's Lee receives 30-month prison term in bribery trial,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court sentenced Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) vice chairman Jay Y. Lee to two and a half years in prison on Monday, which could delay the group's ownership restructuring following the death of Lee's father in October.
The ruling also cements a major shift in South Korea's view on wrongdoings committed by the owners of the country's powerful conglomerates, or chaebol, which led the country's economic rise after the Korean War on the back of what has been criticised as cozy relations with politicians.
Lee, the country's most powerful businessman at age 52, had served one year in prison for bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye when an appeals court suspended it in 2018; a year later, the Supreme Court ordered him retried. His prison time will count against his latest sentence. 
Monday's sentencing by the Seoul High Court can be appealed to the Supreme Court within seven days, but legal experts said that because the Supreme Court has already ruled on it once, chances are low that its legal interpretation will change. 
The Seoul High Court found Lee guilty of bribery, embezzlement and concealment of criminal proceeds worth about 8.6 billion won ($7.8 million), and said the independent compliance committee Samsung (KS:005930) set up early last year has yet to become fully effective. 
""(Lee) has shown willingness for management with newly strengthened compliance, as he has vowed to create a transparent company,"" said Presiding Judge Jeong Jun-yeong. 
""Despite some shortcomings... I hope that over time, it will be evaluated as a milestone in the history of Korean companies as a beginning for compliance and ethics,"" he said. 
Lee, dressed in a dark coat and silver tie and standing to hear the sentencing, sat down after it was read. He did not comment when given a chance by the judge. 
During his final statement to the court in December, Lee had said that he wants to ""make a new Samsung"".
""This case involves the former president's abuse of power violating corporate freedom and property rights... The court's decision is regrettable,"" Lee's lawyer, Lee In-jae, told reporters. 
SHARES FALL
Lee will be sidelined for the time being from major decision-making at Samsung Electronics as it strives to overtake competitors. He will also be unable to directly oversee the process of inheritance from his father, crucial to keeping control of Samsung.
Analysts agreed that day-to-day operations would not be affected, but large-scale decisions whose results are often only visible after years, such as M&As and major personnel changes, may be. 
""(Lee's) absence is not going to disrupt Samsung's current management... Unlike in his father's time, Samsung has been managing by system, decision-making distributed to each business' CEO,"" said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com. 
""But besides the hit to his global image, long-term strategies, like currently unplanned investment for the future and restructuring, may stop,"" he added. 
Samsung affiliates' shares fell sharply after the ruling, with Samsung Electronics shares down 3.4% in their worst daily fall in five months, while Samsung C&T shares fell 6.8%. 
NO MORE LENIENCY
Monday's ruling hammered home that the leniency typically shown to South Korean business leaders in the past can no longer be expected.
Lee is expected to return on Monday to the prison in which he served his earlier sentence.
Business groups expressed concern over the effect Lee's sentence might have. 
""Lack of long-term leadership can result in delayed entry into new businesses and quick decision-making, leaving them behind in global competition,"" said Bae Sang-kun, an executive director of lobby group Federation of Korean Industries.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab is exploring a listing in the United States this year, encouraged by robust investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Grab, whose backers include SoftBank Group Corp and Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, has expanded rapidly from its beginnings as a ride-hailing venture in Malaysia in 2012 to become the region's most valuable startup worth more than $16 billion.
The company has raised more than $10 billion as it becomes a one-stop shop for services such as food delivery, payments and insurance in Southeast Asia, home to about 650 million people. It recently gained a digital bank licence in Singapore.
Grab's total group net revenue jumped by about 70% year on year in 2020 and has recovered to be comfortably above pre-pandemic levels.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said this month Grab had cash holdings of about $3.2 billion, which the ratings agency ""expects will be sufficient to cover negative operating cash flow, capital spending at its transport and food delivery businesses and scheduled debt maturities over at least the next two-three years.""
One of the sources said he expects Grab's IPO to raise substantially more than $2 billion as some of its long-term investors trim stakes and new investors come on board.
Grab has said its ride-hailing business is breaking even in all its operating markets, including Indonesia, the biggest. It expects its food delivery business to break even by the end of 2021.
The IPO plans would come after merger discussions with Indonesian rival Gojek were derailed.
Gojek and Indonesian e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks for a $18 billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, Reuters reported this month.
As consumers increasingly adopt online services amid lockdowns to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, investors are paying more focus on market leaders.
Grab caught global attention when Uber (NYSE:UBER) sold its Southeast Asia business to the company in 2018 after a costly five-year battle and in return took a stake in Grab.
It now operates in 397 cities across eight Southeast Asian countries and its app has seen 214 million downloads. Grab's food delivery business overtook the mature transport division to become the company's biggest segment last year.

""It's quite clear that investors are rewarding growth and market share,"" said the second source, pointing to a 15-fold surge in shares of Singapore-based e-commerce, gaming and payments firm Sea since its 2017 listing in New York.

487,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Veolia's Fight for Suez Turns Nasty,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The battle for control of Suez (OTC:SZSAY) heated up over the weekend, as two private equity groups came to the rescue of the beleaguered French water group's management.
Paris-based Ardian and New York-based Global Infrastructure Partners said they would be willing to pay 18 euros per share for the group, including up to 45c of accrued dividends, effectively matching the bid that Veolia Environment (PA:VIE) made to all Suez shareholders in October, when it agreed to buy a 29.9% stake from utility Engie (PA:ENGIE).
The development appears to be little more than to defend the current position of Suez's management, which is bitterly opposed to being taken over by Veolia. The new offer contains no premium to Veolia's, and the prospect of continued competition between the two in water will do nothing to enhance either's margins. Veolia already has a plan to farm off such assets as necessary to satisfy antitrust concerns and has committed not to cut jobs in France. If Ardian and GIP have any better ideas for creating value for Suez shareholders, they were keeping them close to their chest at the weekend.
Even so, the prospect of Veolia being forced to raise its offer to present a more compelling argument was enough to push Suez (PA:SEVI) stock up 3.1% to a five-year high on Monday, and Veolia's down by almost as much, while the rest of Europe's stock market tended downwards on concerns about the latest wave of the pandemic.
Suez is a natural target for two private equity houses that specialize in infrastructure companies, but their ultimate intentions were still unclear on Monday. In the statement they released, Ardian and GIP described themselves as open to ""various possible execution options"", of which the offer to Suez shareholders was only one. They said that their letter of intent ""paves the way a global solution"" and stressed ""the friendly context"" of their intervention. The only thing that the two said they would not sign up to was a 'dismantling' of Suez.
Veolia was understandably having none of it. 
Over the weekend, Veolia put out a terse statement saying that its newly-acquired shares ""are not and will not be for sale: they constitute the first step in the inevitable construction, and under French control, of the world champion of ecological transformation; they are not an element of financial strategy.""
""Any project which would directly or indirectly involve the sale by Veolia of its stake in Suez, or other transfers distorting the industrial project that the Group is carrying out, is considered hostile,"" Veolia CEO Antoine Frérot said.
Suez stayed tight-lipped. "

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, starting the week on a downbeat note given Covid-related concerns, and not reassured by healthy-looking Chinese economic growth.
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%. 
China reported Monday that its economy grew 2.3% last year, as its gross domestic product rose by 6.5% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, helped by retail sales rising 4.6% in the final quarter from a year ago.
The figures from the world’s second largest economy have tended to be overshadowed by worries about the impact of the latest surge in Covid-19 cases, especially in Europe but also further afield.
China has recently locked down over 28 million people to combat the virus. In Europe, opposition to the latest restrictions is growing, as several thousand people held an unauthorized protest in Amsterdam on Sunday before being dispersed by riot police. While, in the U.S., the spread of the coronavirus has hit consumer spending, given Friday’s weak retail sales.
Still, losses are limited in Europe Monday, with the U.S. on holiday, and ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.
Investors will also be keeping a wary eye on events in Washington, amid concerns about possible violence at President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday as well as how much of his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan will get through Congress given Republican opposition.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally lower Monday, starting the week on a downbeat note given Covid-related concerns,  and not reassured by healthy-looking Chinese economic growth.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
China reported Monday that its economy grew 2.3% last year, as its gross domestic product rose by 6.5% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, helped by retail sales rising 4.6% in the final quarter from a year ago.
The figures from the world’s second largest economy have tended to be overshadowed by worries about the impact of the latest surge in Covid-19 cases, especially in Europe but also further afield.
China has recently locked down over 28 million people to combat the virus. In Europe, opposition to the latest restrictions is growing, as several thousand people held an unauthorized protest in Amsterdam on Sunday before being dispersed by riot police. While, in the U.S., the spread of the coronavirus has hit consumer spending, given Friday’s weak retail sales.
Still, losses are expected to be limited in Europe Monday, with the U.S. on holiday to celebrate Martin Luther King day, and ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting on Thursday.
Investors will also be keeping a wary eye on events in Washington, amid concerns about possible violence at President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday as well as how much of his proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan will get through Congress given Republican opposition.
Back in Europe, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) will be in focus as the drug maker received U.S. approval for its gastric cancer drug.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Monday morning, after U.S. shares saw losses during the previous session over a lack of investor risk appetite and China released crucial data on its economic recovery process.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.32% by 9:44 PM ET (2:44 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.71%. Data released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December, above the 6.9% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 7% growth seen in November.
The data also showed that GDP rose 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, above the forecast 6.1% growth and the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. The GDP grew 2.6% quarter-on-quarter, this time below the forecast 3.2% and the 2.7% growth seen during the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, U.S.-China tensions are set to rise after the U.S. government reportedly notified several Huawei Technologies Co. suppliers, including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), that their licenses to work with the Chinese company have been revoked. Other license applications have also reportedly been rejected.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.30%. A panel is expected to meet later in the day to approve COMIRNATY, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy).

Meanwhile, the U.S. also released some disappointing data on Friday, which saw futures in New York tumble up to 2.3% on the same day. Core retail sales contracted 1.4% month-on-month in December, larger from the 0.1% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 1.3% contraction recorded in November. The Producer Price Index (PPI) grew 0.3% month-on-month in December, while retail sales contracted 0.7% month-on-month in December.
“The data bring into question the durability of the recent move higher in bond yields and the rise in inflation compensation,” ANZ analysts said in a note.
“There’s a lot of good news around vaccines and stimulus priced into equities, but optimism is being challenged by the reality of the tough few months ahead,” they warned. “The risk across Europe is that lockdowns will be extended, and U.S. cases could lift sharply as the UK COVID-19 variant spreads,” the note added.
The nuber of global COVID-19 cases is close to topping the 95 million mark as of Jan. 18, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Global shares slid during the previous week after optimism about the $1.9 trillion worth of stimulus measures announced by U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden during the previous week, waned. Biden and his administration will be sworn in on Wednesday.
“Markets needed a breather or even a pull back to justify reflationary expectations,” Medley Global Advisors managing director of global macro strategy Ben Emons told Bloomberg.

""AG Paxton tries to paint Google’s involvement in this industry as nefarious,"" Cohen wrote. ""The opposite is true.

Quebec-based convenience store operator Couche-Tard abandoned talks to buy Carrefour (PA:CARR) for $20 billion after French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire raised concerns about food and job security. Instead, the two companies decided to work on partnership opportunities, they said in a joint statement on Saturday.
Champagne said in his tweet that the government will support Canadian businesses ""here and abroad,"" adding the two-way trade benefits businesses both sides of the Atlantic.
Bouchard, a self-made billionaire, has taken Couche-Tard from just one store in 1980 to a global network of convenience stores and gas stations with a market value of $33 billion, with 66 acquisitions along the way.
France's swift and firm rejection of the deal sparked a flurry of trans-Atlantic lobbying to salvage the transaction, but the companies ended their pursuit late on Friday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - For years, legal troubles have cast a cloud over Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee as he stood on the cusp of stepping out of his father's shadow and making a name for himself as the leader of the global tech giant.
On Monday, he faces sentencing on a bribery charge that could sideline him from the world's largest smartphone and memory chip maker just as it looks to overtake rivals in areas such as chip contract manufacturing and artificial intelligence (AI). 
""Samsung (KS:005930) is at a crossroads,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of researcher CEO Score. ""COVID-19 has accelerated change, and other third-gen (Korean) business leaders are aggressively breaking into new business.""
Park cited Hyundai's EV push and LG's joint venture with Magna as examples of ambitious initiatives led by the grandsons of those conglomerates' founders. 
""But Samsung hasn't really seen big changes in new business such as AI since its 2016 Harman acquisition, except increasing the foundry business, because of continued legal risk. The next few years will decide whether Samsung will become, say, a global platform company or remain a hardware company,"" he said. 
Lee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father, Lee Kun-hee, was hospitalised after a heart attack in 2014. 
The elder Lee died in October, but the chairmanship he held has yet to be filled, and uncertainty cast by his son's legal troubles was the chief reason, analysts said.
Vice chairman since 2012, Lee has yet to make a mark - as his father did - by building the semiconductor business, which now brings in half of Samsung Electronics profits. 
Amid the moves meant to ensure his succession, Lee has fought against allegations of legal wrongdoing, including a year in prison in 2017-2018 over a bribery case involving impeached President Park Geun-hye.
FLAGSHIP BUSINESSES
One of Lee's focuses is Samsung's non-memory chip business, including chip contract manufacturing, calling on the staff to ""create another legend."" 
Samsung plans to invest 133 trillion won ($121.47 billion) in non-memory chips through 2030 to become No. 1, including in chip contract manufacturing, where its 17% market share is a distant second to current No. 1 TSMC's 54%, according to TrendForce. 
Samsung has also touted Lee's deal-making skills in winning a $6.6 billion contract from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) last year, describing the network equipment business - still small compared with that of rivals like Huawei - as a key business area. 
Lee also needs to deal with paying inheritance tax to maintain control of the tech giant. Since Lee Kun-hee passed away, an estimated 11 trillion won ($10.05 billion) in inheritance tax is expected to be needed for his family to inherit his listed stockholdings alone.
And he faces a separate trial over suspected accounting fraud and stock price manipulation connected to a 2015 merger that helped him assume greater control of Samsung Electronics.
'SUPER-CLASS COMPANY'
Urbane, reserved and media shy, Lee has shown a relaxed side in public more recently after his release from detention. 
He has been pictured eating lunch in staff cafeterias, taking selfies with employees, and smiling brightly when President Moon Jae-in visited a Samsung worksite in April 2019.
In May, he said he would not hand over management rights to his children and apologised for the behaviour of executives caught sabotaging labour union activities. 
""A true super-class company is a sustainable company ... I want to make a new Samsung,"" Lee said during his final statement to the court in December.

Deliveroo is set to hold an initial public offering in the coming months, in what would be the biggest new share issue in London for three years.
""This investment will help us to continue to innovate, developing new tech tools to support restaurants, to provide riders with more work and to extend choice for customers,"" Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu said.

The internet giant's stake is not expected to increase as a result of its participation in the latest round of fundraising, which was led by U.S. investors Durable Capital Partners and Fidelity Management & Research. 
Deliveroo operates across 12 countries, mostly in western Europe but also in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. It did not state how much each investor had contributed in the latest funding round. 

The company said it would spend the $180 million on expanding delivery-only kitchen sites, on-demand grocery deliveries and subscription services, as well as allowing more restaurants to take orders from via own websites.

(Reuters) - Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard and European retailer  Carrefour  SA (OTC:CRRFY) have decided to work on partnership opportunities after takeover talks failed, the two companies said in a joint statement on Saturday.
Couche-Tard dropped its 16.2 billion euro ($19.57 billion) bid for Carrefour (PA:CARR) after the French government opposed the deal, citing food security concerns.
The decision to end merger talks came after a meeting on Friday between French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Couche-Tard's founder and chairman, Alain Bouchard.
""Food security is strategic for our country so that's why we don't sell a big French retailer. My answer is extremely clear: We are not in favour of the deal. The no is polite but it's a clear and final no,"" Le Maire said.
The Canadian firm had submitted a non-binding offer letter earlier this month to buy European retail giant at a price of 20 euros per share.
""We regret to learn that Couche-Tard will not be moving forward with their investments in the French company Carrefour, but are encouraged by the news that Couche-Tard and Carrefour will explore an operational partnership,"" Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng wrote on Twitter.
The companies said they have decided to extend their discussions to examine opportunities for sharing practices on fuel purchases, partnering on private labels and distribution in overlapping networks.
""The discussed areas for cooperation align with our five-year strategic plan, as well as our commitment to strengthening our core convenience and fuel business and pursuing opportunities in multiple, related growth platforms,"" Couche-Tard Chief Executive Brian Hannasch said.

Now analysts and investors are turning their focus to how Tavares plans to address the huge challenges facing the group – from excess production capacity to a woeful performance in China.
Tavares will hold his first press conference as Stellantis CEO on Tuesday, after ringing NYSE's bell with Chairman John Elkann.
FCA and PSA have said Stellantis can cut annual costs by over 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) without plant closures, and investors will be keen for more details on how it will do this.
Marco Santino, a partner at consultants Oliver Wyman, said he expected Tavares to disclose the outlines of his action plan soon, but without divulging too many details at first.
""He has proven to be the kind of person who prefers action to words, so I don't think he will make loud statements or try to over-sell targets,"" he said.
Like all global automakers, Stellantis needs to invest billions in the years ahead to transform its vehicle range for the electric era.
But other pressing tasks loom, including reviving the group's lagging fortunes in China, rationalising its huge global empire and addressing massive overcapacity.
""It will be a step by step process, also to allow the market to better appreciate every single move. I don't think we will have all the details before one year,"" Santino said.

FCA CEO Mike Manley - who will head Stellantis' key North American operations - has said 40% of the carmaker's expected synergies would come from convergence of platforms and powertrains and from optimising R&D investments, 35% from savings on purchases, and another 7% from savings on sales operations and general expenses.

505,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Failed French supermarket deal unlikely to dampen ambitions of Canada's Bouchard,"By Allison Lampert and Kevin Dougherty
MONTREAL/QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - Political opposition that killed Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard's $20 billion bid for French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) on Friday is unlikely to end the global ambitions of founder Alain Bouchard.
The low-profile Canadian businessman built Couche-Tard from a single store in Quebec in 1980 to a global network of convenience stores and gas stations with a market value of $33 billion, with 66 acquisitions along the way.
French politicians gave a strong 'non' to the proposed take-over, calling it a matter of national food safety. Behind the scenes, Bouchard made a misstep by not giving an early heads up to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who was extremely upset to learn about the deal from the media, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Bouchard, 72, who served as Couche-Tard's chief executive for 25 years until 2014, started in business after learning hard lessons as a child when his father, a subcontractor, went bankrupt.
""Couche-Tard is a master at converting dollars spent on gas on dollars spent on food and convenience store products,"" Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.
""You fill up your car with gas and then you go get a sandwich, newspaper and cigarettes.""
But a global move toward electric vehicles would eventually disrupt that model, Charlebois noted, adding the Carrefour acquisition might be a way for the retailer to diversify its strategy.
Bouchard, the current executive chairman of the company, declined to be interviewed for this story.
'A STRETCH'
The Quebec chain grew in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s before making its big break into the fragmented U.S. market in the early 2000s, acquiring first the assets of Johnson Oil Co, and then Circle K Corp. Once, when a banker suggested he was too ambitious, Bouchard switched banks, according to a local media report.
Alain Bouchard is ""an entrepreneurial hero, a self-made man, self-educated man,"" his friend Mitch Garber, who headed Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil, said.
Garber doesn't buy the French minister's arguments, calling them ""a stretch"".
""If Carrefour was making weapons for the French army I would understand,"" he said. ""They sell groceries.""
Despite the endless amount of acquisitions, the company has retained its entrepreneurial approach to business, a top-10 shareholder of Couche-Tard said.
Couche-Tard has missed deals before and looked for more.
Couche-Tard Chief Executive Brian Hannasch told Fortune in August ""there will be more activity caused by the pandemic,"" after the demise of a planned $5.6 billion acquisition of petrol station operator Caltex Australia in April.
Bouchard, who relaxes with opera and gives to the arts and culture, the intellectually disabled, education and health care, retains some strong shareholder support.
""It's a bit of a head scratcher,"" the top-10 shareholder in Couche-Tard said, pointing to the minimal overlap in terms of both business model and geographic region. But history is a guide for investors. ""There is definitely a case to be made that these guys have a great, great track record.""

Under the tentative deal, which is yet to be ratified by the union workers, GM has agreed to begin large-scale commercial production of EV600, an electric van, at its CAMI plant, Unifor said in a statement.
The Detroit automaker said in a separate statement that work would begin immediately at the plant.
The new deal builds upon recent investments by GM in Canada, which in November had agreed to invest C$1 billion in its Oshawa plant to expand production of its full-size pickup trucks.
The Canadian government welcomed the deal and said it would confirm its support as soon as the union members ratified the deal.
""We await the results of the ratification vote,"" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.
Unifor, the union representing hourly workers in Canada, said more details of the deal would be presented to local members of the union at an online ratification meeting scheduled for Jan. 17, the results of which are scheduled to be released a day later.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday began distributing $15 billion in new payroll assistance to airlines, money allocated by Congress to help more than 32,000 aviation workers return to jobs through at least March 31.
Large airlines receiving assistance must repay 30% of it to the government in 10-year, low-interest loans. They must also issue warrants to the government as part of the assistance and must agree to extend restrictions on executive compensation and a ban on paying dividends and share repurchases through March 2022.
The Treasury said Friday it was initially awarding more than $12 billion in payroll support for major passenger air carriers and had released $6.1 billion on Friday.
Treasury and airline officials said the government plans to release the remaining payroll assistance by the end of March.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it expects to receive $2.9 billion in total aid this round, with $830 million in the form of an unsecured loan. The airline said it received the first installment of $1.4 billion on Friday.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it expected to receive $1.73 billion in total and received $863.7 million on Friday.
The warrants are priced at each airline's share closing prices on Dec. 24.
Congress in March approved a initial $25 billion in payroll assistance to support airline jobs for six months.
Treasury said Friday it struck agreements with 12 airlines representing nearly 95% of U.S. airline capacity including Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta, Frontier Airlines Co, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Republic Airways,  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Airlines , Southwest,  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE), and United Airlines.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the program ""will provide additional economic relief for workers, while also protecting taxpayer funds.""
SkyWest said it will receive $233 million in total under the program and received half on Friday.
Last month, American Airlines and United Airlines announced they were recalling tens of thousands of furloughed employees.
American and United together furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October. The new assistance will keep those workers on payrolls through March 31.

Neither airline on Friday immediately disclosed how much they expected to receive from Treasury.

The department's review of the matter had been closely watched since scrapping the 1941 consent agreements could upend the business of licensing music to online companies like Spotify and Pandora (OTC:PANDY) as well as movie companies, commercials, bars and restaurants.
Without the decrees, companies of any size seeking to play music would have to negotiate rights in a chaotic transition while also facing the prospect of price hikes, said the MIC Coalition, whose members include the Brewers Association and National Restaurant Association.
Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division who steps down next week, said in speech that the ""investigation period"" was closing.
""The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees should be reviewed every five years, to assess whether the decrees continue to achieve their objective to protect competition and whether modifications to the decrees are appropriate in light of changes in technology and the music industry,"" Delrahim added in a speech to Vanderbilt Law School.
ASCAP and BMI said they were disappointed by the government's decision to formally close its review with no action taken.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading volume in U.S. equity options hit a new record on Friday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.
More than 49.5 million contracts traded during the session, Trade Alert said. Friday marked the expiration of monthly options contracts, which often results in heavier-than-usual volume.
This year, some 416 million U.S. equity options contracts have already traded over 10 sessions. That's equal to the total options volumes over the first four months of 2004, Trade Alert founder Henry Schwartz wrote in a note.
Options volume has ballooned over the past year as the derivatives become more popular with investors. In 2020, trading volume set an annual record, at 7.47 billion options contracts, according to the Options Clearing Corporation.
The growing popularity of options among retail investors has contributed to the surge in volume. In particular, retail investors have piled into call options on individual stocks - used to position for gains in the underlying shares - as U.S. equities have climbed sharply in the wake of their sell-off last March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes finished lower on Friday, weighed down by big U.S. banks after their earnings reports, while the energy fell sharply due to a regulatory probe into  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).
The S&P 500 banks index lost ground as shares of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) tumbled even though they had posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits. The bank sector had rallied sharply in recent days.
Wells Fargo, down 7.8%, was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500, along with Exxon Mobil, down 4.8%.
""Financials and energy have been disappointing ... that's bringing down the whole market,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""This year is the year for financials, energy, materials, industrials. So if there is a day when they're not leading, it's not good news for the market.""
Wall Street's major indexes had recently hit record highs on hopes for a hefty fiscal stimulus package. 
Incoming U.S. President Joe Biden late on Thursday unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal, which included some $1 trillion in direct relief to households. 
Meanwhile, data showed a further decline in U.S. retail sales in December in the latest sign the economy lost considerable speed at the end of 2020.
""The weaker-than-expected economic data, and especially in parts of the economy like retail sales, is a big driver,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW).
""We are seeing sentiment through last week in extreme speculative frothy euphoric optimistic territory,"" she said.
""Sometimes it doesn't need a catalyst before it begins to fall on its own weight.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 177.26 points, or 0.57%, to 30,814.26, the S&P 500 lost 27.29 points, or 0.72%, to 3,768.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.14 points, or 0.87%, to 12,998.50.
For the week the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell around 1.5% while the Dow lost 0.91%.
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 9.5% in the final quarter of 2020 from a year ago, but are expected to rebound in 2021, with a gain of 16.4% projected for the first quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Exxon shares fell after a report said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation of the oil major, following a whistleblower's complaint that it overvalued a key asset in the prolific Permian shale oil basin.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Investing.com – The Dow snapped a three-week winning streak Friday, paced by a decline in financials as Wall Street banks delivered mixed quarterly results, while the signs of a slowdown in the recovery prompted traders to keep their powder dry.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.57%, or 177 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.87%.   
Financials were among the biggest decliners, led by a drop in banking stocks after JPMorgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported mixed quarterly results.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fell 2% despite reporting fourth-quarter results that topped expectations. Wells Fargo and Citigroup missed quarterly revenue estimates, but beat expectations on the bottom line. Shares fell more than 6% and 7%, respectively.  
The start of earnings season will also provide investors with clues of the impact on Corporate America in the wake of a slowing recovery.
Retail sales fell by a more than expected 0.7% in December, marking the third straight month of losses.
""Total sales in 2020 were up only 0.6% from 2019, the slowest pace in retail activity since the last recession in 2009,"" said Yelena Maleyev, Economist at Grant Thornton.
The U.S. economic slowdown could suffer a further hit as fears mount that more restrictive lockdown measures to curb the virus loom after the CDC warned that highly contagious Covid-19 variant identified in the U.K. could become the dominate strain in the U.S. if there are no measures to slow the spread.
Still, further fiscal help to stem the pandemic blow to the economy could be one the way.
Biden unveiled Thursday plans for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that includes ""another round of direct payments of $1,400 per qualifying person, enhanced federal unemployment benefits to $400 per-week through the end of September, and an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour,"" Stifel said.
Biden also bandied a follow-up recovery package focused on infrastructure and climate change - expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks – that will likely be funded by tax hikes.
The risk of higher taxes has not been fully priced in, said Derek Holt, Vice-President of Scotiabank Economics. ""My personal belief remains that markets have been sleep walking through the tax policy risk out of the U.S.""  Holt added. Biden will likely resort to playing one or two of his two 2021 budget reconciliation cards to push taxes through if he fails to get win support from GOP senators. But while that ""could still cost Biden in the November 2022 mid-terms … he may be thinking he'd better get it all done sooner than later."" 
Energy, meanwhile, fell more than 2% but is set to end week higher amid gains earlier this week as investors expect oil prices to continue their advance.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) fell 5% after the SEC reportedly launched an investigation into how the oil major valued a key asset in the oil rich Permian Basin, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In other news,  Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) gave up some of its public-debut gains from a day earlier, falling 19%, but remained above its IPO price of $42 per share."

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 03:15PM ET</span>",France's Total quits top U.S. oil lobby in climate split,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - France's Total SE on Friday became the first major global energy company to quit the main U.S. oil and gas lobby due to disagreements over its climate policies and support for easing drilling regulations.
Total said it would not renew its 2021 membership with the American Petroleum Institute (API) following a review of the lobby's climate positions, describing them as being only ""partially aligned"" with its own.
The high-profile departure from the most powerful energy lobby comes ahead of sweeping changes in policy direction in the United States, with incoming President Joe Biden promising to tackle climate change and bring the country to net-zero emissions by 2050.
""As part of our climate ambition made public in May 2020, we are committed to ensuring, in a transparent manner, that the industry associations of which we are a member adopt positions and messages that are aligned with those of the Group in the fight against climate change"", Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said.
The withdrawal highlights a widening rift between Europe's top energy companies, which over the past year accelerated plans to cut emissions and build large renewable energy businesses and their U.S. rivals  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) that have largely resisted growing investor pressure to diversify.
Chevron has no plans to leave the API, company spokesman Sean Comey said. Exxon was not immediately available for comment.
The announcement puts pressure on Total's European rivals BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to follow suit after resisting the move in recent years.
BP, Shell and Norway's Equinor on Friday said they are reviewing memberships in trade organizations and how they align on climate-related issues. Shell spokesman Curtis Moore said ""API is moving closer to Shell’s own stated views"" on climate change.
European oil companies have in the past pointed to the API's role in formulating industry safety and operating standards as their rationale for remaining with the group.
However, in its reasons for leaving the group, Total cited the API's support for last year's rollback of U.S. regulation on emissions of methane, its differing views on pricing carbon, as well its lack of support for subsidies for electric vehicles.
The API thanked Total for its membership, but noted that it does not support subsidies for energy, saying it distorts markets.
""We believe that the world's energy and environmental challenges are large enough that many different approaches are necessary to solve them, and we benefit from a diversity of views,"" the API said.
The group has defended its record on tackling carbon emissions, noting that the industry's technological advances have helped it cut carbon dioxide and methane emissions rates in large oil-producing regions.
Total last year announced plans to cut its carbon emissions, with the aim of reaching net zero emissions from its operations and its energy products sold to customers in Europe by 2050 or sooner.
Total's operations in the United States include a number of offshore oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico, a major refining and petrochemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas, as well as renewable energy businesses. The company produced about 343,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter in the Americas.
SIGNIFICANT MOVE
Growing investor pressure has spurred Europe's top energy companies to outline plans to curb emissions and boost renewable energy output.
""There is simply no justification for any association with lobby groups who roll back emissions regulations and undermine urgent climate action,"" said Jeanett Bergan, head of responsible investment at KLP, Norway's largest pension fund, which manages $80 billion in assets.
Total, BP and Shell have already pulled out of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), a U.S. oil refining group, also due to differences over climate policies.
The withdrawal from API was more significant, said Andrew Logan, director for oil and gas programmes and clean energy investor group CERES, said the announcement was significant and would put pressure on other European oil majors.

""Given the size and influence of API, this is a much more significant move than previous decisions to pull out of more niche trade groups like AFPM. I think that we will see other companies follow suit,"" Logan said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prophet Capital Asset Management LP, an investor in loans and structured credit securities with $2.5 billion in assets, has restructured a hedge fund that had been rocked by March's market turmoil, a company executive said on Friday.
Reuters reported in March that Prophet Capital, based in New York and Austin, Texas, had temporarily blocked investor withdrawals from its Prophet Opportunity Partners LP fund with a view to ultimately dissolving it, amid extreme volatility sparked by the onset of the coronavirus. 
The fund primarily held high-yield collateralized loan obligations (CLO), which were hard hit amid fears over the widespread risk of corporate loan defaults stemming from pandemic lockdowns.
The CLO market has since rebounded dramatically, allowing Prophet Capital to raise new cash for the fund and let investors redeem their money, said the firm's partner David Rosenblum. 
Effective Jan. 1, the fund has allowed investors three options: to cash out at net asset value, remain invested but sell their legacy assets over time, or reinvest with a two-year lockup that would make it easier to manage the fund through times of extreme volatility, said Rosenblum.
The restructuring underscores how default rates in the leveraged loan market have been far lower than feared, thanks largely to extraordinary interventions by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
""The CLO market has had a hell of a whipsaw this year, the whipsaw to end all whipsaws,"" said Rosenblum. 
""When all the stimulus came into the market, the stock market rallied hard and corporate bonds tightened a ton, bank loans, even distressed bank loans, caught the wave."" 
In 2020, CLOs returned 3.11%, according to data gathered by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Lower-rated tranches returned far more, with the BB-rated tranche returning 8.04%, according to the bank. 
One pre-pandemic investor in the fund said his company had redeemed their capital at net asset value, ""a much better outcome than we had feared.""

Bets on an economic recovery hinged on coronavirus vaccine roll outs and massive fiscal stimulus allowed Citi to release $1.5 billion from its reserves that it had previously set aside for sour loans, boosting results.
Finance chief Mark Mason warned that the revenue the bank earns from lending activities could fall more than 4% this year as the bank contends with the rock-bottom interest rates monetary authorities are holding in place to prop up the economy. 
Citi’s revenue slid 10% in the last quarter of 2020, driven by declines in its consumer bank as customers borrowed less and paid down more debt. Fees in the North American branded cards business, once the growth engine of the consumer bank, tumbled 13%.
Trading remained a bright spot defying concerns that the breakneck growth in trading revenue seen throughout 2020 was unsustainable.
Equities fees jumped 57% from last year and fixed-income fees grew 7%, but the bump was not enough to offset interest-related revenue declines during the quarter. 
Citi shares fell 5.4% to $65.32 as the bank reported a 7% decline in profit even as its peers JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co posted growth in the fourth quarter. 
Expenses rose 2% as the bank spent more to address its risk and controls after being sanctioned by regulators last year for failing to address years long deficiencies. 
Citi's finance head Mark Mason also said the bank's expenses would rise again in 2021 in the range of 2% to 3% this year, further pressuring its operating margins.
Incoming CEO Jane Fraser, who will officially take over next month, told analysts on a call that she was ""determined"" to address the deficiencies in its risk and control environment that have been raised by regulators and encouraging analysts skeptical that things would be different under her tenure to hold her accountable.
In all, the bank profit of $4.63 billion, or $2.08 a share, down from $5 billion, or $2.15 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected profit of $1.34 per share, according to Refinitiv data
Total loans fell 3% to $676 billion, while deposits rose 20% to $1.3 trillion as customers, faced with economic uncertainties, borrowed less and saved more.
Outgoing CEO Michael Corbat said the bank intended to resume share buybacks in the first quarter, after receiving a green light from regulators last month.
It has a capacity to buyback shares worth $1.8 billion in the first quarter, Mason said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Honest Capital LLC launched last year amid one of the most chaotic times in financial history, but its 88.4% returns far outpaced hedge fund peers and broad market indexes by focusing on smaller, less recognized stocks, according to a letter sent to investors this week.
Founder Shawn Badlani launched the San Francisco-based firm in May not long after stocks entered a brief free fall due to the coronavirus pandemic. He took in investor capital after Federal Reserve interventions and economic stimulus programs propped financial markets.
Honest Capital fund remains small – under $100 million, a person familiar with the firm said – but 2020 returns, after fees, compare with 11.6% average gains for hedge funds, according to Hedge Fund Research, and a 16.2% rise in the S&P 500 Index.
It is a success story as only 346 new funds, the smallest number in two decades, launched and 619 shut down during the first three quarters of 2020, HFR data shows.
The stellar results were thanks to the firm's focus on a handful of stocks that have potential, as opposed to a strategy of jumping on popular trends, Badlani said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters.
""We are pleased with this performance,"" Badlani, 38, wrote. ""We believe it demonstrates that a concentrated portfolio of high quality, less followed small and mid-cap equities can drive differentiated performance.""
The firm owns just nine stocks, including advertising platform Cardlytics (NASDAQ:CDLX) Inc, digital media company IAC/Interactive Corp and cannabis retailer Green Thumb Industries (OTC:GTBIF) Inc.
Green Thumb benefited from more U.S. states legalizing marijuana for recreational use and Cardlytics continues to add new users and improve its customer interface.
Badlani had been a partner at Marcato Capital Management for nearly a decade, until that firm shut in 2019. His former boss, Mick McGuire, learned about activist investing at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, and investors expect Badlani to follow in their mold.
At some point, he may start activist campaigns to push for operational improvements at companies and his firm name is supposed to represent the advice he will give CEOs, whether they like it or not, a person familiar with his thinking said.
For now, he is running Honest Capital from home with a third party handling back-office and compliance functions, since the pandemic made it difficult to meet potential employees and investors or scout office space in person.

520,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 02:51PM ET</span>","Plug Power a Leading Play in Fuel Cells, But Case for Growth is Tricky","By Yasin Ebrahim and Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com —  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) has surged more than 1000% over the past 12 months, but Is it time to pull the plug on the hydrogen's fuel cell company's shares?
Investing.com’s Yasin Ebrahim argues the bull case for Plug Power, while Geoffrey Smith argues why investors should steer clear.
The Bull Case
A more than 10-fold rally in 12 months? That's often the cue for the naysayers to jump on the ""over valuation"" bandwagon, and call time on a rally.
But this rally has not been driven on a diet of hopium and momentum, but rather signs the company's hydrogen fuel cells are poised to play a big role in the alternative energy space.
The company's core business, material handling – predominately driven by putting fuel cells into forklifts used in warehouses by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot – has been gaining traction.
Over the past year, the pace of its growth has continued to improve. The company recently raised its full-year billing guidance after reporting quarterly growth of 73.4% in Q3 and 68% in Q2.
Its material building business, which has a potential total addressable market of around $30 billion, is dwarfed by that of electric vehicles boasting a potential market of $200 billion, so the need to make a meaningful push into EV is clear.
In recent months, the company has made progress on objectives that will pave the way toward its goal of expanding its technology into on-road applications.
Plug teamed up with French automaker  Renault  to enter the European light commercial vehicle market, targeting over 30% share of the fuel cell-powered light commercial vehicle market in Europe.
In another move that highlighted the promise of the company's fuel cell technology, Plug Power secured a $1.5 billion strategic investment from SK Group to provide hydrogen fuel cell products to South Korea and wider Asian markets.
The recent progress confirms Plug Power as the leading hydrogen and fuel cell play.
""We believe with partners such as SK Group and Renault, the company essentially has state-level backing to accelerate hydrogen and fuel cell commercialization in Asia and Europe,""  H.C. Wainwright Amit Dayal said.
Growing evidence of Plug Power's progress in sectors including transport and power generation - that many say hold sway for the hydrogen economy to fulfil its promise as the missing piece of energy puzzle - suggests there is further room to go.
The Bear Case
Plug Power is in a bubble inflated by a collective mania on the part of relatively uninformed retail investors for anything that smells of the future, a bet that billions of subsidy dollars will somehow create a technology that generates not only super-clean energy but also positive free cash flow over the long run.
Plug Power isn’t worth half of what the stock market says. But you don’t need to take my word for that. You can take the word of the companies who believe in it and who need and want it to succeed in order to succeed themselves, companies that have looked a lot harder at its technology and balance sheet than those squeezing the stock higher through the options market this week.
SK Group, the Korean company that agreed to invest $1.5 billion for a 9.9% stake in Plug, did so at a price of $29.29 a share. In response to that very same news, retail investors were buying the same share at over $70 on Wednesday, and even though it gave up 4.3% on Thursday, it’s still trading at over twice what SK paid for it.
The other strategic partnership announced in the last week is also very likely less than meets the eye. Sure, it has locked up a strategic partner for vans, a particularly promising vehicle segment, in a deep and broad market with abundant subsidies for green energy. On the downside, it’s Renault SA (PA:RENA) – a French company unlikely to have a meaningful presence in either the U.S. or China, and which lags rivals such as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) Pref ADR (OTC:VWAPY) and Stellantis (the new holding company for Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Fiat Chrysler). Financial details of who will provide how much money for the JV and over what timeframe were conspicuous by their absence.
It’s true that the future that Plug Power has been promising for 20 years looks a more realistic prospect than at any time during its long, unbroken and glorious series of losses. And the company loses less money per share now than it used to, even if it is widening in absolute terms. But its valuation, at over 10 times trailing sales, is divorced from reality.
Hydrogen remains the longest of long-duration tech bets. Any profits it makes in the next 10 years will be due to subsidies which look secure today but which many governments may struggle to sustain if there should ever be an increase in their borrowing costs. Unless your investment strategy is simply to raid the public purse, there are better and safer returns to be had elsewhere."

Investing.com --  Palantir rose 7% on the Biden administration's plan to track Covid-19, Bloomberg reported.
President-elect Joe Biden’s economic relief proposal includes a plan for increased Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, which could benefit Palantir, Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services, told Bloomberg in a phone interview. 
“This will mean a lot of data to be analyzed, and that’s right in Palantir’s wheelhouse,” Kaufman said. Palantir has several contracts already with the U.S. government. 
Yesterday, officials from the Centers for Disease Control suggested Biden dump a Palantir system to track how hospitals were handling the surge in Covid-19 cases because it is inaccurate, Daily Beast reported. 
On Wednesday, Citi downgraded Palantir to sell from neutral, warning that it was “vulnerable heading into 2021"" and an expected deceleration in growth, according to StreetInsider.  
Shares of Palantir are up more than 170% since the stock went public in September.

(Reuters) - A federal judge denied Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s bid to set aside or reduce a $502.8 million patent infringement verdict favoring VirnetX Holding Corp, and awarded interest and royalties that could boost Apple's total payout in two lawsuits above $1.1 billion.
In a decision issued on Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert Schroeder in Tyler, Texas rejected Apple's request for a new trial and several other claims.
These included that VirnetX's award should not exceed $113.7 million, and that jurors should have been told the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had deemed VirnetX's claims ""unpatentable.""
Jurors in October found that Apple infringed two VirnetX patents related to secure networks, known as virtual private networks, to which owners of various iPhones and iPads may connect.
Schroeder also awarded royalties of 84 cents per unit for future infringements, mirroring the rate set by the jury. Apple had said future royalties should be zero, or else no more than 19 cents per unit.
Apple and VirnetX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In afternoon trading, VirnetX shares were up 54 cents, or 10.8%, at $5.63.
Apple, based in Cupertino, California, and VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, have battled in patent litigation for more than a decade.
Last March, Apple paid VirnetX $454 million after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the iPhone maker's appeal in an earlier patent case.
In a Dec. 18 court filing, Apple said the latest award could boost its payout in both cases to $1.116 billion.

The case is VirnetX Inc v. Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 12-00855.

Investing.com – The Dow moved off session lows Friday but remained under pressure on mixed quarterly reports from banks and further signs of a slowing recovery just as President-elect Joe Biden revealed his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to prop up the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.21%, or 64 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.31%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.27%.  
Financials were among the biggest decliners, led by a drop in banking stocks after JPMorgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported mixed quarterly results.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fell 2% despite reporting fourth-quarter results that topped expectations. Wells Fargo and Citigroup missed quarterly revenue estimates, but beat expectations on the bottom line. Shares fell more than 6% and 5%, respectively.  
The start of earnings season will also provide investors with clues of the impact on Corporate America in the wake of a slowing recovery.
Retail sales fell by a more than expected 0.7% in December, marking the third straight month of losses.
""Total sales in 2020 were up only 0.6% from 2019, the slowest pace in retail activity since the last recession in 2009,"" said Yelena Maleyev, Economist at Grant Thornton.
The U.S. economic slowdown could suffer a further hit as fears mount that more restrictive lockdown measures to curb the virus loom after the CDC warned that highly contagious Covid-19 variant identified in the U.K. could become the dominate strain in the U.S. if there are no measures to slow the spread.
Still, further fiscal help to stem the pandemic blow to the economy could be one the way.
Biden unveiled Thursday plans for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package that includes ""another round of direct payments of $1,400 per qualifying person, enhanced federal unemployment benefits to $400 per-week through the end of September, and an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour,"" Stifel said.
Biden also bandied a follow-up recovery package focused on infrastructure and climate change - expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks – that will likely be funded by tax hikes.
The risk of higher taxes has not been fully priced in, said Derek Holt, Vice-President of Scotiabank Economics. ""My personal belief remains that markets have been sleep walking through the tax policy risk out of the U.S.""  Holt added. Biden will likely resort to playing one or two of his two 2021 budget reconciliation cards to push taxes through if he fails to get win support from GOP senators. But while that ""could still cost Biden in the November 2022 mid-terms … he may be thinking he'd better get it all done sooner than later."" 
Energy, meanwhile, fell more than 2% but is set to end week higher amid gains earlier this week as investors expect oil prices to continue their advance.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) fell 3% after the SEC reportedly launched an investigation into how the oil major valued a key asset in the oil rich Permian Basin, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In other news,   Poshmark  (NASDAQ:POSH) gave up some of its public-debut gains from a day earlier, falling 16%, but remained above its IPO price of $42 per share."

Investing.com --   Exxon Mobil dropped more than 3% after The Wall Street Journal reported the company is being investigated for overvaluing property. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated the investigation after an employee filed a whistleblower complaint last fall alleging Exxon (NYSE:XOM) overvalued a key asset in the Permian Basin, one of its most important oil and gas properties, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Several people involved in valuing the asset complained during an internal assessment in 2019 that employees were being forced to use unrealistic assumptions about how quickly the company could drill wells there to arrive at a higher value, according to a copy of the complaint reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
At least one of the employees who complained was fired last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The SEC and Exxon declined to comment.  Demand for oil has plummeted since measures to stem the spread of Covid-19 closed businesses, schools and workplaces around the world for months on end. Although vaccines are now being distributed worldwide, infections and deaths resulting from the virus are surging, and cities and countries around the world remain locked down.
Exxon's revenue dropped by $20 billion to $46 billion the most recent quarter compared to a year earlier, according to data compiled by Investing.com. The company also reported a loss per share of 18 cents in the quarter, versus a profit of 68 cents per share a year earlier.

The retail group said holiday sales, including e-commerce, grew to $789.4 billion, beating it's forecast of between 3.6% and 5.2% growth. 
The sales jump last year was more than double the 3.5% average holiday growth over the previous five years, including 2019's 4% gain, NRF said.
""The promise of a new round of stimulus checks after a deal was struck before Christmas helped increase consumer confidence,"" NRF Chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said. 
Kleinhenz noted that Americans were able to spend more on gifts this year as they had saved more money from the stimulus checks on account of not being able to travel or eat out due to the lockdown restrictions.
Online and other non-store sales for the festive period were up 23.9% at $209 billion.
Consumers took advantage of curbside pickups and quick in-store trips as a bulk of gifts and other holiday-related items were bought during the third and fourth weeks of December, when it became late to expect deliveries of online purchases by Christmas, the NRF said.

Bernstein named it a top pick in 2021, even after a stellar 2020, when it grew almost 400% thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic that kept us all at home and working and studying via the service. Shares are up about 1%.
The firm named it a high conviction top pick and said it saw strong growth in 2021, CNBC Pro reported.
“Zoom Phone should contribute substantial revenue in a shorter time frame than many investors expect,"" Bernstein wrote in a note. ""The ~500k new Phone users added in the last 6 months is roughly double the run rate of additions in the prior year.”
Zoom Phone places the company in rivalry against a crowded enterprise telephony service industry, which includes RingCentral (NYSE:RNG), Vonage and Avaya.
Revenue for the quarter ended in October came in at $777 million, up from $166 million in the same period a year earlier. Profit rose from 9 cents per share to 99 cents per share in that time. 
Vaccines against the coronavirus have begun to be distributed around the world, but working from home is being seen as a permanent change, helping companies to lower costs and allowing working parents to spend more time with their children (whether or not they want to is another question).
The company has nine buy ratings, 12 holds and one sell, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Not that Zoom comes cheap. The forward price to earnings ratio for the stock is 129 times. That compares to Vonage's 81 times, Avaya's 5 times and RingCentral's 347 times.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo records rare profit beat as credit costs fall,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co posted a small rise in quarterly profit on Friday that beat Wall Street estimates, as stabilizing credit costs helped buffer historic near-zero interest rates meant to prop up the ailing economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The country's fourth-largest bank, which has been plagued by hefty costs tied to litigation over the past several years, reported a drop in overall fourth-quarter expenses. But costs are still high due to a sales practices scandal that has haunted it since 2016. 
Wells Fargo paid $321 million in customer remediation costs in the quarter, despite bank executives repeatedly signaling that the worst of the fallout, which has cost it billions, is in the past.
The company also took $781 million in restructuring charges as Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf takes tough measures to shift fortunes at the bank that he joined in 2019.
Scharf has targeted $10 billion in savings annually over the long term. The bank has also been offloading assets, including a possible sale of its asset management business to a private equity consortium. 
Wells Fargo was once seen as the crème de la crème of U.S. banks: it avoided the kind of problems that Wall Street rivals encountered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
But it has operated under a dark cloud since 2016, when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets. 
There have been revelations about other customer abuses, and Wells Fargo has been unable to shake the damage caused by all the blunders.
""Our results continued to be impacted by the unprecedented operating environment and the required work to put our substantial legacy issues behind us,"" Scharf said in a statement.
Wells Fargo is also constrained by growth restrictions the U.S. Federal Reserve placed on its balance sheet as punishment for the sales abuses.
""There's no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment,"" Scharf said about the asset cap it operates under.
Because the bank does not have a large capital markets business like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) or  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) - which also reported results on Friday - it has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low interest rates.
Total revenue fell 10% to $17.93 billion, missing average analyst estimates, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Net-interest income fell 17% to $9.28 billion in the quarter.
Shares of Wells Fargo were down more than 7% in morning trade after the bank warned 2021 net interest income would be flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion.
DEPOSITS LAG
Deposit growth has boomed across the industry as cautious consumers and companies save more and spend less during the pandemic. Wells Fargo added deposits at a much slower rate compared to peers. 
Total deposits rose 4%, compared with a 20% jump at Citigroup and a 35% rise at JPMorgan.
The bank did manage some bright spots. It reported net income of $2.99 billion, or 64 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $2.87 billion, or 60 cents per share a year earlier.
Analysts had expected a profit of 60 cents on average. The bank missed estimates in the first three quarters of last year.
Costs pegged to bad loans fell $823 million compared to last year and remained far below the level seen in the first half of the year when the bank racked up more than $14 billion in provision expenses. 

Wells Fargo said it expects total 2021 expenses of about $53 billion excluding one-off charges.

Investing.com --  Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) slumped 5% after getting downgraded at Citi.
The firm bumped the audio streaming service to sell from neutral on concerns about its pivot to podcasts, according to CNBC Pro. 
“Among four subscription based stocks – Spotify,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and SiriusXM – Spotify is the only firm where the Street’s long-term forecasts (through 2023) do not comport to the prevailing valuation,"" Citi said. ""We suspect this disconnect stems from recent enthusiasm around Spotify’s recent podcast pivot.”
Shares of Spotify have about doubled since going public in 2018.
“The cadence of Premium gross additions (through 3Q20) and app download data (through 4Q20) do not show any material benefit from recent podcast investments (that began in 2019),” CNBC Pro reported Citi as saying in a note. 
Spotify acquired podcast companies Gimlet Media, Anchor and Parcast about two years ago, as well as sports and entertainment news companies The Ringer and Megaphone. It also has exclusive rights to stream celebrity podcasts, including those from Kim Kardashian West, Michelle Obama and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, CNBC Pro reported.  
“If we were to see a material positive inflection in app downloads or Premium subs (from higher gross adds or materially lower churn), we would alter our view,” Citi said. “But, our fear is that if podcasting doesn’t provide a way for Spotify to shift away from music label dependence, the Street may reassess the underlying value of the business. And, that would be bad for Spotify’s multiple and equity value.”
Spotify has also struggled to produce consistent profits, with losses per share outweighing gains, according to data compiled by Investing.com. That said, revenue has been inching higher over the quarters, and is expected to bust through $2 billion for the three months ended in December. 
Spotify is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 3.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",JPMorgan trims loan reserves on hopes for recovery,"By Anirban Sen and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as it released some of the cash it had built up against coronavirus-driven loan losses, although the bank cautioned that demand for loans was likely to remain sluggish this year.
For most of last year, Main Street lenders were grappling with the economic fallout of the pandemic, setting aside tens of billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults by struggling businesses and households.
But speedy vaccine deployments and nearly $2 trillion in stimulus have raised hopes of a recovery from one of the worst downturn in decades, prompting banks to start unwinding some of their massive loan loss reserves.
""You will have a better economy in the second half [of the year] because we have the vaccine coming, we have fiscal stimulus and people have saved up a lot of money,"" JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said.
""There will be a lot of pent-up demand and, hopefully, optimism because of the fact that we are getting through this mess. By sometime this summer you could have a very healthy economy.""
JPMorgan CFO Jennifer Piepszak said the bank had the ability to repurchase up to $4.5 billion of stock in the first quarter, according to regulatory income-based limits on capital reductions.
The pandemic has also caused a plunge in short and long-term interest rates that hurt interest income, but the Wall Street arms of the biggest banks have benefited from volatility in global financial markets, a rush for stock market listings and emergency corporate fundraising.
JPMorgan's net income rose 42% to $12.1 billion, or $3.79 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue rose 3% to $30.2 billion. During the quarter, it released credit reserves of $2.9 billion, adding 72 cents to its earnings per share.
Excluding the reserves, the bank reported net income of $9.9 billion, or $3.07 per share, which was well ahead of the average Wall Street estimate of $2.62 per share, according to Refinitiv.
About 70% of JPMorgan's beat came from reserve releases and much of the benefit was already priced into its stock, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr estimated.
Analysts called the results solid, considering low interest rates and business challenges during the pandemic. ""These were strong results and the economic outlook is improving,"" Schorr wrote in a note to clients.
In the latest quarter, JPMorgan's numbers also received a boost from continued strength in its trading and investment banking units.
Investment banking revenue surged 37% to $2.5 billion, driven by higher advisory fees across all its products. Trading revenue rose 20% to $5.9 billion.
Looking forward, JPMorgan said in a slide presentation to analysts that it expects its non-interest expenses to go up in 2021 to about $68 billion from $65.5 billion, as it makes another $1.5 billion of investments in its business and spends another $900 million on its technology.
The spending plan continues JPMorgan's practice of using its financial heft as the biggest U.S. bank to expand its business and take market share from other lenders as it fights to hold off non-bank competitors.
NOTE OF CAUTION
Still, JPMorgan chief Dimon warned of ""significant near-term uncertainty"" and said the reserve takedown did not represent ""core or recurring profits"", while other top executives warned that comparisons with 2020 will be ""challenging,"" due to a record performance from markets during the year. 
Shares of JPMorgan,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, which had seen a strong rally in the run-up to earnings, were all down in early trading even as they reported better-than-expected profits.
Near-zero Federal Reserve interest rates led to a record reduction in net interest margins in 2020 - the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay out to depositors.
JPMorgan's net interest income fell 7% to $13.4 billion.
Interest metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets.
The bank's other reporting lines held up well during the quarter. Three of JPMorgan's four operating units reported higher revenue, with the consumer & community banking unit recording an 8% decline.

Trading revenue surged as the bank benefited from volatility in financial markets with investors reassessing their portfolios at the end of the year.

534,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Goldman Sees Congress Approving $1.1 Trillion in Near-Term Aid,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). raised its forecast for the amount of near-term stimulus Congress will approve after President-elect Joe Biden unveiled his plan Thursday, though kept it well short of the proposed $1.9 trillion package.
The bank’s new projection of $1.1 trillion, up from a previous forecast of $750 billion, reflects more spending on education and public health, along with unemployment insurance and other programs, analyst Alec Phillips wrote in a note late Thursday.
The aid is likely to be approved between mid-February and mid-March, but the timing depends on factors such as Donald Trump’s impeachment trial and the extent to which Democrats decide to use the so-called budget reconciliation process, Phillips said. With the Senate split 50-50 along party lines and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote, that would require a simple majority instead of 60 votes -- but would take longer to negotiate.
“We do not expect 10 Republicans to support a $1.9 trillion relief package,” Phillips wrote.
Goldman’s $1.1 trillion forecast includes $200 billion in funding for state and local governments, compared with the $370 billion proposed by Biden. Some Republicans had backed $160 billion in a bipartisan proposal last month.
The bank is also assuming $300 billion to fund $1,400 stimulus payments and a child tax credit -- versus $450 billion in Biden’s plan. It expects Congress will back $100 billion in coronavirus containment funding, against the $160 billion that the incoming president is seeking.
Goldman also sees $50 billion in “other” spending as part of the approved aid, a fraction of the $285 billion proposed by the president-elect.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc filed a petition with U.S. auto safety regulators saying that 612,000 vehicles produced since 2012 do not fully comply with federal safety standards because displays can be switched from miles per hour to only metric measurements, documents released on Friday show.
The automaker asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to declare the noncompliance issue inconsequential to safety, according to the agency's filing.
Tesla said it corrected the issue in production in September and that more than 75% percent of the affected U.S. vehicles have accepted the firmware update released in September.
Tesla said if vehicles are set to only display to kilometers, all functions tied to speed limit like Traffic Aware Cruise Control and Speed Assist will ""convert mapped data from mph to km/h, resulting in the vehicle speed automatically matching the appropriate speed limit.""
Tesla added that vehicle operators can change the display back to miles per hour, saying the option is ""easily located in the display menu and is not buried in sub-menus.""
Tesla said it has not received any reports of crashes related to this issue and noted that NHTSA granted two petitions for inconsequential treatment involving speedometer unit display noncompliance to Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) in July and BMW in 2015.

538,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 09:43AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mostly Lower After Retail Sales Drop; Dow Down 175 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened mostly lower on Friday after a second straight monthly drop in retail sales underlined the loss of momentum in the economy due to record Covid-19 infections around the turn of the year. 
The mood wasn't helped much by an opening salvo of bank earnings that looked strong at first sight, but which belied a slowdown in lending trend, or by news of an SEC investigation into ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) amid doubts over the accounting for one of its most valuable assets.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 174 points, or 0.6% at 30,817 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite was just staying in positive territory.
Earlier, the Commerce Department had reported that retail sales dropped 0.7% in December, and also revised down November's figure to a 1.4% drop, rather than the 1.1% originally reported. The figures were a fresh reminder of the pressure on the retail sector from a pandemic which spread rapidly at the end of last year in the aftermath of the election and, in particular, the Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. infection rates and hospital admissions are only now starting to flatten off, while the number of daily deaths involving Covid is still running at nearly 4,000.
Producer price inflation for December and the New York Manufacturing Index for January also came in slightly below expectations. 
The flurry of bank earnings that traditionally marks the start of earnings season got a muted response, despite headline numbers that were at first glance stronger than expected. However, the numbers presented by  JPMorgan,  Citigroup  and  Wells Fargo  were all bolstered by the release of credit provisions booked earlier in the pandemic, which JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned didn't represent underlying trends. Revenue, which provides a better idea of ongoing dynamics, fell short of expectations at both Citi and Wells, and was not meaningfully above consensus at either JPMorgan or PNC Financial. 
Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock fell 7.6% on the back of its report, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) stock fell 4.1% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock escaped with a relatively moderate 1.3% decline. PNC (NYSE:PNC) stock fell 1.7%. The bank earnings are typically taken as a proxy for the broader health of the U.S. economy, and their ability to withstand a hard buffeting from Covid-19 last year was one of the fundamental supports of the broader market rally. 
Elsewhere, ExxonMobil stock fell 4.8% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Securities and Exchanges Commission had opened an investigation into its accounting practises, after a whistleblower alleged that employees had been forced to make aggressive assumptions on how quickly it could drill wells at its fields in the Permian Basin in Texas, in order to justify the high valuation the company wanted to assign to the assets.
Exxon's decline went hand-in-hand with a 2% drop in Crude Oil Futures. Both had become susceptible to profit-taking after a sharp rally in the last week on optimism over the path of U.S. and global oil demand under the influence of heavy U.S. fiscal and monetary stimulus. The spending plans announced by President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday had little effect, however, having been already largely priced in.

The move by Amazon Web Services (AWS) comes as Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's conservative government has stepped up efforts to attract foreign investment and draw high tech companies to Greece.
""We have seen increased customer adoption of AWS in the country and decided to open an office in Athens to better support new customers,"" Przemek Szuder, the head of AWS operations in central and eastern Europe said in a statement.
No financial details were disclosed.
AWS already provides cloud computing services to companies and organisations in Greece including telecoms group Wind Hellas, PAOK FC, one of Greece's top football clubs, and a number of public sector organisations, the group said.
It said services covered areas from big data analytics and mobile, web and social media applications to enterprise business applications and the internet of things.

Several people involved in valuing the asset, during an internal assessment in 2019, said employees were being forced to use unrealistic assumptions about how quickly the company could drill wells there to arrive at a higher value, the report said. (https://on.wsj.com/2LzpVjX)
The SEC began investigating the claims after receiving the complaint, and at least one of the employees who complained was fired last year, WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Exxon and SEC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for a comment.
The Journal in September reported that there had been internal disagreements over the valuation. 
Some Exxon managers in 2018 had initially pegged the net present value of the Delaware Basin in Permian at about $60 billion. But a few employees involved in Exxon's annual development planning estimated the value was closer to $40 billion during the summer of 2019, WSJ said. 
The largest U.S. oil producer has posted losses in the first three quarters of 2020 on an ill-timed spending increase that collided with a downturn in fuel demand and prices. To cope, the company has cut employees and project spending.
Last month, Exxon also signaled an up to $20 billion writedown, mostly related to its natural gas properties.

Exxon shares were down 3.4% at $48.62 in premarket trading.

Citi released $1.5 billion from previously-booked loan loss reserves, after bolstering them by over $10 billion earlier in the pandemic. The relative resilience of the U.S. economy and the various safety nets provided by the Federal Government and Federal Reserve have all helped to avert Wall Street's worst case scenario for Main Street.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>",Earnings season to test surge in regional banks stocks,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A blistering rally in the shares of regional banks may be tested when a spate of lenders report results in the coming week. 
Regional banks in the S&P 500 have surged 11% since the beginning of the year, beating out the gains in larger, more diversified banks by about a percentage point over the same period. Both regional and diversified banks are running well ahead of the benchmark S&P 500, buoyed by a rise in Treasury yields to their highest levels since the pandemic began on expectations that additional fiscal stimulus will spur economic growth. 
Smaller banks often outperform during the early stages of an economic recovery because their earnings and revenues are more reliant on the products affected by higher Treasury yields than their larger competitors, which more often have additional revenue streams such as trading or capital markets divisions. 
Upcoming earnings reports will show if that trend holds this time around. Much of the pain from COVID-19-fueled lockdowns has fallen on the smaller businesses and low-to-middle income consumers that are more likely to be customers of regional banks, said Ian Lapey, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Global Financial Services Fund. 
""The large banks with the large customers are in better shape across the board"" because of their greater access to credit markets and investment banking income, he said. This year ""is going to be a challenging year for regional banks. Interest rates have moved up but they're still very low and unemployment is still high and won't recover quickly even with the vaccine."" 
As a result, Lapey is only holding regional banks with ""pristine credit quality"" such as Webster Financial (NYSE:WBS) Corp and First Citizens Bancshares Inc, both of which are up more than 10% since the start of the year. 
Regional banks, including Zions Bancorp, First Midwest Bancorp (NASDAQ:FMBI) and  United Community Banks  (NASDAQ:UCBI) Inc, are expected to report their quarterly results on Tuesday. 
Overall, larger banks will grow earnings by an average of 112% in the coming year while regional banks will grow their earnings by an average of 33%, said Dick Manuel, an equity research analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. 
That trend will continue into the following year as well, with larger banks posting an average 29% earnings growth between 2021 and 2022 while regional banks post average earnings growth of 13%, he said. 
At the same time, larger banks are trading at 11.5 times their anticipated 2022 earnings on average, compared with an average 13.3 times 2022 earnings multiple among the largest regional banks, Manuel said. 
David Ellison, a portfolio manager who runs two financial funds at Hennessy Funds, sees little value in regional banks at a time when online lenders such as SoFi, PayPal and Square are poised to eat into their customer base for personal and small business loans. 
""The reality is that these franchises are losing value at a faster rate because technology platforms are out there making loans electronically,"" he said. ""Kids are entering the banking system today through Robinhood or Venmo or SoFi, they're not going down to the regional bank in their town."" 
As a result, he is focusing his exposure on regional banks that are either poised to takeover their competitors or be acquired by a rival. 
""The opportunity in the space is not an earnings recovery because they never really went down,"" he said. ""The opportunity is consolidation.""

545,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 07:03AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Beats Forecasts in Q4, Helped by Investment Bank Strength","Investing.com - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) ended 2020 on a high note, handily beating consensus forecasts for fourth-quarter earnings  as the bank released previously booked credit provisions, while its investment bank made hay amid the recovery in global markets at the end of the year.
Net income rose to $12.1 billion, or $3.79 a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $8.5 billion, or $2.57/share, 12 months ago, the last quarter to be unaffected by the pandemic.
The results were inflated by the release of another $2.9 billion in credit provisions, which added $1.89 billion to the bottom line. The bank had released a net $611 million in provisions in the third quarter after taking a huge initial hit of some $8 billion at the start of the pandemic.
""We do not consider the reserve takedown of $2.9 billion to represent core or recurring profits,"" chief executive Jamie Dimon warned. ""Essentially reserve calculations, while done extremely diligently and carefully, now involve multiple, multi-year hypothetical probability-adjusted scenarios, which may or may not occur and which can be expected to introduce quarterly volatility in our reserves.""
The bank's revenue rose 3% to $30.2 billion: Noninterest revenue surged 13% to $16.8 billion, driven by trading gains and investment bank fees that were helped by a fourth quarter full of initial public offerings. That offset a 7% drop in revenue from the group's core lending business. Interest income from consumer and business lending fell 14% from a year earlier, while income from credit card and auto loans fell 7%. 
JPMorgan shares are up 11% from the beginning of the year, and down just 1.1% from their 52-week high of $142.73 set on January 14. They are outperforming the S&P 500 which is up 1.1% from the start of the year. By 8 AM ET, JPMorgan shares were down 0.4% in premarket trading.
As a result of another quarter of solid profits, the bank's core tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, finished the year at 13.1%, up from 12.4% at the end of 2019. JPMorgan has signaled it will make immediate use of the Federal Reserve's authorization to resume dividend payments and stock buybacks. I
(CORRECTION: The original version of this story misstated the credit provisions figure. This has now been amended.)
PNC Financial also beat expectations on Friday with fourth-quarter EPS of $3.26 on revenue of $4.21 billion, compared to forecast for EPS of $2.59 on revenue of $4.13 billion.

BMW also said that including plug-in hybrids, it aims for a 50% increase in sales of electrified vehicles versus 2020.
It did not give sales volumes for its fully electric vehicles but in 2020 data released on Tuesday BMW said it sold close to 193,000 electrified vehicles - fully electric and plug-in hybrid - last year.
Tesla delivered just under 500,000 vehicles, all fully electric, to customers in 2020.
The BMW Group currently produces 13 electrified models - either fully electric or plug-in hybrid - sold in 74 markets. 
BMW said on Tuesday that its global EV sales rose 31.8% in 2020 and accounted for 15% of its sales in Europe, helping the company meet its European Union emissions targets for last year.
By 2023, BMW said it would almost double its line-up of electrified vehicles to 25 models, with more than half of them fully electric.
As well as emissions targets, a growing number of countries will ban the sale of new fossil-fuel vehicles starting in 2030, adding pressure on carmakers to develop electric vehicles.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Friday, as investors bank recent gains after President-elect Joe Biden unveiled his new fiscal stimulus package and with the earnings season starting.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 114 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 25 points, or 0.2%. 
Incoming President Joe Biden outlined details late Thursday of his new proposal to boost an economy devastated by the coronavirus outbreak. The offering totalled $1.9 trillion, and involved additional federal unemployment payments, direct payments of $1,400, as well as increased aid to states and Covid testing and vaccination programs.
A bill of this approximate size had been expected for weeks, especially when the Democrats took control of the Senate after winning two runoffs in Georgia, and had been a prime driver of the stock market gains so far this year.
U.S. equity funds saw inflows of $2.2 billion in the week ended Wednesday, according to data from financial services firm Lipper.
The main indices are currently on course for their first losing week in five, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still up around 1.3% year-to-date, the S&P 500 up 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.7%.
The earnings season kicks off in earnest Friday, with the big banks first up. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) release their numbers early Friday, with healthy trading numbers expected to offset a drop in net income. 
There are a substantial number of economic releases due Friday, with the December retail sales figure, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), the highlight. This figure will be watched closely to see if holiday shopping picked up late in the month after November's 1.1% decline.
Other releases include Empire manufacturing, producer prices and the University of Michigan Sentiment index.
Oil prices weakened Friday amid concerns about a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s largest crude importer, with the country reporting the highest number of daily cases in more than 10 months on Friday. 
That said, both crude benchmarks remain well above $50 a barrel, not far removed from 10-month highs, helped by additional fiscal stimulus, Covid-19 vaccine breakthroughs and a recent pledge by Saudi Arabia to deepen output cuts.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% lower at $52.94 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.5% to $55.55. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,845.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.2123.

550,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Buy the Rumor, Sell the Fact as Virus Chills Stimulus Cheer","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are ending the week in downbeat mood, the reality of Joe Biden’s stimulus plans not enough to offset concerns about the new advance of the Covid-19 virus at the start of the year. 
By mid-morning in London, the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was down 0.4% at 410.38, while the German DAX was down 0.4% and the U.K. FTSE 100 and French CAC 40 were both down 0.6%.  
In contrast to U.S. indices, the Stoxx 600 is still below its pre-pandemic high, with only the Stoxx Technology subindex posting all-time highs this year. It was among the strongest performers again on Friday, after SAP posted better-than-expected preliminary results for the fourth quarter overnight. Aveva, a smaller U.K. software provider, also chalked up an impressive 26% gain in currency-adjusted revenue. Aveva (LON:AVV) stock rose 5.8% while SAP  (DE:SAPG) stock eked out a 0.8% gain.
The President-elect’s $1.9 trillion plan to support the U.S. economy had been the chief supporting factor for risk assets for over a week, and there was little in it at first glance that had not already been fully discounted.
""Realistically, it will be a stimulus that hits the second quarter, rather than the first, as Congress is not going to pass this at once, and almost certainly will not pass the proposals as they stand,” said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management in a morning podcast.
Donovan argued that the support for state and local governments and the minimum wage increase in the package are both likely to arouse significant opposition from Republican Senators. The 50-50 split in the upper chamber leaves many elements of the package exposed to the risk of filibusters unless bipartisan support can be secured – something that may be less likely given the deep divide between the two parties over the recent actions of outgoing President Donald Trump.
However, none of this is particularly new. What is new is the increasing number of those starting to express doubt in the narrative that the rollout of vaccines will essentially end the pandemic by the middle of the year. Fresh mutations of the virus, slow distribution of vaccines and scattered evidence of problems regarding their effectiveness are all adding to concerns.
In Germany, deaths from Covid-19 are at record highs. Across much of Europe, notably the U.K., public healthcare systems are being stretched beyond the extremes of last spring. Germany looks like following the U.K. in extending lockdown restrictions through the end of the first quarter. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) mobility data show a clear drop in activity all across the continent at the start of the new year.
Further afield, China has now locked down nearly 30 million people to contain a new outbreak. Most worryingly of all, the disease is ravaging parts of Brazil – notably the state of Amazonas around Manaus, which was widely thought to have achieved herd immunity after a severe initial outbreak last year. The city is registering five times its usual daily death rate amid reports that hospitals have run out of oxygen for patients needing ventilation. Amazonas has appealed to the United States to send a military transport plane with oxygen cylinders, Brazil’s Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on Thursday."

The court said it had decided to discontinue the proceedings as the expected sentence in another case, in which Winterkorn faces charges for his role in allowing diesel cars with excessive pollution levels to hit the road, was higher.
""In this context, the conviction for market manipulation would not lead to a significant increase in the overall sentence,"" the court said in a statement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - From cancelled hotel bookings ahead of the Lunar New Year to steel piled up at mills because of transport curbs in Hebei province, China's battle against a new wave of COVID-19 infections clouds what has been a dramatic economic recovery.
New cases in China are at 10-month highs, prompting the lockdown of 28 million people in two provinces, disrupting logistics and industrial activity, with millions expected to scrap holiday travel plans in a blow to China's efforts to get consumption back on track.
China's economy plunged an unprecedented 6.8% in the first quarter last year. 
Thanks partly to surging global demand for Chinese-made electronics and gear to protect from coronavirus, China looks set to be the only major economy to expand in 2020, with growth expected at 2.1%.
Given the limited geographic spread of the outbreaks and improved testing and containment, economists do not expect anything approaching a repeat of what happened in the first quarter of last year, when the emergence of the coronavirus resulting in the world's second largest economy contracting by 6.8%.
Manufacturing and export demand remain robust. But economists say consumption, which typically accounts for more than half of the economy and has lagged the wider recovery, may take a hit.
Authorities have urged people not to travel for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which starts Feb. 11 and is typically a time to spend on travel, food and gifts.
""The worsening coronavirus situation will impact economic activity, and markets may need to temper their expectations for strong pent-up consumption demand in the coming LNY holidays,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note this week.
The outbreak and social distancing measures ""add conviction"" to Nomura's forecast that policymakers will moderate moves to ease stimulus and slow credit growth, and delay rate hikes into 2022, it said.
But Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said there may be an economic upside.
""One reason many manufacturers have been quick to participate in official efforts to discourage travel is that it would allow them to keep factories running over the holiday,"" he wrote in a Friday note.
TRANSPORT TROUBLES
In the steelmaking powerhouse Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing and has seen cities locked down to contain the outbreak, steel inventories have jumped 11% this year, according to data from consultancy Mysteel, with industry sources blaming transport restrictions.
In the Hebei city of Tangshan more than one-third of steel mills have coke supplies of fewer than seven days, which suggests supply shortages, and weekly blast furnace capacity utilization rates fell this week by 1.7% from last week and by 7% from a year earlier, Mysteel data shows.
""The COVID situation may not improve quickly, but the impact will not be as big as in last year's Lunar New Year,"" said Zhang Yiping, economist at China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen.
CANCELLED PARTIES 
Consumption in China was slower to recover than factory output or investment, although retail sales recorded the fourth straight month of year-on-year growth in November.
Gubei Watertown, a tourist site at the foot of China's Great Wall, has suffered cancellations of 8,900 room bookings as well as numerous year-end conferences, Chen Xianghong, president of Wuzhen Tourism Co Ltd, one of its owners, said on the Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) site on Thursday. 
""We can't close, but keeping open is loss-making,"" he said.
Many companies which would ordinarily be holding parties are cancelling events, while cities have advised couples to delay wedding banquets.
Liquor giant Kweichow Moutai, based in Renhuai in Guizhou province, told employees to stay put.
""All employees are not allowed to leave Renhuai, participate in gatherings, or visit public areas such as karaoke outlets, bars or internet cafes,"" according to a notice to staff reported by state media this week.

U.S.-based taxable bond funds drew $9 billion, the fourth straight weekly inflow, while $5.9 billion flowed into money market funds, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
Other significant allocation milestones included the largest weekly inflow into financial/banking sector funds since 2008. The $3.6 billion that moved into financials was the 11th straight inflow and the third largest in Lipper's records dating to 1992, coming as the S&P 500 financials index reached record highs.

International equity funds attracted $3.9 billion, the biggest weekly inflow since February 2013, according to Lipper.

555,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Wall Street cheers on Biden stimulus plan but worries about the cost,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief stimulus package from President-elect Joe Biden may prove a double-edged sword for investors, sustaining optimism for further economic revival while raising worries over how the United States will pay for it all.
The stimulus package, unveiled by Biden on Thursday, has been widely anticipated by Wall Street and has helped lift the broad S&P 500 index nearly 3% in the week since Democratic challengers won both of Georgia's U.S. Senate seats, giving Democrats full control of Congress.
Yet those moves have been mirrored by a slide in Treasuries, due in part to expectations that the government will need to fund the spending with more debt issuance, pushing yields of benchmark 10-year notes to their highest levels since early March and nudging borrowing costs throughout the economy higher. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
""Right now markets are celebrating the additional stimulus and see it as a stronger bridge to a fully reopened economy,"" said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
""On the other side of it there's the chance that markets will have to pay for this in the form of sharply higher interest rates or tax hikes that could cap equity valuations,"" he said.
Stock valuations are already concerning some investors, who worry that earnings will have to be exceptionally strong in the coming year to justify the lofty multiples. The S&P 500 is trading at 22.3 times forward earnings estimates, near its all-time high of 24.4 from March 2000, according to FactSet.
The S&P 500 dipped nearly 0.4% on Thursday, and is up approximately 1.1% since the start of January. The year's rally has been led largely by cyclical stocks that benefit from a stimulus package, including banks, which are up over 10% for the year to date.
Meanwhile, last year's winners such as the technology sector are down nearly 1% over the same time. Rising yields threaten to weigh on the companies with longer-duration cash flows such as tech and growth shares.
SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUT
Biden's plan to stimulate the economy through a rescue package comes at a time when a surge in coronavirus cases is forcing companies and investors to pare back their estimates for how soon the pandemic will end.
Initial unemployment claims rose to 965,000 last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday, their highest levels since August and well above the 795,000 anticipated by economists polled by Reuters. Overall, job losses in December fell for the first time in eight months.
Rising bond yields, meanwhile, are spurring concerns of looming inflation once the economy begins to recover. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech on Thursday he does not expect the central bank to begin trimming its monthly bond purchases ""too early.""
""Now is not the time to be talking about exit,"" he said.
Biden's expected stimulus plan is ""in line with what the market expected,"" and will likely be followed by additional packages focused on infrastructure spending and other priorities, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives, Schwab Center for Financial Research.
The underwhelming pace of coronavirus immunizations in the United States is delaying economic reopening and increasing the need for more stimulus measures, though corporations and investors will likely face higher tax rates later in the year as a result of the extra spending, Frederick said.
""The vaccine rollout has been slower than expected just about everywhere,"" he said.
Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, said she expects the equity market to stumble later this year as investors start to price in the possibility of higher corporate and individual tax rates that the new administration may push through.

""There's a necessity today that overrides the long-term concern,"" she said. ""There is a worry about inflation coming but I don't see it happening soon.""

556,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>",Britain denies wanting to reduce workers' rights post-Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Friday it had no plans to lower standards on workers' rights, rejecting a Financial Times report that a shake-up of EU labour regulations as part of a post-Brexit overhaul was in the works.
The FT reported https://www.ft.com/content/55588f86-a4f8-4cf3-aecb-38723b787569 on Thursday that the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy was proposing changes focused on ending the 48-hour working week, rules around rest breaks, and not including overtime pay when calculating some holiday pay entitlements, citing people familiar with the plans.
The measures were being prepared with Downing Street's approval but have not yet been agreed by ministers or put to the cabinet, the FT said.
In response, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government wanted to build up workers' rights. 
""We want to protect and enhance workers' rights going forward, not row back on them,"" Kwarteng said in a tweet.
A government spokeswoman added: ""We have absolutely no intention of lowering the standards of workers' rights.""
""The UK has one of the best workers' rights records in the world, and it is well known that the UK goes further than the EU in many areas. Leaving the EU allows us to continue to be a standard setter and protect and enhance UK workers' rights.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to use Britain's exit from the European Union and the end of what many in the ruling Conservative Party believe to be the bloc's restrictive rules to benefit business growth.
The government is having discussions with businesses in a wide-range of sectors to try to gauge how to use what it calls its new freedoms from the EU to boost growth.
But many opposition lawmakers and trade unions fear the government will use its new freedom from EU rules and regulations to diminish rights rather than build on them.
Ed Miliband, the business policy chief for the opposition Labour Party, said the government's priorities were ""out of step with the needs of workers and their families"".

""These proposals are not about cutting red tape for businesses but ripping up vital rights for workers,"" Miliband said in a statement.

""Food security is strategic for our country so that's why we don't sell a big French retailer,"" Le Maire told BFM TV. ""My answer is extremely clear: we are not in favour of the deal. The no is polite but it's a clear and final no,"" he said.
Carrefour, which acknowledged Couche-Tard's approach to discuss a combination on Wednesday, had no immediate comment on Friday.
Convenience-store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard's 20 euros per share offer for Carrefour - continental Europe's largest retailer - also raises other political considerations, as Carrefour is France's biggest private-sector employer.
Carrefour CFDT union representative Sylvain Mace told BFM business that staff were ""surprised and a bit worried"" by the offer, which raised concerns over jobs and the future management of the French retailer.
If Le Maire's opposition to the approach is to protect jobs, ""it is a positive signal"", Mace said.
UBS analysts said Carrefour shares were now pricing a low 20% probability of a deal happening.
""Clearly the forceful commentary from the French government suggests they can block the deal. Further, given this was a 'friendly' approach we doubt Couche-Tard or indeed Carrefour would challenge this directly,"" they wrote.
Separately, Credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said Couche-Tard's offer for Carrefour would be at about 6.8 times enterprise value to adjusted EBITDA, which was ""consistent"" with Couche-Tard's other large acquisitions in the past.

The benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index was little changed as of 9:56 a.m. in Johannesburg after closing at a record Thursday. Tech investor Naspers Ltd. supported the market amid a continued rally in partly owned Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. in Hong Kong. Mining giants BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) Plc and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc weighed on the gauge, giving up some of their recent gains.
Locally, traders were digesting the latest developments in South Africa’s coronavirus response, with the government announcing that the reopening of schools will be delayed by two weeks. The country is also in the second of four days of rolling power cuts after the state-owned utility reported a malfunction at a newly built plant and other operational issues.
Naspers rose 1.5%, while unit Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which holds the Cape Town-based company’s 31% stake in Tencent, gained 1.3%. The two stocks contributed the most index points to the benchmark’s daily performance. Tencent was 1.8% higher and heading to a fresh record high.
Gold stocks supported the market as bullion prices steadied while investors parsed details of the U.S. stimulus package, as well as commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that pointed to sustained monetary support. Harmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY)  gained 0.3% and Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI) Ltd. rose 0.2%.
BHP  (JO:BHPJ) dropped 0.9% and Anglo American (JO:AGLJ) fell 0.4% to be among the biggest drags on the benchmark. An index of mining stocks declined 0.4%. Luxury-goods maker Richemont slipped 1%, despite analyst rating upgrades from HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) and Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Bank stocks were weaker as the rand retreated against the dollar. An index of lenders slid for a third day, with Firstrand Ltd (JO:FSRJ) down 1% and Standard Bank Group Ltd (JO:SBKJ) falling 0.7%.
Still, the main South African stock index is up 0.6% since Monday, heading for a third successive weekly gain for the first time since August.
The surge that’s pushed the market to five record closes this month has prompted a signal that Johannesburg stocks are technically overbought for an eighth day, the longest such sequence since 2017. The 14-day relative strength index on the benchmark was above 77 on Friday, beyond the level of 70 that suggests to some analysts that the rally may be overdone.

The coronavirus continues to hit European economies hard. The U.K. reported earlier Friday that its GDP fell 2.6% in November, back to 8.5% below the levels seen in February 2020, with the service sector acting as the main drag on growth.
France announced Thursday it will bring forward its night curfew by two hours for at least a fortnight, while Germany’s government is weighing up tougher lockdown restrictions as countries throughout the continent try to slow the spread of the virus.
Italy, the euro-zone’s third-biggest economy, is not only suffering from a resurgent coronavirus outbreak but also a deepening political crisis, after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi pulled his Italia Viva party out of the ruling coalition government, denying it a majority in parliament. 
These woes have overshadowed U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s overnight proposal of a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to support the world's largest economy. The bill had been widely expected, especially after the Democrats won control of the Senate in early January as well as holding the House of Representatives.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Friday, with investors weighing increased Covid-related restrictions with the announcement of additional U.S. stimulus.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
Overnight U.S. President-elect Joe Biden proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to boost the world's largest economy, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.
His proposal included increasing the additional federal unemployment payments, direct payments to many Americans, more aid to state and local governments and additional funding for Covid testing and vaccination programs.
This relief bill had been widely expected, especially after the Democrats won control of the Senate in early January as well as holding the House of Representatives. 
Back in Europe, France announced Thursday it will bring forward its night curfew by two hours for at least a fortnight, while Germany’s government is weighing up tougher lockdown restrictions as countries throughout the continent try to slow the spread of the virus.
Italy, the euro-zone’s third-biggest economy, is not only suffering from a resurgent coronavirus outbreak but also a deepening political crisis, after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi pulled his Italia Viva party out of the ruling coalition government, denying it its majority in parliament. 
In corporate news, SAP (DE:SAPG) was set to open strongly after reporting a hefty rise in operating cash flow and raising its forecasts, while U.K. software group Aveva  (LON:AVV) also reported a 26% rise in currency-adjusted revenue in the fourth quarter.
Also in the U.K.  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) said it had closed a three-year investigation into suspected bribery by company executives. 
Looking at economic data, U.K. GDP fell 2.6% in November, back to 8.5% below the levels seen in February 2020, with the service sector acting as the main drag on growth, but this was not as bad as the 5.7% drop expected.  
Oil prices weakened Friday amid concerns about a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s largest crude importer, with the country reporting the highest number of daily cases in more than 10 months on Friday. This has prompted the lockdown of more than 28 million people this week, potentially hitting demand hard.
That said, both crude benchmarks remain well above $50 a barrel, not far removed from 10-month highs, helped by additional fiscal stimulus, Covid-19 vaccine breakthroughs and a recent pledge by Saudi Arabia to deepen output cuts.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $53.08 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.3% to $55.69.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 01:50AM ET</span>","Analysis: Investors resigned to Trump's China ban, with Biden seen changing little","By John McCrank, Ross Kerber and Alun John
NEW YORK/BOSTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Financial executives are settling in for the long haul over the Trump administration's investment ban on Chinese securities, expecting the rules to be lasting but hoping to have more clarity after President-elect Joe Biden takes office. 
Trump's executive order requires U.S. investors to completely divest from the securities of 44 companies deemed to be linked to the Chinese military.
Confusion over the order, which has been amended and interpreted via different guidance from separate agencies, has roiled Asian markets, led financial institutions to purge potentially affected companies from funds and asset managers to sell positions at depressed prices.
With the sanctions effectively kicking in after Biden takes office, financial professionals are waiting to see how he handles the issue, but expectations are low that he will reverse course, leaving investors worried their access to China's vast capital market and huge economy will be increasingly restricted. 
Some of the confusion stems from deep divides within the Trump administration over the approach on China, with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin seen as taking a more dovish view on Beijing but the State Department more hardline, according to current and former government officials. 
Biden officials declined to comment.
""There's unlikely to be immediate, dramatic changes, only because the current political climate will not encourage him to make changes,"" said Franklin Chu, president of Sage Capital.
That sentiment was shared by more than half-a-dozen financial professionals interviewed by Reuters.
""We are going to move forward as though this order is going to be in place for a long time,"" said a senior executive at a large U.S. trading platform, who declined to be named, as did several others, because of the topic's political nature. 
One source familiar with the views of three U.S. banks said the institutions doubt Biden will reverse, or significantly ease, the ban anytime soon.
With the coronavirus raging, the economic recovery waning, and bipartisan support for a tough approach toward China, backing down on a ban aimed at curbing Chinese military expansion is unlikely to be a priority, several executives said.
""There is very little chance the incoming Biden administration in the early days uses what political chips ithas to anything construed as being weak on China,"" said LelandMiller, CEO of U.S.-based consultancy China Beige Book.
ADMINISTRATIVE KERFUFFLE 
Confusion over the rules was evident last week when the New York Stock Exchange said it would delist three Chinese telecoms included in the order as of Jan. 11, backtracked, then made another U-turn after Mnuchin called NYSE President Stacey Cunningham to object.
The NYSE's general counsel later held a call with hundreds of market participants looking for answers on the about-face, many of whom were unsatisfied with what they heard, said a lawyer who had several clients on the call.
The NYSE declined comment.
In a bid to clarify the rules, the Treasury on Thursday issued a general license exempting U.S. securities exchanges from the investment ban for transactions with newly blacklisted Chinese companies for a full year from the date of their addition to the list. 
The rules so far have ""been perceived as pretty ad hoc andreactionary, so the industry has been forced to scramble,"" said Dan Hanson, chief investment officer of Ivy Investments of Kansas City, who hopes ""the administrative kerfuffle will be improved in the coming months."" 
Trump signed the order in November, but there was confusion over which securities were included. More securities were added to the list in December and more earlier this week. 
""I would certainly hope that there would be better guidancecoming out"" from Biden, said a U.S. stock exchange executive. 
Investors expressed relief when Chinese behemoths  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) , Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent were not added to the list, as Reuters reported was being considered, but uncertainty remains high. 
""This is forcing investors to sell now while they still can,"" said David Loevinger, a managing director at TCW Group. 
The rules have also caused confusion in Hong Kong, where a large exchange-traded fund on Wednesday resumed investing in stocks banned under the order two days after saying it would stop doing so, because neither it nor the manager of the fund,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors Asia, are ""U.S. persons."" Until there is more clarity, many investors say they will avoid anything that might get ensnared by the rules.

""It's just an area in an issue that I'd rather not be exposed to today... until we know what the ground rules are,"" said Jim Warner, managing director at  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Investment Managementin Dallas.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 01:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman eyes deals to boost Marcus - sources,"By Matt Scuffham
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is considering acquisitions to bulk up its consumer banking unit Marcus, after the Wall Street firm slowed loan and deposit growth at its fledgling business last year in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, three bank sources said.
Goldman management has put an ""extremely high"" bar for any deal to be large and transformational, the sources cautioned. One of the sources said the bank had M&A bankers crunching numbers on ""different ideas.""
Digital banking is one area of interest. The pandemic has strengthened management's belief that online activity will be central to future growth within the industry and branches will continue to have a diminished role, the source said. 
As a result, executives are ruling out any deals that involve acquiring branches. Digital businesses that bring in new customers or unique technologies would be attractive to the bank, the source said.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Building out Marcus, which is named after one of the bank's founders, is a key plank of Chief Executive David Solomon's plan to reduce Goldman's reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. To do so, Solomon wants to build businesses with predictable revenues such as consumer banking and mass-market wealth management, which most of its main rivals now have. 
In January last year, Solomon set out three- and five-year financial goals for Marcus as well as the overall profitability of the firm. The three sources said booming investment banking and trading businesses during the pandemic and cost cuts made possible by remote working have helped Goldman make significant progress on its profitability and cost-cutting goals.
However, worried about the quality of loans in the middle of a recession, executives have said they slowed loan and deposit growth at Marcus. 
When Goldman reports its fourth quarter results Tuesday, it is expected to say that loan growth at its consumer business, which includes Marcus and a credit card joint venture with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), has been slower than anticipated, the three sources said.
The bank may warn that a target it set to grow consumer loans and credit card balances to over $20 billion over five years, from $7 billion in January 2020, could take longer to achieve if the economic slowdown persists, the sources said.
It is expected to stick with a target to achieve $125 billion of deposits over the same period, anticipating that market conditions will improve, the sources said. Total deposits were $96 billion at the end of third quarter. 
Goldman plans to keep the deposit target despite regulatory restrictions in the United Kingdom and its decision to cut rates on U.S. savings accounts slowed growth dramatically in the second half of 2020, the sources said. The bank added just $4 billion of deposits in the third quarter after adding $32 billion during the first half. 
Rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) spent more than $20 billion last year acquiring discount brokerage E*Trade and investment management firm  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV).
Analysts and industry insiders have long expected Goldman to try to grow its consumer business through acquisitions, and some said the time was right for the bank to do so now. 
Last year, the bank settled long-pending corruption probes involving Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, lifting a cloud that can often keep regulators from signing off on major acquisitions. 
At the same time, regulatory sources said President-elect Joe Biden's administration may take a more restrictive stance on allowing bank deals than the Trump administration did, meaning there might be a limited window to do large banking deals. 

Moreover, the bank has excess capital following U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last year to restrict payouts.

(Reuters) - The co-founder of U.S. LNG developer Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL) said Thursday that the company is targeting this summer to begin construction of its $16.8 billion Driftwood LNG export project in Louisiana as demand for the super-cooled fuel surges worldwide.
""I hope that we will be in construction this summer,"" said Charif Souki, co-founder and executive chairman of Tellurian. ""There is a strong need for additional liquefaction capacity and we're probably the project that is the closest to starting construction.""
Demand for liquefied natural gas has soared in recent years as countries like China and India shift power generation away from dirtier coal-fired plants. In recent weeks, both prices for the fuel and shipping fees have soared due to cold weather in Asia and bottlenecked shipments at the Panama Canal.
""The level of (customer) interest has increased pretty dramatically over the past month,"" Souki said.
Over the past two years, numerous projects slated for groundbreaking in North America, including Driftwood, were delayed because customers were unwilling to sign long-term deals needed to finance the projects as natural gas prices slumped.
Coronavirus demand destruction caused gas prices in Europe and Asia to plunge to record lows below $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), while U.S. gas prices fell to their lowest in 24 years last year. 
""The system is stressed,"" Souki said, adding that global LNG demand is on track to increase by around 200 million tonnes over the next seven years. In 2020, global LNG demand hit a record high of 360 million tonnes.

The first phase of Driftwood is slated for operation in 2025, and will produce about 16.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG, equivalent to about 2.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million homes for a day.

SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares stumbled lower in afternoon trade on Friday, reversing earlier gains as rising COVID-19 cases in China reinforced investor concerns over the prospects for a global economic recovery.
European bourses were set to open lower. Pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures dropped 0.66% in early trade, while German DAX futures lost 0.65% and FTSE futures dipped 0.35%.
Earlier on Friday, an Asian regional share index had edged near record highs after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to jump-start the world's largest economy and accelerate its response to COVID-19. 
In prime-time remarks, Biden outlined a proposal that includes $415 billion aimed at the COVID-19 response, some $1 trillion in direct relief to households, and roughly $440 billion for small businesses and communities hard hit by the pandemic.
But that initial boost faded by the afternoon as risk appetite waned, lifting bond prices and the dollar, and hitting regional equities.
""When you get to these lofty levels, what does it need to take (the market) higher again?"" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at Axi. 
""Ultimately, the market has excelled itself. I'm not saying it's gotten too far over its skis, I don't think it has, but I think the expectations for economic repricing are quite dramatic ... (we're) back again to the lack of economic conviction."" 
Global stocks had initially firmed on Thursday on a report that the stimulus package could be as big as $2 trillion, much more than markets were expecting.
Biden's comments came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a dovish tone in comments at a virtual symposium with Princeton University. 
Powell said the U.S. central bank is not raising interest rates anytime soon and rejected suggestions the Fed might start reducing its bond purchases in the near term.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last down 0.59%.
Chinese blue-chips shed 0.97% amid worries over rising COVID-19 cases in China, and after the Chinese central bank drained liquidity from the country's banking system, suggesting a tightening bias in monetary policy.
More than 28 million people are under lockdown in China. On Friday it reported the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in more than 10 months.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.29% and Australia's ASX 200 was flat, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.65% after touching three-decade highs in the previous session.
The falls in Asia echoed a late dip on Wall Street on Thursday. While U.S. stocks spent most of the trading session in positive territory, helped by the stimulus hopes, concerns over the cost of the package led to a modest decline toward the end of Wall Street trade.
S&P 500 e-mini futures shed 0.61% to 3,768.
""The concern is what it's going to mean from a tax stand point,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""Spending is easy to do but the question is how are you going to pay for it? Markets often ignore politics but they don't often ignore taxes.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%, the S&P 500 lost 0.38%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.12%.
On Friday, earnings season will kick into full swing with results from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). Investors will be looking to see if banks are starting to take down credit reserves, resume buybacks, and provide guidance that shows the economy is improving, said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital in New York.
In the currency market, the U.S. dollar was flat against the yen at 103.79 and the dollar index edged 0.1% higher to 90.35.
The euro fell 0.16% to $1.2136.
U.S. yields stepped back as risk appetite waned. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yielded 1.1005%, down from a U.S. close of 1.129% on Thursday, while the 30-year yield dipped to 1.8409% from 1.874%.
Oil prices, which had risen on a weak dollar and strong Chinese import data, dropped as COVID-19 concerns in China hit sentiment.
Brent crude oil futures fell 0.83%, to $55.95 a barrel while U.S. crude lost 0.54% to $53.28.

Investing.com – Chinese smartphone manufacturer  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corporation saw its shares plunge after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration added it to a blacklist of Chinese companies with ties to the military.
Xiaomi Corp (HK:1810) plunged 12.40% to HK$28.60 ($3.69) by 12:21 AM ET (5:21 AM GMT).
The company was one of nine added to the Defense Department’s blacklist, in a final move to ratchet up pressure on China before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. State-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, Luokong Technology Corp., Gowin Semiconductor Corp., Global Tone Communication Technology Co. and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. were also among the nine to make it onto the list.
Under an executive order signed by Trump in November 2020, U.S. investors will have to unwind stakes in any company on the Defense Department list by Nov. 11, 2021.
“Ample warning has been given to the public about the material risks associated with investments” identified in Trump’s executive order, State Department’s undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment Keith Krach said on Thursday.
A Xiaomi statement said that it is not owned or controlled by the Chinese military, adding that it would take appropriate actions to protect its interests. However, the company faces being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deletion from global benchmark indexes unless it is removed from the blacklist.
China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. were all removed by MSCI Inc. during the previous week thanks to their inclusion on the list.
Co-founded by billionaire entrepreneur Lei Jun, Beijing-based Xiaomi is one of China’s more recognizable brands. Viewed as China’s answer to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., it makes electric scooters, earphones and smart rice cookers alongside its flagship smartphones. It competes with Huawei Technologies Co. for the title of China’s No. 1 mobile device brand and took grabbed market share from Huawei as U.S. sanctions on Huawei also deepened.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department added China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)), the country’s main deepwater explorer, to its own blacklist. The move follows the decision to blacklist more than 60 other Chinese companies in December 2020.
The reason for CNOOC’s inclusion in the list is its operations in the South China Sea. China’s claim of drilling rights in the area have soured relations with other countries laying claim to the body of water, including Vietnam and the Philppines."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The World Economic Forum (WEF) is aiming to attract around 1,000 delegates for its Singapore summit in late May and wants the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex to host the event, two sources familiar with the organisation's plans said.
The sources, who did not want to be identified as negotiations are ongoing, said the plans for the May 25-28 event were still fluid given the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic raging across the world. 
The WEF and Marina Bay Sands declined comment. Singapore's trade ministry did not immediately have comment.
The annual gathering of political and business leaders was moved from its usual home in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, from which it takes its informal name, to Singapore in December due to virus safety fears, organisers said.
If it goes ahead as planned, the event would be the first in-person global conference since COVID-19 started spreading widely in early 2020. The WEF's previous summit in Davos in January 2020 was one of the last, and attracted 3,000 delegates and thousands of others for side events. 
WEF is aiming for around 1,000 delegates in Singapore, the sources said, possibly up to 1,800 if conditions allow. The usual side events - which have in previous years seen the population of the Alpine town of Davos swell from 10,000 to about 30,000 - will be significantly curtailed due to the virus, the sources added.
Still, there is much uncertainty. Singapore, a Southeast Asian island nation of 5.7 million, has had its borders largely shut to visitors for almost a year, and imposed strict quarantine measures for returning residents.
The emergence of more infectious virus variants have led the city-state to impose further travel curbs on some countries in recent weeks.
WEF organisers hope attendees will be able to avoid quarantines through rigorous testing and by staying in a 'bubble' cut off from the local population. Singapore is due to start a trial of a limited version of this scheme later this month, and has also said it will consider relaxing travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers.
Alvin Tan, a senior trade ministry official, said earlier this month there would be measures to manage interactions between WEF attendees and locals, but said specific details were still being worked out.
Finding a venue for this WEF bubble, where attendees can also eat, sleep and mingle, has led the organisation to target Marina Bay Sands as potential hosts, the sources said.
Marina Bay Sands, owned by late billionaire Sheldon Adelson's  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), is the most globally recognisable building on the wealthy city-state's skyline, regularly featured on postcards and other tourist wares. 
Resembling a surfboard perched atop three towers, it has more than 2,500 rooms and suites, a casino, shops and restaurants, as well as convention and exhibition facilities that can host over 45,000 delegates.

A virus-proofed business travel facility being built at a convention centre near the airport could also be among the venues to host WEF travellers, authorities have said.

The ruling is a blow to the San Carlos Apache (NASDAQ:APA) tribe and others who have long opposed Rio's Resolution copper project, which would be built on land considered sacred. 
U.S. District Judge Steven Logan declined to issue a restraining order that would have prevented the government from publishing the environmental study as planned on Friday, a step that would start a 60-day countdown to transfer the land to Rio Tinto. 
Tribal attorneys are required, under legal statute, to discuss the restraining order request with the government, but government attorneys did not return the tribe's phone calls, the filing documents show. Because the two sides did not talk, Logan said he would not approve the restraining order. 
The judge added that even if the study is published, it does not necessarily mean the land swap will go through, although the U.S. Congress had mandated just that in 2014. The judge has set a series of hearings on the matter over the next two weeks.
Lawyers for tribal members say they are looking forward to the hearings and hope the judge will invalidate the environmental study, if it is published, or rule the 2014 act by Congress unconstitutional.
As an added defense, tribal members on Thursday filed a property lien on the land, effectively saying the government does not own the land and thus cannot give it away.

The U.S. Forest Service, which manages the land, was not immediately available to comment. Rio declined to comment.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with investors digesting U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s mega stimulus plan unveiled yesterday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.27% by 9:21 PM ET (2:21 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.84%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.25%
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.05%.
China’s Shanghai Composite gained 0.59% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.83%. Tensions with the U.S. were up as the Trump administration added  Xiaomi  (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810) and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) to its blacklist.
Smartphone maker Xiaomi was one of nine firms added to the Defense Department’s list of Chinese companies with links to the military. Another firm on the list is state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department blacklisted CNOOC., the nation’s main deepwater explorer, over the Chinese company’s drilling in disputed South China Sea waters.
Biden unveiled his “American Rescue Plan” on Thursday, which came with few surprises. The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan includes a wave of new spending, more direct payments to households, an expansion of jobless benefits and an enlargement of vaccinations and virus-testing programs.
Although Biden’s announcement pushed U.S. shares into positive territory for much of the previous session, some investors expressed concerns about the plan’s cost.
“The concern is what it’s going to mean from a tax standpoint,” Inverness Counsel chief investment strategist Tim Ghriskey told Reuters.
“Spending is easy to do but the question is how are you going to pay for it? Markets often ignore politics, but they don’t often ignore taxes,” he added.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told attendees at a Princeton University virtual symposium that the central bank will raise interest rates “no time soon”, unless they see troubling signs of inflation. Powell added that policy makers would “let the world know” well in advance of any decision to taper bond purchases, and his comments further steepened the yield curve and saw breakeven rates climb.
“The Fed wants to talk down rates, and it would be interesting if it steps in to buy long-dated securities and if the bond market breaks because of that,” Inverness Counsel’s Ghriskey said.
Earnings season is also swinging into full gear as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) announce their results later in the day. Investors will be looking to see if banks are starting to take down credit reserves, resume buybacks, and provide guidance that shows the economy is improving, Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes told Reuters.
“The markets want to see if they are showing confidence. If the guidance is strong, it shows we can sustain this move,” he added."
576,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>",GE alleges Siemens Energy used stolen trade secrets to rig contract bids,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co accused a Siemens Energy AG subsidiary of using stolen trade secrets to rig bids for lucrative contracts supplying gas turbines to public utilities, and cover up improper business gains totaling more than $1 billion, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday.
GE sued the rival company, Siemens Energy Inc, in a U.S. district court in Virginia, alleging the theft traces back to May 2019, when the industrial conglomerates bid to provide gas turbine equipment and servicing to Dominion Energy Inc. Dominion is a Virginia power utility that provides electricity to about 4 million customers on the east coast.
The suit comes in the wake of Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) spinning off its energy business to create Siemens Energy. GE alleges that Siemens Energy used trade secrets improperly received from a Dominion employee in part to win contracts that would boost the price of its initial public offering that took place in September.
Siemens identified the receipt of GE’s trade secrets “through its own robust compliance processes,” a spokesman said. Following an internal investigation, Siemens “implemented extensive remedial measures in response,” the spokesman added, such as “swift and appropriate discipline of the involved employees, including separation from the company.” 
A Dominion representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In the course of GE's bid for business with Dominion, the lawsuit alleges, a senior Dominion employee started sending to a Siemens account manager confidential business information GE had submitted. The information also included Dominion's analysis of all bids, giving Siemens a ""blueprint"" to win contracts worth up to $340 million with the utility for the business, known as the Peakers Project, GE alleged. 
The recipient of GE's trade secrets at Siemens passed the information to colleagues that included those preparing the Dominion bid, which they used to help win the business, the lawsuit said.
The Dominion employee, no longer employed there, passed the information to the Siemens manager at least half a dozen times, in some instances forwarding it from his personal email address to that of the Siemens manager's wife, the lawsuit said. The employee on the receiving end remains at Siemens, the lawsuit said.
In a bid package, GE had provided Dominion with technical specifications for four gas turbine models, pricing for different combinations of the equipment and details on how the company would service and maintain it, the lawsuit claims. Gas turbines are combustion engines that convert natural gas to energy powering generators that supply electricity to large residential and business developments. 
Siemens only alerted GE to improperly receiving the trade secrets 16 months later, in September, through what GE described as a ""nothing to see here, folks"" letter minimizing the infraction, the lawsuit alleged. 
The alert came after Siemens completed its own internal investigation and Dominion finished its own inquiry, the lawsuit claims. Dominion alerted GE to the alleged malfeasance before Siemens did, the lawsuit said. GE asked a judge to halt Siemens from using the allegedly stolen material and pay damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars or more. 
The litigation is the latest legal battle involving the corporate rivals, which have squared off in lawsuits over patent infringement as recently as last year.
The alleged theft has put GE at a disadvantage competing for upcoming contracts worth at least $120 million apiece, the lawsuit claims. GE and Siemens are competing on another Dominion bid due Jan. 19, adding urgency to resolving the theft allegations, the lawsuit said.
Since first improperly receiving the information in May 2019, Siemens has won eight other gas turbine bids over GE's competing proposals valued at more than $1 billion, the lawsuit alleges.
In most of those proposals, GE bid some of the same gas turbine models from the Dominion project, and in one case equipment with similar specifications, the lawsuit said.
According to GE, the Siemens employee receiving the trade secrets passed them to numerous colleagues, some of whom played key roles in preparing other gas turbine bids. GE lost the Dominion bid to Siemens in July 2019 without explanation, the lawsuit alleges, and Siemens employees continued to disseminate and use GE trade secrets to tailor at least two additional gas turbine proposals.
Siemens has also ""steadfastly refused"" to assure GE that documents containing the trade secrets have been destroyed, the lawsuit claims.

The Siemens spokesman said the company has removed GE’s confidential information from all its internal systems and restricted employees who received the trade secrets from working on similar bids or proposals and reassigned employees to other parts of its business.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","Google closes Fitbit deal as U.S., Australia probes continue","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Search and advertising giant Google closed its deal to buy fitness tracking company Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), the companies said on Thursday, even as U.S. and Australian competition regulators said they were continuing probes of the $2.1 billion transaction.
The Justice Department, which sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in October for allegedly violating antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses, said it ""has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action"" regarding the Fitbit deal. 
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chair Rod Sims said ""depending on the results of our investigation, we will consider whether to take legal action on this matter.""
Google said it ""complied with the DOJ's (Justice Department's) extensive review for the past 14 months, and the agreed upon waiting period expired without their objection."" 
""We continue to be in touch with them and we’re committed to answering any additional questions,"" the company added.
Google did not immediately respond to Sims' statement.
It is rare for a big deal to close without antitrust approval.
Google won EU antitrust approval last month for its Fitbit bid after agreeing to restrictions on how it will use customers' health-related data.
Australia rejected similar restrictions proposed by Google, expressing concern that the company might block Fitbit rivals from connecting to phones running Google's Android operating software. 
Fitbit makes a watch-like device to measure physical activity that competes with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch and others. Google said it was buying the company to compete in this market.
""We worked with global regulators on an approach which safeguards consumers' privacy expectations,"" Google said in a blog post, which said Fitbit had 29 million active users. 
""(That includes) a series of binding commitments that confirm Fitbit users' health and wellness data won't be used for Google ads and this data will be separated from other Google ads data.""
While Alphabet is best known for a free service, its search engine, it has many other businesses, including online advertising services, audio device and thermostat maker Nest, video streamer YouTube and self-driving car company Waymo.
Google's plan to buy Fitbit raised concerns when it was announced in late 2019 because of its already rich trove of data about people, what they buy, where they travel, and more.
Fitbit's fitness trackers and other devices monitor users' steps and calories burned. They also measure floors climbed, heart rate, and how long and how well people sleep.

Alphabet shares closed down about 1% on Thursday. The company is expected to retain Fitbit's 1,800 employees.

The gap in the nearly $92.3 billion preliminary budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1 grew to $5.25 billion from the city's November financial plan projection of $3.75 billion.
The mayor called for a new and substantial round of stimulus to help offset the economic fallout from the pandemic and stave off the possibility of state funding cuts.
""This is absolutely crucial to get a strong stimulus from Washington - an actual stimulus, not just a survival package,"" he said. ""A stimulus with direct aid to New York City and all localities. That's going to be the single number-one difference maker."" 
President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to unveil a $1.9 trillion plan later on Thursday.
New York City, once the nation's epicenter of the pandemic, was hit last year with one-notch credit rating downgrades by Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, while S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings revised its rating outlook to negative from stable.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>",Heir to South Korea's Samsung faces day of reckoning after four years of graft trial,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court will sentence Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd heir Jay Y. Lee on a bribery charge on Monday, a ruling likely to have ramifications not just for his company but for all of South Korea's chaebol conglomerates.
Lee, 52, was convicted of bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye and jailed for five years in 2017. He denied wrongdoing, the sentence was reduced and suspended on appeal, and he was released after serving a year.
The Supreme Court then sent the case back to the Seoul High Court, which will rule on it, and the sentencing, on Monday. Prosecutors have called for a nine-year jail term.
Legal experts say the court is highly unlikely to acquit Lee but it could suspend his sentence, allowing him to remain free. Lee is involved in a separate trial for accounting fraud and stock manipulation.
For many South Koreans, it is not just Lee who will be in the dock on Monday but the whole chaebol system of family-run conglomerates, long credited with building Asia's fourth-largest economy but criticised for wielding too much power and lapses in governance and compliance.
President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017 on a reformist platform vowing to clean up chaebol practices but he has since encouraged the big businesses to create jobs, especially as the novel coronavirus undermined growth.
Similarly, public sentiment seems to have swung back in favour of the chaebol and many South Koreans would like to see a decisive Lee at the helm of the Samsung (KS:005930) empire as it navigates intensifying global competition and pressure to innovate.
""Any absence could affect Samsung from taking on major deals to jump ahead of the competition in fields it is trying to expand in, perhaps buying a struggling competitor in contract chip manufacturing, for example,"" said Lee Jae-yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.
'MITIGATING FACTOR'
On the broader question of chaebols, Cho Chang-hoon, professor at Hallym University of Graduate Studies, said while the conglomerates benefit from centralised decision-making they are often open to attack, including from investors, on environmental, social and governance issues.
Lee has pledged to change Samsung and make compliance and social responsibility top priorities, in part by ensuring that an independent compliance panel set up last year continues to operate.
The judges who will rule on Monday have said they will take the issue of compliance into account in making their decision.
""This is the first trial that proposed compliance as a mitigating factor in sentencing and it could lead to it being utilised in South Korea's charisma-led chaebol culture as a way to build consensus with external stakeholders,"" Cho said.
Lee's father, Lee Kun-hee, who died in October, was convicted of bribery in 1996 and tax evasion in 2008 but never served time in jail and eventually got a presidential pardon, leniency that was typically shown to business leaders.
But such treatment can no longer taken for granted. The leader of the third-largest conglomerate, SK, served more than two years in prison for embezzlement in 2013-2015.

A petition signed by 57,440 members of the public and lodged with the presidential office hailed Samsung as ""the pride of South Korea"" and called for Lee to remain free and run the company that pays so much in taxes and provides so many jobs.

(Reuters) - Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky on Thursday predicted travel would permanently change due to the pandemic with people seeking out thousands of smaller cities and spending more time visiting friends and family.
Traditional tourism and sightseeing at top global destinations would be significantly reduced by travelers who will drive to smaller communities and fly less for business meetings.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are ""yearning for what was taken away from them,"" Chesky said at the Reuters Next conference in an interview with Jonathan Weber, Reuters global technology editor. ""They're not yearning to see Times Square. What they are yearning to do is to see their friends and their families they have not seen in a long time.""
The startup was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and its business dropped by 80% in a little over eight weeks.
However, as lockdowns eased, more travelers opted to book homes instead of hotels, helping Airbnb post a surprise profit for the third quarter. The San Francisco-based firm gained from increased interest in renting homes away from major cities.
The home rental firm went public in a blockbuster initial public offering in December, its shares more than doubling in their stock market debut. Shares of Airbnb rose as much as 10% to record high of $187.42 on Thursday. 
WILL NOT FACILITATE VIOLENCE 
The rental platform has been canceling home-sharing reservations in the Washington D.C. area for President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration's next Wednesday after law enforcement warned of a threat from armed militias.
Chesky recalled the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia and said that he did not want the platform facilitating people traveling to commit violence in communities.
Airbnb made the decision of after consulting local and federal officials and after a number of hosts worried about potential attacks sought to cancel bookings.
However, major hotel chains including  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) have said they planned to uphold existing reservations.

(Reuters) - Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s prominent incubator and startup fund, has half of its latest class of entrepreneurs from outside of the United States, more than ever before, as the pandemic has pushed all of its work online, Managing Director Michael Seibel said Thursday at the Reuters Next conference.
Incubators help entrepreneurs take ideas and turn them into businesses, often taking a stake. Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc both went through Y Combinator and are the first and second-highest valued companies among the graduates.
“We were able to do 50% more office hours with founders than an in-person batch. It turns out that all of that driving and parking and looking for meeting room just generated so much inefficiency,” said Seibel, adding that the format will continue to evolve with this experience.
Jared Friedman, a partner at Y Combinator, said the last demo day in August 2020 was record breaking. Demo days are when startups present their business to investors, and Y Combinator said its virtual demo day yielded over 28,000 introductions between investors and founders, 40% more than the previous record.
In addition to trying to include more international entrepreneurs, Y Combinator has been working to increase racial diversity of the startups it guides, said Seibel. He said since 2015 Y Combinator has funded over 500 female founders, over 200 Black founders and almost 300 Latinx founders. “You change the stats by funding people,” said Seibel, adding that it is also important once funded, to help underrepresented founders get attention. 
Y Combinator has set up a directory for investors and businesses to find them. Seibel is seen as one of the most successful Black entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley. He co-founded Justin.tv which became Twitch Interactive and was sold to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for around $1 billion in 2014.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday after making a u-turn toward the end of the session as reports emerged about U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's pandemic aid proposal following earlier data that showed a weakening labor market.
The Labor Department's weekly jobless report showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week, underscoring the impact of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
While the S&P 500 lost a lot of steam toward the end of the day, it spent most of the session in positive territory as investors counted on Biden unveiling on Thursday evening a stimulus plan that could exceed $1.5 trillion.
""There's a tug-of-war going on between the prospects for further fiscal stimulus, as a result of Democratic control of the Senate, and a jobs market that has a long way to go before it heals,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. ""You have these competing forces going on which are keeping markets range bound.""
But Roland noted that disappointing jobs data could provide ""further fodder for Biden to potentially market this plan.""
""Everybody's waiting to hear the details ... Whether it's $1 trillion or $2 trillion, that's a massive amount of fiscal stimulus,"" she said.
Citing two people familiar with the plans, The New York Times reported that Biden is expected on Thursday to unveil a $1.9 trillion spending package.
Since the S&P had gained steadily ahead of the story, Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut, suggested investors were selling on the news.
Others such as Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana, looked for potential downsides from the massive spending plan, which markets have appeared to be craving for months. 
""There’s some realization that throwing another $2 trillion into the mix is overkill,"" said Carlson. ""There is that underlying concern that inflation is going to get rekindled and this amount of money is certainly a concern.”
After both touched fresh record highs earlier in the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 68.95 points, or 0.22%, at 30,991.52 while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.31 points, or 0.12%, to 13,112.64.
The S&P 500 lost 14.3 points, or 0.38%, to close at 3,795.54.
Earlier investors had seemed reassured after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate hike would not be coming anytime time soon and pushed back against suggestions that it might taper bond purchases any time soon.
Of the 11 major S&P sectors, only four closed higher with economically-sensitive energy, up 3%, showing the biggest percentage gains as oil prices rose. 
The biggest percentage decliner on the day was the information technology sector. 
The domestically-focused small-cap Russell 2000 index closed up 2%, while the Dow Jones Transports index ended up 1% after both sectors, which are seen as big beneficiaries of stimulus, scaled all-time highs during the day.
Helping the transport index was a 2.5% rise in shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) after Chief Executive Ed Bastian forecast 2021 to be ""the year of recovery"" after the coronavirus pandemic prompted its first annual loss in 11 years. 
The S&P 1500 airlines index closed up 3.4%.
This was after Donald Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice when the House voted 232-197 on Wednesday to charge him with inciting riots at the Capitol.
The Philadelphia semiconductor index also hit a record high with a big boost from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. The chip manufacturer's U.S. shares closed up 5% after it announced its best-ever quarterly profit and raised revenue and capital spending estimates.
Investors were waiting for the earnings season to kick into full swing with results from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) slated for Friday.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.51-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 367 new highs and three new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 14.37 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 12.54 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com – The Dow closed lower after rising to intraday highs Thursday as losses in technology stocks offset gains in value stocks ahead expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will unveil a more than $1 trillion fiscal package to boost the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.36%, or 68 points, after hitting an intraday record of 31,223.78. The S&P 500 was down 0.31%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.12%.
Biden's fiscal package, expected to be unveiled around 7:15pm EST, will likely include proposals to boost direct payments to Americans, state and local aid, and funding the distribution of vaccines.
Investor focus will likely center on the size of the package and any updates on potential tax hikes to partially offset a $1.5 trillion infrastructure and healthcare package expected to be unveiled in the latter half of 2021,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
""The market will be very attentive to the overall size of the proposed package as well as the extent of potential tax hikes. We believe a headline stimulus number substantially above $1.5 trillion would come as a surprise,"" the bank said.
In another boost to stimulus optimism, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank would continue to keep the monetary spigot wide open as the risk of runaway inflation in the post-pandemic era is unlikely.
“The real question is, how large is that effect [post-pandemic rise in prices] is going to be and will it be persistent … clearly a one time increase in prices is very unlikely to meet persistently high inflation,” Powell said Thursday during a virtual event sponsored by Princeton's Bendheim Center for Finance.
Powell's remarks come just a day after vice chairman Richard Clarida said the fed won't raise rates until inflation reaches 2%.
The latest weekly jobs report highlighted the need for further support as jobless claims surged 181,000 to a more than four-month high of 965,000, well above economists forecast of 795,000.
Value stocks – those linked with the performance of the economy – led the upside in the broader market, with energy, industrials and financials in the ascendency.
Financials will come under deeper the spotlight on Friday as a trio of Wall Street banks kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) report quarterly earnings on Friday. Banks have rallied in the run up to their quarterly reports as investors anticipate strength in trading divisions, improving trends in loans will drive up performance.
The potential restart of dividend payments as well as the size of share buybacks will also be closely watched. 
Last month, the Fed lifted restrictions following a stress tests that found banks were sufficiently capitalized to withstand a negative economic shock.
Ahead of the slew of bank earnings, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) rose 2% as upbeat guidance offset mixed  quarterly performance.
In tech, weakness in the Fab 5 offset strength in chip stocks.   
Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) closed sharply higher, with the latter boosted by better-than-expected quarterly performance.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 4%, as several analysts on Wall Street talked up the prospect of the beleaguered chipmaker as its set for new leadership.
In other news,  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) fell 4% after JPMorgan initiated coverage on the stock at neutral, saying that the stock is “fully valued,” in the wake of its more than 100% gains since the start of the year."

(Reuters) - Fast-casual U.S. chain  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) and Dutch delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com predicted a return to more normal levels of dining out by spring or summer of 2021, they said on Thursday.
The two companies, which have both prospered during the coronavirus pandemic, saw little downside to the idea that consumers will want to eat in dining rooms again - instead of grabbing burritos to go or ordering in-home delivery.
""I'm very optimistic that people are going to be coming back to dining rooms,"" Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said during a panel discussion at the Reuters Next conference.
Fast food and some fast-casual chains as well as third-party delivery services have thrived during the pandemic as consumers shifted to delivery, drive-thru and pickup to get restaurant meals.
Niccol and Jitse Groen, CEO of Just Eat Takeaway, predicted a quick recovery to more normal, pre-pandemic levels consumer behavior in 2020 - followed by years of possible expansion for their companies.
""We will return to some sort of normality from April onwards, at least in Europe,"" Groen said. ""It will be some combination of having vaccinated the most vulnerable people and the weather improving.""
Shifts to e-commerce and digital ordering will likely stick around for the long term, they said.
Both executives said orders will also gradually shift back to offices as workers return.
Five years from now, Chipotle may be able to double its U.S. store count - currently about 2,700 - to as many as 6,000 locations while boosting average annual sales per store from $2.3 million now to ""hopefully closing in on"" $3 million, Niccol said.
He also anticipates a ""much bigger global footprint in the foreseeable future"" versus the Mexican fast-casual's current 16 restaurants throughout Europe.
Its eight UK locations will soon be added to Just Eat Takeaway's online marketplace, Groen said.
Looking ahead, Groen said people will order delivery more often and order more food each time. Overall speed could also increase - from 25 minutes now optimally to just 15 minutes in coming years.
Takeaway, which acquired Just Eat in 2020 and is closing in on its deal to buy U.S.-based GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) Inc, is on track to be the largest third-party restaurant delivery firm outside of China.
Groen said that the delivery industry is in constant change, making it hard for him to give precise estimates on growth other than to say his company ""will be a lot bigger.""

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated earlier that the central bank would continue to keep the monetary spigot wide open. This morning, the weekly jobs report highlighted the need for further support as jobless claims surged to a more than four-month high of 965,000, above economists' forecast of 795,000.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Bank earnings are back
It's that time of year again, when big banks start rolling out their results. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are up first. Expect to hear big trading numbers from JPMorgan and Citi that help to offset a drop in net income. Commentary on the outlook for 2021 will also be of keen interest.
2. Retail sales
Retail sales for December will be widely watched to see if holiday shopping picked up late in the month. November's number plunged from the previous month, and economists aren't expecting much as -- tell us if you've heard this before -- coronavirus cases increased and lockdowns intensified. Consensus calls for sales to be flat, after the previous month's 1.1% decline. That's due at 8:30 AM ET.
3. Other economic data
Empire manufacturing, producer prices and the University of Michigan Sentiment are also due. The Empire number, which covers the hard-hit New York region, is expected to come in at 6.0 compared to the prior month's 4.9 when it hits at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Producer prices (9:15 AM ET) are expected to increase 0.4%. The Michigan consumer sentiment survey (10 AM ET) is expected to take a modest tick down to 79.5 from the prior 80.7 reading.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines back Biden plan to mandate masks for passengers,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A group representing major U.S. airlines on Thursday backed President-elect Joe Biden's plan to mandate face coverings for all air passengers, but asked him to give them flexibility in enforcing it.
Airlines for America - which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Co, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and others - asked Biden in a letter seen by Reuters to ""allow air carriers to maintain their existing policies and practices which are aimed at de-escalating conflict in-flight and allowing the aircraft to continue while providing a consequential enforcement backstop on the ground.""
The airline group noted airlines have been enforcing the requirements and prohibiting passengers that do not comply from flying for the duration of the pandemic.
""Thousands of passengers have been barred to date,"" the letter to Biden read, saying it hopes the Democrat applies the legal requirement to airports as well.
The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which has demanded a federal face covering mandate since early in the pandemic, said the mandate would provide one standard across U.S. aviation and back up flight attendants and other airline workers who must enforce compliance.
Republican President Donald Trump opposed legally requiring airline, train and public transit passengers and workers to wear masks amid the pandemic, and the White House rejected efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to require face coverings. 
Biden in October said he would mandate masks in all interstate U.S. transportation and he has recently reiterated that plan. The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
The airlines called on Biden to apply the rules to all modes of public transport and to ""require all passengers 2 years and older to wear a mask, without exception."" They also called for allowing ""existing practices for food and beverage consumption, medical distress and other necessary flexibilities included in air carrier operational policies.""

They also asked Biden not to extend the legal requirement to crew members.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from record intraday highs Thursday, but remained supported on optimism for a speedier recovery as President-elect Joe Biden is set to unveil a more than $1 trillion package to boost the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.24%, or 73 points to 31,131.71 after hitting an intraday record of 31,223.78. The S&P 500 was up 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27%.
Biden's fiscal package, due around 7:15pm EST, will likely include proposals to boost direct payments to Americans, state and local aid, and funding the distribution of vaccines.
Investor focus will likely center on the size of the package and any updates on potential tax hikes to partially offset a $1.5 trillion infrastructure and healthcare package expected to be unveiled in the latter half of 2021,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
""The market will be very attentive to the overall size of the proposed package as well as the extent of potential tax hikes. We believe a headline stimulus number substantially above $1.5 trillion would come as a surprise,"" the bank said.
In another boost to stimulus optimism, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank would continue to keep the monetary spigot wide open as the risk of runaway inflation in the post-pandemic era is unlikely.
“The real question is, how large is that effect [post-pandemic rise in prices] is going to be and will it be persistent … clearly a one time increase in prices is very unlikely to meet persistently high inflation,” Powell said Thursday during a virtual event sponsored by Princeton's Bendheim Center for Finance.
Powell's remarks come just a day after vice chairman Richard Clarida said the fed won't raise rates until inflation reaches 2%.
The latest weekly jobs report highlighted the need for further support as jobless claims surged 181,000 to a more than four-month high of 965,000, well above economists forecast of 795,000.
Value stocks – those linked with the performance of the economy – led the upside in the broader market, with energy, industrials and financials in the ascendency.
Financials will come under deeper the spotlight on Friday as a trio of Wall Street banks kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) report quarterly earnings on Friday. Banks have rallied in the run up to their quarterly reports as investors anticipate strength in trading divisions, improving trends in loans will drive up performance.
The potential restart of dividend payments as well as the size of share buybacks will also be closely watched. 
Last month, the Fed lifted restrictions following a stress tests that found banks were sufficiently capitalized to withstand a negative economic shock.
In tech, chip stocks were in focus on a rally in Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), with the latter boosted by better-than-expected quarterly performance.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was also among the biggest advancers, up 4%, as several analysts on Wall Street talked up the prospect of the beleaguered chipmaker as its set for new leadership.
The record intraday session on Wall Street comes a day after President Donald Trump was impeached by the House for the incitement of insurrection after encouraging his loyalist to storm the U.S. Capitol last week.
The impeachment trial in the Senate will likely fizzle out as it's unlikely to be backed by two-thirds of Senators needed for a conviction."

590,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>","Pandemic is boosting euro zone imbalances, ministers to mull way out","By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing economic imbalances in the euro zone, the European Commission will tell the bloc's finance ministers on Monday, but reforms and investments funded by European Union money should help address that.
Finance ministers from the 19 countries sharing the euro will hold monthly talks on Monday to discuss ways to counter the effects of the pandemic on the economy.
In a note seen by Reuters that is to form the basis of their discussions, the Commission said the impact of COVID-19 was especially visible in countries that were already vulnerable before the outbreak because of high debts.
""The COVID-19 shock appears to exacerbate existing imbalances within the euro area,"" the note said. 
""Member States most impacted economically by the COVID-19 crisis, because of the gravity of the pandemic or their dependence on highly exposed sectors, are characterised by ... large stocks of government and private debt,"" it said.
The COVID-19 crisis was therefore making existing problems with disparate debt trends among euro zone countries even worse, which could lead to members diverging economically. 
""A number of the countries highly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis were in the recent past characterised by anaemic potential growth. Hence, the pandemic could also be exacerbating economic divergences,"" the Commissions said. 
The EU's 750 billion euro recovery fund, which is to be jointly borrowed and repaid, was designed to address that problem, allowing highly indebted and very slow growing countries such as Italy to avoid boosting its debt even further.
""A strong implementation of relevant reforms and investments, while making full use of the EU support measures, should tackle the identified imbalances. Addressing imbalances going forward will be key to prevent the risk of accentuating divergences within the euro area,"" the note said.
EU governments are now preparing plans of how they want to spend the money allocated to them in grants and cheap loans in the recovery fund. But to get the plans approved and get the cash, they have to take into account the Commission's recommendations on how to fix imbalances in their economies.
The Commission pointed out last year that Germany and the Netherlands should boost investment and household income to cut their huge current account surpluses. 
Italy, Greece, Spain, France or Portugal, however, had to tackle high public and private debts, competitiveness and productivity issues, it said.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>",Simons taps Brown as chair of Renaissance board after mixed 2020,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor James Simons is stepping down as chairman at Renaissance Technologies but will remain on the board of the $60 billion hedge fund he founded nearly 40 years ago.
Simons told investors late in 2020 -- a year of mixed returns for the firm -- that he would be handing the reins as board chairman to Peter Brown, who has been running the company as sole CEO since 2017. The move signaled a shift after Simons named his son, Nathaniel, as co-chair of the board in January 2020. James and Nathaniel Simons will remain as board directors.
""Simply put, I believe it is time: this transition has been many years in the making and Peter Brown, our incoming Chairman, is more than ready to take on the responsibility,"" Simons wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the move. 
Simons, who will turn 83 this year, is a former mathematics professor and code breaker who turned Renaissance into one of the world's most successful hedge funds since its 1982 launch.
Simons retired and stepped down as CEO in 2010, handing over to Brown and Robert Mercer, who were co-CEOs until 2017.
Mercer stepped down amid controversy over his strong support of Donald Trump and the media outlet Breitbart News. Simons, whose net worth was estimated at $23.5 billion in 2020 by Forbes, donated millions to elect Joe Biden as president.
Investors have been drawn to quant funds like Renaissance where computers instead of star stock-pickers make the allocations, for years. 
But in 2020, returns at Renaissance were mixed.
Its Medallion Fund, available only to Renaissance insiders, returned 76%. But its Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, the oldest portfolio available to outsiders which was launched in 2005, tumbled nearly 20%, a person familiar with the numbers said.
Simons acknowledged the returns in his letter, writing ""I know it has been a difficult year and that Renaissance has
been through challenging periods before, but I continue to believe in our processes and our people. I remain fully committed to our investors, to our employees, and to our firm, and I am stepping down as Chair because I believe that is what’s best for the firm.""

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo close to deal with buyout firms for asset management business - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and David French
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co is in exclusive talks to sell its asset management business, which manages more than $607 billion on behalf of customers, to a private equity consortium led by GTCR LLC and Reverence Capital Partners LP, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The divestment would represent the U.S. bank's biggest shake-up since former Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Chief Executive Charles Scharf joined as CEO in 2019.
The exact price being negotiated could not be learned, but Reuters previously reported that Wells Fargo was seeking more than $3 billion for the unit. 
The talks could still end without a deal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.
Wells Fargo declined to comment. Chicago-based GTCR and New York-based Reverence did not respond to requests for comment. 
The sale of the asset management business is one of many steps taken by Scharf to turn Wells Fargo around following a years-old sales practices scandal. He has been cutting costs and shedding noncore businesses. Earlier on Thursday, Wells Fargo announced a deal to sell its Canadian direct equipment finance business to Toronto-Dominion Bank.
Last month, Wells Fargo said it would sell its private student loan portfolio to a group of investors.
The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and Scharf is expected to unveil a new strategic plan for the bank.
Reverence Capital, co-founded by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) alum Milton Berlinski, and GTCR have been active in acquiring businesses in the asset management sector.

In 2019, Reverence bought 75% of Phoenix-based independent financial advisory firm Advisor Group Inc, while last year GTCR took a minority stake in Raleigh, North-Carolina's CAPTRUST Financial Advisors, which valued the registered investment adviser at $1.25 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday added nine Chinese firms to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, including planemaker Comac and mobile phone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), according to a document seen by Reuters. 
The companies will be subject to a new U.S. investment ban which forces American investors to divest their holdings of the blacklisted firms by Nov. 11, 2021. 
The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Xiaomi and Comac did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The expanding blacklist is part of a bid by President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy in the waning days of his presidency. 
It was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Defense Department to compile a catalogue of companies owned or controlled by the Chinese military. The Pentagon, which only began complying this year, has so far added 35 companies, including oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) and China's top chipmaker SMIC. 

In November, Trump sought to give the law teeth by signing an executive order banning U.S. investment of the blacklisted firms.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 12:35PM ET</span>",Toyota settles U.S. probe into delayed emissions defect reports for $180 million,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp settled a lengthy Justice Department civil probe into its delayed filing of emissions-related defect reports for $180 million, the government said on Thursday.
Reuters first reported the expected settlement, which resolves the violations of the Clean Air Act.
Toyota first disclosed in 2016 it was under investigation for the delayed reports to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Justice Department had not previously confirmed the investigation until Thursday's announcement by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan that the government had filed a civil lawsuit against the Japanese automaker. It simultaneously announced the settlement, which includes a consent decree that requires semi-annual compliance reports.
Toyota will record $180 million in after-tax charges against earnings in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, for costs relating to the agreement.
The government said the settlement resolved Toyota's ""systematic, longstanding violations of Clean Air Act emission-related defect reporting requirements, which require manufacturers to report potential defects and recalls affecting vehicle components designed to control emissions.""
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in New York said: ""Toyota shut its eyes to the noncompliance, failing to provide proper training, attention, and oversight to its Clean Air Act reporting obligations.""
She added that ""Toyota’s actions undermined EPA’s self-disclosure system and likely led to delayed or avoided emission-related recalls, resulting in financial benefit to Toyota and excess emissions of air pollutants."" 
Toyota said in a statement the company nearly five years ago ""identified and self-reported a process gap that resulted in a delay in the filing of certain non-public EPA reports for emissions-related defects in vehicles.""
The automaker added that ""while this reporting delay resulted in a negligible emissions impact, if any, we recognize that some of our reporting protocols fell short of our own high standards, and we are pleased to have resolved this matter.” 
Over a 10-year period ending in 2015, Toyota ""routinely filed emission defect reports to EPA materially late and, in many cases, failed to file such reports at all until a self-disclosure of non-compliance"" in 2015, the Justice Department said in a court filing.
The government initially sought a substantially higher civil penalty from Toyota, sources briefed on the matter said.
The $180 million fine is the largest civil penalty for violation of EPA’s emission-reporting requirements. 
""Toyota failed to report mandatory information about potential defects in their cars to the EPA, keeping the agency in the dark and evading oversight. EPA considers this failure to be a serious violation of the Clean Air Act,"" said EPA Assistant Administrator Susan Bodine.

In recent years, the Justice Department has brought penalties in a number of auto emissions investigations, but unlike others including Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the Toyota case has no allegations of emissions cheating.

Investing.com -- Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) did not have a merry Christmas.
Net sales dropped 22% for the nine-week holiday period ended January 2 compared with the same period in 2020. On the upside, sales trends increased sequentially by approximately 500 basis points relative to the third quarter. Digital sales grew 23% over last year and represented 54% of total sales compared with 34% from the same period in fiscal 2019.
Shares are down about 2%, though they have recovered after plunging more than 65% in April.
Nordstrom got hit hard after the Covid-19 pandemic forced stores to close around the country in an effort to avert the agglomeration of people to stem the virus. For the quarter ended in April, the company reported a loss per share of $3.33, the first decline in at least seven years, when revenue fell to $2.1 billion from $3.44 billion a year earlier. In the quarter ended January 2020, Nordstrom reported earnings per share of $1.42.
The department store chain expects to deliver positive earnings before interest and taxes and operating cash flow for the fourth quarter.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>","USTR says Austria, Spain, UK digital taxes discriminate against U.S. firms","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Trade Representative's office on Thursday said it has found that digital services taxes imposed by Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom discriminate against U.S. companies and are inconsistent with international tax principles, but will take no immediate action.
Releasing the results of a ""Section 301"" investigation into the countries' digital taxes, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the trade agency will continue to evaluate all available options.
""The best outcome would be for countries to come together to find a solution,"" Lighthizer said in a statement. 
The announcement https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-and-updates-dst-investigations mirrors findings last week in similar digital services taxes imposed by India, Italy and Turkey and follows USTR's decision to suspend planned tariffs on French cosmetics, handbags and other goods as punishment for France's digital services tax.
The decisions not to impose immediate tariffs give some breathing room to President-elect Joe Biden's USTR nominee, Katherine Tai, to try to negotiate a settlement of the tax disputes after she takes office in coming weeks.
The Section 301 reports find that the foreign digital taxes discriminate against big U.S. tech firms, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), impeding U.S. commerce. The U.S. Treasury has been trying to negotiate a global agreement on digital taxation through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but talks have bogged down in recent months. 
The issue also has been complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump's feud with the big tech companies during his waning days in office, one source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The source added that it made sense to hold off on imposing unilateral tariffs at this point to allow the OECD talks to proceed and avoid tying the hands of the Biden trade team. USTR officials have stepped up efforts to ensure a smooth transition to the new administration since mid-December, the source said.

Investing.com -- What if there's a Twitter post with an animated potato version of the CEO of Taco Bell announcing the return of the starchy tuber to the menu, while also teasing a new partnership with Beyond Meat?
Well, there is, indeed, an animated potato of Mark King, head of Taco Bell, apparently underground, apologizing for removing the spuds from the menu and proclaiming their triumphant return.  
Taco Bell's Cheesy Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI) Potatoes and the Spicy Potato Soft Taco will be back starting March 11.  Both food items were removed from the menu momentarily due to Covid-19-related complications last year.
Taco Bell is also teaming up with Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) to create a new plant-based protein that will be tested in the next year.  It's all part of a bet on vegetarians.
Shares of Beyond Meat rose 7%, while Taco Bell parent  Yum! Brands Inc  (NYSE:YUM) was up 2%.
""The return of our beloved potatoes is just the first step in showing our fans the strong continued commitment to vegetarian we are making this year,"" said Liz Matthews, Taco Bell's Global Chief Food Innovation Officer. ""We have long been a leader in the vegetarian space, but this year, we have more meatless options in store that vegetarians, veggie-curious and even meat-eaters will love.""

603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Delta calls 2021 year of recovery after first loss in 11 years,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) CEO Ed Bastian expects 2021 to be ""the year of recovery"" after the coronavirus pandemic cut operating revenue by 64% and prompted its first annual loss in 11 years.
""We don’t anticipate that by the summer travel will be back anywhere close to where it previously was, but it will be a meaningful improvement, sufficient to be able to drive profitability for us in the back half of the year,"" Bastian told Reuters. 
The strength of the recovery will hinge on factors such as the pace of vaccine rollouts and people's appetite for flying after a year that nearly brought global travel to a halt. 
In the first quarter, the Atlanta-based airline expects revenue to fall by 60% to 65% from a year ago and its scheduled flight capacity to shrink by 35%.
As it continues to block middle seats at least through March 30, it expects the actual capacity it sells to fall by around 55%.
""When the demand for air travel picks up because of confidence, that’s going to be the indication that we start selling those middle seats,"" Bastian said.
Business travel should pick up in the second half of the year but remain muted for a period of time, he said. 
A recovery in international travel, which has been hit hard by travel bans, will take at least another year and Bastian said the airline would continue to burn through $10 million to $15 million a day in the first quarter.
It lost an average of $12 million a day in the fourth quarter, but remains on track to halt its cash burn in the spring, the airline said.
Global airline industry body IATA believes a return to positive cash flow for the industry might not happen this year, Chief Economist Brian Pearce said on Thursday, as a resurgence in lockdowns has killed off a fragile bookings upturn.
Delta expects to have $18 billion to $19 billion of liquidity by the end of March, including an additional $3 billion in government payroll support, while carrying around $18 billion in net debt.
It had $16.7 billion in liquidity in 2020 after a series of capital raisings.
FIRST ANNUAL LOSS SINCE 2009
Delta, the first U.S. airline to post 2020 results, reported a $12.4 billion loss - its first since 2009 - on operating revenue of $17 billion. It recorded a $4.8 billion profit a year earlier.
It lost $755 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.19 per share. The adjusted loss per share was $2.53, versus analyst estimates for $2.51. 
Delta shares jumped 2.2% in pre-market trading following the results.
Delta booked $1 billion in COVID-19 related charges in the quarter, though total adjusted operating expenses fell by $4.6 billion or 47% on lower fuel, maintenance and salary costs.
Delta has avoided furloughs but said nearly 18,000 employees, or 20% of its workforce, decided to leave the company in 2020. 
It does not intend to furlough any employees once the second round of government payroll support for airlines expires in March. 
The company expects to retire nearly 400 jets through 2025 as it simplifies its fleet to nine families of aircraft. 
Bastian has previously hinted at the possibility of purchasing Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX.
The U.S. government will hopefully lift its international travel ban by the spring or summer if the virus is contained, Bastian said.
Turning to disruption on recent U.S. flights by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bastian said Delta has placed passengers involved in incidents that targeted senators Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) on its no-fly list.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",French government hardens stance against Carrefour takeover,"By Leigh Thomas, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - France on Thursday took a tough line against any takeover of retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) by a foreign company, dealing a major blow to a near $20 billion bid approach by Canada's Couche-Tard. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Reuters that the government wanted to preserve the country's food security and sovereignty.
""Having Carrefour being bought by a foreign company would be a major difficulty for all of us,"" Le Maire said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference.
""Food security is at the core of the strategic challenges of all developed nations"", he said.
Along with other retailers, Carrefour, with roughly a fifth of France's groceries market, played a major role in ensuring smooth food supplies as the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 
But convenience-store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard's offer for Carrefour - continental Europe's largest retailer - also raises other political considerations, as the group is one of France's biggest employers.
Shares in Carrefour fell on Thursday as the French government underscored its opposition to a deal, with Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne also saying she was against it.
The shares were down 1.7% at 1429 GMT after a 17% jump on Wednesday.
Morningstar analyst Ioannis Pontikis said the market was probably pricing in the low likelihood of the deal going through.
Couche-Tard's approach also raised eyebrows with analysts partly because they saw little potential for cost savings - the group, focused on gas stations in North America, has little geographical overlap with Carrefour. 
But this could be a plus in terms of preserving jobs, while a takeover could be interesting for Carrefour if it provided financial firepower for investments in areas like e-commerce. 
Traditional retailers including Carrefour are trying to reinvent themselves to fight off rising competition from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) . 
A source close to Carrefour said the group had been surprised by Le Maire's immediate and vocal opposition to the deal. 
""We are surprised by this reaction as we are at a very preliminary stage"", the source told Reuters.
Another source with knowledge of the matter said it was too early to say the deal would not go through.
The French government spoke out in 2005 to protect French big business amid rumors that Danone might receive a takeover bid from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc.
The country has since tightened takeover rules to protect French companies deemed strategic, including under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, who will face a presidential election in 2022. 
During the pandemic, Macron has ramped up calls to protect French sovereignty in areas such as healthcare and industry, although the former investment banker has tried to strike a balance with a business-friendly approach. 
Couche-Tard on Wednesday made a non-binding 20 euros per share offer for the French grocery group, largely in cash. 
A source familiar with the discussions told Reuters that 20 euros per share was not enough but was a starting point for discussions. Initial contact between the two companies came at the end of last year and Couche-Tard sent its first letter in early January, the source said.

In a statement on Wednesday, Carrefour acknowledged Couche-Tard's approach to discuss a combination.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",BlackRock results beat expectations as assets grow to $8.68 trillion,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)'s, quarterly results topped analysts' expectations on Thursday, buoyed by a rising stock market that boosted the firm's assets under management to a record high $8.68 trillion, further widening its lead against peers. 
The firm drew $127 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter as investors poured money into its various business, including its exchange-traded funds, as well as active funds that aim to beat the market.
""We begin 2021 well-positioned and intend to keep investing in our business to drive long-term growth and to lead the evolution of the asset management industry,"" BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, said in a statement.
Financial markets rallied in the fourth quarter, building on sharp gains of the prior two quarters, as accommodative global central bank policy and improving growth prospects helped lift investors' risk appetite.
While rallying stock markets provided a powerful boost to BlackRock's results, the profit report showed outsized growth in inflows at a time when the rest of the industry is expected to struggle with redemptions.
""Yes, markets were great for everyone this quarter, but most asset managers are still bleeding out assets ... whereas BlackRock's flow growth rate is continuing to accelerate,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
""That shows that they are taking market share ... widening the competitive gap with all their peers,"" said Sanders.
BlackRock's adjusted net income of $10.18 per share in the fourth quarter topped Wall Street estimates of $9.14, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The asset manager raked in higher investment and advisory fees, a major source of revenue, through the quarter.
BlackRock's growing size and wide reach in financial markets across the globe have seen the asset manager become one of the most important firms in capital markets today.
When markets turned turbulent in early 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve roped in BlackRock to run various vehicles the Fed created to buy corporate debt from the primary and secondary markets, thereby helping restore calm to markets.
BlackRock's success, not untied to its size, is likely to spur consolidation among peers looking to play catch-up with the investment behemoth, analysts said.
""We anticipate elevated mergers and acquisitions within the industry as peers attempt to replicate BlackRock's scale, technology capabilities and comprehensive product lineup,"" Edward Jones' Sanders said.
In February 2020, asset manager Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN) bought rival  Legg Mason  Inc (NYSE:LM) in a $4.5 billion deal, and in December, Bloomberg reported U.S. custodian bank  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) was exploring options for its asset management business.
On Thursday, BlackRock's Fink said he is open to dealmaking as long as it is additive and not just to take out costs.
In November, BlackRock said it would buy investment management services provider Aperio Group LLC for $1.05 billion in cash. 
BlackRock's shares, which hit a record high on Wednesday, have risen 8.1% this year, compared with a 5.2% gain for a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States. BlackRock's shares were down 3.3% in early trading on Thursday. 

BlackRock's shares were trading at record highs as investors bet on the company benefiting from improving market conditions.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday in anticipation of President-elect Joe Biden's stimulus plans, shrugging off fresh evidence of damage to the labor market from the pandemic.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 108 points, or 0.4%, at 31,168 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
Biden is due later to present details of a stimulus plan that he has previously said will run to ""trillions of dollars."" The prospect of higher federal borrowing this year has raised questions as to whether the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus will be enough to absorb all that extra issuance. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may touch on the relationship between fiscal and monetary policy in a speech at 12:30 PM ET. 
That the economy is in need of further support is not in question. Labor Department data released earlier showed that 965,000 Americans filed initial claims for jobless benefits, the highest weekly number since August and well above the 795,000 expected.
The numbers suggest that the U.S. economy will shed jobs for a second straight month in January, due largely to the devastating impact of lockdowns on the hospitality and travel sectors. 
Among early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 1.3% after regulators urged a recall for over 150,000 Model S and X cars whose touch screens showed signs of degradation with age.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent ADRs rose 3.7% and 3.4% after reports that the U.S. administration will not add them to its blacklist of Chinese companies. 
Quarterly reports are also starting to trickle in ahead of the dump of bank earnings on Friday that traditionally kicks off earnings season. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rose 7.3% after beating expectations for profit and guiding expectations for its first-quarter revenue higher. By contrast, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) stock fell 2.8% despite the world's largest asset manager handily beating expectations for both earnings and revenue. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 3.7% after the airline predicted a strong second half to 2021, even though it still expects first-quarter revenue to be down by more than 60% from last year. The airline posted its first loss in over a decade in 2020.
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock rose 13% after star fund manager Cathie Wood said her company Ark Investment Management would launch an ETF devoted to space exploration. 
Ark's ETF will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in space exploration and innovation, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On the downside, Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock was down 5.2%, the loss-making fuel cell manufacturer giving up some of its stellar gains over the last week that were made on the back of two strategic partnership with France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and South Korea's SK Group."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - WhatsApp's updated privacy policy verges on user surveillance and threatens India's security, a petition filed in an Indian court said on Thursday, presenting another legal challenge for the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc-owned messenger.
California-based WhatsApp said on Jan. 4 it reserved the right to share some data including location and phone number with Facebook and its units such as Instagram and Messenger.
That triggered outrage, including in its biggest market India where it has 400 million users.
The change has also met with a challenge in Turkey with the country's Competition Board this week launching an investigation into the messaging service and its parent.
In India, many users have began installing rival apps like Signal and Telegram, pushing WhatsApp to begin a costly advertising campaign to calm customers.
""It virtually gives a 360-degree profile into a person's online activity,"" lawyer Chaitanya Rohilla said of Whatsapp's new policy in the petition to the Delhi High Court.
'BROWBEATING'
A copy of the petition, seen by Reuters, said Whatsapp was jeopardizing national security by sharing, transmitting and storing user data in another country with the information thus governed by foreign laws.
""WhatsApp has made a mockery out of our fundamental right to privacy,"" it said.
WhatsApp has given users a Feb. 8 deadline to agree to the new terms.
""This type of arbitrary behaviour and browbeating cannot be accepted in a democracy and is completely 'ultra vires' (beyond its powers) and against the fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution of India,"" the petition added. 
It will be heard by the Delhi High Court on Friday.
WhatsApp did not respond to a request for comment. It has previously said the policy update does not affect privacy of messages with friends and family, as group chats are encrypted and the changes only relate to interactions with businesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading U.S. bank regulator finalized a rule Thursday that prohibits large banks from refusing to lend to certain business sectors, after Republicans voiced frustration at what they saw as a reluctance by banks to finance gun makers and energy firms.
The rule, proposed in November by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, has been fiercely contested by banks which call it unworkable and politically motivated. It applies to banks with more than $100 billion in assets and stipulates that they must show legitimate business reasons for not providing services to certain borrowers.
The rule, pushed by Comptroller Brian Brooks, had been encouraged by some Republicans frustrated by banks' refusal to lend to certain types of businesses, such as gun manufacturers and oil and gas companies.
Instead, Brooks said banks must evaluate each applicant on the merits, and the rule would prohibit any blanket prohibition.
""It is inconsistent with basic principles of prudent risk management to make decisions based solely on conclusory or categorical assertions of risk without actual analysis,"" said Brooks in a statement. ""Moreover, elected officials should determine what is legal and illegal in our country.""
The OCC finalized the rule on Brooks's last day at the agency.
The last-minute rule has been met broad condemnation, with consumer groups, Democrats and the banking industry in rare alignment in opposition. Banks say the rule takes away their ability to make business decisions for themselves, and places it in the hands of the government.
Banks are expected to push the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden and Democrats to find a way to repeal the rule, and have suggested they could challenge it in court.

Hari Nada, a former Nissan vice president in charge of legal affairs, is a key whistleblower in the case brought by Japanese prosecutors against former Nissan and Renault boss Ghosn, who was arrested in 2018.
Nada was testifying at the trial of former Nissan executive Greg Kelly who is charged with helping Ghosn hide 9.3 billion yen ($89 million) in compensation over eight years through deferred payments after Japan introduced new rules requiring executives to disclose payments above 1 billion yen.
Kelly has pleaded not guilty. He has been on bail in Japan since his release from jail in 2018 and is facing trial without Ghosn because his co-accused fled to Lebanon in December 2019. 
Ghosn, who was one of the world's most prominent auto bosses as head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, has denied wrongdoing. He says he is the victim of a boardroom coup by former Nissan colleagues worried he would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault, its largest shareholder. 
Nada told the court that Ghosn had concealed his true compensation because he feared the repercussions in France. He said Kelly had given him this information.
""He didn't want to be fired. If he paid himself what he wanted and that was disclosed, the French state would have felt obliged to fire him,"" said Nada, who agreed to cooperate with Japanese prosecutors in return for immunity from prosecution.
France's economy ministry declined to comment.
Nada was demoted following Ghosn's arrest.
Ghosn, who is also charged with enriching himself through $5 million in payments to a Middle East car dealership, and for a breach of trust for temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books, also denies any wrongdoing. 
Kelly's trial could take about a year. If found guilty he could face up to 10 years in prison and a 10 million yen fine.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>","New Renault boss plans leaner, electric future","By Gilles Guillaume and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) pledged to slim down and focus more on technology as its new CEO laid out plans to revive a business hammered by management turmoil and the COVID-19 crisis. 
In a departure from the world-conquering view of former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn, Chief Executive Luca de Meo said Renault would reduce the number of cars it turns out, focus on its most profitable models and on new electric launches - including a revamped version of the classic Renault Super Cinq. 
""We grew bigger, but not better,"" De Meo said in an online presentation, which aimed to project a jazzier, more youthful brand under a street-art style ""Renaulution"" slogan. 
De Meo, who arrived last July after a stint running Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Seat brand, said the task now was to ""steer our business from market share to margin.""
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the car industry, Renault was struggling to adjust to life without Ghosn, the architect and long-time boss of its alliance with Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY). Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges, which he denies, and later fled. 
The company also faces new challenges, as the European Union tightens emissions regulations and rivals PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles complete their merger to create Stellantis, the world's fourth-biggest automaker, with potentially more resources to meet the industry changes. 
Renault's car production will drop to 3.1 million vehicles by 2025 from 4 million in 2019 - and down from the 5 million per year targeted by Ghosn in 2017.
Half of new launches will be electrified, manufacturing will be simplified and Renault will also focus on areas like car sharing and ride hailing, with the aim of deriving a fifth of revenues from these mobility services by 2030. 
De Meo ruled out further job cuts, beyond the 15,000 it earmarked last year over the next two to three years. 
But he hiked cost savings goals, with an extra 500 million euros ($608 million) planned to reach 2.5 billion euros by 2023, and then 3 billion euros by 2025. 
Investors were initially unimpressed, with Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois describing profit goals as ""underwhelming"", reflecting the ""depth of challenges at Renault."" 
Shares had largely recovered by 1153 GMT, trading down 0.3%. 
TECHNOLOGY
Underscoring attempts at a fresh start for its troubled alliance with Nissan, Renault included a video message in its presentation from the Japanese carmaker's boss Makoto Uchida, who gave the plan his thumbs up.
Under de Meo's efficiency drive, Renault will build vehicles on fewer shared platforms to pare back costs by 600 euros per car by 2023, and aim to cut development time for new vehicles by a year, to under three years.
The 53-year old's shift to a more electric line-up will include building a battery plant in France with one of the company's suppliers, while the company is working on partnerships in areas like technology. 
""We'll move from a car company working with tech to a tech company working with cars,"" de Meo said. 
Renault aims to lift operating margins to 5% by 2023. It also plans to lower capital spending and research costs to 8% of revenue from 10% by 2025. Together, these measures should lower Renault's break-even point by 30% by 2023.
The company has yet to publish margins for 2020, though following the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted operations, they are likely to be lower than the 4.8% hit in 2019.
Renault also said it was targeting automotive free cash flow of 3 billion euros by 2023, and 6 billion by 2025.
""The commitment to short-term cash targets is positive as it remains the key concern for investors,"" Citibank analysts wrote in a client note. 
Renault said it had drawn an additional chunk of its 5 billion euro government-guaranteed loan secured early in the COVID-19 crisis.
The company said it would combine all its sports car efforts into one unit ""dedicated to developing exclusive and innovative"" vehicles, with Formula One racing ""at the heart of the project.""

618,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",Airlines face more turbulence before vaccine relief,"By Laurence Frost and Sarah Young
PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - For a year expected to mark a turning point for pandemic-stricken European airlines, 2021 is off to a rough start.
A resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns has killed off a fragile bookings upturn, executives and analysts said, as insolvent Norwegian Air finally axed its long-haul operations on Thursday.
The setbacks deal a blow to airline hopes that the promise of vaccines would put the worst of the crisis behind them, and set the stage for a summer rebound.
New outbreaks and travel restrictions - some designed to curb the spread of a highly infectious virus variant detected in Britain - have hit forward bookings that are usually relied upon to bring in vital cash during the thin winter months.
Global airline industry body IATA believes a return to positive cash flow ""might not arrive before the end of the year,"" Chief Economist Brian Pearce said.
""Meanwhile the cash burn is going to continue"" and may even in increase in Europe, Pearce told an online conference on Wednesday.
Some carriers may yet run out of cash, he added. For bailed-out airlines like Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, a longer slump increases both debt and the likelihood more support will be needed.
Europe faces the worst relapse - although hitherto buoyant Chinese and Russian domestic bookings have also been weakened by new restrictions.
Intra-European bookings for the first half of the year stand at 22% of their level 12 months ago, Olivier Ponti of aviation data specialist ForwardKeys said. That compares with 36% for U.S. domestic bookings and 48% for flights within China.
'CARNAGE IN EUROPE'
Airlines have responded by cancelling yet more services. Ultra-low-cost carrier Wizz Air, which has been expanding its fleet and network during the crisis, is suspending most UK routes and sees January capacity down 75%.
""The lockdown puts strains on demand, and we're adjusting capacity according to demand,"" Chief Executive Jozsef Varadi told Reuters. ""It's going to be a difficult quarter.""
Data provider OAG, which tracks airline schedules, predicted ""carnage in Europe"" after airlines slashed western Europe capacity by a quarter.
""A loss of some 1.5 million seats in a week is staggering,"" analyst John Grant said. With another 580,000 dropped in eastern Europe, ""expectations for the next few months are grim"".
Recovery hopes have driven a share rebound for European airlines since the first vaccine breakthrough in November, before lockdown setbacks pared average gains to 30%, based on the Stoxx Europe airlines index.
More bullish investors may be getting ahead of themselves, some analysts caution.
European aviation is ""primed for disappointment"", Citi analyst Mark Manduca said.
""We see recovery risks into summer because (pre-flight) testing will in our view likely stifle demand,"" he added in a note. ""Slower-than-expected rollouts of vaccines to corporate populations will likely continue to strangle a business-demand recovery.""
'DESTROYS CONFIDENCE'
The volatile outlook hugely complicates all-important summer schedule planning, as airlines must decide several months ahead whether to commit cash to bringing back and overhauling parked jets and rehire staff.
Wheel out too much capacity and the unfilled seats will deepen losses. An airline that underestimates demand, on the other hand, risks handing badly needed business to rivals.
Nearly three-quarters of European routes are now under restrictions, according to UBS research - a higher proportion than at the height of the pandemic's first wave last March-May.
Airlines are growing exasperated with governments' refusal to drop quarantines for pre-flight COVID-19 testing. When Britain added testing requirements on top of a quarantine, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary decried ""another shambolic measure"".
""What this does is it destroys all confidence in bookings,"" he told the BBC on Friday.
Similar moves by Canada, Germany and Japan have drawn fire from the industry.
""These governments are not interested in managing a balanced approach to the risks,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said on Tuesday. 

""The industry's situation is still perilous - in fact it got worse over the year-end holiday period.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Thursday amid cautious trading as investors await details of additional fiscal stimulus with the political turmoil continuing.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 73 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 7 points, or 0.1%. 
Overnight President Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached by the House of Representatives twice, with all Democrats and 10 Republicans backing the measure to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last week.
The action now moves to the Senate, although when the upper chamber starts to discuss this measure is not known at this point, suggesting the impeachment proceedings will drag into President-elect Joe Biden’s term.
Biden has other things on his mind at this point. He is expected to provide more details about his Covid-19 stimulus plans later Thursday. The incoming President last week said the “entire package” would total “trillions of dollars,” and so expectations of substantial additional fiscal aid are running high.  
Coronavirus cases have continued to surge, with the United States setting a new record for deaths in one day, with 4,336 fatalities on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. More than 384,000 people have died from the Covid-19 virus in the U.S., with over 23 million having been infected. 
There was some good news on the subject as Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) experimental single-dose vaccine generated a long-lasting immune response in an early safety study.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight after U.S. regulators demanded the company recall 158,000 of its electric cars over safety concerns. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) both rose modestly in premarket trade after reporting fourth-quarter earnings.
Turning to economic data, the weekly initial jobless claims figure is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), while many investors will also be listening to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, given the recent talk about the central bank tapering its bond-buying program.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO to unveil cost-cutting plan,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Charlie Scharf will give investors more details on his long-awaited turnaround plan for the scandal-plagued bank this week.
Although Wall Street expects Wells Fargo to report a 38% profit decline on Friday against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, investors have become more bullish in anticipation of details about expansive cost-cutting plans. Wells Fargo shares have jumped 45% since Scharf teased a strategic update in October, outperforming JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Wells Fargo management has promised transformation since its 2016 fraudulent account scandal with little to show for the effort, but it feels different now, Raymond James analyst David Long said.
Scharf's ""really changed the internal attitude to make improving the bank's governance the number one priority,"" Long said.
Scharf started making changes shortly after taking the helm in October 2019, though he has not yet provided firm targets or timelines for progress. He installed a slew of external leaders, overhauled the reporting segments, and began to shed non-core businesses. He also implemented weekly and monthly reviews to increase oversight and address regulator concerns more efficiently.
In a sign of progress repairing Wells Fargo's relationship with regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ended a consent order related to anti-money laundering compliance on the bank earlier this month.
But Wells' largest hurdles remain and it has a long way to go to catch up with peers. Efficiency ratios across Wells' largest business lines dramatically lag other big banks. Further, the ongoing need for spending to satisfy regulators and the presence of punitive asset cap until Wells proves it fixed the risk management failures that led to the widespread customer abuses will continue to hinder the bank's ability to compete effectively.

""Other banks have not been operating under these consent orders so they've been able to spend a good amount of their mindshare thinking about operating efficiency and the future,"" Long said. ""Wells has not.""

625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 05:54AM ET</span>",Couche-Tard’s $20 Billion Carrefour Bid Gets Government Snub,"(Bloomberg) -- A $20 billion takeover proposal by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. for France’s  Carrefour  SA (OTC:CRRFY) faces initial government opposition, casting doubt on prospects for the transatlantic retail deal.
The pandemic has demonstrated the importance of domestic control over the food supply, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. Carrefour (PA:CARR) and other grocers have faced surges in demand during lockdowns, with consumers clearing shelves of some items such as flour.
“From this point of view, the idea of Carrefour being bought by a foreign competitor -- on the face of it, I am not in favor of this deal,” Le Maire said on France 5 television. Carrefour shares slumped.
While the government has the power to formally block the takeover, the comments may also indicate that officials want to set conditions before deciding whether to clear the deal.
Le Maire’s remarks were “rather a posture to be invited to the negotiating table, in our view,” Clement Genelot, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co., wrote in a note. He pointed to an absence of overlap between the companies.
Carrefour shares fell as much as 7.4% in Paris trading. They had climbed 13% on Wednesday, as Couche-Tard’s stock regained some ground in Toronto following Le Maire’s comments. The shares still closed down 9.2%, their worst day since last March.
Couche-Tard said Wednesday that it had submitted an offer at 20 euros a share, financed largely in cash. A takeover would combine Carrefour’s extensive European base with the Canadian company’s North American-focused network of convenience stores and gas stations. A representative for Couche-Tard did not reply to a request for comment about the French finance minister’s remarks.
The French government has voiced opposition to deals it ended up clearing in the past after imposing some conditions, as was the case with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.’s 2015 purchase of  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA’s energy assets.
The boards of both companies haven’t yet met, so Carrefour considers that any posturing by the government is premature, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who declined to be identified by name.
Le Maire said a decree he introduced in 2019 on state screening of foreign investments could allow the government to block the deal. Those rules enable the finance ministry to block a non-European investor from holding more than 25% of the voting rights in a listed company in certain sectors.
When the pandemic hit, the government cut the threshold for its investment screening to 10%, saying the crisis could make some companies vulnerable to foreign takeovers.
As well as covering sectors like aerospace and cybersecurity, the decree applies to the “production, transformation and distribution” of agricultural produce when those activities contribute to “objectives of national food security.”
“If this deal continues, food sovereignty comes before everything,” Le Maire said. “People watching will ask themselves what the impact on jobs will be at France’s biggest private sector employer and whether food sovereignty will be guaranteed.”
Still On?
Some analysts said Le Maire sounded clear and firm, leaving little room for negotiation.
“The government has the last word -- game over,” Fabienne Caron, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, wrote in a note to clients.
Carrefour, which operates everything from convenience stores to giant suburban hypermarkets, has a workforce of about 105,000 in the country, making any deal especially sensitive for the government. France has a history of objecting to foreign takeovers of its blue-chip companies.
In 2005, French politicians frowned on talk of an approach from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. to Danone SA (OTC:DANOY), leaving any such deal dead in the water. More recently, deals such as the GE-Alstom transaction were cleared with stringent conditions. That didn’t prevent GE from implementing job cuts later on.
Shares of another French retailer that could be a potential takeover target, Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA, fell after Le Maire’s comments.

626,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 05:47AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Renault: Leaner, Meaner, Greener (Just Don't Mention French Job Cuts)","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Renault signalled a retreat from its global ambitions on Thursday, unveiling a new strategy based on making fewer and more valuable cars.
The struggling French automaker is essentially following the path beaten four years ago by General Motors (NYSE:GM), acknowledging that it has spent the last five years making too many cars, and too many cheap ones at that. It accelerates a process that was already in full swing since last year, when the group sold out of a joint venture with Dongfeng Automotive for the Chinese market.
It also came in the same week that  Renault  (PA:RENA) signed up to a joint venture with hydrogen fuel cell maker  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) in a bid to defend its position in light commercial vehicles, a segment set to gain in importance as online shopping bolsters demand for door-to-door goods delivery.
The plan is a strong statement of intent from new chief executive Luca de Meo, stamping his authority on a company that has drifted alarmingly since the scandalous ouster of Carlos Ghosn that exposed a parlous state of affairs both internally and in relations with its alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY).
In the next five years, the group will cut its manufacturing capacity by 22%, chiefly in Latin America and India, and significantly streamline its product offering, ultimately producing 80% of its output on three basic model platforms shared with Nissan. By 2025, it expects that two-thirds of models in its sales mix will be either battery-powered or hybrids.
Renault hopes to reduce cash breakeven costs by 30% by 2023 and raise operating margins to 5% by 2025. While that would be a clear improvement from under 4% in 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, it would still leave it well below rivals Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), against which it has typically measured itself.
Strikingly, Peugeot and Volkswagen stock sharply outperformed Renault’s on Thursday. Peugeot stock rose 5.0%, helped by the formal completion of its merger with Fiat Chrysler. VW stock was up 4.0%.
That makes sense: the reduction of global overcapacity will help them just as much as Renault, although both may now face more focused competition in their home market of Europe. Renault’s new strategy sees an enhanced role for low-cost manufacturing locations in Romania, Morocco and Turkey.
It is, however, less forthcoming about the future of the high-cost French plants. Not a word in the strategy presentation was devoted to capacity adjustments there. Clearly, this is not the best time to be announcing large-scale job cuts in France, but there never is a good time for that. It remains a nettle that di Meo will have to grasp sooner or later. For all that the strategy calls on Renault to embrace disruption, whether from the electric revolution or changing usage patterns, the reality is that disruption embraced Renault a long time ago, and that the multibillion euro losses of last year have been a long time coming. It will be an uphill struggle."

(Reuters) - PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc said on Thursday it aimed to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2040, as consumers and investors increasingly call upon big corporations to play their part in the fight against global warming.
The Doritos chips and Tropicana juice maker said it would initially cut greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 75% and by 40% in areas that are outside its own manufacturing processes and supply chain by 2030. 
The food-and-beverage giant generated about 57 million metric tonnes of greenhhouse gas emissions globally in 2019, according to its latest annual sustainability report. Over the next nine years, it hopes to cut those emissions by just under half, or an absolute 26 million metric tonnes.
The Purchase, New York-based company said it would first focus on its agricultural supply system, which contributes to a third of PepsiCo's greenhouse gas emissions, before turning to carbon sequestration.
PepsiCo will accelerate the use of smart irrigation systems, improve soil health and reduce deforestation, its chief sustainability officer, Jim Andrew, said in an interview with Reuters.
Other steps will include the use of renewable energy in its offices, recycled PET bottles for beverages, cutting back on business flights and creating sustainable packaging, the company said.
PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which has set its own target of cutting supply chain emissions by 25% by 2030, have emerged as new targets for global activism because of the amount of single-use plastic waste they generate. 
Last year tied with 2016 as the world's warmest year on record, rounding off the hottest decade globally, with scientists saying countries and corporations needed to slash greenhouse gas emissions quickly to avoid catastrophic climate change. 

""We have to drive systemic change. That is going to require partnerships with customers, suppliers, co-packers ... and sometimes competitors to do all of that,"" Andrew said.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",WhatsApp scrambles as users in big Indian market fret over privacy,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - WhatsApp is battling mistrust globally after it updated its privacy policy to let it share some user data with parent Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other group firms, and the backlash risks thwarting its ambitions in its biggest market, India.
Though WhatsApp has yet to see mass uninstalls of its app in India, users concerned about privacy are increasingly downloading rival apps such as Signal and Telegram, research firms say, propelling them higher on the download charts and putting those apps ahead of their ubiquitous rival in India for the first time.
The reaction in India - where 400 million users exchange more messages on WhatsApp than anywhere in the world - has forced the messaging app to unleash an advertising blitz costing tens of millions of rupees this week in at least 10 English and Hindi newspapers.
""Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA,"" WhatsApp said in one newspaper announcement.
It said its privacy policy update ""does not affect the privacy of your messages with your friends and family in any way"". WhatsApp has also said that the changes to the privacy policy are only related to users' interactions with businesses.
When asked for comment, WhatsApp referred Reuters to its published statements on privacy.
The media campaign - similar to one it ran two years ago when it was facing criticism in India for not doing enough to curb disinformation - underscores the severity of the crisis for the world's most popular messaging platform.
Parent Facebook and WhatsApp have bet big on India and any user grumbling could dent their plans.
Last year, Facebook invested $5.7 billion in the digital unit of Indian oil-to-tech group Reliance - the social media giant's biggest deal since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014.
A huge part of the India investment hinges on a WhatsApp and Reliance project to allow about 30 million mum-and-pop store owners to transact digitally.
While WhatsApp's payment service, approved by India's flagship payments processor late last year after two years of waiting, does not fall under the privacy policy update, any sizeable user shift to other messengers could mean losing out to well-entrenched rivals.
CONCERNS ABOUND
Users around the world were alarmed when WhatsApp said on Jan. 4 it reserved the right to share some user data including location and phone number, with Facebook and its units such as Instagram and Messenger.
Even as WhatsApp sought to calm fears and assure users that neither it nor Facebook would have access to their messages, calls, or call logs, the privacy policy update triggered a storm globally with Signal downloads swelling as people looked for alternative messengers.
Signal was the most downloaded free app in India on both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iOS and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android outpacing WhatsApp, according to internet research firm Top10VPN.
Downloads of Signal in India jumped to 7,100,000 between Jan. 5 and Jan. 12, from about 15,000 days earlier, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. Telegram downloads surged 40% while WhatsApp downloads fell 30% in the period.
Manish Khatri, a Mumbai based smartphone seller, said many of his customers were asking if WhatsApp could read their messages.
Indian startups have also been quick to react.
""Here in India WhatsApp/Facebook are abusing their monopoly and taking away millions of users' privacy for granted,"" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, chief executive of Alibaba-backed fintech Paytm, said on Twitter.
""We should move on to @signalapp NOW. It is up to us to become victim or reject such moves.""
MobiKwik, another digital payments firm, had begun using WhatsApp for business communication but has decided to shift to Google and Signal, its boss said.
""I'm making myself unavailable on WhatsApp and I've advised senior executives to do the same,"" MobiKwik CEO Bipin Preet Singh told Reuters.
WhatsApp's payments system in India competes with the likes of Paytm and MobiKwik as well as Google Pay and Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s PhonePe.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Most of AirAsia X Bhd (AAX)'s lessors support a restructuring plan, and the Malaysian airline has received interest from potential investors for fundraising after reorganization, court documents filed this month show.
In emails attached to the court filings, supportive lessors said they wanted to continue discussions with the budget airline and potential new investors, seeking more equitable terms and new commercial arrangements.
The affidavits come after more than a dozen creditors filed to intervene with its proposed court-supervised restructuring, with lessor BOC Aviation Ltd and airport operator Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd arguing that AAX is ""hopelessly insolvent"".
Planemaker Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) also filed an affidavit last month saying it could lose more than $5 billion worth of aircraft orders if the low-cost, long-haul carrier proceeded with the plan.
AAX's senior legal counsel, Shereen Ee, said in court documents seen by Reuters that 15 out of 20 aircraft lessors were not in favour of AAX liquidating, and three other interveners - Airbus, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) Group and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) - were ""not objecting"" to the restructuring plan.
Lessors in favour of a restructuring include Macquarie Aircraft Leasing Services and Aircastle, according to the documents. Rolls-Royce, Macquarie Aircraft Leasing Services and Aircastle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment, saying that the company was continuing discussions but that the details are confidential. AirAsia X also declined to comment.
BNP Paribas - which is a trustee acting on creditors' instructions - declined to comment. 
Aircastle Asia Pacific executive vice president Nigel Harwood told AAX in an email that his firm was not seeking liquidation of the airline, according to the court filings.
""We look forward to working with you to arrive at a revised commercial arrangements once we understand your future business plan with the introduction of new investors,"" he said.
Macquarie's email said it was willing to support a recapitalised AAX and make a restructured lease agreement on condition that the airline has a detailed business plan, credible third-party investors and that lessors have a meaningful say, according to the filings.
AAX said it had received 10 letters from Malaysian and Singaporean corporations and high net worth individuals indicating interest to participate in its proposed fundraising exercise, according to an affidavit. 
The 10 includes Tune Group Sdn Bhd, owned by AirAsia Group Bhd co-founders Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun. Tune is the largest AAX shareholder, with a 17.83% stake.
AAX said it also received interest from a public-listed financial group and the subsidiary of another, both preferring to be unnamed.
AAX, an affiliate of AirAsia Group, last month said it planned to raise up to 200 million ringgit ($49.49 million) by issuing shares to new investors after its debt restructuring.
The airline is seeking to restructure 64.15 billion ringgit of debt. Its accrued debt amounts to 2.24 billion ringgit, without taking into consideration contingent debts such as its large aircraft order book with Airbus. 
Some lessors have argued the Airbus orders should be excluded. However, AAX said the contingent debts must be dealt with and will be reduced by the re-negotiated leases and other commercial contracts.
AAX estimated that lessors that continue with the airline post-restructuring would be able to recover approximately 44-66% of their lease rental loss under new agreements.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: Sanctions-hit Chinese firms surge as global buyers swoop in,"By Samuel Shen and Tom Westbrook
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian and European investors are snatching up discounted Chinese stocks hit by a U.S. investment ban, finding bargains as giant American funds bail out and shrugging off concerns that the sanctions could hurt the companies' prospects.
Swiss investment bank UBS said clients were interested in taking advantage of the selldown. In a week that saw Vanguard and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) announce divestments, cash has poured in to lift Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese telecoms by more than 15%.
China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) is heading for its best week in nearly 12 years. State-owned oil company CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd is up 16% and chipmaker SMIC 10%. All three are subject to the sanctions and have been, or risk being, removed from global indexes.
The flows and price moves point to deep faith abroad and especially at home in the worth of the 35 Chinese companies, and subsidiaries, that Americans are barred from holding after November 2021. It also raises questions over how painful the sanctions will prove.
""I think it's worth monitoring the market closely these days because there will be forced liquidations triggered,"" said UBS' head of China strategy Wendy Liu. ""We do have European investors interested in stocks blacklisted by the U.S.""
U.S. funds are scrambling to sell following a November order from President Donald Trump banning buying companies deemed to have links with China's military. He clarified on Wednesday that the ban extends to owning the stocks.
Passive investors are also responding to the removal of more than a dozen companies from benchmarks compiled by MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Vanguard and BlackRock have given few details of their divestments and have not detailed exactly which stocks they have sold. Vanguard has said it has sold to comply with the rules and BlackRock said its index funds have responded to index changes. 
""Opportunity exists now,"" said portfolio manager Dave Wang at Singapore's Nuvest Capital, which has increased exposure to state-owned firms in the construction and energy sectors in China since the U.S. sanctions were announced.
""Profit outlook is trending upwards, while valuation has been depressed and lots of pessimism is priced in due to the (U.S.) list.""
HOME BUYERS
Support for the sanctioned companies seems to run strongest in China, where brokers have issued buy recommendations and some retail investors mentioned patriotism along with profit as their motive for buying.
Ding Ning, a retail investor on investment website Xueqiu.com, estimates China Mobile already offers a good dividend and ""if you take into account the potential valuation repairment, supporting share prices for the country would generate handsome returns"".
Cash flows into Hong Kong from the mainland hit record levels this week as Chinese investors snapped up sanctioned companies listed there.
Holdings by mainland Chinese in China Mobile, China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), China Railway Construction Corp and CNOOC have more than tripled since the companies fell under the remit of sanctions, among other heavy inflows to affected stocks.
But though the stocks have rallied, prices are still lower than before the companies were sanctioned, and they face months more of selling as well as loss of access to the world's deepest pool of capital. There is also a lot of uncertainty around the details of the rules.
But U.S. fund managers say investors are taking no chances. 
""The prevalence of U.S. firms all along the financial supply chain means that liquidity will dry up,"" said David Loevinger, California-based managing director at asset manager TCW's emerging markets group.
""This is forcing investors to sell now while they still can."" 
And that means picking their moment before November to part with the sanctioned sections of their exposure to the world's best-performing big economy.

""I think the fundamentals don't change. They're still sound,"" said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions in Asia at France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management. ""The burden of these sanctions has really fallen on U.S. investors.""

632,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>","Indian stores shuttered by farmer protests cost Reliance, Walmart millions in revenue: sources","By Manoj Kumar and Aditya Kalra
MOHALI, India (Reuters) - Dozens of Reliance Industries' retail stores and a giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) outlet face revenue losses of millions of dollars after being forced to shut for more than three months over protests against India's new farm laws, sources said. 
Thousands of farmers from states including northern Punjab have camped for weeks on the outskirts of the capital, in a bid to force Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the laws they contend will benefit corporates, rather than cultivators.
Fears of farmers' agitation in Punjab, home to many protest leaders, have stoked companies' fears over vandalism and the safety of employees, prompting the closure of dozens of shops, store employees and industry sources said.
Since October, more than half the roughly 100 stores of top retailer Reliance Retail in Punjab and Walmart's 50,000-square-foot (4,645-sq-m) wholesale outlet in the district of Bathinda, a centre of the protests, have been shut, the sources added. 
""We are scared of the protesting farmers,"" said a senior official of a shuttered Reliance outlet in Mohali, a prosperous city located in the farm belt. 
One industry source said estimated losses for Reliance from its state-wide shutdowns run into millions of dollars. Two other sources said Walmart's estimated revenue loss from its store, one of 29 such outlets nationwide, has crossed $8 million. 
""The farmers camp outside the Walmart store daily, they don't let anybody go in,"" said one of the sources, adding that the store employed about 250 people.
Thousands of items in the store are gathering dust and have passed their use-by date.
Reliance store officials and the sources, who have direct knowledge of the situation, sought anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.
Walmart and its Indian unit, Flipkart, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reliance, India's largest private company, also did not respond.
Both firms can absorb the losses for now, said Ankur Bisen, head of consumer and retail at consultancy Technopak Advisors, but he added, ""They have to keep their fingers crossed that shutdowns do not extend to other states."" 
A Punjab official said authorities were ready to provide security but could do little if companies had decided to keep their stores shut.
For their part, farmer unions have vowed to continue the protests and block stores from opening, even as the Supreme Court this week ordered a temporary suspension of the farm laws as it sets up a panel to examine their complaints.
""Our protests against corporates like Reliance will continue ... there is no question of lifting our sit-ins,"" said Kulwant Singh Sandhu, an official of one protesting group, the Democratic Farmers' Union.
Another farm leader, Jagtar Singh, said protests against Reliance would continue until the government repealed the laws. 
India says the laws passed in September will boost farmers' incomes by letting them deal directly with big companies and bypass government-regulated wholesale markets.
But many of the unions disagree, saying they risk losing their bargaining power and becoming vulnerable to potential bulk buyers such as Walmart and Reliance.
They fear the eventual disappearance of the guaranteed prices the government pays for their grain.
Reliance, controlled by one of Asia's richest men, Mukesh Ambani, has said it would require suppliers to abide by these prices, known as minimum support prices, or a similar mechanism.
In December, the protests also disrupted Reliance's nearly 2,000 telecom towers and several petrol pumps in Punjab. Protests along highways linking it to New Delhi have disrupted transport and industries such as textiles.

In November, Punjab estimated economic losses from the protests at $4 billion, while one industry group has pegged the overall hit to India's economy at $9.6 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Thursday, helped by the expectation of additional U.S. stimulus while Christmas trading reports flooded in from the retail sector.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher after the Federal Statistics Office estimated that the economy shrunk by 'only' 5% last year, less than the 5.2% expected. The CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%. 
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), the U.K.'s biggest food retailer, reported a 6.4% rise in comparable sales for the third quarter of its fiscal year and a 6.1% rise over the Christmas period. However, its stock fell 1.6% with its profit guidance for the year unchanged while Covid-related costs rose.
Associated British Foods (OTC:ASBFY), the owner of cut price fashion house Primark, stock fell 0.7% after the retailer said lost sales due to the pandemic will top one billion pounds, above the 650 million pounds previously mentioned. Fast-fashion rival Boohoo (LON:BOOH) stock fell 0.2% despite the company reporting surging sales during the lockdown and lifting its sales growth forecasts for 2021. It warned of an impact from higher administrative costs due to Brexit, but didn’t put a figure on this.
In France, meanwhile,  Renault  (PA:RENA) stock fell 2.6% with the struggling automaker unveiling a new strategic plan aimed at raising operating margins to over 5% by 2025, not least by cutting its output by over 20% in that period.
Elsewhere, shipping giant Maersk AS (OTC:AMKBY) rose 2.0% on data showing Chinese exports up 18% on the year in December.
The idea of additional stimulus in the U.S. has boosted global equity markets ever since the Democrats took the Senate at the start of the year, and was given another boost overnight after CNN reported that President-elect Joe Biden was mulling an additional package as large as $2 trillion. 
However, gains are likely to be limited Thursday with governments across Europe tightening their coronavirus restrictions over fears about a fast-spreading strain first detected in the U.K..
Italy, whose government is on the verge of collapse, is set to extend its Covid-19 state of emergency to the end of April. The Netherlands will stretch its lockdown measures by at least three weeks, while France is thinking of lengthening its nationwide curfew.
In the U.S., the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on the single charge of incitement of insurrection for his role in last week’s rampage on Capitol Hill, making him the first U.S. president to face two such trials.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, with traders having to balance the pandemic impact on demand with a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday showed a draw of 3.247 million barrels last week, the fifth week in a row of reductions.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $52.55 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $55.63. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,841.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2155.

Adecco competes globally with rivals Randstad, ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) as well as local staffing companies, which are all seeing big changes in the employment market caused by the pandemic.
Many companies which held back from cutting jobs last year will launch restructuring drives in the first half of this year, Christophe Catoir, president of the Adecco brand - which places temporary and permanent workers - told Reuters.
""For 2021 you will see a difficult impact for white collar hiring,"" he said. ""Restructuring has started in the fourth quarter of 2020 and will run into the first and second quarter of this year.
""We have not touched the bottom of the swimming pool yet,"" said Catoir, who sits on Adecco's board. ""In 25 years I have never seen such uncertainty.""
In its third-quarter results in November, Adecco Group reported a 15% drop in revenues compared with a year earlier, although the company said it was seeing a gradual improvement as businesses reopened.
For 2021, Catoir expects there will a marked decline in the availability of permanent placements for white collar professionals in areas like payroll management, financial control and other corporate functions.
This will be replaced by a rise in temporary hiring, he said as companies prefer to remain flexible.
""Although each wave of the virus is less impactful than the previous one, the companies are weaker than before,"" Catoir said, meaning they will hold off on permanent hiring for the time being.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries slipped on Thursday on a report that President-elect Joe Biden will announce a stimulus package as big as $2 trillion, while Japanese stocks surged to a new three-decade peak as investors extended bets on a global growth rebound.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points to 1.1105% after CNN reported on the possibility Biden could spend $2 trillion, which is much more than market expectations and which would be funded by borrowing.
Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.9% at its highest level since August 1990. It has gained 25% since the end of October.
MSCI's index of Asia shares outside Japan was steady a whisker short of Monday's all-time high. S&P 500 futures, FTSE futures and EuroSTOXX 50 futures all rose about 0.2%.
Treasury yields had tempered their surge this year on Wednesday as reassurances from the Federal Reserve about its purchase program calmed a heavy bond selloff and investors bet a big spending agenda can clear a Democrat-controlled Congress.
Biden is due to outline his economic plans later on Thursday and U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will also speak, either one of which could set yields rising again. 
""The number one question for global markets and equities will be when will the Fed start tapering,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) in Hong Kong.
""This is where you can get some concern... but at the moment it is something that is a bit premature. We are in a context where you have growth accelerating, economic indicators are good, and in the U.S. the increased probability of fiscal stimulus.""
Currency markets are taking a little more of a wait-and-see approach, as investors are short dollars and wondering whether the eventual tapering might limit the greenback's decline.[FRX/]
The dollar rose 0.2% to 104.12 yen with U.S. yields after the CNN report, which cited one lawmaker in contact with Biden's advisers as its source. 
The Australian and New Zealand dollars firmed after slipping a little overnight, with the Aussie at $0.7761 and the kiwi at $0.7203. The euro nursed broad but modest losses at $1.2151 and 126.42 yen. 
EXPORTS BOOM
Stellar economic statistics, meanwhile, kept flowing in North Asia. China's exports grew more than expected in December - pointing to solid global demand - while machinery orders rose for a second straight month in Japan.
Chinese blue chips eased from a 13-year peak hit on Wednesday as investors took some profits. [.SS]
Hong Kong listed shares of tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent rose after sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that plans to extend a U.S. investment ban to the stocks had been scrapped.
In Washington, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump for a second time. But markets have been more focused on his attacks on Chinese companies.
Trump bolstered a ban on U.S. investments in Chinese companies deemed to be linked with the military by clarifying late on Wednesday that American investors cannot own them after November 2021.
In commodity markets, oil futures nursed modest losses as fresh surges in coronavirus cases stoke worries about more lockdowns and lower energy demand. Brent crude futures were steady at $55.95 a barrel and U.S. crude futures flat at $52.88.
Gold, which pays no interest, has suffered as U.S. yields have climbed and it traded 0.2% lower at $1,840 an ounce - well below a two-month peak of $1,959 hit a week ago. [GOL/]

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening marginally higher Thursday, as Christmas trading reports flood in from the retail sector.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.
 Tesco  (OTC:TSCDY), the U.K.'s biggest food retailer and online retailer boohoo both caught the eye with their updates, Tesco (LON:TSCO) reporting a 6.4% rise in comparable sales for the third quarter of its fiscal year and a 6.1% rise over the Christmas period. Online fashion group boohoo (LON:BOOH) meanwhile raised its sales guidance for the year to a rise of around 37% from 30% previously. 
In France, meanwhile, struggling automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) unveiled a new strategic plan aimed at raising operating margins to over 5% by 2025, not least by cutting its output by over 20% in that period.
The idea of additional stimulus in the U.S. has boosted global equity markets ever since the Democrats took the Senate at the start of the year and was given another boost overnight after CNN reported that President-elect Joe Biden was mulling an additional package as large as $2 trillion.
However, gains are likely to be limited Thursday with governments across Europe tightening their coronavirus restrictions over fears about a fast-spreading strain first detected in the U.K..
Italy, whose government is on the verge of collapse, is set to extend its Covid-19 state of emergency to the end of April.  The Netherlands will stretch its lockdown measures by at least three weeks, while France is thinking of lengthening its nationwide curfew.
The vaccination programs continue to be rolled out across the continent, but these are not expected to help to any great degree for another two to three months.
That said, there was some good news on the vaccine front as early trial data published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) one-shot Covid vaccine appeared to generate an immune response in both the young and elderly.
Elsewhere, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on the single charge of incitement of insurrection for his role in last week’s rampage on Capitol Hill, making him the first U.S. president to face two such trials.
Oil prices edged lower Thursday, with traders having to balance the pandemic impact on demand with a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday showed a draw of 3.247 million barrels last week, the fifth week in a row of reductions, while Tuesday’s data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 5.821 million barrels.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $52.90 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $55.97. 
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,840/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2145.

PayPal acquired the 30% stake it doesn't already own in China's GoPay, formally known as Guofubao Information Technology Co., on Dec. 31, 2020, according to shareholder data from the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. 
Financial details weren't disclosed in the data. The stake purchase came a year after PayPal bought a 70% stake in GoPay for an undisclosed amount，then becoming the first foreign company licensed to provide online payment services in China.
PayPal declined to comment. 
In taking full control of one of the smaller players in the world's largest payment market, PayPal will compete with domestic payments giants Alipay, owned by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group, and WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, as China fully opens up its financial sector.
The stake purchase also comes amid Beijing's antimonopoly campaign against  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and other Internet companies.
Last August, PayPal appointed Hannah Qiu as head of China business, responsible for formulating long-term strategy in the world's second-biggest economy. Qiu was a former executive at insurer Ping An Group's fintech unit OneConnect, according to PayPal's website. 
PayPal said in its 2019 annual report its initial focus in China is to provide cross-border payment solutions to Chinese merchants and consumers, linking the country's commerce ecosystem to PayPal's global network. 
But in that area, PayPal also faces the prospect of competition from Chinese companies. 
Bill Deng, Chief Executive and co-founder of XTransfer, a Shanghai-based payment platform start-up that facilitates cross-border money transfers for Chinese merchants, was not shy about his ambitions to emulate PayPal.

""We see ourselves as China's PayPal in cross-border businesses,"" Deng told Reuters.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK)'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan was approved by a U.S. judge on Wednesday, giving lenders control of the firm and ending a contentious trial.
Chesapeake will emerge from bankruptcy with about $3 billion in new financing, a $7 billion reduction in debt, and $1.7 billion cut from gas processing and pipeline costs. 
Investors who committed last spring to back the restructuring as energy tumbled stand to benefit enormously. A rebound in energy prices raised Chesapeake's value to about $5.13 billion, the judge hearing the case said. 
Once the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, Chesapeake filed for court protection last June, reeling from overspending on assets and from a sudden decline in demand and prices spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Creditors who opposed the plan claimed Chesapeake was bankrupt long before it sought court protection and harshly criticized terms that gave backers including mutual fund giant Franklin Advisers Inc. heady returns. 
First-lien note holders stand to get a 130% return on their claims and Franklin 41%, but unsecured creditors will only recover about 4%, said Robert Stack, who represented unsecured creditors. The plan improperly favors a few at the expense of many, he said. His remarks drew a rebuke from bankruptcy court Judge David Jones. 
Chesapeake managers ""should not be criticized,"" said Jones, ""they should be complimented,"" citing the energy market crash. ""I reject the assertion that people threw caution to the wind."" 
The plan will allow Chesapeake to emerge ""a stronger and more competitive enterprise,"" spokesman Gordon Pennoyer said. 
Jones refused to consider a last minute offer by an investment group led by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group to replace the financing that gave first-lien and Franklin heady returns. 
At the same time, Jones acknowledged his decision to allocate a significant number of share-rights to Franklin and others in exchange for their financing provided what he called a ""good deal."" 

""I might have made a different decision with the benefit of hindsight,"" Jones said. ""The fact of the matter is I didn't.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, following a mixed session for U.S. shares, over continued expectations of further U.S. stimulus measures and as investors digested the U.S.’ decision to impeach incumbent President Donald Trump.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.38% by 9:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component slid 2.10%. Trade data released earlier in the day was positive, with all metrics outperforming. Exports grew 18.1% year-on-year, imports grew 6.5% year-on-year and the trade balance was $78.17 billion in December.
Chinese tech companies  Alibaba  Group Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (OTC:TCEHY) saw gains in their U.S. shares after reports that the duo could be spared from a U.S. investment ban.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.21%. Police have reportedly arrested 11 individuals for aiding a group of 12 people to flee the city.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.45%. South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.04% and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.48%.
U.S. Treasury yields saw their first full-session decline in 2021 after rising for six consecutive sessions as investors expect more spending by the incoming Joe Biden administration. An auction of $24 billion in 30-year bonds was also well bid, which dragged yields down further.
However, yields are expected to resume their climb, partly due to expectations of further stimulus packages from the Biden administration, which takes office in the following week.
“There's this push-pull relationship between what happens in the bond market and equity markets … bond yields have risen in prospect of more stimulus spending and if yields continue to rise to there’s going to be some pressure on equity markets,” Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management senior investment strategist Charlie Ripley told Reuters.
Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard pushed back against suggestions the Fed could taper its bond-buying program in 2021. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will take part in a webinar later in the day, where he is expected to discuss topics including the central bank’s policy framework.
Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the central bank will keep an easy stance for as long as needed.
The House of Representatives voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on the single charge of incitement of insurrection for his role in a riot by his supporters that left five dead and Capitol Hill ransacked.
This is Trump’s second impeachment, coming a little more than a year after his first and makes him the first U.S. president to face a second impeachment. All Democrats and ten Republicans, including Liz Cheney, voted for the impeachment. Top U.S. officials have reportedly cancelled international travel plans for the week amid the chaos.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic.
“This will be a great year for the economy and earnings, but just a good year for the stock market … in other words, I think multiples are held back a bit because of modestly rising interest rates and inflation,” Nuveen chief equity strategist Bob Doll told Bloomberg."

(Reuters) - Pet retailer Petco Health and Wellness Company Inc said on Wednesday it sold shares in its initial public offering (IPO) at $18 apiece, above its target range, to raise about $816.5 million.
Petco, which is owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) and private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, had aimed to sell 48 million shares at a target range of $14 to $17 per share.
The IPO, which values Petco at almost $4 billion, signals that investor appetite for new stocks remains robust following a stellar 2020, which was the strongest IPO market in two decades.
Earlier in the day, shares of online lender Affirm Holdings Inc doubled in their Nasdaq debut after selling shares in its IPO above the company's target range.
The U.S. pet industry is seen by analysts as being more resistant to economic shocks than the broader economy and has benefited during the COVID-19 pandemic from an increase in pet adoption.
Rival online pet products retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc has seen its stock rise more than 100% in the last six months. Barkbox, a provider of subscription boxes of dog treats, last month agreed to go public through a merger with Northern Star Acquisition Corp.
San Diego, California-based Petco operates about 1,470 stores across the United States and Puerto Rico and has more than 100 in-store veterinary hospitals.
Founded in 1965, Petco was acquired CPP Investments and CVC Capital Partners in 2015 for about $4.7 billion. Petco reported net sales of $3.6 billion and net loss of $20.3 million in the 39 weeks ended Oct. 31 last year.
Petco shares are due to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday under the symbol ""WOOF.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

Under the amended directive, by Nov. 11, 2021, U.S. investors will be required to have completely divested their holdings of securities of companies designated by the Defense Department as owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
The change expands the scope of the initial November executive order, which initially only restricted U.S. investors from buying those securities by that date. Reuters had previously reported that the change was under consideration.
""Today’s executive order ensures that the United States retains a key tool to protect U.S. investors from funding Chinese military modernization,"" a senior administration official told Reuters. 
The executive order is part of Trump's bid to cement his tough-on-China legacy in the waning days of his Presidency. It also sought to give teeth to a 1999 law that tasked the Defense Department with drafting a list of Chinese companies it believes are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
Among the 35 companies that the DOD has blacklisted so far are China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO). But Reuters and other outlets reported earlier on Wednesday the administration had scrapped plans to blacklist tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent.

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) said on Thursday it had closed its first fund targeting real estate investments in Asia Pacific at $1.7 billion.
The announcement comes days after KKR closed its inaugural Asia infrastructure fund, as the private equity powerhouse expands its platforms in the region.
John Pattar, KKR head of real estate Asia, told Reuters the new fund would focus on Asia's urbanization trends, corporate carve-outs of non-core real estate assets in Japan and also take-private opportunities in markets including Australia, Singapore and Japan.
""Increased domestic consumption, productivity and urbanization – combined with the acceleration of e-commerce and platform-based businesses and the evolution of the traditional office landscape – is fundamentally reshaping the region's real estate sector,"" he said.
The fund is also looking at opportunities in countries such as South Korea, which has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, said Hong Kong-based Pattar, a veteran real estate investor poached by KKR in 2018 to lead its Asia real estate efforts.
""We look at markets that handle COVID best,"" he said. ""...Asia Pacific is the first to recover in 2021.""
KKR's real estate fundraising comes as private equity firms globally have expanded from a model of buying out companies to turn around and sell for profit. They now invest through a range of alternative asset management products including infrastructure, real estate, hedge funds and credit.
Investment firms raised $9 billion in 47 Asia-focused real estate funds last year, following a record $26 billion raised in 2019, according to data provider Preqin. KKR’s U.S.-based rival Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) raised the region’s biggest real estate fund in 2018 at $7.1 billion.
KKR will also be competing with regional firms such as Hillhouse Capital Group, which has hired former Warburg Pincus and Blackstone dealmakers to build out its real estate capabilities.
The New York-headquartered firm launched its dedicated global real estate platform in 2011 and has about $14 billion of real estate assets under management as of the end of September 2020.
In Asia Pacific, it has deployed more than $1.5 billion of equity across about 20 real estate transactions since 2011.
Its portfolio includes office tower Namsan Square in Seoul, Oasis Shopping Centre in Australia's Gold Coast and Hong Kong retail assets Lake Silver and Parkside.

648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 08:09PM ET</span>","U.S. Decide Against Investing Ban on Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. officials deliberated but ultimately decided against banning American investment in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., a person familiar with the discussions said, removing a cloud of uncertainty over Asia’s two biggest corporations.
The Treasury Department blocked a Pentagon effort to add the two internet firms on grounds they aided the military, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing private talks. Officials also debated blocking search leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). but dropped the plan, the person added. Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares rose 4.3% while Tencent’s American Depositary Receipts climbed 2.9% on news of the reprieve, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The decision removes uncertainty hanging over Chinese social media and gaming leader Tencent and Alibaba, the e-commerce titan founded by billionaire Jack Ma that’s now under intense regulatory scrutiny by Beijing regulators. Imposing a ban on the pair would have marked the most dramatic escalation yet by President Donald Trump’s administration, given the sheer size of the two firms and the difficulty unwinding positions. At more than $1 trillion, their combined market value is nearly twice the size of Spain’s stock market, while the firms together account for about a 10th of the weighting for MSCI Inc.’s emerging markets benchmark.

Citing national security, Trump previously signed an executive order in November requiring investors to pull out of Chinese companies linked to that nation’s military. The Defense Department will add more companies to the roster, the person said without elaborating.
That would further fray the relationship between the world’s two largest economies, which have clashed over everything from Covid-19 to Hong Kong. Authorities in Washington have ramped up efforts to deprive Chinese companies of U.S. capital in the final months of the Trump administration, adding to economic tensions as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take over this month.
Hasty measures have at times sown confusion in markets and prompted price swings, such as when the New York Stock Exchange reversed course twice on a decision to delist three Chinese telecommunications companies. The NYSE is now proceeding with its original delisting plan after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disagreed with its decision to give the firms a reprieve.
Trump’s order banned trading in affected securities starting Jan. 11. If Biden leaves Trump’s executive order in place, U.S. investment firms and pension funds would be required to sell their holdings in companies linked to the Chinese military by Nov. 11. And if the U.S. determines additional companies have military ties in the future, American investors will be given 60 days from that determination to divest.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday asked Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles over media control unit (MCU) failures that could pose safety risks by leading to touchscreen displays not working.
The auto safety agency made the unusual request in a formal letter to Tesla after upgrading a safety probe in November, saying it had tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles ""contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment but it must respond to NHTSA by Jan. 27. If it does not agree it must provide the agency ""with a full explanation of its decision."" 
It is unusual for the agency to formally demand a recall. Automakers typically voluntarily agree to a recall if sought in discussions by regulators.
The agency said it sought the recall after considering ""Tesla’s technical briefing presentation ... and evaluated Tesla’s assertions.""
NHTSA added that ""during our review of the data, Tesla provided confirmation that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity."" 
NHTSA said other automakers have issued numerous recalls for similar safety issues, the agency told Tesla, including a detailed list of prior callbacks.
The agency said touchscreen failures pose significant safety issues, including the loss of rearview/backup camera images. It noted nine prior recalls by other automakers for similar problems.
The Tesla vehicles that lose touchscreen use may see driver assistance Autopilot system and turn signal functionality impacted due to potential loss of audible chimes, driver sensing, and alerts associated with these vehicle functions, NHTSA said. It added that loss of alerts tied to systems like Autopilot ""increases the risk of a crash occurring because drivers may be unaware of system malfunctions.""
Touchscreen failures result in drivers being unable to use windshield defogging and defrosting systems that ""may decrease the driver’s visibility in inclement weather, increasing the risk of crash.""
NHTSA noted that ""Tesla has implemented several over-the-air updates in an attempt to mitigate some of the issues ... but tentatively believes these updates are procedurally and substantively insufficient."" It noted that under law ""vehicle manufacturers are required to conduct recalls to remedy safety-related defects.""
NHTSA said in November it reviewed 12,523 claims and complaints about the issue, which would impact roughly 8% of the vehicles under investigation.

Many complaints said Tesla requires owners to pay to replace the unit once warranties expire.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson signed an order on Wednesday directing the agency to take a ""zero tolerance policy"" after supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on some recent flights.
Dickson told Reuters the FAA’s special emphasis program would last through March 30 and warned disruptive passengers could face up to $35,000 fines and possible jail time. He emphasized the agency will not issue warning letters or negotiate penalties.
""We will no longer adjudicate certain of these unruly passenger cases with counseling or warnings. We're going to go straight to enforcement,"" Dickson said in an interview.
He said he briefed airlines on the new policy. ""We've seen a disturbing increase in these incidents.... We'll take the strongest possible enforcement action against any passenger who engages in it.""
Dickson said the FAA could refer cases for criminal prosecution to the Justice Department, which could seek sentences of up to 20 years for flight disturbances.
The president of a large flight attendants' union, who has pressed authorities to take strong action against disruptive passengers, applauded the FAA's stance.
""First strike and you're out,"" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA representing workers at 17 airlines, said in a statement.
Numerous videos have been posted of unruly behavior on Washington flights, including one American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) flight to Phoenix in which the pilot threatened to divert ""to the middle of Kansas and dump people off.""
Nelson had urged airlines to bar Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol from flying out of Washington after exhibiting ""mob mentality behavior"" on flights into the region.
On Friday, Alaska Airlines said it banned 14 passengers from future travel after ""unacceptable"" behavior on a flight from Washington to Seattle.
U.S airlines and law enforcement agencies have bolstered security at Washington-area airports with Capitol Police now assigned to DC airports to ensure lawmaker safety after videos emerged of lawmakers being harassed in airport terminals.

On Tuesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump supporters who breached the U.S. Capitol should be banned from flying and added to a government ""no-fly"" list.

The update for analysts and investors is the first glimpse of De Meo's full vision for Renault after taking the reins last July, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, following a stint running Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Seat brand. 
Four years after former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn unveiled his bombastic view for Renault, based on expanding car volumes globally, De Meo has already signalled a change of tack.
The group is likely to exit some unprofitable countries or markets, and has yet to reveal the line-up of cars it wants to entice customers with over the next three to eight years. 
The French carmaker, which was struggling with waning sales even before the COVID-19 crisis and has been trying to get a partnership with Japan's Nissan (OTC:NSANY) back on track, is already counting on cost cuts to reboot the business.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 05:10PM ET</span>",Emirates boss says Boeing must recognize top-down role in MAX flaws,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - The head of one of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's biggest customers, Dubai's Emirates, wants the planemaker to demonstrate fundamental changes after producing a flawed 737 MAX jet and has urged it to recognize ""culpability and accountability"" from the very top.
Influential Emirates President Tim Clark said a crisis over crashes of its 737 MAX had damaged the air travel industry as a whole, but he was confident the redesigned jet was safe.
""Boeing need to take a good hard look at themselves; I'm sure they have,"" Clark told Reuters.
""But they have to (show) evidence to people like the airline community, the traveling public, that they have made the changes that are required of them in a transparent manner,"" he said, while also suggesting a shift of emphasis on financial matters.
""That (can) only be done at board level and executed ... at senior level,"" Clark said. ""I believe they still have work to do in Boeing to get themselves sorted out ... There is a top-down culpability and accountability and they need to recognize that.""
Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The comments from the head of one of the world's biggest carriers, with Boeing jets worth over $50 billion at list prices on order, are among the most direct airline criticisms since a 20-month ban on MAX flights was lifted in December.
Last week Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion in a deal with federal prosecutors over a fraud conspiracy charge over the MAX's flawed development.
Clark's critique, aimed at the highest echelons of the world's largest aerospace company, stood in contrast to the settlement's focus on two lower-level Boeing employees who prosecutors say deceived U.S. regulators.
The jet, a staple of short-haul travel across the world, was grounded in March 2019 after crashes linked to flawed software.
'SHUFFLING DECK'
""Clearly there were process and practices, attitudes - DNA if you like - that needed to be resolved from the top down. It is pointless shuffling the deck,"" Clark said, though he stopped short of laying out precise actions Boeing should take.
Boeing should understand the magnitude of damage to the industry and make ""fundamental structural changes,"" Clark said. 
Since the crashes, Boeing has fired its former chief executive, added a board safety committee and agreed to strengthen internal controls. Boeing however turned for its new CEO to an insider, Dave Calhoun, a long-serving board member.
It says it has learned ""many hard lessons"" from the crisis. 
On Wednesday, Calhoun named Mike Delaney chief aerospace safety officer, a new role. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has admitted mistakes during certification, has seen its global leadership tarnished by the crisis. 
Clark backed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency for taking a ""very hard line"" over the re-design.

""This isn't a sort of motherhood level scrutiny,"" he said. ""This is a detailed assessment of everything that makes that aircraft fly, then I think it should something that people should be relaxed about flying in.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 index closed slightly higher on Wednesday with defensive sectors leading gains as investors waited for details of the next U.S. fiscal stimulus plan and Congress began President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings. 
U.S. Treasury yields pulled back after rising for six straight sessions, giving a boost to rate-sensitive defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate, while economically sensitive cyclical sectors lagged. 
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) advanced quickly, after the chipmaker said it would replace its Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware (NYSE:VMW) Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger next month.
Wall Street's main indexes had hit record highs last week on expectations for a hefty COVID-19 relief package even as an attack on Capitol Hill ramped up political uncertainty.
But a day before details of incoming President Joe Biden's fiscal relief plan was due to be announced, investors appeared to pull to the sidelines.
""Investors have been for some time looking to the second half of 2021. They continue to hope for a real reopening,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. Investment Strategist, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, New York. 
Referring to the Treasury yield decline, Mahajan said: ""A day like today is probably natural after a long run. Some of the laggard (stock sectors) are leading.""
As U.S. House of Representatives gathered to consider a second impeachment for Trump after the Capitol invasion by his supporters which left five dead, some investors were watching to see whether impeachment could delay stimulus or other parts of in-coming President Joe Biden's agenda. 
""The headlines coming in are causing some near term jitters but it looks like investors are looking past that to the rest of the year,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Jersey City, New Jersey. 
While utilities and real estate lead percentage gains among the 11 major S&P sectors during the session the biggest losers were the more economically sensitive sectors such as materials and industrials. 
""Investors are in wait-and-see mode for now ... if you're moving to the sidelines you probably might want to be moving out of cyclicals,"" said Cruz.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.22 points, or 0.03%, to 31,060.47, the S&P 500 gained 8.65 points, or 0.23%, to 3,809.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.52 points, or 0.43%, to 13,128.95.
The S&P had expanded its gains temporarily in the late afternoon before losing ground again after the Federal Reserve released its ""Beige Book"" report which showed U.S. economic activity increasing modestly in recent weeks as employment dropped in a growing number of Fed districts due to a surge in coronavirus infections.
Most of the 11 major S&P sectors gained ground. After boasting a record closing high in the previous day's session, the Russell 2000 pulled back slightly and the S&P growth index outperformed the value index.
Earnings reports from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were also on investors minds as they will mark the unofficial start to the fourth-quarter earnings season on Friday. 

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)'s shares climbed as the U.S. government said it would buy 1.25 million additional doses of its COVID-19 antibody cocktail for about $2.63 billion. Shares of VMware fell after the Intel news.

Investing.com – The Dow ended unchanged Wednesday, as political turmoil on Capitol Hill gripped investor attention ahead of the vote in the House to impeach President Donald Trump for an historic second time.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.03%, or 8 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.43%.
The House of Representative voted 232 to 197 to impeach President Donald Trump for inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol last week. But the trial in the Senate is unlikely to take place until after Trump leaves the White House as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected a call for an emergency session. The impeachment trial in the upper chamber is unlikely to get underway before Jan. 19, just a day before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.  
Still, a conviction after impeachment is ""unlikely to occur,"" Scotiabank said, as it requires a two-thirds Senate majority, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to break ranks and vote with Democrats.
Beyond the backdrop of rising political tensions, utilities and technology stocks kept the broader market above the flatline.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) rallied 7% to boost tech after the chipmaker confirmed Chief Executive Bob Swan would step down next month following pressure from activist investor Third Point (NYSE:TPRE).
As well as Intel, the Fab 5 stocks also pushed tech higher.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) traded in the green.  
But weakness in cyclicals, paced by a decline in energy, kept gains in check
Energy fell nearly 1% on weaker oil prices after data showing a rise in weekly U.S. product inventories offset a larger-than-expected draw in crude stockpiles.  
The weakness in value stocks come as daily coronavirus infections in the U.S. surged to a record high.
""The U.S. has seen a sizable resurgence of the virus as of late with the death toll reaching a new daily record of nearly 4,500. According to Johns Hopkins, the U.S. caseload has reached 22.8M with more than 380,000 deaths,"" Stifel said.
But further fiscal support is expected to cushion the economic fallout and boost vaccine distribution efforts.
Biden will lay out his stimulus plan on Thursday. The plan is likely to include a proposal to boost direct payments to Americans to $2,000 from $600, provide state and local aid, and fund the ongoing vaccine roll out.
""The good news is ... the economy and equity markets will likely be helped by additional stimulus spending in addition to the recovery in consumer spending that we are projecting over the course of the final three quarter of 2021,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
In other news, Urban Outfitters reported weaker sales over the holiday period, sending shares 6% lower. The retailer reported down sales in the two months through Dec. 31 were down 8.4% year-on-year, and announced that Trish Donnelly is set to stand down from Jan. 31."

Investing.com -- Stocks waffled for most of the day, but tech staged an afternoon rally as lawmakers gathered to impeach President Donald Trump for the second time in a year. 
The unprecedented political move comes a week after an unruly mob of Trump supporters overtook the Capitol, causing damage and resulting in five deaths. Since then, the grounds surrounding the Hill in D.C. have been fortified with National Guard troops, fencing and barricades. The House began voting shortly before the market closed, and the result was 232 in favor of impeachment to 197 opposed.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) led technology stocks higher after announcing it would bring in a new CEO from VMware Inc (NYSE:VMW). The so-called Fab 5 tech stocks also pushed higher. 
With one week to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, coronavirus cases continued to surge. Biden has promised to immediately address ways to combat the virus, including pushing for a broader rollout of vaccines. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.  
1. Earnings reporting season about to kick off
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is set to report earnings on Thursday. Of course it hasn’t been a good year for airline stocks, but travelers did return to the skies over the holidays, which take up a chunk of the fourth quarter.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect a loss of $2.47 a share on revenue of $3.78 billion.
2. Another round of stock debuts to kick off the year
On Wednesday the “buy now, pay later” app  Affirm Holdings  Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) debuted with a surge of more than 100% after opening at $90.90 a share. They priced at $49, falling in line with other recent IPOs that popped when they started trading. Affirm is the latest effort by PayPal founder Max Levchin. 
It’s not the only IPO people are watching this week. Poshmark, the used clothing and goods online marketplace, is set to price its IPO Wednesday night and open for trading on Thursday. At a range of $35 to $39, the listing values Poshmark at around $2.7 billion. 
3. A speech by Fed Chair Powell
Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak around 12:30 PM ET (1630 GMT) during a livestream event hosted by Princeton University’s Bendheim Center for Finance. He may bring up economic stimulus, which many Fed policy makers have said is crucial to the economic recovery.
Incoming Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer reportedly has asked Biden for $1.3 trillion in stimulus. That would come on top of the $900 billion package Congress approved last month and boost the individual payments for qualified households to $2,000 from $600.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. Chamber expects high-level Chinese visit early in Biden administration,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sees ""every indication"" that a high-ranking delegation of Chinese officials will visit Washington early in the administration of President-elect Joe Biden, a top Chamber official said on Wednesday.
Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs for the business group, told reporters such a visit could help lay the groundwork for improved U.S.-China relations and progress toward an expanded trade agreement.
""There are some challenges that we have to overcome in the relationship, and it's not going to be a straight line. It's going to be a bumpy road ahead,"" he said.
Brilliant gave no details and said he would not speculate on a possible date for the visit.
He said the Chamber would urge Biden and his top trade officials to offer some immediate relief to U.S. companies and farmers from nearly $400 billion in tariffs imposed on imports from China and elsewhere by the Trump administration, especially given the need to bolster the U.S. economy.
""We need to see both sides send early signs (and take) positive steps to defuse the growing tensions in the relationship,"" he said, adding that Chinese officials and people in the incoming administration understood the need to find some common ground on global issues, including climate change.
""Every indication is that there will a high-level visit early in the administration,"" he said, adding that the Chamber would continue pressing for structural reform and increased accountability by China. 
A Biden transition team spokesman declined to comment on the prospects for a high-level visit by Chinese officials.
Brilliant said he expected the Biden administration to move rapidly to settle a long-standing dispute with the European Union over aircraft subsidies - which could trigger removal of tariffs hurting both sides - as it sought to rebuild relations with Europe.

Brilliant said the Chamber would also object to any moves by the Trump administration to impose additional tariffs in the final days before Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates Airline President Tim Clark on Wednesday said Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 777X might not enter into service with airlines until 2023 or even later, amid uncertainty over the development timeline of Boeing's biggest twin-engine jet and when it will be certified.
Boeing has been developing the widebody jet, a new version of its popular 777 aircraft, with the goal of releasing it in 2022, already two years later than planned. 
The 777X will be the first major jet to be certified since software flaws in two Boeing 737 MAX planes caused fatal crashes and prompted accusations of cozy relations between the company and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
""It is a question of when that aircraft is going to be completed and certified and offered for entry of service. That could be '22, could be '23, it could be even longer,"" Clark told Reuters in an interview.
""So we will just wait and see as to what Boeing will do with regard to that and we will take a view as to how they fit into the fleet at that particular time.""
Boeing could not be immediately reached for comment.
Clark said he expected regulators to place the new jet under higher level of scrutiny as a result of the MAX crisis, and Boeing's Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith has warned the market entry would be influenced by the requirements of regulators.
But Clark doubted this would add significantly to existing delays.
""This is essentially a modern 777, which of course is a workhorse for international travel and it has been a thoroughly reliable, excellent bit of Boeing design so I don't see why the 777X should be any different,"" Clark said. 
European regulators have said in particular that they will subject the 777X to extra scrutiny after the fatal crashes prompted the 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX. 
The MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months in 2018 and 2019 and triggered multiple investigations and weakened U.S. influence over global aviation.
Emirates originally ordered 150 of the 777X series, which seats up to 406 people, and now has 126 on order. Analysts say the COVID-19 crisis has clouded the demand for such big jets.

The plane was originally due to enter service with Emirates in June 2020.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major chunk of the global recovery in companies' earnings expected in the first quarter is at risk of being pushed back further as lockdowns and mobility restrictions in several countries cloud hopes of a swifter economic rebound, investment banks said.
China announced lockdowns in four cities and European countries unveiled tighter and longer coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, denting back-to-normal hopes and sparking worries about further economic damage in 2021.
Germany, Britain and the Netherlands indicated strict COVID-19 curbs would last into early February and Italy said it would extend its state of emergency to the end of April. Japan also expanded a state of emergency in Tokyo, hurting the prospects of holding an already delayed Summer Olympics.
In the United States, sweeping stay-at-home orders were re-instituted last month in California, the most populous state, as infections surged.
Those actions globally prompted words of caution from major investment banks and other market-watchers. 
""An additional wave of COVID is among the key risks to be monitored this year,"" said Vincent Manuel, global CIO at Indosuez Wealth Management.
""In the past two quarters we were in the trend of positive earnings momentum both in Europe and in the U.S., which was coming from the value segments of the market. Now it's true that should we have disruptions from COVID, it would trigger negative revisions for Q1, but what matters even more is the rebound capacity of earnings over the following quarters.""
Analysts' earnings estimates for the first quarter did not reflect the worry either - Europe is seen reporting a whopping 40% jump in profits, while earnings of U.S. S&P 500 companies are forecast to rise by 16%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The S&P 500 first-quarter estimated profit growth is up slightly since Jan. 1.
First-quarter and 2021 corporate guidance will be key for investors in the coming weeks. This week marks the start of fourth-quarter 2020 earnings for U.S. companies, with results from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and other major banks due on Friday. 
""We see risks of downward guidance this earnings season,"" BofA's equity strategist, Savita Subramanian, said in a note on Wednesday, highlighting a consensus on U.S. profits that points to a drop of just 3% versus pre-COVID-19 levels in 2019.
""While additional stimulus could provide upside risks, rising COVID cases suggest a more tepid recovery from here.""
There were some cracks appearing in expectations of a V-shaped bounceback in earnings, with the pace of upward revisions in global earnings estimates cooling down in recent weeks. 
(Graphic: Global earnings upgrades slowing - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/rlgvdgwmapo/Pasted%20image%201610548817808.png) 
Many companies are still troubled by the pandemic. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co said last month it will cut 2,200 jobs globally, including 1,200 in the United States, due to the impact of the virus on the economy. 
Still, U.S. and European companies were seen reporting profit growth of 20.8% and 38% respectively for 2021, according to Refinitiv based on MSCI indexes.
Some U.S. strategists think consensus forecasts may be underestimating the expected pickup in the economy. 
Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities, raised his 2021 targets on the S&P 500 last week, saying in a report that ""the likely avalanche of pent-up consumer demand cannot be ignored."" 
Vaccine rollouts have been a major reason for the rosy outlook picture.
""There is widespread hope that a COVID-19 vaccine rollout in 2021 can normalize the underlying real economy and increase earnings, employment and margins,"" said Steen Jakobsen, chief investment officer at investment bank Saxo.

""The risk is that new mutations of the virus will dilute our attempt to normalise our society with the first-generation vaccine.""

664,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Trillions of Dollars in Index Funds Are Distorting the S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors who poured trillions of dollars into index funds on the conviction that no one can beat the market may actually be making it easier to do just that.
All that dumb money could be offering wily stock pickers a chance to buy smaller companies on the cheap, according to new research.
Academics have shown that passive flows into the S&P 500 over the last two decades disproportionately pumped up prices of its largest members -- paving the way for small companies in the benchmark to eventually outperform.
That may seem like a wild idea to anyone on Wall Street who witnessed the relentless rise of the megacaps in recent years. But the argument is that passive flows ultimately make the S&P 500’s small members too cheap relative to the big.
“Flows into funds tracking the S&P 500 index raise disproportionately the prices of large-capitalization stocks in the index relative to the prices of the index’s small stocks,” authors Hao Jiang, Dimitri Vayanos and Lu Zheng wrote in the paper. “The flows predict a high future return of the small-minus-large index portfolio.”
The research will prove timely to critics of the passive boom who say a bubble in the biggest tech names is about to burst, while small caps start 2021 in fighting form.
‘Distortions’
The team from Michigan State University, the London School of Economics and University of California Irvine analyzed data from 2000 to 2019.
They found that so-called noise traders tend to push up the price of fashionably big companies as they enter the S&P 500. As a result, those companies arrive with higher index weights which in turn trigger more buying from capitalization-weighted funds tracking the gauge.
A similar effect occurs when the funds get inflows -- the new cash is more likely to go toward stocks seeing high noise trader demand.
“When prices are distorted, weights of value-weighted indices are biased, and flows into index funds exacerbate the distortions,” the academics wrote.
It all paves the way for the outperformance of smaller S&P 500 companies when the price gap eventually normalizes.
Market moves over the past 10 years offer some support to one side of the story. The big have got bigger, with tech stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). accounting for an ever-increasing share of the index, while smaller companies in global indexes underperform.
But the longevity of that trend has killed confidence in the so-called size factor, a well-known quantitative strategy based on the notion that small-caps outperform large-caps over the long run.
The new research suggests that the size effect lives on -- just within the S&P 500, rather than across the entire stock market as the old academic studies once stated.
A “small-minus-large” portfolio of stocks in the index -- which takes a long position in the smallest shares and shorts the biggest -- earns an average 10% per year, the research found. But an equivalent portfolio using shares outside the S&P 500 delivers an insignificant return, indicating the mountain of cash indexed to the benchmark may be creating the distortion.
Index Fears
Wall Street has long fretted the side effects of the indexing boom, with researchers warning about everything from the co-movement of shares to the threat to standards of corporate governance.
The biggest question hanging over the latest research is if and how smaller companies can ever catch up.
Megacap defenders point to fundamental justifications for their lofty valuations, such as Big Tech’s ability to capitalize on technological shifts and grow profits. There is evidence that passive investment has made S&P 500 prices more informative on aggregate, if not always on an individual basis.
Yet if the distortions keep growing, they may sow the seeds of their own reversal. A working paper last year from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System suggested that ultimately a “feedback effect” may disrupt the active-to-passive shift itself.
“If index-related price distortions become more significant over time, they may boost the profitability of active investing strategies that exploit these distortions and ultimately slow the shift to passive investing,” the authors wrote.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court probes FTC's approach to seeking ill-gotten gains,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed concern on Wednesday in a case involving a high-profile payday lender that the Federal Trade Commission has overstepped its authority when seeking ill-gotten gains from firms that engaged in deceptive practices.
The justices heard arguments in a dispute involving businessman and racecar driver Scott Tucker, who is serving a prison sentence for crimes related to the same underlying conduct at issue before the court.
Tucker's lawyers have said the FTC lacked the authority to seek restitution under a section of a law called the Federal Trade Commission Act that lets the agency sue lawbreakers and authorizes judges to issue permanent injunctions. The legal question is whether judges have the authority under that provision to order defendants to return money that consumers handed over.
Conservative and liberal justices alike questioned whether the FTC was using the correct provision of the law to seek ill-gotten gains, noting that there is another section of the law that could allow the agency to seek refunds, although it could be more difficult to succeed.
Conservative justices skeptical of the power of independent federal agencies expressed similar concerns about the FTC's use of its enforcement power.
""With good intentions the agency pushes the envelope and stretches the statutory language to do the good or prevent the bad. The problem is this results in a transfer of power from Congress to the executive branch on whether to exercise this authority,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan noted that the FTC's use of the provision in question appeared to be based on expediency.
""It's so clearly better from the agency's perspective,"" Kagan said.
Tucker and his company, AMG Capital Management, are appealing a ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed the FTC's authority to recoup $1.27 billion in ill-gotten gains.
AMG gives consumers high-interest, short-term payday loans online that renew automatically. It was sued by the FTC in 2012 for inadequate disclosures about the terms of the loans. AMG agreed to stop the practices to which the FTC had objected but balked at returning the money.
If the court chooses not to curb the agency's authority it would be because until recently courts have consistently sided with the FTC on the issue since the provision was enacted in 1973.
""My question is, still, it's close and the lower courts have been uniform for 50 years. We can't undo everything that was decided,"" liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said.
The FTC and its supporters have said a ruling in favor of Tucker would severely curtail its ability to repair the financial harm caused by fraudsters. 
Tucker in 2018 was sentenced to 16 years and eight months in prison after being found guilty of violating federal lending and racketeering laws.

After several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.
The Supreme Court's ruling will affect another case the justices agreed to hear in which the FTC is seeking $5.2 million in ill-gotten gains from another company, the Credit Bureau Center. 
The Supreme Court's consideration of the legal disputes comes at a time when the United States is awash in scams, with some taking advantage of fears about the spread of the coronavirus to bilk unsuspecting consumers. Robocalls inundate landlines touting phony medical devices and other deceptive offers. Since they often originate overseas, U.S. law enforcement has difficulty in combating the scam artists.

That's almost a 40-year low, according to historical data from Box Office Mojo.
Research firm Comscore's end-of-year report has also stated that North American box offices brought in just $2.2 billion in 2020 - compared to $11.4 billion in 2019.
With movie theaters closed across the world due to lockdown measures, studios were forced to delay release dates for scores of new films. 
Some firms, like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), were brought to the brink of bankruptcy. 
Theaters are still yet to reopen in the biggest U.S. markets of Los Angeles and New York City. 
Some 274 movies - including blockbusters like ""No Time to Die,"" ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and the ninth ""Fast and Furious"" action film - were forced to move their release dates to 2021.
That left  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Pictures cop caper ""Bad Boys for Life,"" released in January last year, as the top-earning movie in North America for 2020 - with $206 million.
Thriller ""Tenet"" from Warner Brothers, which hoped to tempt movie-goers back into theaters in the summer, took in just $58 million in the U.S. and Canada.
One media analyst for Comscore said that the 2020 revenue - much of it from drive-in venues - was actually grounds for hope. 
Some industry observers feared the figure would be even smaller. 
Comscore did not release worldwide data for 2020 - but entertainment newspaper Variety reported that global returns slumped some 71%."

Investing.com -- Twitter doesn't need Donald Trump. 
That's per Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, who raised the price target on  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) to $58 from $55 while maintaining a buy-equivalent rating, according to StreetInsider.
""We are not concerned with usage impact of blocking President Trump,"" Helfstein wrote in a note. 
Shares are up about 2%, at around $47.70.
The firm expects fourth quarter monetizable daily active Twitter users up 34%, 5% ahead of the Street consensus, thanks to the U.S. elections and a potential buyback.
Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" the company said last week, two days after the Jan. 6 rampage on the U.S. Capitol that left a handful of people dead. Trump has been blamed for instigating his romping, fur-hatted and antler-donning supporters in their breaching of the building as lawmakers attempted to certify the election of Joe Biden.
""We believe the company's reinvigorated focus on revenue products creates ample catalysts for future growth, including a potential subscription offering,"" Helfstein said.

Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) named VMware (NYSE:VMW)'s chief as its new chief executive officer, prompting shares to rise 8%. VMware, on the other hand, dropped 7%. 
Pat Gelsinger, who has led VMware since 2012 and overseen a tripling in revenue, will replace Bob Swan next month. Swan has been Intel's CEO for two years, after serving as interim head for six months, Bloomberg reported.  
Activist investor Dan Loeb has been pushing the chipmaker to seek strategic alternatives for the company, including a possible breakup and sale of assets. Delays in the chip fabrication process have plagued Intel, and it is in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) to make some of its chips, Bloomberg said.
Intel also said it expects to exceed previous guidance for fourth quarter sales and profit. In October, the company reported guidance for the fourth quarter, with sales at $17.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.10.
Gelsinger has been in the industry for more than 40 years, and this won't be his first time at Intel. He spent 30 years at the company, and was its first chief technology officer. He drove the creation of key industry technologies such as USB and Wi-Fi. 
VMware has initiated a search for a new CEO. Zane Rowe, VMware’s chief financial officer, has been appointed Interim CEO. Gelsinger will continue to serve on the VMware Board of Directors.
Shares of VMware are up some 70% since Gelsinger took over in 2012. In the meantime, while Intel shares have tripled in that time, they are still below a dot-com era peak in 2000.

(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) reported a 17.2% rise in comparable sales for the holiday season on Wednesday as its online sales more than doubled, thanks to faster deliveries and higher demand for home goods, electronics and beauty products.
A large chunk of the sales growth came from same-day deliveries and store pick-up services, areas where the Minneapolis-based retailer has been investing heavily during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deep-pocketed retailers such as Target and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc are using the disruption brought on by the health crisis as an opportunity to gain market share from smaller brick-and-mortar rivals struggling to survive the impact of the pandemic.
Target in December sold 150 million items through services that allow customers to collect their online purchases from stores, almost four times more than the same period a year earlier.
The sales surge came as retailers spread out their holiday season promotions to prevent crowding at stores, instead of focusing on a few specific days.
In a blog post, Target said on Wednesday it would keep its nearly 1,900 U.S. stores closed on Thanksgiving this year, repeating the measure it had taken in 2020. 
""It is even less likely retailers will return to the big sales bonanza of Thanksgiving and Black Friday even when the pandemic is over,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. 
Target said sales trends in January has been strong. Analysts on average expect its fourth-quarter comparable sales, which includes January, to rise 12.7%. 
However, analysts at Gordon Haskett said the retailer had likely missed the more optimistic expectations of 18%-19% growth, which is closer to what Target had seen in the third quarter.

Shares of the company, which have gained about 60% over the last 12 months, fell 1% in early trading.

PARIS (Reuters) - European retail giant  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) has received a surprise 16.2 billion euros ($19.72 billion) takeover approach from Canadian convenience-store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard, sending its shares soaring on Wednesday.
Couche-Tard said it had submitted a non-binding offer for the French grocery group at 20 euros per share, largely in cash, though it gave no further detail on its vision for the combined companies. 
Facing growing competition from online rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), European supermarket operators are viewed as ripe for tie-ups, though Couche-Tard's approach raised analyst questions over the the potential for cost cuts or purchasing savings.
Couche-Tard, which is mainly focused on gas stations in North America, would be entering virgin territory. Carrefour, continental Europe's biggest retailer, has operations across Europe and Brazil, including out-of-town hypermarkets. 
""Given the nature and location of ATD's businesses, we see little scope for synergies,"" Citi analysts said, adding that fierce competition makes France a particularly tough market. 
It was not immediately clear whether Couche-Tard might seek to cherry-pick from Carrefour's operations. 
Couche-Tard has mainly made smaller acquisitions in the past, though it was reported to be a potential suitor for Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)'s Speedway gas stations last year before another buyer sealed a $21 billion deal. 
There is no certainty at this stage that the discussions with Carrefour will result in any agreement or transaction, Couche-Tard said.
Shares in Carrefour soared 15.3% to 17.83 euros by 1504 GMT while Couche-Tard dropped about 9% to C$37.54.
OVERHAUL PLAN
Carrefour employs more than 320,000 people worldwide, including 105,000 in France, its largest market. It is also France's largest private sector employer. The French Presidency declined to comment on the Canadian group's approach.
The company launched a five-year overhaul plan in 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment to contend with online competitors as well as domestic rivals such as Leclerc. It has also expanded into convenience stores to reduce reliance on the big hypermarkets that still account for the bulk of its sales.
""If the potential transaction was for Carrefour's convenience stores segment only, we could better understand the strategic rationale,"" Raymond James analysts said of Couche-Tard's approach.
With food retailers across the world benefiting from surging demand as more consumers stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Carrefour reported robust third-quarter results in France as well as other key markets Brazil and Spain.
Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard has repeatedly said the retail sector was bound to consolidate and that his mission was to ensure Carrrefour emerges as a winner.
In 2018 Carrefour and French rival Casino were locked in a dispute after Casino said it had rejected a tie-up approach that Carrefour denied making.
Carrefour also struck a purchasing alliance with Britain's Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) that year and retreated from the highly competitive Chinese market, where it sold loss-making operations to electronics retailer Suning.com.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is mostly unfazed by the political turmoil in Washington and fears of violence ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, with investors squarely focused on the probability of another sizeable stimulus package to boost economic growth and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
The benchmark S&P 500 index stands near record highs while bond yields have rallied to their highest levels since the pandemic began, despite last week's shocking assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump - an apparent divergence between the political and economic realities on the ground and market valuations. 
With Trump's presidency due to end on Jan. 20, investors say they are looking ahead to the trillions of dollars of additional stimulus promised by President-elect Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats, who will soon control both chambers of Congress, and what it would mean for economic growth and corporate profits.
""It’s a market that actually says, 'We are investing for 2021 and we see explosive economic growth in the back half of this year,'"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""Because the market is a forward pricing mechanism, it frustrates the people that are watching the news in the here and now.""
Still, some investors wonder whether the market has gotten ahead of itself in a rally that has seen the S&P 500 surge more than 60% from its March lows. Rising Treasury yields threaten to dent the allure of stocks, which are trading near their highest valuations in 20 years, while the Federal Reserve could accelerate the timing of interest rate hikes if the recovery proves stronger than expected. 
Among the investors that have recently expressed concern are Jeremy Grantham of money manager GMO, who said earlier this month that the stock rally ""has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble.""
Bond giant PIMCO was more circumspect, predicting on Tuesday that the U.S. economy could rebound to pre-recession levels later this year but pointing out a bevy of risks, including a sooner-than-expected withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, regulation concerns loom over the big technology and internet stocks that account for more than 15% of the S&P 500, and wild rides in the shares of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and cryptocurrency Bitcoin are bolstering the case for those who argue markets have entered a bubble. As markets have climbed, some investors have been in sell mode: Net outflows in equities totaled $2.4 billion last week, coming on the heels of near-record withdrawals a week before, client data from BofA Global Research showed.
""Flows suggest clients may be cautious to add more equity exposure given index highs and extended valuations,"" BofA Global Research said in a note on Tuesday. Doubts about the rally's sustainability were a periodic feature of the decade-long bull market that followed the 2007-2009 recession and figured prominently in last year’s rebound, when many analysts and investors were struck by the dissonance presented by surging stock prices and the human and economic misery brought by the pandemic.
HIGH VALUATIONS
More recently, the market has looked past the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol and the subsequent push by Democrats to remove Trump from office, with the S&P 500 rising 2% over the past week.
Should more political unrest occur around Biden's inauguration, investors have said they expect any associated market volatility to be temporary. Upcoming corporate earnings reports may need to be strong to support stock valuations. The S&P 500 trades at 22.7 times future earnings estimates, well above its long-term average of 15.3, according to Refinitiv Datastream.
So far, that's what's expected. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise nearly 24% in 2021 after falling 15% last year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""I'm not concerned because I think market valuations are reflecting a quicker rebound in profitability than folks thought was possible in the spring,"" Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday.

Low interest rates and Treasury yields, which keep borrowing costs attractive for companies and help make equities relatively more attractive in comparison with bonds, have provided another rationale for the high valuations. However, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has risen recently, climbing to around 1.11% from 0.78% about two months ago. While that increase supported interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banks, a sharp rise in yields could hit stocks, particularly those with longer-duration cash flows such as tech and growth stocks.At the same time, markets are starting to push up bets on when the U.S. central bank could tighten monetary policy, with eurodollar futures contract prices reflecting growing odds that a rate hike could happen as early as June 2023, roughly three months earlier than was priced in a week ago. ""On a 12-month horizon, we would advise investors to be overweight equities, but for shorter-term positions right now we are more neutral,"" said Erik Knutzen, multi-asset class chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed in narrow ranges on Wednesday, against a backdrop dominated by events in Washington DC, where the House of Representatives was set to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up an insignificant 6 points, or less than 0.1%, at 31,075 points. The S&P 500 was also more or less unchanged while the Nasdaq Composite opened slightly more strongly with a rise of 0.2%.

General Motors  (NYSE:GM) stock rose 2.1% to the highest level since its post-financial crisis bankruptcy and bailout, after saying on Tuesday that it will start deliveries of electric vans to FedEx (NYSE:FDX) later this year, inserting itself into an EV niche still unoccupied by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Earlier, the main economic data release of the day had passed off exactly as forecast, with consumer prices rising 0.4% in December. The biggest increases were in appliance prices and moving costs, both of which reflect two of the big trends of the pandemic. Food prices also rose more strongly while hotel and airline prices continued to struggle under the effects of a pandemic which still hasn't crested in the U.S. Daily death rates are back above 4,000 after a brief lull, according to data released on Tuesday.
Interest in the inflation numbers has ticked up recently as debate has started to focus on how fast and how far a loose fiscal and monetary policy combination will push prices this year. The Federal Reserve has committed to let the economy 'run hot' for an indefinite period until it feels that the slack in the labor market has been fully taken up. Despite some murmurs that the central bank may start to taper its bond purchases later this year, Influential vice-president Richard Clarida said earlier this week that he doesn't see any such move this year, a stance he may elaborate on in a speech at 2 PM ET.  "

680,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: Patchy vaccine rollout clouds emerging market investment rebound,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - A surge in emerging markets linked to the success of COVID-19 vaccines may not fully reflect the challenges of delivering scarce supplies to some of the world's poorest countries, suggesting a bumpy 2021 for investors in the asset class.
The vaccine rollout is already shaping up to be the investment theme of the year. 
Israel's early immunisation campaign has helped the shekel hit 24-year highs and aided local stocks, while Chile's peso has gained 1.3% over the past month, helped by its push to finish vaccination by the second quarter.
At the other end of the spectrum, South Africa's rand and Brazil's real have been punished recently, in part due to worries about their countries' vaccine supplies and the spread of a new coronavirus variant in the former.
Shekel shines, real and rand roughed up https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdgmravo/Capture2.PNG
But elsewhere investors have shown less pickiness after stampeding back into emerging market assets late last year on bets for a robust economic revival from the pandemic.
Yet longer-term global recovery depends in part on vaccine distribution and on this emerging markets are expected to lag developed markets, which have secured more vaccines than needed.
Timely delivery of vaccines is proving to be a ""challenge"", World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart told the Reuters Next conference.
""Everything hinges on the vaccine and the virus. For the economy near term it's more the virus, for the markets it's probably more the vaccine,"" UBS chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a recent UBS podcast, referring to the global economy.
Most investors anticipate vaccines should reach emerging markets widely during the second half of the year, a recent Citi survey showed.
That suggests little space has been priced in for potential setbacks, such as further virus waves or vaccination delays. Meanwhile, some countries getting ahead with inoculation are reaping only limited rewards.
""Whenever investors get bullish on global growth, they buy EM FX (emerging market currencies) broadly, rather than getting too deep into the local stories,"" said Dirk Willer, head of emerging market strategy at Citi. 
More than 60% of the variation in exchange rates was explained by global factors, said Willer. 
The outlook for the U.S. dollar, one of those factors, now appears less certain after a bounce from more than 2-1/2-year lows as expectations for a wave of spending under an incoming Joe Biden administration have pushed U.S. Treasury yields up.
A weaker dollar is normally supportive of emerging markets and their currencies. 
Citi flagged the risk that markets may start to get concerned about inefficient or slow vaccination programmes in countries already facing fiscal challenges, such as Brazil.
But for most countries, there appears less scrutiny so far.
Russia's rouble and South Korea's won have underperformed over the past month, despite the former's relatively fast inoculation programme and the latter securing a high level of doses as a percentage of population. 
Doses of COVID-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 people https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VACCINE/yxmvjqzbbpr/chart.png
BEYOND VACCINES
Similarly, credit spreads have tightened since the pandemic across the board. 
Sovereign bonds of Israel and Abu Dhabi, two of the global leaders in doses administered to date, are trading at similar levels to those of Mexico and Saudi Arabia, two of the laggards. 
Still, Mexico's credit may be supported by it securing one of the highest doses as a percent of the population in emerging markets.
Limited signs of vaccine shake out in EM dollar bonds https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplkmnnvb/Capture.PNG
There shouldn't be too much differentiation in sovereign credit performance based on vaccine performance, said Nick Eisinger, principal for fixed income emerging markets at Vanguard.
""EM will of course benefit from developed countries coming back on line and this stronger activity in exports and services,"" he said. 
Some investors are looking beyond vaccines, seen as a one-off variable, and instead focusing on more traditional metrics such as public finances and external funding needs. 
""We don't have any direct input by the vaccine or even the pandemic, infection ratios or anything into our credit models,"" said Yong Zhu, senior portfolio manager at DuPont (NYSE:DD) Capital. 
""What we really care about is how does the pandemic and policies impact the macro indicators and is there any long-term structural change in the country.""
In contrast, vaccination deployment is central to HSBC's EM equity strategy, said John Lomax, head of the bank's global EM equity strategy. It has increased its overweight position in countries including Indonesia and Thailand.

""Markets which handled the virus less well have much more to gain from vaccine roll-out and economic normalisation, even if it takes time,"" said Lomax.

(Reuters) - Twitter's decision to suspend President Donald Trump's account will test a truce made last year between CEO Jack Dorsey and top shareholders of the social media company which allowed Dorsey to remain in the top job.
In early 2020, Dorsey faced calls from Elliott Management Corp to step down, after the hedge fund argued he was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running payments processing company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ). He fended off this pressure by giving Elliott and its ally, buyout firm Silver Lake Partners, seats on Twitter's board.
Since then, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) shares had risen more than 70% as of Friday - the day Twitter suspended Trump - as users flocked to the app for news in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet its stock has dropped 9% this week amid investor concerns that banning Trump would alienate some of his 88 million followers from the popular social media platform and trigger a new push by lawmakers to regulate it.
An agreement that prevents Elliott and Silver Lake from seeking to influence Twitter's content moderation and user policy expires this spring. The two investment firms declined to comment on whether they would seek to intervene once the agreement expires. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment or make Dorsey available for an interview.
Elliott's founder, Paul Singer, is a major financial backer of Trump's Republican Party. The hedge fund took a 4% stake in Twitter when the stock was hovering around $30, and is still in the black with the shares now trading at around $47. Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter's convertible bonds that give it the equivalent of a 3% stake.
Analysts and investors said the impact of the ban on Dorsey's standing with investors will hinge on whether the move weighs on the company's longer-term growth prospects, and that the chances of a regulatory crackdown on the app were difficult to assess. Many said, however, that they expected most Twitter users to remain on the platform and top shareholders to stick with the company.
""We think other Tweeters can replace Trump, and note that since Nov. 17, Trump's follower count is down by about 180,000, and President-elect Biden's is up by over 4 million,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts wrote in a note.
Representatives for top Twitter investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and Fidelity, declined to comment.
The reaction of advertisers, from whom Twitter derives the bulk of its revenue, will be key. Many are drawn to the platform because of its high user ""engagement,"" a measure of how active and involved people are when they use the app, and are fearful of being mired in controversy, said Mark Douglas, chief executive of SteelHouse, which provides advertising software to help marketers reach audiences across TV, Web and mobile media.
Advertisers often pull their ads in times of political or cultural turmoil, such as the aftermath of George Floyd's death in May. Twitter has acknowledged this risk, warning investors in October that the U.S. election could affect its ad sales.
""We just worry that last week's news flow will remind advertisers how dark of a sewer that Twitter’s environment truly is,"" said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.
Some investors said Dorsey could argue he was left with no choice but to suspend Trump after his rally of supporters in Washington, D.C. seeking to overturn the outcome of the U.S. election led to the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in the deaths of five people. Other internet giants, such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, also cracked down on content produced by Trump and his supporters.
""We think Twitter is undergoing a turnaround and will show very nice growth numbers. Replacing a CEO in the middle of that effort would interrupt all of those good things,"" said Sahm Adrangi, founder and portfolio manager of Kerrisdale Capital Management, Twitter's 40th-largest shareholder.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Siemens Gamesa and Siemens Energy are developing a commercial offshore wind turbine that produces hydrogen via electrolysis, the companies said, marking a breakthrough for the mass production of renewable hydrogen.
The companies are investing 120 million euros ($146 million) in the system, which has not been previously reported on. It is the renewable industry's most concrete plan yet to capitalise on an expected boom in hydrogen demand.
In the European Union, renewable hydrogen, which can replace fossil fuel in sectors that are struggling to decarbonise, is seen as a way to meet goals to reduce emissions.
Hoping to get ahead of main rivals Vestas and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Siemens Energy and Siemens Gamesa are targeting large industrial players, including steelmakers, refineries and chemical firms, as customers from the mid 2020s.
""It's really about developing a commercially viable product,"" said Christian Bruch, chief executive of Siemens Energy, which owns 67% of Siemens Gamesa, the world's largest offshore wind turbine maker.
""I don't know any other company that combines wind energy, electrolysis and offshore high voltage technology all in one enterprise.""
Siemens Energy was spun off from parent Siemens last year. About one sixth of electricity generated globally is based on the group's technology.
""We have to completely retool the turbine, which has been designed for electricity production,"" Siemens Gamesa Chief Executive Andreas Nauen said.
The joint effort aims to integrate electrolyser technology, which is needed to produce hydrogen, in offshore turbines.
""We're looking at our 14 megawatt turbine, which will be our bread-and-butter product by the mid 2020s,"" Nauen said.
Shares in Siemens Energy were 2% higher following the news, while Siemens Gamesa's stock was up 1.3%.
Green hydrogen is created by splitting water into its two components using electricity from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, as opposed to cheaper grey hydrogen, which is produced via fossil fuels.
GRAPHIC-The hydrogen hype - expected demand in Europe https://graphics.reuters.com/HYDROGEN-EUROPE/jznpnmdejvl/chart.png
Although most projects across the continent are at pilot stage, the EU estimates investments in green hydrogen in Europe could reach 470 billion euros by 2050 and create up to 1 million jobs.
""What's charming about our cooperation is that it's about developing a product,"" Siemens Energy's Bruch said.
The plans by Siemens Energy and Siemens Gamesa are supported by the German government, which has earmarked 9 billion euros to kickstart a national hydrogen industry, with the aim of becoming a global leader in the field.
Berlin on Wednesday said it would provide 700 million euros in support funding to three model projects by 2025.
""Green hydrogen is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Germany in terms of innovation and industry,"" Research Minister Anja Karliczek said.
Germany, which borders the North and Baltic Seas, would be a good location for a first commercial project, Siemens Gamesa's Nauen said.
This could be 100-200 megawatts in size, he said, adding potential clients must be located closer to the source as the transportation of hydrogen generated by offshore wind turbines will require pipelines, rather than power cables.
""Potential offtakers include industries in coastal areas, such as chemical and steel firms,"" Nauen said.
Industrial firms, including Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Salzgitter, are looking to hydrogen technology to help them to significantly cut their carbon footprint.
But Siemens Energy's Bruch said offshore wind turbines able to produce hydrogen are just one of many ways to reach net zero emissions.
""Hydrogen is a key topic but there's no silver bullet here,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening slightly lower Wednesday, with investors taking a more cautious stance as they digest higher Treasury yields, likely more fiscal stimulus and continued political turmoil.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 25 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 15 points, or 0.1%. 
Wall Street has had a strong start to 2021, with the main indices all posting record highs, despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. 
This has been largely down to heightened expectations for additional fiscal stimulus after the Democrats won the Senate. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to release details on his economic plan on Thursday, but he has already indicated that the new stimulus could be “in the trillions of dollars.” 
However, new gains are becoming harder to come by as long-term interest rates start to rise--10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed above 1%--amid concerns about the Federal Reserve tapering its stimulus program more quickly than previously expected.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned that a pullback for stocks could be coming soon, with the influential bank’s Chief Economist Jan Hatzius saying in a research note that U.S. stocks could possibly “take more of a breather” in the near term. 
Meanwhile, the political turmoil continues in Washington. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote to impeach President Donald Trump later Wednesday over the recent turmoil in the U.S. Capitol after Vice President Mike Pence resisted pressure on Tuesday to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. 
The coronavirus continues to disrupt society, as the U.S. topped 4,000 daily deaths Tuesday for the second time this month, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Texas became the second state to surpass 2 million Covid-19 cases, after California passed the marker in December.
Turning to economic data, the consumer price inflation release for December is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with consensus calling for a 0.4% bump from the previous month's 0.2%. The Fed's December Beige Book is also due for publication.
Oil prices continued to climb Wednesday, boosted by industry data showing a 5.8 million barrel draw in U.S. inventories, again suggesting that the U.S. measures to contain the latest surge in the pandemic have had less effect on demand than those in Europe. The Energy Information Administration releases its data later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $53.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.2% to $56.68. Both benchmarks are trading near their highest levels since February.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,852.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2167.

U.S. federal officials have been told that J&J has fallen behind its original production schedule and will not catch up until the end of April, when it agreed to deliver more than 60 million doses, the NYT reported, citing people familiar with the situation. (https://nyti.ms/38EX4n9)
Earlier this week, J&J's chief executive officer said the company was on track to have close to a billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by 2021-end, and that it was in the final stages of analyzing data from a large trial of the vaccine.
J&J and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
In August, J&J signed a $1 billion contract with the U.S. government to supply up to 100 million doses by mid-2021. 
Approval for J&J's vaccine could help speed up the vaccination effort in the United States as it likely requires a single dose unlike the two currently approved vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which are to be administered in two-dose series weeks apart. 

J&J said in December it expects interim data from the late-stage trial by the end of January.

Investing.com -- For the last two months, it's the vaccine developers that have hogged the headlines, but for anyone still looking for exposure to the medical campaign against the virus, they are not the only play available.
U.K.-listed small cap Synairgen (LON:SYNG) stock rose over 10% on Wednesday after announcing the start of a phase 3 trial for an interferon beta treatment delivered by inhaler, which early test results have indicated reduces both the severity of infection and subsequent recovery time. The news comes against the backdrop of a sharp deterioration in the public health situation in the U.K., which has stretched the country's hospital system to the limit. Anything that allows faster recovery and the freeing up of hospital beds is likely to be grabbed with both hands against such a backdrop. 
Synairgen's advantage is that its product is essentially a tweak to a well-established and broadly-tolerated drug that is already widely used to fight other diseases. As such, the chances of regulatory approval seem high, and it has already been fast-tracked by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
The stock subsequently pared its gains but was still up 7.1% by mid-morning in London at its highest since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's breakthrough announcement that their experimental vaccine was effective in treating the virus.
The Pfizer/BioNTech announcement ushered in a rough couple of months for a host of small and medium-cap stocks that had flourished in the early stages of the pandemic. Companies like Italy's DiaSorin (MI:DIAS), U.K.-based Avacta (LON:AVTG) and the Anglo-French venture Novacyt (LON:NCYT) - all of whose strengths lay in detecting the disease rather than treating it - all suffered as Pfizer was followed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in rolling out vaccines that ought - in time - to sharply reduce the need for Covid-related clinical diagnostics. 
Neither DiaSorin - a well-established company with hundreds of millions of euros in annual revenue, nor Avacta, a startup with hardly any revenue, has really recovered. DiaSorin hit its lowest level since September earlier this week. Avacta stock has done better. It fell 40% in the weeks after the Pfizer/BioNTech announcement but has recovered some 20% since then, helped by a couple of licensing agreements that reminded the market of its original focus on developing biotherapeutics for cancer treatment - a business that will long outlive the Covid-19 pandemic. 
But along with Synairgen, the small-cap that has rebounded best is Novacyt, whose 2,000% rally last spring briefly made it the hottest stock in Europe. Both Novacyt and Avacta are working on developing so-called 'lateral flow' tests for Covid-19, which give results in minutes. While other lateral flow tests have already reached the market, they are plagued by low reliability. As such, the successful development of a reliable alternative could still be rocket fuel for either stock, given the improvement in testing regimes that that would imply.
Novacyt said last year it expects to launch its product in the first quarter of this year. Novacyt stock was up 7.1% by mid-morning in London, without any visible price trigger.

(Reuters) - European stocks inched up on Wednesday as merger talks powered gains in French grocer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Spain's Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), offsetting weakness in banking stocks on worries about extended lockdowns across the continent.
Carrefour shares hit their highest level since August 2019 after Canadian convenience-store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc said it had approached Europe's biggest retailer to discuss a combination.
The stock was last up 8.6%, leading gains in Paris' CAC 40, while shares in French rival Casino rose 3.1%.
Spanish telecom company Telefonica rose 7.9% after it agreed to sell its mobile phone masts in Europe and Latin America to U.S.-based telecom infrastructure operator American Towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.41 billion) in cash.
Telecom stocks were the top sectoral gainers, up 1.4%.
The broader pan-European STOXX 600 index rose just 0.2% as investors took a pause after last week's strong rally.
Banks fell the most as on fears that prolonged restrictions in Europe to control soaring coronavirus cases will further slow an economic recovery.
""We're not going to see restrictions being lifted anytime soon, so that's adding to fears of a decline in economic activity,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets.
""The longer the economies are under lockdown the more likely we're going to have loan defaults. So that's impacting the banks.""
The German DAX was flat as Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country will not be able to lift all restrictions at the beginning of February.
The Dutch government also said it would extend lockdown measures, including the closure of schools and shops, by at least three weeks.
Investors also kept an eye on political developments in Rome where former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi warned that he was ready to sink the government if current premier Giuseppe Conte did not apply for a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund to relaunch Italy's battered economy.
Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.2%, while banking stocks fell 0.6%.
Meanwhile, data showed Italian industrial output fell more than expected in November, suggesting the recovery petered out in the fourth quarter due to new curbs on business.
Utilities were a drag after Danish offshore wind farm developer Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) slumped 6.7% on warning a return to more normal wind speeds this year would hit operating earnings.
Copenhagen stocks fell 0.8%.

Food ordering group Just Eat Takeaway fell 3.9% as a disappointing 2020 margin guidance overshadowed a 57% jump in fourth-quarter orders.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 04:51AM ET</span>",Telefonica stock surges on $9.4 billion asset sale to American Towers,"By Inti Landauro and Isla Binnie
MADRID (Reuters) - Shares in Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) soared on Wednesday after the Spanish group said it had agreed to sell its mobile phone masts in Europe and Latin America to American Towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.41 billion) in cash.
Telefonica's Telxius division, partly owned by investment fund KKR and Zara owner Amancio Ortega's investment vehicle, will hand over more than 30,000 mobile phone masts in Spain, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina.
U.S.-based American Towers will then lease the phone masts back to Telefonica, leaving the Spanish group only owning tower assets in Britain. 
Telefonica, which alongside European peers has struggled to prop up a sagging share price in the face of fierce competition, will be able to use sale proceeds to trim by 4.6 billion euros its net debt that piled up during hefty investment in networks. 
It has said it aims to focus on more profitable businesses and exit less profitable markets such as those in Latin America.
Shares were trading 8.7% higher on the day at 0845 GMT, outperforming a very slightly positive Madrid blue-chip index.
Long-term income streams tied to inflation have turned towers into prized investment targets in a world of low returns. These networks are set to expand to accommodate next-generation 5G internet and eventually link up billions of smart devices.
Telefonica Chief Executive Josa Maria Alvarez-Pallete said the deal meant the firm could focus on its ""more ambitious goals"", such as a deal to merge its British operations under the O2 brand with Virgin Media, the acquisition of Brazilian carrier Oi's mobile assets and debt reduction.
As of September, net financial debt was 2.77 times core adjusted earnings.
Proceeds from the American Towers deal include a capital gain of about 3.5 billion euros, Telefonica said. 
For the U.S. firm, which dwarves its main European rival Cellnex, the deal gives access to a European market made increasingly attractive by the 5G rollout.
Cellnex has already built up a tower network spanning most of Europe, while Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) is planning to list its own infrastructure unit Vantage towers in Frankfurt. 
Telefonica has said it is looking at all possible options for the future of the part of Telxius it still owns, which is an undersea cable between Europe and the United States.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",European equities rise; U.S. yields ease after pushback on taper talk,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose after a shaky start and the dollar edged up on Wednesday, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell from 10-month highs, helped by policymakers pushing back against talk of the Fed tapering its support.
After Asian equities saw modest gains, European shares opened lower then rose slightly, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.2% on the day at 0918 GMT.
MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.2%, edging back towards all-time highs, and MSCI's main European Index was up by a similar amount.
China recorded its biggest daily jump in COVID-19 cases in more than five months, despite four cities being in lockdown, and the Dutch government said it would extend lockdown measures on Tuesday.
Investors are closely tracking the discussion around tapering - that is, the Fed's possible easing of monetary stimulus.
Several Federal Reserve policymakers, including Loretta Mester, Esther George, James Bullard and Eric Rosengren pushed back on the idea of the Fed tapering its asset purchases any time soon.
These comments, along with a well-received auction of 10-year Treasuries, pushed the U.S. 10-year yield back down, away from the 10-month high of 1.187% reached in the previous session.
At 0919 GMT, the benchmark yield was at 1.1189%.
The yield curve, which had reached the steepest since May 2017 on expectations for big fiscal stimulus under a new Democratic administration, narrowed slightly to 96.8 basis points.
""We believe the potential for fiscal stimulus, along with a normalization of economic activity as the vaccine rollout ramps up, justify slightly higher US Treasury yields,"" UBS strategists wrote in a note to clients.
""To acknowledge this, we have raised our 10- and 30- year US Treasury yield forecasts by 0.1 percentage points this year to 1.0% and 1.7%, respectively, by end-December,"" they said, adding that they do not expect the run-up in yields to go much further than that because central banks remain accommodative and the Fed has signalled a tolerance for higher inflation.
In light of the recent yield jump, U.S. December inflation data due at 1330 GMT will be closely watched.
The U.S. dollar recently broke its downward trend with a three-day winning streak, then resumed falling on Tuesday. It was steady overnight but picked up in early London trading on Wednesday, calling into question whether its bounce was over.
At 0920 GMT, it was up 0.1% at 90.136 versus a basket of currencies.
With at least five Republicans joining the Democrats push to impeach President Donald Trump over the storming of the U.S. Capitol, Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Group, said that preventing Trump from running for office in future would ""permanently remove the “Trump premium” from the dollar and allow the currency to weaken further.""
In Europe, government bond yields dipped. Italian bonds, which sold off on Tuesday due to political uncertainty, lagged behind Germany.
Euro zone industrial production data for November is due at 1000 GMT.
Versus the dollar the euro was down around 0.2% at $1.21875 at 0920 GMT. Riskier currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars also fell as the U.S. dollar edged higher.
Bitcoin edged up slightly but, at $34,999 was still around 17% down from the all-time high of $42,000 it reached on Friday last week.
Oil prices rallied, gaining for the seventh straight day, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude both trading at their highest since February, after industry data showed a bigger than expected drop in inventories and investors shrugged off the impact of the pandemic.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indian automaker Mahindra cuts over half of North America workforce - sources,"By Sudarshan Varadhan, Aditi Shah and Ben Klayman
CHENNAI/NEW DELHI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd has cut more than half of the workforce at its North American unit, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing legal tussle.
The sources did not give a figure for the number of jobs lost at the business, which had over 500 employees in early 2020, according to its website.
However, one of the sources said ""hundreds of workers"" had been laid off since mid-2020 as part of a restructuring, and that the cuts were as high as two-thirds of Mahindra Automotive North America's (MANA) total staffing.
Positions include engineers and manufacturing jobs at its plant in Detroit that produces the off-road vehicle Roxor, as well as sales executives.
The cuts come as Mahindra reviews its businesses in a drive to conserve capital and retain only those that make money or have the potential to be profitable.
MANA said in a statement it had furloughed some staff and laid off others due to the pandemic and an International Trade Commission lawsuit which led to an August ""cease and desist"" order for the Roxor business. It did not provide figures.
Mahindra and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are in a protracted legal battle over an intellectual property infringement case which has prevented the Indian automaker from selling its Roxor vehicle in the United States.
""This forced us to halt production and furlough our manufacturing team and some additional people across several functions, including the Roxor sales team,"" the company said.
However, last month, the company won a favourable ruling in its lawsuit against FCA, paving the way for it to begin selling the Roxor again.
It now expects to recall a large group of employees, it said in the statement.
As part of its review which began last year, Mahindra has pulled the plug on its U.S. electric scooter business GenZe; it is in talks to sell its stake in South Korean automaker Ssangyong Motor; and it has called off a joint venture with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Mahindra's shares have surged over 60% since it announced the review in June last year, valuing the company at over $12.6 billion.
The automaker plans to focus on manufacturing large sport-utility vehicles and electric models for its core India market, where it has lost ground to competitors such as  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) and Kia Motors.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Bets on for Macau's Sands China after U.S. billionaire Adelson's death,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sands China (OTC:SCHYY) Ltd's adjustment to life after the death of billionaire founder Sheldon Adelson, coming a year before the firm's gaming licence expires, could open up opportunities for Chinese investors to acquire a stake, industry executives said.
Without the larger-than-life visionary at the helm, the firm may be more willing to sell a stake to curry favour with China's government, or suitors may take advantage of his absence to buy a degree of control without opposition, executives told Reuters.
Adelson, who died on Jan. 11 aged 87, was widely credited with helping transform the Chinese territory of Macau from a den of hardcore gambling parlours into a centre of luxury resorts and convention centres with revenue that now dwarfs that of Las Vegas, home of his U.S. flagship  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp.
Yet gaming licences for Macau's six casino operators, including Sands China, are set to expire in 2022, and the government has yet to detail the rebidding process.
""This presents a window of opportunity for Chinese parties to come in and take a strategic stake in the company,"" said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX.
Having a Chinese partner would improve Sands China's chance of a new concession, he said, particularly with the removal of Adelson's link to U.S. President Donald Trump, who he bankrolled and had regular contact with during Trump's anti-China term.
Parent Las Vegas Sands earns the bulk of its revenue from Asian properties, including the Venetian and Parisian in Macau and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The casino operator is due to open British-themed resort Londoner in Macau in February.
Sands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
BEIJING DECISION
Any decision on a Chinese firm buying a meaningful stake in Sands China would not be made in Las Vegas or Macau but by authorities in Beijing, said Matthew Ossolinski, chairman of Ossolinski Holdings, an investor in Las Vegas Sands since 2008.
""Increased Chinese ownership in any of the large operators makes sense for political reasons and could be a net positive for existing shareholders,"" he said.
In January, MGM China (OTC:MCHVY) Holdings Ltd shareholder Snow Lake Capital urged MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International to sell 20% of the Macau casino operator to a Chinese strategic partner to help secure its local casino licence.
In an open letter, Snow Lake said markets already reflected licence renewal concern for U.S.-owned Macau operators through trading performance and valuation - citing the high profitability yet low valuation of market leader Sands China.
DIVERSIFICATION PRICE
Casino operators are trying to ensure they stay on the right side of authorities, such as through hiring more local staff and supporting patriotic education initiatives.
Heeding government calls to help diversify Macau's gaming-dependent economy, Sands China built the territory's largest convention centre and exhibition space, entertainment theatres and around 13,000 hotel rooms.
Adding a Chinese partner would improve Sands China's licence chances and also boost its marketing ability in mainland China, said Anthony Lawrance, managing director of consultancy Greater Bay Insight.
""It would help for what comes next in Macau after the licences are awarded: access to new land and opportunities in (the mainland city of) Hengqin.""
Still, risks for potential suitors include legal battles relating to the opaque process through which Sands China was awarded its Macau casino licence in the early 2000s.

In one case going to trial in June, former partner Asian American, headed by Taiwanese businessman Marshall Hao, is seeking $12 billion to compensate for lost profit from 2004 to 2020 after Sands China opted to change partner.

Investing.com - European stock markets were largely flat Wednesday, with investors keeping a wary eye on developments surrounding the coronavirus while monitoring the U.S. political turbulence.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.1%. 
The near-term outlook for the European economy darkened somewhat on Tuesday after a report by the newspaper Bild suggested German Chancellor Angela Merkel wanted to extend the current lockdown in Europe's largest economy through the end of March. 
""It seems the December trading enthusiasm, driven by the prospect of a global economic recovery, is now being offset by alarming Covid-19 numbers as well as valuation concerns over stocks that went far away from their equilibrium price,"" said Pierre Veyret, a technical analyst with ActivTrades, in a morning note.
That said, the underlying tone remains positive given low interest rates globally and monetary and fiscal stimulus from central banks and governments alike, as well as the idea that vaccinations are coming.
Later Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote to impeach President Donald Trump over the recent turmoil in the U.S. Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence resisted pressure on Tuesday to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. An impeachment trial could proceed even after Trump leaves office on Jan. 20.
Back in Europe, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) stock rose 7.5% after the Spanish telecom company agreed to sell its mobile phone masts in Europe and Latin America to U.S.-based telecom infrastructure operator American Towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.41 billion) in cash. 
ASOS (LON:ASOS) stock rose 3% after the retailer posted a better-than-expected trading update, while  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) stock climbed over 6% after it emerged that Canada’s Couche-Tard was in talks to buy the French retailer. 
November industrial production figures for the euro zone are also due. The euro-area economy is poised to shrink again at the start of this year as the resurgent pandemic plunges the region into a double-dip recession.
Oil prices continued to climb Wednesday, boosted by industry data showing a hefty draw in U.S. inventories, again suggesting that the U.S. measures to contain the latest surge in the pandemic have had less effect on demand than those in Europe.
Oil stocks in the U.S. dropped by 5.8 million barrels last week, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed late Tuesday. The government agency, the Energy Information Administration, releases its data later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $53.37 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $56.84. Both benchmarks are close to their highest levels since February.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,857.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2186.

The latest beneficiary of the billionaire’s often cryptic language and 42 million-strong base of followers is a Japanese toy and game maker. Shares in  Bandai Namco Holdings Inc  (T:7832) rose 4.4% in Tokyo on Wednesday following a meme Musk tweeted overnight that featured a character from the company’s Idolmaster franchise.
Idolmaster is a long-running Bandai Namco series that started as an arcade game and grew to include mobile games and an animated series. With characters that translate across media and into toys, the franchise has been a key contributor to the firm’s earnings over the years.
The charcater used in the tweet that drove up the game maker’s stock is called Sachiko Koshimizu. While the origins of the meme are unclear, as is whether or not Musk was aiming his comment at anyone specific, the tweet was liked by over 300,000 users as of 4:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon in Tokyo.
Musk, a prolific tweeter, is well known for his references to Japanese pop culture. He commented in 2018 about his fondness for the hit anime movie “Your Name” and the Ghibli film “Princess Mononoke,” and jokingly asked to be referred to as “Elon-chan.”
“It’s quite a surprise to discover that despite his busy schedule, Musk is familiar with this Japanese game character,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market strategist at Securities Japan Inc. “Musk’s tweet could heighten awareness of the company’s games and characters overseas.”

Back in Europe, trading updates are expected from retailers Sainsbury’s,  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) and ASOS (LON:ASOS), while Spanish telecom company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has agreed to sell its mobile phone masts in Europe and Latin America to U.S.-based telecom infrastructure operator American Towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.41 billion) in cash. 
November industrial production figures for the euro zone are also due. The euro-area economy is poised to shrink again at the start of this year as the resurgent pandemic plunges the region into a double-dip recession.

Affirm said it offered 24.6 million shares of its Class A common stock, and that shares are due to begin trading on the Nasdaq later in the day under the symbol ""AFRM"".
Affirm, founded by  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) co-founder Max Levchin, had planned to sell 24.6 million shares at a target price range of between $41 and $44 each. The company had upsized the share offering from a range of $33 to $38 per share on Monday.
The IPO, the largest U.S. listing so far in 2021, signals that investor appetite for new stocks remains robust following a stellar 2020, which was the strongest IPO market in two decades.
Levchin founded Affirm in 2012 to offer easily accessible financing targeted at mostly young online shoppers, who pay back in monthly installments. The company generated revenue of $174 million in three months ended September 2020, up 98% from the previous year. Its net losses narrowed to $15.3 million compared with $30.7 million. As of June 2020, Affirm had $1.1 billion in debt.
Besides Levchin, Affirm's major investors include Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Funds, and Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc.

In a statement Vanguard said that since Friday it had exited its positions in securities that figured on a list published on Nov. 12.
Vanguard added that it was ""continuing to monitor the situation to ensure ongoing compliance with the executive order as additional securities are identified for sanction.""
It gave no further details.
Confusion over the securities affected prompted a U-turn by the New York Stock Exchange last week, when it said it would delist three Chinese telecom firms.
Just days earlier it had said it would keep them listed, reversing its announcement of their delistings a week before.
Other U.S. asset managers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), say they have dropped Chinese securities because of the ban, and index providers MSCI Inc, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices have cut sanctioned firms from their benchmarks.

702,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 12:05AM ET</span>","Return with confidence: Using tech to create safe offices, post-pandemic","By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - How can technology help companies worldwide return to work safely when lockdown ends?
At Siemens, Ruth Gratzke is overseeing a ""Return with Confidence"" campaign to create safe and healthy indoor office environments.
""It addresses everything from elevators where you don’t have to touch the buttons, touchless interactions throughout the building or management of meeting rooms and desks around social distancing,” said Gratzke, who is president of Siemens Smart Infrastructure, U.S., a unit of Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY). “It’s about using creative and new technologies, looking at what’s available in tech and giving people the confidence to return to the office.”
Gratzke, 49, talked to Reuters about the future of the office as well as leadership lessons she learned during the pandemic. Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What do you think our future work offices will look like?
A. The days of the good old cube format where everybody is sitting piled on top of each other are over. If people sit near one another again, there may be Plexiglass barriers around us.
And while people always say, “Yeah, we’re going to collaborate in these great beautiful meeting rooms,” people have learned to effectively communicate with each other via video.
Q. What impact has the pandemic had on leadership?
A. It’s shifted a lot more focus to our people. They are really the ones who have carried us through this pandemic and we’ve had to think a lot about, ""How do I take care of these human beings and keep them safe, engaged and motivated?""
Our Mexico operations lost a handful of employees. We had to look at ""how can we help their families through this dire time?"" We’re taking care of our employees in ways I never had to before.
Q. What is your biggest work-life challenge now?
A. Being a home educator while being president. My son is nine years old. He is in public school, and he went virtual in March.
I was used to going to work in the morning and not thinking about my family until I came back at night. Home schooling was incredibly stressful and trying to balance both was crazy.
But constantly juggling both made me a lot more patient with myself. If I have a video call in my home office, and my little guy barges in here because he couldn't solve a math problem, a year ago I would have killed myself over embarrassment. Now it’s like, “Hey, that’s OK. It’s part of life.”
Q. How are you managing burnout?
A. I’ve been working a lot more, longer hours, and I’m a lot more exhausted. My days are more packed and dense.
I’m a runner, so I get up at five in the morning and go pound the pavement for an hour. There’s something wonderful about just taking your music and going running in the dark. It cleanses my brain. Now, if I skip a run, I can feel my stress go up immediately.
Q. What advice do you have for someone just starting out right now?
A. For people that are trying to get into the job market, I am really impressed with young talent who go on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and are ruthless. They find a way to connect. They are not scared of approaching someone with a big title.
I have the highest respect for someone who dares to do that. That takes confidence. I really encourage you to use the tools you have today and don’t be afraid to be aggressive.
Q. Is there a business book you often recommend?
A. “The Other Kind of Smart” by Harvey Deutschendorf. At some point in my career, I received feedback that I was too assertive, and I needed to focus more on being in tune with people around me.
This book showed me that strengthening the side of EQ, the ability to listen, the ability to read the signs around you are equally important as having a brilliant mind or being a great engineer.

The world’s biggest oil producer has begun talks with lenders to secure favorable terms for the funding package that would then be offered to investors, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The discussions are occurring in parallel with the sale of a stake in a pipeline unit, which could raise about $10 billion for Aramco, the people said.
A pipeline deal would be the first phase of Aramco’s strategy to raise money by selling leasing rights or stakes in non-core assets, mirroring what Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has done in the past few years. The Saudi company is working with advisers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co., the Wall Street investment bank that’s also involved in the Adnoc deals.
Aramco declined to comment.
Adnoc, which pumps most of the oil and gas in the United Arab Emirates, has generated more than $15 billion from the likes of Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The company sold shares in its fuel-retail arm and leasing rights for properties and natural-gas pipelines.
Aramco, which for years maintained only minimal corporate debt, is increasingly tapping new sources of funding as it looks to maintain annual dividend payments of $75 billion at a time of lower oil prices. Most of those payouts go to the Saudi state, which needs the money to fund its budget.
The company listed in Riyadh in late 2019, but is still 98% owned by the government.
The firm’s gearing, a measure of debt to equity, has risen to 21.8%, above its target range of 5% to 15%. Debt also rose because it took on loans to pay for a $69 billion acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., a local chemical maker, last year.

The deal, which was proposed in January 2020, was scrapped to avoid protracted litigation, said Al Kelly, chairman and CEO of  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V).

705,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 11:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. tells European companies they face sanctions risk on Nord Stream 2 pipeline,"By Timothy Gardner and Daphne Psaledakis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department this month told European companies which it suspects are helping to build Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that they face the risk of sanctions as the outgoing Trump administration prepares a final round of punitive measures against the project, two sources said on Tuesday.
""We are trying to inform companies of the risk and urge them to pull out before it's too late,"" a U.S. government source said on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. source said the State Department is expected to issue a report by Thursday or Friday on companies it believes are helping the Russia-to-Germany pipeline. Companies that could be in the report include ones providing insurance, helping to lay the undersea pipeline, or verify the project's construction equipment, the source said.
The companies could be at risk of U.S. sanctions under existing law if they do not stop work.
Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF) could be listed in the report, the source said. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nord Stream 2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The $11 billion pipeline, one of Russia's most important projects in Europe, has sparked tensions between Washington and Moscow.
The Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, which would deprive Ukraine of lucrative transit fees, saying it would increase Russia's economic and political leverage over Europe. The administration has also pushed exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe, a fuel that competes with pipelined gas from Russia.
The Kremlin says Nord Stream 2, led by state energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), is a commercial project.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, also says the pipeline is simply commercial. It needs gas as it shuts coal and nuclear plants on environmental and safety concerns.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden opposed the project when he was vice president under Barack Obama. It is uncertain whether he would be willing to compromise on the project after Jan. 20 when he takes over.
Gazprom halted Nord Stream 2 construction for a year after U.S. sanctions in December 2019. But work has resumed as Gazprom hopes to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea to double the existing line's capacity. The project is 90% completed with only a 62-mile (100-km) stretch in deep waters off Denmark left to complete.
Gazprom’s Western partners in the project are Germany’s Uniper, BASF’s Wintershall Dea, Anglo-Dutch oil major Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria’s OMV and Engie.
A U.S. based industry source who has seen the State Department communications said European companies, including German ones, received the inquiries from the Trump administration over the past several months, dating back to October, about their activities relating to Nord Stream 2.
The State Department asked the companies in October if they were involved with Nord Stream 2 and whether any work continued after July 15, and the value of any services or support.
On that date, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned investors in Russia's Nord Stream 2 and Turkstream pipelines they could face sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017.
On Jan. 1, the State Department reached out again with an urgent request, the industry source said, asking to set up a call that weekend with the Bureau of Energy Resources to discuss the details of the companies' wind down activities.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with U.S. shares seeing modest gains during the previous session over raised hopes for an end to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields also saw their highest levels since March over expectations of massive stimulus packages from President-elect Joe Biden. However, these levels were tightened to near flat a day after a Treasury auction was well-bid.
The incoming Biden administration, set to take office on Jan. 20, is expected to ramp up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, which would allow large parts of the economy to reopen, Commonwealth Financial Network head of portfolio management Peter Essele told Reuters.
“The amount of pent-up demand is slowly being unwound and over the next year it is probably going to result in one the strongest growth in 20 years and markets are pricing that in … right now, it’s a race between cases and the vaccine and the vaccine will ultimately win out and the curve will flatten out,” he added.
Although progress on vaccine rollouts continued to raise hopes for an economic recovery, lingering concerns over the speculative excess and froth that has driven stocks to all-time highs despite COVID-19 remains.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren pushed back on speculation that the Fed will begin to ease its asset-purchase program any time soon in separate comments.
“What I think investors are most focused on is the digesting of what is shifting fiscal policy … we’re beginning to lose the anchor on some long-term key benchmark interest rates,” DWS Group chief investment officer of the Americas David Bianco told Bloomberg.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to take part in a webinar on Thursday. Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at an online conference later in the day.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.83% by 10:38 PM ET (3:38 AM GMT). The state of emergency declared for the Greater Tokyo area during the previous week is expected to be extended to seven additional prefectures, including Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.59%. In Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.04% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.07%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.08%, while the SZSE Component was up 0.27%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the billionaire chief executive of investment firm DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday he is bullish on Asian emerging market stocks and neutral on bitcoin given the volatility of the cryptocurrency.
Gundlach, whose Los Angeles-based firm manages more than $140 billion in assets, said valuations across financial markets appear stretched given massive amounts of global economic stimulus in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
""We remain mired in a house of mirrors,"" Gundlach said on a webcast.
In a wide-ranging presentation, he noted that some long-term market trends may be stalling, such as the outperformance of U.S. equities versus the rest of the world and large-cap U.S. equities rallying more than small-caps.
At the same time, he predicted that the United States may experience additional rounds of layoffs focused on middle-management as companies make some work from home policies permanent given worker preferences.
The U.S. economy shed jobs for the first time in eight months in December, with the majority of job losses coming in sectors such as hospitality and leisure that remain battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Asian emerging market stocks have rallied at the start of the year, with South Korean shares up nearly 10% and China's CSI 300 index up 7.4%. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500, by comparison, is up 1.2% over the same time.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned the convictions of four former Wilmington Trust Co executives charged with concealing from regulators the amount of troubled loans on the company's books following the 2008 global financial crisis.
Former President Robert Harra, Chief Financial Officer David Gibson, Controller Kevyn Rakowski and Chief Credit Officer William North had been charged with underreporting the amount of Wilmington's ""past due"" commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Prosecutors said the defendants wanted to make Wilmington's finances look better, enabling it to raise $273.9 million in a February 2010 stock offering, just over a year after accepting $330 million from the federal government's bank bailout program.
But a unanimous three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia agreed with the defendants that the reporting rules were ambiguous, and that prosecutors failed to prove that only their own view of the rules was objectively reasonable.
In voiding the May 2018 convictions, the appeals court ordered acquittals on charges of making false statements and certifications, and returned conspiracy and securities fraud charges to a lower court for a possible new trial.
""Needless to say, I am disappointed,"" U.S. Attorney David Weiss in Delaware said, adding that the defendants may be retried.
Wilmington was founded by the du Pont family in 1903. M&T Bank Corp (NYSE:MTB), of Buffalo, New York, bought Wilmington in 2011 after loan losses prompted Wilmington to sell itself at a fire-sale price, 46% below its market value.
Rakowski's lawyer Henry Klingeman called Tuesday's decision a ""vindication,"" saying ""it was never the defendants' fault that the bank struggled."" Harra's lawyer Lawrence Lustberg, Gibson's lawyer Kenneth Breen, and North's lawyer George Hicks were also pleased with the decision.
Wilmington was indicted in 2016 over the loans, becoming the first recipient of federal bailout money under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be charged. It reached a $60 million settlement in 2017.
The case is U.S. v. Harra et al, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-1136.

Both the FTC and a large group of state attorneys general, led by New York, filed lawsuits against Facebook in December before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging violations of antitrust law. The company was accused of using its dominance to crush smaller rivals.
The state attorneys general requested last month that the cases be consolidated. Facebook objected to the consolidation, saying it was ""premature and unnecessary"" but did not object to the same judge hearing both cases.
Judge Chris Cooper, who had been assigned the FTC's case, said in a minute order on Tuesday that he was asking for it to be re-assigned to Judge James Boasberg, who is hearing the similar case filed by state attorneys general.

Boasberg was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama, and is also presiding judge on the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which considers surveillance requests from U.S. law enforcement.

39 newcomers targeted corporations around the world last year, making up 30% of all 128 campaigns launched in 2020, according to data released on Tuesday by investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ). In 2019, first ever activists made up 29% of the year's 147 total campaigns.
Elliott remained the busiest activist with 16 campaigns.
""These numbers show that regardless of Covid, activism is an attractive strategy and that activists are healthy and well funded and ready to mount more campaigns,"" said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard.
The recent rollout of coronavirus vaccines and a strong stock market recovery late in 2020 emboldened rabble-rousing investors to take on new targets after a slowdown earlier in the year.
Newly launched Engine No. 1 mounted a campaign at Exxon (NYSE:XOM) while WaterMill Asset Management, Impala Asset Management, Vesa Equity Investment and Steel City Capital were other first time activists targeting U.S. companies.

Overall activity around the globe however remains dominated by Paul Singer's Elliott followed by Jeff Smith's Starboard Value, which targeted 6 companies, the data showed.
Elliott put $8.9 billion in capital to work in 2020 at companies including Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) where it won two board seats in 2021.

In other news, General Motors (NYSE:GM) had a good day, rising to a record high as the automaker unveiled an electric van, not made by Nikola.
Here are three things that may move markets tomorrow:
1. Impeachment part deux
Assuming Vice President Mike Pence doesn't throw President Trump under the 25th Amendment bus, he's looking at a second impeachment process on Wednesday. Trump faces one charge for incitement of insurrection, and the debate on the resolution is expected to begin tomorrow with a vote to follow.
2. Consumer prices and more
Headline inflation for December hits at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Consensus calls for a 0.4% bump from the previous month's 0.2%. MBA mortgage applications (7:00 AM ET) and the monthly budget statement (2:00 PM ET) are also due.
3. Beige book
The Fed's December Beige Book will give us a look at how regional economies were holding up at the end of the year. Look for commentary on how the continued pandemic and initial vaccine distributions affected outlooks and hiring trends.

Investing.com – The Dow struggled for direction Tuesday as investors weighed up strength in value stocks against weakness in tech amid rising political tensions after Democrats said they would move ahead with a plan to impeach President Donald Trump.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.23%, or 71 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.20%.
Trump criticized the Democrats for seeking to impeach him, insisting that his remarks in the run-up to the attack on Capitol Hill were ""appropriate."" The president also hit back at big tech, in particular social media firms, several of which have reined in his reach by restricting access to his accounts.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) fell 3%, while  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were down about 1%.
The House of Representatives said they would move ahead with a vote to impeach Trump on Wednesday, accusing him of inciting supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol. The vote comes as Vice President Mike Pence is unlikely to give in to the Democrats demand to invoke the 25th amendment and remove Trump from office.
Value stocks stifled downside momentum in the broader market as investors bet the economy could snap back stronger under a new administration that is expected to be heavily focused on spending.
President-elect Joe Biden is expected to lay out his multi-trillion stimulus plan on Thursday. The stimulus plan is likely to include a proposal to boost stimulus checks to $2,000 from $600, provide state and local aid, and fund the ongoing vaccine roll out.
Energy added to gains from a day earlier, led by a rise in oil prices as Wall Street continued to tout further gains ahead amid expectations for further stimulus and the vaccine roll out.

""Oil demand remains very levered to reaching herd immunity, with half of global oil demand losses still coming from jet, where international travel remains down 75% despite domestic flying only down 28%,"" Goldman Sachs said.
Industrials were inching up nearly 1% even as Boeing (NYSE:BA) slipped after aircraft orders fell by 17 in December, which included 105 737 Max cancelations, taking deliveries for the year to 157, down from 380 last year.

 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) jumped 5% after it sold 1 million Zoom Phone seats, a core product in its unified communication platform, within two years after launch. The stock was lower in pre-market trade after the company said it would sell $1.5 billion in stock to raise funds. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 was barely higher in Tuesday's volatile session as investors waited for earnings season and monitored developments in Washington after supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol.
As Democrats moved to impeach Trump for inciting the deadly rampage last week, Trump on Tuesday denied wrongdoing saying that his public comments on the day of the attack were ""totally appropriate.""
Also, the Washington Post reported that an FBI office in Virginia issued an internal warning the day before the Capitol invasion that extremists were planning to come to Washington and were talking of ""war.""
Trump's denial and the FBI story, which contradicts suggestions that the administration did not expect an attack, ""highlight the fact that there's still a lot of issues in this country and we have a lot of progress to make before we can really go forward,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
""It just gives investors some pause,"" said O'Rourke.
By 2:24 p.m. ET (1924 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.96 points, or 0.21%, to 31,074.65, the S&P 500 gained 2.25 points, or 0.06%, to 3,801.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.94 points, or 0.21%, to 13,064.37.
The communications services sector was the biggest percentage decliner of the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes as investors were worried that big social media companies such as  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) could come under increased regulatory scrutiny.
""A lot of what we've seen today and we've seen this week is big tech under pressure because of the obvious sizable influence and power they have,"" said O'Rourke as Facebook and Twitter banned Trump from their platforms after the Capitol attacks.
""It's expected the members of Congress will take it seriously now,"" he said.
Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were trading higher with energy stocks leading the gains with a 3% advance, as crude prices rose. [O/R] 
The consumer discretionary sector was the next biggest sector gainer with some of its biggest single stock boosts coming from carmakers. 
Shares in U.S. automaker General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) rose 6% to hit their highest in a decade after Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra outlined plans for its first electric commercial vans to be delivered to FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) by year-end.
Also shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc were up more than 5% as a regulatory filing showed the electric-car maker moved a step closer to its launch in India later this year by registering a company in the country.
The S&P financial sector traded above its February peak for the first time, boosted by rate-sensitive banks where were up 1.7% as benchmark U.S. Treasury yields reached their highest levels since March. [US/]
The small-cap Russell 2000 index gained about 1.4%.
Hopes of a big boost to public spending and speedy roll-out of vaccines under a Democratic-led U.S. Congress have pushed Wall Street to record highs, with economically-sensitive small caps, financial, industrial and energy sectors benefiting.
Investors were also waiting for the fourth-quarter earnings season to start Friday, with results from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and other big banks.
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to show a decline of 9.5% year-over-year in the final quarter of 2020, marking a slight improvement from the previous expectation for a 9.8% decline according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However earnings are expected to rebound in 2021, with a gain of 16.4% projected for the first quarter.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.89-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 85 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 283 new highs and four new lows.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm Cornell Capital is preparing a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of Knowlton Development Corp (KDC), which could value the manufacturer and custom formulator of products for the beauty industry at more than $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Cornell Capital has hired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to lead KDC's IPO, which may raise around $750 million and come later this year, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. 
The sources cautioned that the IPO plans are subject to market conditions. Cornell Capital and Goldman Sach declined to comment.
Longueuil, Québec-based KDC, operates under the brand name KDC/ONE, and provides manufacturing and packaging services to beauty and personal care companies. 
The IPO plans come at a challenging time for the $500 billion global beauty industry, as people stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has affected demand for makeup products, though the personal care sector, which includes products such as bath soap and shampoo, has performed better. 
Industry executives have talked about a broader recovery for the sector once COVID-19 vaccines are largely available. 
Cornell led an investor group to buy KDC in 2018 and since then has purchased a string of add-on companies to help expand it, including HCT Group and Zobele Group.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>",GM shares jump on plans for electric delivery vehicle business,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) shares jumped on Tuesday to their highest level since the company's post-bankruptcy IPO in 2010, as the automaker announced its entry into the growing electric delivery vehicle business.
After Chief Executive Mary Barra outlined plans for GM's first BrightDrop commercial vans to be delivered to FedEx (NYSE:FDX) later this year, GM shares rose as high as $48.95 in morning trading, pushing the company's market cap over $68 billion.
The new BrightDrop delivery business will put GM squarely in competition in the commercial sector with cross-town rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, as well as startups such as Rivian, Arrival and Canoo that are developing electric commercial vehicles for customers ranging from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Hyundai Motor.
Fueled in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, GM estimates the U.S. market for parcel and food delivery will climb to more than $850 billion by 2025. It is one sector that EV sales leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has yet to crack.
Barra said BrightDrop will offer delivery and logistics customers such as FedEx a range of products and services that leverage the automaker's expertise in electrification and fleet management.
The BrightDrop EV600 will use a version of GM's Ultium battery system that will power many of the company's future electric vehicles, including the Hummer EV pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq crossover.
Barra introduced BrightDrop in an online keynote address at the CES annual tech and gadget show.
As part of Barra's presentation, GM design chief Mike Simcoe hosted a virtual unveiling of two battery-powered Cadillac concepts: A flying car and a boxy shuttle with sliding doors. Simcoe said Cadillac also is working on a luxury electric two-seater.
In a pre-show briefing, Pam Fletcher, GM vice president of global innovation, said the BrightDrop EV600 is a large, purpose-built delivery van that will have a range of 250 miles (400 km) between charges, with a long list of advanced safety features and built-in internet connectivity.
Unlike Cruise, the San Francisco self-driving startup that is majority-owned by GM and is developing a robotaxi business, BrightDrop does not plan to operate its own vehicle fleet. It will focus on supplying electric vans and related services to commercial customers.
A source familiar with details of the EV600 said it will share basic underbody architecture with the Hummer EV and a variety of other large GM trucks and SUVs that will hit the market over the next three years.
The first 500 units will go to FedEx by the end of the year, with deliveries to other customers starting in early 2022, Fletcher said.
The BrightDrop commercial van family could eventually include a smaller model designed for medium-distance deliveries and a larger model designed for rapid loading and unloading, she said.
In November, GM said it would challenge Tesla with increased spending and accelerated vehicle production targets. The higher investment will be funded by expanded pickup and SUV production.
GM said it planned to increase spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion by 2023, up 35% from previously disclosed plans. The Detroit automaker will offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in China and the United States by then.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Trump delays increase in fuel economy penalties at auto industry request,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration agreed on Tuesday to an auto industry request to delay the start of dramatically higher penalties for companies that fail to meet fuel efficiency requirements, a move that could save the industry hundreds of millions of dollars or more. 
The decision - announced eight days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office - follows a U.S. appeals court ruling in August that overturned the Trump administration’s 2019 decision to suspend a regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements.
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued rules to raise fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards.
Automakers protested that 2016 hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually.
The auto industry trade group that sought relief praised the NHTSA's decision, noting vehicles that would have faced higher penalties ""have already been sold or will soon be manufactured."" 
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) paid a $79 million civil penalty for failing to meet 2017 fuel economy requirements after paying $77.3 million for 2016 requirements.
In November, FCA warned it could need to set aside 500 million euros ($608 million) as a result of the appeals court decision.
The NHTSA cited FCA's disclosure and noted ""increasing the rate is likely to lead to an increase in the price of
credits."" The agency added that ""to disregard the industry’s serious reliance interests would be unfair and improper.""
Environmental groups urged the administration to retain the increase, noting U.S. fuel economy fines lost nearly 75% of their original value because fines had been increased only once - from $5 to $5.50 in 1997 - since 1975.

Dave Cooke, vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said NHTSA's decision amounted to regulators ""doing some last-minute favors"" for the auto industry.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co delivered about 60% fewer aircraft to customers in 2020 than 2019 and less than one-third the deliveries of rival Airbus, the lowest in 43 years, company data showed on Tuesday. 
Tuesday's snapshot of orders and deliveries caps a year in which the coronavirus pandemic and the tail-end of a 20-month 737 MAX grounding after fatal crashes prevented embattled airlines from adding new jets to their sidelined fleets. 
Also, for a second month, Boeing handed over zero 787 Dreamliners to customers, as intensive inspections over recent production flaws compounded delays from the COVID-19 crisis. 
Jet deliveries are being closely scrutinized by investors as they generate much-needed cash during the coronavirus crisis. 
Overall, the U.S. planemaker delivered 39 planes to customers in December, including 27 737 MAX jets, one P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, and 11 widebodies. 
For the year, it delivered a total of 157 airplanes, down from 380 in 2019 and a record 806 jets in 2018. 
By comparison, Airbus posted stronger-than-expected deliveries of 566 jets in 2020, remaining the world's largest planemaker, a title Boeing held from 2012 through 2018. 
Even so, deliveries at Airbus fell 34% from a record a year earlier, when travel demand was riding high on the increasing mobility of consumers in fast-growing markets across Asia. 
For jet orders, Boeing booked 90 orders in December, including a previously announced lifeline deal from budget airline Ryanair for 75 737 MAX jets. The best-selling narrowbody was cleared to resume service in November in the U.S. after a 20-month grounding order. 
Boeing also booked orders for seven MAX jets from unidentified buyers in December, and for eight 777 freighters from the courier arm of  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) DHL Express. 
But the fresh orders were eclipsed last month as buyers walked away from orders for 105 MAX jets and two 787s, Boeing said. 
For the year, gross orders were 184 jets, down 25% compared with 2019, and the lowest since 1994. 
Adjusted for stricter accounting standards, cancellations and orders where the buyer converted to another model, 2020 net orders for all Boeing models moved to negative 1,026 at year-end, from negative 1,048 in November.

For the MAX, buyers canceled orders for some 641 jets, while Boeing removed from its backlog another 523 seen as unlikely to be filled when stricter accounting standards are applied.

The social media company said it had suspended a little more than 2,800 accounts and pages on its main platform and photo-sharing site, Instagram, for using fake identities and other forms of so-called ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".
The activity spanned 11 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Morocco, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. In most of those countries, the networks were focused on forthcoming elections and run by domestic groups, Facebook said.
""Deceptive campaigns like these raise a complex challenge by blurring the line between healthy public debate and manipulation,"" the company said in a blog post.
Three of the networks announced on Tuesday were first exposed last month and used by rival French and Russian groups to spread competing narratives in the Central African Republic ahead of the country's parliamentary election.
Facebook's operations chief Sheryl Sandberg said on Monday the company had no plans to lift its block on the accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump as it clamped down on a misleading phrase that has become a rallying cry for Trump's supporters.

(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) said late on Monday it had blocked a Christian crowdfunding site, GiveSendGo, after it helped raise funds for people who attended last week's event in Washington when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol.
The digital payments processor also confirmed to Reuters that it closed an account held by Ali Alexander, one of the organizers of the gathering. The news was reported earlier by Bloomberg, which cited an unidentified source.
Online platforms and social media companies are distancing themselves from, and taking action against, those that encouraged or engaged in last week's violence in the U.S. Capitol.
Twitter said it had suspended more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content after the assault on the Capitol building. QAnon backers push baseless conspiracies on social media.
A number of large U.S. companies, including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and Dow Inc, have said they would cut off campaign contributions to those who voted to challenge President-elect Joe Biden's victory, with Republicans in the U.S. Congress facing growing consternation from corporate America.
Supporters of Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, trying to halt the certification by Congress of Biden's election win. 
Trump, who has without evidence challenged the validity of Biden's election win, initially praised his supporters but later condemned the violence.
Bloomberg reported last week that PayPal had closed an account held by Joy In Liberty, one of the groups that paid for supporters of Trump to travel to Washington.
GiveSendGo, which describes itself as ""A place to fund hope. A place to work together with the body of Christ around the world to make a difference,"" said it had moved its payment processing away from PayPal and was going to shut its PayPal account anyway.
""We have created and are using alternative payment solutions for our platform"", GiveSendGo's co-founder and Chief Financial Officer Jacob Wells said in an email.

“‘This has required people to invest because they don’t want to sit around with their cash,” Marks said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “They don’t want Treasuries at less than 1% or high-yield bonds at 2%.”
Global credit and equity markets have staged a dramatic rebound since March, when the Fed first took unprecedented steps to steady the economy amid the Covid-19 outbreak. This dramatically cut the amount of distressed debt outstanding and propped up companies that were ailing even before the pandemic hit, depriving value-oriented investors like Oaktree of new targets.
Marks said the current market highs don’t jibe with events in the U.S.
“Why is the market making new highs every day if we have these problems,” he said. “The political division in the country is a terrific one but the greatest one of course is the pandemic.”
Discussing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s meteoric rise, Marks said the stock may be too high.
“If you describe an individual not of great needs, he should take some profits,” Marks said. “If he bought Tesla two years ago, he probably has a huge gain. It’s probably a very disproportionate amount of his financial net worth. He should absolutely cut back.”
Oaktree is one of the largest distressed-debt investors in the world, with more than $19 billion committed to credit from troubled companies. The Los Angeles-based fund has thrived in times of economic stress, when prices on bonds of companies in danger of defaulting fall to deep discounts.

Investing.com --   Albertsons Companies  (NYSE:ACI) thanks you for hoarding.
The grocery chain beat expectations and boosted its fiscal 2020 outlook, and Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran said on CNBC that he sees no deceleration ahead. 
The company said it expects identical sales growth in fiscal 2020 of approximately 16.5%, versus the previous 15.5%, as well as adjusted earnings per share of between $3.05 and $3.15 compared to an earlier forecast of no more than $2.85 per share. 
""Customer behavior is changing,"" Sankaran said, and with continued work-from-home scenarios, even post-pandemic, that means more eating at home. While growth rates from the start of the pandemic won't return, ""We're in for healthier growth than we saw before the pandemic."" 
For the third quarter, Albertsons reported sales of $15.4 billion, which narrowly beat estimates, and profit of 66 cents per share, compared to the expected 42 cents.
Shoppers are stockpiling amid a second wave of infections.
""Customers continue to consolidate trips and we continue to see fewer trips per household but larger baskets these households are spending more with us compared to last year,"" Sankaran said on the earnings call.
Breakfast, too, has been an unexpected boon.
""We've seen large increases in sales of breakfast items such as cereal, eggs and bacon as people are eating a full breakfast at home rather than grabbing breakfast on the go,"" Sankaran said. ""We anticipate the consumption patterns we are seeing now will continue well into 2021 and then should continue to favor us.""
Albertsons is trading at a relatively low forward price to earnings ratio of almost 10 times, compared to Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s 26 times.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has moved a step closer to its launch in India later this year by registering a company in the country, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.
 Tesla Motors  (NASDAQ:TSLA) India and Energy Private Limited was incorporated on Jan. 8 with its registered office in the southern city of Bengaluru, a hub for several global technology companies.
The filing shows the Indian unit has three directors including David Feinstein, who is currently a senior executive at Tesla, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
India's transport minister Nitin Gadkari told a local newspaper in December the U.S. electric carmaker would start with sales and then might look at assembly and manufacturing.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has tweeted several times in recent years, including as recently as October 2020, about an impending foray into India.
The move comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is promoting the production and use of electric vehicles to reduce the country's oil dependence and cut down on pollution. 
But efforts have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.

To boost investment, India plans to offer $4.6 billion in incentives to companies setting up advanced battery manufacturing facilities, according to a government proposal seen by Reuters.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",Analysis: The trillion dollar weapon in the U.S.-China tech stock war,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The threat of a $1 trillion U.S. sanctions hit on the Chinese internet giants that have led emerging market stocks to their first record high since 2007 is overshadowing the rally, just as increased scrutiny from Beijing itself squeezes valuations. 
U.S.-Sino tensions ratcheted up in recent days as outgoing President Donald Trump's administration pushed through a ban on Americans investing in 35 firms it considers to be linked to China's military.
Sources in Washington last week said Trump was considering adding  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent, worth a combined $1.3 trillion, the second and third biggest EM stocks in the world and held by almost every major U.S. investment fund, to the list of banned firms.
Targeting China's two most valuable companies would be the most dramatic step yet against the country's firms as Trump seeks to cement his hardline policy against Beijing during his final days in office.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates that U.S. investors hold roughly $1 trillion of Chinese internet and tech stocks, or have U.S. listings known as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that Washington has also been clamping down on. 
""To unwind 1 trillion of investment (if Alibaba and Tencent were removed) is a lot!"" said Vivian Lin Thurston, a portfolio manager and Chinese equity analyst at William Blair Investment Management. 
""It would be unprecedented,"" she added. ""It hasn't happened before in any global market."" 
Swiss bank UBS calculates that just over a third of Alibaba's $616 billion market cap is held by U.S. investors, while 12% of Tencent's $35 billion value is.
The two firms also account for almost 11% of MSCI's $7 trillion Emerging Market index which they respectively joined in 2015 and 2008. Chinese firms now make up 40% of the index, up from just 17% a decade ago. 
Graphic: China's growing dominance of MSCI's emerging market index https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-MARKETS/jznvnqwjdpl/chart.png
THE BIG UNWIND 
Global index providers such as MSCI, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell as well as the New York Stock Exchange have been forced to eject high profile firms on Trump's list like China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and semiconductor giant SMIC from their top benchmarks.
William Blair's Lin Thurston explained how those removals then trigger a wave of selling by investment funds that passively track the indexes. 
""As soon as it is delisted - bang it's gone,"" she said referring to the need to shed the stocks.
While incoming President Joe Biden could reverse the ban, analysts at UBS say the new administration may not want to appear ""soft"" on China. 
Neither Biden nor his team have commented on the matter, but a reversal still wouldn't undo the billions of dollars of disruption already caused. 
Chinese investors have swooped in to buy up some of the offloaded shares but may struggle to absorb everything if things snowball. 
Goldman Sachs estimates there would be a $28 billion selloff if every international fund tracking MSCI's main global, emerging market or Asia indexes were to liquidate holdings of the 42 Chinese firms its views as at risk, not including Tencent or Alibaba.
It and fellow Wall Street banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have also said they will withdraw as many as 500 Hong Kong-listed structured products they had issued linked to the Chinese firms.

ANT PROBLEMS 
The Trump administration has had both Tencent and Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group in its crosshairs for some time.
Just last week, Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. transactions with Alibaba's Alipay mobile payment app and Tencent's WeChat and QQ Wallet over concerns they could be used to ""track the locations of federal employees"" and ""build dossiers of personal information"". 
China's foreign ministry responded saying the U.S. was abusing its power and unreasonably suppressing foreign firms with the measures. 
Tencent and Alibaba have declined to comment. 
In early November, it was Beijing itself though that rattled investors after the surprise suspension of Ant Group’s $37 billion public listing, set to be the world’s largest stock market debut, with just days to go.
Alibaba, which owns about a third of Ant, has seen its market value shrink by more than a quarter since the IPO was shelved and regulators zeroed in on its business model, although it is still among the biggest 10 companies globally with a valuation of more than $600 billion.
Some fund managers considered Beijing's move a sensible one as Ant, a major online lender, lacked adequate capital buffers. But others like  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors' Head of Global Emerging Market Equities Alistair Way are concerned. 
""We have become rather more nervous about the regulatory climate in China and the seeming desire to reduce competitive dominance of big e-commerce players such as Alibaba,"" he said.
""In aggregate we have been reducing exposure to Chinese internet firms."" 
 Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen senior investment director Nick Robinson is also unsure.
""It feels unlikely at the moment that they (Alibaba and Tencent) will be added to the blacklist, but so far it hasn't been right to bet on a de-escalation.""
""So could it happen? Absolutely. And if it does happen it could be quite significant.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, as concerns about ongoing political instability and the severity of the pandemic's latest surge blunted optimism generated by promises of more stimulus and the start of the nation's vaccination campaign.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 36 points, or 0.1%, at 30,973 points, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%.
The near-term challenges to the economic outlook were underlined earlier by a closely-watched indicator of small business optimism falling to its lowest level since June. The National Federation of Independent Businesses' main index of confidence fell to 95.9 from 101.4 in December.  Despite that, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies powered 1.0% higher to a new all-time high.
Bank stocks were again among the most prominent early gainers, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock rising 1.3% to a new record high. It's now up nearly 10% since the Democratic Party's victory in the Georgia runoff elections solidified 'blue; control of Congress for the first time in six years.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock also rose 0.5%, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose 1.6% to its highest in a year. All are being supported by the sell-off in longer-dated U.S. Treasuries, which is increasing the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates. A wider spread gives banks fatter lending margins.
Among early movers, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 0.6% and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 0.1% as the two companies braced for legal action from the supporters of Donald Trump, after both companies clamped down on language that they said could be used to foster further violence. That came against the backdrop of an FBI warning of armed protests across the country to mark and possibly disrupt the inauguration of Joe Biden as president next week.
Elsewhere,  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock rocketed again, after it said it would form a joint venture with France's Renault (OTC:RNLSY) with the aim of getting a 30% market share in the European van market. It's the second major strategic announcement from the loss-making manufacturer of hydrogen fuel cells in barely a week. Plug Power stock rose 16%, while other makers of hydrogen fuel cells were also dragged higher by the news. Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) rose 14.1% and  FuelCell Energy  (NASDAQ:FCEL) rose 12.3%.

Morgan,"(Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's decision to close three plants in Brazil will cut its losses and allow it to focus on boosting profitability in its underperforming international segment, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Tuesday.
The United States' No. 2 automaker on Monday said it would take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion to close the Brazilian plants, under used for a while due to pandemic-related restrictions, affecting 5,000 jobs.
Shares of the company gained 3% following the announcement on Monday afternoon and were roughly steady in premarket trading on Tuesday at $9.31.
Ford said the move was part of a previously announced $11 billion global restructuring, of which it has already taken a charge of $4.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020. It expects to book another $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and about $1.6 billion in 2021.
J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note the move came at a time when investors had been complaining of the absence of a path to profitability for the South American businesses.
""We expect the move to quickly reduce losses in its South American operations, for which we now model a breakeven result in 2020 compared with a loss of $300 million prior.""
The brokerage raised its price target for Ford's stock by 10% to $11. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts also said the plant closures supported Ford's road to improved margins and that a reduced footprint made sense.

747,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 08:09AM ET</span>","In Blow to Retailers, Pandemic Made Online Upstarts Even Stronger","(Bloomberg) -- Digital brands looked headed for a reckoning a year ago, with bloated valuations, rising advertising costs and ever more competition.
Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. and gave a giant gift to brands that mainly sell directly through the web. With their brick-and-mortar competition shuttered and the virus raging, Americans flocked online and loaded up on home goods, comfy clothes and much more. And this wasn’t just 20-somethings, but pretty much everyone.
This helped remove a big hurdle to continued growth for direct-to-consumer brands: finding new customers. The bulk of these businesses got off the ground by flooding social media with ads targeted at younger shoppers. This created a winning formula and digital brands flourished last decade.
However, they increasingly faced rising marketing costs as brands selling everything from subscription toothbrushes to cleaning services poured cash into courting the same young cohort. That led many to try to push into the mainstream by opening stores and advertising on television or through direct mail to win shoppers it couldn’t reach online. Covid helped on this front, too, because industries hit hard by the pandemic, such as restaurants and travel, slashed advertising. That brought down ad rates on the web and in traditional media, creating a big opening for smaller brands. 
“At a point, these brands either move into the mainstream or fizzle out,” said Sonal Gandhi, chief product officer for The Lead, a research and events firm focused on e-commerce. Because of the “pandemic and everyone going online, they can reach the older customers they couldn’t before.”
This is another blow for legacy retailers and brands—many of which have been hammered by the store closures and recession triggered by Covid. The 10 largest public U.S. companies that are either clothing retailers or department stores collectively had $38 billion of revenue wiped out last year, or about a quarter of their 2019 sales, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
At Mack Weldon, an underwear and casual basics brand based in New York, the opening in ad markets helped create a boom in new customers during the fourth quarter, according to chief executive officer and founder Brian Berger. And that included gains among senior citizens.
The pandemic “created lasting growth implications for our business,” Berger said.
Covid also got Mack Weldon, which has annual revenue of more than $50 million, into television for the first time. The company did it cheaply, using a freelance producer to create a spot in house with previously recorded customer testimonials. In the fourth quarter, it doubled its television budget and plans to keep up that spending early this year. 
“That was a big win for us,” Berger said.
The Lead included Mack Weldon in its Foremost 50, a list of direct-to-consumer brands it sees as positioned to have staying power and challenge incumbents. The past five years showed that starting a digital brand became easier with the increased automation of digital advertising, but few have broken out.
“We found a ton of new customers.”
Many of these brands have taken on investment from venture capital and other sources, which is why there was so much hand-wringing when their prospects to either go public or be acquired faded. And that's why this moment could be so crucial, according to The Lead’s Gandhi. 
Not only do these brands have an opportunity to push into a new demographic or part of the country, but they are luring older customers who are often more loyal. Many have shopped at the same stores for decades and could be as devoted to a digital brand they trust, she said. 
“The crossing over into the mainstream has been facilitated” by the pandemic, Gandhi said.
At Tecovas, a western wear brand based in Austin, Texas, the pandemic sapped demand for its handmade cowboy boots—not as many occasions, like concerts or weddings, to wear them, according to CEO and founder Paul Hedrick. But even with the industry down 30%, the company boosted sales about 10% last year because of its acumen in digital advertising, he said. A big help was that its marketing cost per customer declined by about a quarter. 
“We found a ton of new customers,” Hedrick said, partly crediting the drop in digital ad rates. “There were tailwinds in reaching consumers more cheaply.”
Tecovas also stuck with its plan on physical stores and opened seven in the U.S. after the pandemic hit, more than doubling its total. While it didn’t get any great deals on leases because they were signed months in advance, cheaper rents may be a boon for the brands that go into brick and mortar, said Hedrick, who left a career in private equity to start Tecovas in 2015. He sees the past year as a reset for the direct-to-consumer market. 
“Over the last 12 months, a lot of people came to their senses,” said Hedrick, whose company also made the Lead’s list. “Valuations came down to earth. There was a flurry of enthusiasm that got overly enthusiastic.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses with investors looking for additional fiscal stimulus amid continued political turmoil.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 54 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.2%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 40 points, or 0.3%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% lower Monday, snapping the 2021 winning streak, while the S&P 500 closed 0.6% lower and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2%. The DJIA hasn't fallen on back-to-back days since Dec. 9-10.
The United States lost more than 22,000 lives to Covid-19 last week, a second straight weekly record. The overall death toll is now 375,000.
This surge, and the associated economic damage, prompted President-elect Joe Biden to promise further economic stimulus “in the trillions of dollars” late last week. More details are expected to follow in a formal announcement on Thursday, something that is supporting markets at their current elevated level.
Repercussions of last week’s violent scenes on Capitol Hill continue to be felt in political circles. The House of Representatives introduced an article of impeachment on Monday, accusing Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"", and plans to vote on it this week. 
Fears are also mounting that there could be further disruptions in the days leading up to Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, with the FBI stating it has received information indicating ""armed protests"" are being planned at all 50 state capitols as well as in Washington.
Looking at economic data, the main release Tuesday will be the JOLTs job openings data for November, at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), which follows Friday’s disappointing nonfarm payrolls release.
Also of interest will be a number of Federal Reserve speakers, particularly after a number of regional Fed Presidents have hinted that the central bank’s 'tapering' of bond purchases could begin toward the end of 2021.
In corporate news, the social media giants will remain in focus after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all clamped down on speech that they said raised the risk of further violence.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, climbing to 11-month highs, helped by last week’s pledge by Saudi Arabia to voluntarily cut production. 
Focus will now turn to the publication of reports concerning U.S. oil stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute later Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.3% higher at $52.95 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $56.39.

751,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 06:04AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Fed Taper Talk Cools Euro Rally; Reassurance for Eurozone Stocks,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Just as things were beginning to look a bit ropy for Europe’s exporters, help may be at hand.
Only a couple of days ago, the EUR/USD was at its highest in nearly three years, having risen 12% against the dollar from its post-pandemic low. Many analysts had already assumed that $1.25 would be the next big number to fall, with an overshoot as far as $1.30 or even further seen as possible by some.
That threatened to derail a Eurozone economic recovery that, despite signs of more action from governments to support domestic demand, is still going to depend to a large extent on exports.
However, a spate of comments from the Federal Reserve in the last week has encouraged speculation that the U.S. central bank may entertain thoughts of winding down its stimulus as early as the end of this year.
At the same time, the prospect of a unified Democrat-controlled Congress has shifted expectations of U.S. bond issuance higher. The 10-year Treasury yield premium over the corresponding German Bund has widened by 12 basis points in the last week, improving the relative attractiveness of the dollar. As such, the euro is back at $1.2160 and looking less of a one-way bet.
An interview given by the European Central Bank’s Isabel Schnabel to Austria’s Der Standard, published on Tuesday, helps to show why, pre-empting a discussion that is almost certain to figure prominently in the euro zone over the coming months, namely, the rebound in headline consumer prices that will push all kinds of buttons among the region’s inflation hawks.
A rise is as good as pre-programmed, given that energy prices collapsed a year ago as the pandemic erupted, and given that a cut in value added tax in Germany, the Eurozone’s largest economy, which ran through most of last year, expired at the end of 2020.
A couple of upticks in measured prices, however, do not make a return of inflation.
“There are no indications that we need to be concerned about inflation being too high,” she said. “The main problem is probably that economic demand is too weak.”
Banks including JPMorgan and UBS have argued that the euro zone is likely to suffer a ‘double-dip’ recession around the turn of the year, with both 4Q 2020 and 1Q 2021 GDP numbers coming out negative due to extensive lockdown measures across the region.
Even if a faster-than-expected rollout of vaccines across Europe allows a quick recovery, Schnabel argued that the main point is still valid.
“The prices for services, such as travel or eating out, may soar on the back of the pent-up demand. But such a short-term development should not be mistaken for a sustained increase in inflation, which is likely to only emerge very slowly.”
In other words, the ECB doesn’t want you to even think about a weakening of its stimulus any time soon. The upward drag from Treasury yields may force it to spend a little more in keeping Eurozone yields anchored, but given that the ECB spent only 57 billion euros in December on its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and has the freedom to spend over another trillion in the next 15 months, that shouldn’t be too hard."

(Reuters) - Analysts expect a strong turnaround in profits at Asian companies as regional economies see a surge in factory activity and an expansion in exports, helped by approvals for multiple coronavirus vaccines.
Asia's large- and mid-cap companies are expected to post profit growth of 26.4% in 2021, after an estimated 5% growth last year, according to Refinitiv data. 
Singapore, South Korea and Japanese firms lead the earnings growth for the region this year, boosted by a surge in electronics exports.
The data also showed Chinese firms were to likely record an 18.8% rise in profits this year, compared with 10.5% in 2020.
""China could see further earnings upgrades driven by sustained business activity growth and online/offline retail sales growth albeit at a slower pace,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a report.
""India and Korea are also likely to see earnings revision upgrades helped by sustained strong manufacturing activity data and exports,"" it said.
In different sectors, industrials and consumer discretionary companies are expected to post a faster recovery this year, after being hit heavily by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
Energy and mining firms are also poised to see a strong growth this year, thanks to a surge in commodity prices.
Iron ore prices have risen more than 40% in the past two months, while crude oil gained 28%.
Some analysts expect earnings growth in Asian firms to bolster the equity markets this year after a sharp rally in 2020.
The MSCI Asia Pacific index has gained 3.7% so far this year, after climbing 17.2% last year.

Deutsche Bank is Trump's biggest lender, with about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president's umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to Trump's disclosures with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics dated July 31 last year, plus banking sources.
The move, reported by the NYT and citing a person familiar with the bank's thinking, comes as  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY) - where Trump's ethics disclosures show he has checking and money-market accounts - called for him to step down. 
""The resignation of the president ... is in the best interests of our nation and the American people,"" Signature Bank said on its website.

The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside normal business hours, and the White House press office did not answer the phone.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shares were mixed on Tuesday as investors paused to assess how much worse the COVID-19 pandemic could get while waiting for a new earnings season on Wall Street to inject fresh direction.
U.S. bonds remained under pressure, with yields building on their 10-month highs, though not yet at levels that make them more attractive than stocks, analysts said.
Blue chip indices in London, Paris and Frankfurt were little changed in early trading on Tuesday. European shares hit their highest levels in 10 months last week but had eased on Monday.

""The main focus now is how much worse can it get in respect to COVID in the UK and Europe, and is China starting to see evidence of a second wave,"" Hewson added.
There was little in the way of major corporate earnings news or key economic data as markets waited for the new earnings season on Wall Street, with banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reporting on Friday.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion, with investors reacting with caution after a suite of U.S. Federal Reserve officials hinted that it could start reducing its monetary stimulus later this year.
Three regional Fed Presidents -- Richmond's Tom Barkin, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic and Dallas' Robert Kaplan -- all hinted more or less clearly on Monday that the 'tapering' of bond purchases could begin toward the end of 2021. The Fed is currently pumping $120 billion a month into the economy through such asset purchases.  Another barrage of Fed speeches is due Tuesday, starting with governor Lael Brainard at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
At 4:05 AM ET, the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.1%. 
Global equity markets have posted strong gains over the last few weeks, boosted by stimulus from central banks and governments alike, and the idea that vaccinations were on their way.
This tone was helped by the prospect for additional U.S. fiscal stimulus after a Democratic sweep of Congress, with President-elect Joe Biden pledging Friday a new economic stimulus “in the trillions of dollars.”  
However, investors are now starting to weigh up whether valuations are becoming too stretched, especially with a global surge in Covid-19 cases, following the emergence of new highly transmissible strains of the virus. That's posing fresh challenges for governments that are still only in the early stages of vaccination campaigns. 
Additionally, political uncertainty has increased in the U.S.: Democrats introduced a resolution into the House of Representatives to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting insurrection following a violent attack on the Capitol by his supporters last week.

760,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>",European Stocks Mixed; Pausing for Breath After Gains,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, after a suite of U.S. Federal Reserve officials hinted that it could start reducing its monetary stimulus later this year.
Three regional Fed Presidents -- Richmond's Tom Barkin, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic and Dallas' Robert Kaplan -- all hinted more or less clearly that the 'tapering' of bond purchases could begin toward the end of 2021. The Fed is currently pumping $120 billion a month into the economy through such asset purchases.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
Global equity markets have posted strong gains over the last few weeks, boosted by stimulus from central banks and governments alike, and the idea that vaccinations were on their way.
This tone was helped by the prospect for additional U.S. fiscal stimulus after a Democratic sweep of Congress, with President-elect Joe Biden pledging Friday a new economic stimulus “in the trillions of dollars.” 
The Dax, for example, reached its all-time high at the end of last year, while the indexes on Wall Street have posted record closes on a regular basis into 2021. 
However, investors are now starting to weigh up whether valuations are becoming too stretched, especially with a global surge in Covid-19 cases, following the emergence of new highly transmissible strains of the virus. That's posing fresh challenges for governments that are still only in the early stages of vaccination campaigns. 
Additionally, political uncertainty has increased in the U.S.: Democrats introduced a resolution into the House of Representatives to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting insurrection following a violent attack on the Capitol by his supporters last week. 
Back in Europe, the Italian banking sector will be in focus Tuesday after Monte dei Paschi said it would grant access to confidential data to potential merger partners selected by its advisers, as the Italian government presses ahead with plans to cut its stake in the state-owned bank.
Both UniCredit (MI:CRDI), Italy's second-biggest bank, and Banco Bpm SpA (MI:BAMI), Italy's third-largest bank, have been linked with Monte dei Paschi in the past.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, remaining supported by last week’s pledge by Saudi Arabia to voluntarily cut production by 1 million barrels per day as well as the expectation of additional U.S. fiscal support. However, gains are limited amid worries about demand growth as the number of global Covid-19 cases tops 90 million.
Focus will now turn to the publication of reports concerning U.S. oil stockpiles from industry group American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, on Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $52.58 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $55.99. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,859.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2159.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Value stocks surge boosts 2020’s losers as investors bet on economic revival,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are weighing how much further a rally in value stocks can run, as expectations for greater fiscal spending under a Democrat-controlled Congress add momentum to the surging shares of companies that took a beating for most of 2020.
Shares of banks, energy firms and other economically sensitive companies climbed after the Democratic party's recent victory in the Senate, adding to gains sparked by breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19 late last year. 
The move in these so-called value stocks, which tend to trade at relatively low price-to-book values, has stood out even in a broader rally that has seen most segments of the markets advance and Treasury yields climb on hopes of an economic revival. The Russell 1000 value index has jumped 14.5% since early November, nearly triple the gain of its growth-stock counterpart, which is dominated by technology. 
That kind of outperformance is well outside the norm for value stocks, which badly trailed growth companies in the years since the financial crisis and especially in 2020, when the “stay at home” trend of 2020 buoyed big tech stocks for most of the year. 
Still, as investors bet an economic revival this year, the rally in value shares may have further to go, if history is any guide. 
A BofA Global Research indicator that tracks a number of economic factors is approaching the ""mid-cycle"" phase, where value has historically outperformed growth 71% of the time, excluding the tech bubble of 20 years ago. The firm’s top picks for 2021 feature a bevy of value names, including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT).
Meanwhile, energy sector funds saw $1.9 billion in inflows last week, their strongest since 2014, according to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). Tech, by comparison, saw ""muted"" inflows of around $600 million. 
""The lockdown mode ... is going to end at some point and I think Wall Street is getting comfortable with that idea,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, which in recent months cut its technology holdings. 
(Graphic: Value stocks overtake growth: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/VALUE/qmyvmqdxjvr/chart.png)
Economically sensitive stocks can rebound quickly as growth picks up speed after a recession.
Value stocks saw a 25% gain while momentum names lost 30% during a three-month stretch in 2009, when the economy was emerging from the financial crisis, according to Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
More often, however, rallies in value names have tended to sputter over the last decade, and investors said there are several catalysts that could derail the current move. 
Among those are delays with the U.S. vaccine rollouts, a potential factor that analysts at Deutsche Bank said was among the top risks to their recently upgraded forecast for U.S. growth. 
""Obviously, we all hope that the vaccines ... will get us to a much better place by the second half of the year,"" said Doug Cohen, portfolio manager at Fiduciary Trust International. However, there are ""no guarantees on that.""
At the same time, Democrats will have little margin for error when it comes to enacting fiscal spending measures, given their razor-thin majority in Congress, analysts said. 
U.S. economic growth could top 5% in 2021, on a fourth- quarter on fourth-quarter basis, if lawmakers pass another $900 billion in fiscal spending over the next few months, analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote last week, up from their forecast of 3.8%. 
Investors will also be paying close attention to corporate views of the economy in the upcoming earnings season, which kicks off this week. 
Earnings for S&P 500 companies overall are expected to jump about 24% in 2021, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, including strong rebounds for economically sensitive groups such as industrials, materials and financials.
""The outlook has to be good,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management. It “would really kick the market into higher gear if we are hearing more companies raise guidance.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, after U.S. shares declined for the first time in five sessions overnight.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.06% by 9:35 PM ET (2:35 AM GMT), with markets reopening after a holiday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier in the day that he would declare a state of emergency for Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, extending the one declared for the Greater Tokyo area during the previous week.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.49% and in Australia, the ASX 200 inched down 0.03%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.43%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.44% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.46%.
Investors were also weighing whether equities are running too hot, and if valuations are too stretched. Ten-year Treasury yields were at 1.15%, climbing to their highest level since March 2020.
Benchmark Treasury yields surpassed the 1% mark during the previous week over hopes that a Democrat-controlled Congress would pass big stimulus packages to drive economic recovery from COVID-19. President-elect Joe Biden is due to lay out proposals for “trillions” of dollars in fiscal support on Thursday.
However, higher yields could jeopardize current easy financial conditions and reset expectations for a range of asset classes.
“Ultimately it goes back to the 10-year,” Lynx Equity Strategies’ KC Rajkumar and Jahanara Nissar said in a note.
A higher yield “points to higher inflation down the road, which is negative for stocks. We are not there yet, but as the 10-year inches higher, the closer we get,” the note added.
However, other investors were more optimistic.
“People are optimistic to see the yield curve steepening and it could help spreads and net interest margins for banks,” Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes told Reuters.
Big tech giants, including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also fell. Twitter shares fell up to 6.4% and Facebook also saw its shares fall on Monday. Both companies suspended U.S. President Donald Trump’s accounts on their platforms, in Twitter’s case permanently, over the events that took place in Capitol Hill during the previous week.
“The weakness was led by tech and I think the banning of Trump’s account by Twitter and Amazon stepping up against Parler all brought a renewed focus on increased regulation and reining in on tech,” Great Hill Capital’s Hayes said.
Concerns are rising that further violence could take place as House of Representatives Democrats introduced a resolution on Monday to impeach Trump for the second time. A vote will take place later in the week unless Vice President Mike Pence makes use of his constitutional authority to remove Trump from power.
However, Trump and Pence reportedly agreed to work together until Jan. 20, when Biden and his administration are due to begin their terms, during a meeting on Monday.
The U.S. will release a slew of data later in the week, starting with December’s core Consumer Price Index on Wednesday. Data on December’s Producer Price Index (PPI), core retail sales and industrial production will follow on Friday.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at an online conference Wednesday, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to take part in a webinar on Thursday."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - New models will help electric vehicle sales in China zoom this year, after tepid business in a virus-riddled 2020, and analysts predict Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model Y pricing will emerge as a major disruptor in the world's biggest car market.
Tesla Inc, which became the world's most valuable car maker last year, started selling locally made Model Y SUVs in China this month, for almost a tenth less than gasoline-powered luxury cars with similar market positioning.
It set the starting price at 339,900 yuan ($52,376), or 10% below official prices of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes GLC, BMW's X3 and Audi's Q5L - all locally made gasoline sport utility vehicles (SUVs) with similar size and positioning.
""The pricing will disrupt the conventional premium cars market and shatter the traditional belief that the cost of an electric vehicle (EV) should be higher,"" said Cui Dongshu, secretary general at China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).
The Tesla Model Y pricing - that analysts say will be the price to beat - and new models from others such as Mercedes and BMW will help drive up demand in China, which also accounts for almost half of global EV sales.
Sales in China of so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell cars, are expected to grow 30-40% to around 1.8 million units in 2021, according to its top auto industry body China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and analysts.
NEV sales likely rose only 8% last year to 1.3 million, lagging a government target for annual sales to reach 2 million by 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced people indoors and eroded demand in the first few months of the year.
China's decision to extend EV subsidies by two years, instead of phasing them out by end 2020, will also underpin demand in 2021. Beijing wants NEVs to account for 20% of its overall auto sales by 2025, versus about 5% now.
Stricter rules in some cities to promote greener vehicles and reduce air pollution are expected to force urban customers to buy EVs too, according to Yale Zhang, head of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight.
MORE MANUFACTURING
Betting on growing demand, NEV makers such as homegrown Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc and Xpeng Inc as well as foreign players, such as Tesla, are expanding manufacturing capacity.
Tesla is expected to make ""around or over half a million"" vehicles in China this year, with around 20% earmarked for international exports, industry sources with knowledge of Tesla's orders to suppliers said.
That represents a big increase from 2020, when Tesla produced around 150,000 cars, analysts said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla's China website shows customers who place Model Y orders now need to wait until the second quarter for delivery.
It is offering the same financing tools to customers for the Model Y as it does for the Model 3 sedan that allow buyers to pay only 10% of the cost upfront when they get the car.
Tesla's Model 3, which it has been making in China for over a year, is also seen chipping away at the dominance of Daimler, Audi and BMW in the conventional premium auto sector.
Shanghai-made Model 3s outsold similarly positioned and more expensive Audi's A4, BMW's 3-series and Mercedes C-class in November, data from CPCA shows.
""Competitive pricing is the key,"" CPCA's Cui said.

President-elect Joe Biden is set to release proposals for a multitrillion-dollar stimulus package on Thursday, which could help to pave the way for a rise in inflation, against which gold is seen as a hedge.
The precious metal has lost ground so far in 2021 after posting its biggest annual gain in a decade on the back of the devastating effects of the pandemic, vast stimulus, and rising haven demand.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake is in advanced talks to acquire a minority stake in the commercial activities of New Zealand Rugby, home of the world-renowned All Blacks team, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters. 
The potential transaction was for a stake of ""up to 15%"" of the three-times winners of the Rugby World Cup, the source said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private.
The talks with Silver Lake were first reported by Sky News, which said the deal for a 15% stake would value the team at about $2 billion. Sky said a deal had not been concluded, but could be announced as soon as this month.
An investment in one of the most famous brands in world sport would expand the buyout giant's $75 billion portfolio of companies, most of which are technology and sports venues and teams, according to its website.
Representatives from Silver Lake declined to comment. 
Charlotte McLauchlan, Director of Communications for New Zealand Rugby, told Reuters the organisation was ""on a path to look at what an investor partner for New Zealand Rugby might look like - which is a very exciting prospect for us.""
She declined to comment any further. 
Last year New Zealand Rugby launched a review into how the game in the rugby-mad country is run and financed, saying it could include private equity investments.

In 2019, the California-based firm acquired a 10% stake in City Football Group (CFG), which owns reigning English Premier League champions Manchester City and teams in the United States, Australia and China.

DETROIT/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Monday it will close its three plants in Brazil this year and take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the company's under use of its manufacturing capacity.
Production will cease immediately at Ford's plants in Camaçari and Taubaté, with some parts production continuing for a few months to support inventories for aftermarket sales. The Troller plant in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, will continue to operate until the fourth quarter.
Ford officials said the action was part of the $11 billion global restructuring previously forecast by the U.S. automaker, of which it had accounted for $4.2 billion through the third quarter of 2020. Ford shares closed up more than 3%.
The plant closures affect about 5,000 employees, mostly in Brazil, Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said on a conference call with reporters.
Industry vehicle sales fell 26% in Brazil last year and are not expected to rebound to 2019 levels until 2023 with an emphasis on less profitable fleet sales, Ford said.
""We know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,"" Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. “We are moving to a lean, asset-light business model by ceasing production in Brazil.""
Ford officials said the plant closures are part of the company's strategy to achieve 8% global operating margins. Ford, which has operated in Brazil for more than a century, has begun discussions with its unions and others about the layoffs.
Brazil's Economy Ministry lamented Ford's decision to end production in the country and said it reinforced the need for reforms to improve the business climate.
In Camaçari, in northeastern Brazil, the union called an emergency meeting at the factory gates at the first shift on Tuesday to take a stance on the loss of 4,059 jobs.
""This very hard blow took us by surprise. We never imagined that Ford could close its factories in Brazil,"" said union leader Julio Bonfim in a video message to the workers.
The closures marked another retreat by Ford in a developing market after the Dearborn, Michigan-based company last month called off its auto joint venture with India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
As a result of the plant closures, Ford will end sales in South America of EcoSport SUV, Ka subcompact car and T4 SUV once inventories are sold.
Ford retains a plant in Argentina and another in Uruguay.
Ford said it will maintain its product development center in Bahia, its proving ground in Tatuí, São Paulo, and its regional headquarters in São Paulo.

Of the $4.1 billion in charges, Ford said it expects to record about $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and about $1.6 billion in 2021. The charges include about $1.6 billion in noncash charges and the rest in cash, primarily in 2021 to cover the layoffs.

Pilgrim's Pride, owned mainly by Brazil's  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY), will pay $75 million to settle claims by purchasers that bought chickens directly from the company. The size of Tyson's settlement with the same purchasers was not disclosed.
Neither company admitted liability, and both said settling was in their best interests.
Both settlements require approval by a federal judge in Chicago.
Neither affects claims by ""indirect"" purchasers, which include restaurant and supermarket operators such as Chick-fil-A, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Inc as well as ordinary consumers.
They also do not affect claims against other defendants, such as  Sanderson Farms  (NASDAQ:SAFM) Inc and Perdue Farms Inc.

A few smaller chicken producers previously reached similar settlements totaling $13 million.
Similar litigation has been pending in Minneapolis federal court accusing Tyson, another JBS unit and other pork producers of conspiring to inflate pork prices by limiting supply.
The Pilgrim's settlement follows that company's agreement in October to pay a $110.5 million fine to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice criminal price-fixing probe.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s stock tumbled over 6% on Monday after its move to permanently suspend U.S. President Donald Trump's widely-followed account spurred concern among investors over the future regulation of social networks.
The San Francisco-based social media company said on Friday its suspension of Trump's account, which had 88 million followers, was due to the risk of further violence following the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week.
The move drew criticism from some Republicans for quelling the president's right to free speech, while European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton said the past week's events likely heralded a new era of heavier official control.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose relations with Trump have been frosty, criticized Twitter's ban and warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression.
The attention drawn to Twitter increased investors' worries that it could be more exposed to regulation than its bigger rivals  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) or Google and YouTube-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Other social media platforms, including Facebook, have issued similar bans on Trump, but Monday's fall of as much as 12% in Twitter's stock was much deeper than for any of its peers. Facebook was last down almost 4% and Alphabet lost 2%.
Speaking during the Reuters Next conference, Facebook's operations chief Sheryl Sandberg said the world's largest social network had no plans to lift its block on Trump's accounts.
BIG TECH POWER
Friday's move, accompanied by suspensions for some of Trump's supporters, was the first time Twitter had banned a head of state, and Republican lawmakers denounced its decision as an attempt to stifle conservative voices. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also suspended Parler, a social network favored by many Trump supporters, from their app stores and Web-hosting services, effectively making the service inaccessible. 
""These moves, whether you consider them justified or not, could well see them lose further users if they become seen as arbiters of what is considered politically correct or acceptable,"" said Michael Hewson, chief analyst at CMC Markets UK.

(Reuters) - At least eight businesses are set to price initial public offerings (IPOs) in New York in the next three days, seeking to raise a total of nearly $5 billion in what could be the biggest week for new listings in more than five years.
The companies are seeking to capitalize on what has been the strongest IPO market in two decades. Some $83 billion was raised across 203 IPOs in 2020, excluding listings of special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs), on U.S. stock exchanges, according to Refinitiv data.
This was the most since 2000, as firms such as home-rental company Airbnb Inc, food delivery startup DoorDash Inc and data warehouse firm Snowflake Inc capitalized on the stock market recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial technology startup Affirm Holdings Inc, mobile gaming firm Playtika Holding Corp, pet retailer Petco Health and online fashion marketplace Poshmark Inc are among those aiming to price IPOs this week.
Other high-profile listings expected in the coming months include supermarket chain Winn-Dixie operator Southeastern Grocers Inc, gaming site Roblox Corp and grocery delivery app Instacart.

Biotechnology companies Cullinan Oncology LLC and Gracell Biotechnologies, priced IPOs last week higher than targeted, their shares closing up on their first day of trading. On Monday, Affirm increased the target selling price for its shares because of the strong investor demand.
With the stock market posting new all-time highs, concerns are rising about listings overheating. Companies priced their U.S. IPOs at a median price-to-sales ratio of 38.5 in 2020, the highest since the dotcom era of 2000, according to data complied by Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida.
Some investment bankers said it was hard to predict if there is an IPO bubble, noting that low interest rates have made investors more willing to bet on riskier stocks.
""We are very much in a risk-on environment and this is when IPOs shine. We don't know how long this continues, but while it does companies will keep coming to market,"" said David Hermer,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG's head of global equity and debt capital markets.
DIRECT LISTINGS, SPACS
Dealmakers expect more companies to go public through a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO this year, after four companies, including data analytics firm Palantir Technologies and workplace app Asana Inc, picked this route last year, up from two in 2019.
Direct listings let companies sell shares directly to investors without paying for underwriters. Unlike IPOs, they do not allow companies to raise capital, though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month greenlighted a process by the New York Stock Exchange that enables companies to raise money in a direct listing. This process has yet to be tested.
""The idea that we see another round of direct listings this year that doubles the four we have had so far again is inside the scope of possibility,"" said Andrew Wetenhall, co-head of equity capital markets in the Americas at Morgan Stanley.
SPACs, also known as blank-check acquisition companies, kept raising funds from investors at a strong pace after bringing in a record $83.4 billion through IPOs last year, according to SPAC Research.
Their popularity was fueled by the success of some SPAC mergers in late 2019 and early 2020, such as space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE), sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc and battery-maker Quantumscape Corp.
In the first week of 2021, a record 28 SPACs raised over $6 billion to invest in private companies to take public, according to IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
""The SPAC boom will have a greater impact than in 2021 than last year,"" said Matthew Kennedy, a senior strategist at Renaissance Capital.
""They've raised a lot money in the past months and we start the year with hundreds of blank checks looking to take companies public,"" Kennedy added.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:45PM ET</span>",Italy's Monte dei Paschi to open books to potential partners,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - Monte dei Paschi di Siena said it would grant access to confidential data to potential merger partners selected by its advisers, as Italy presses ahead with plans to cut its stake in the state-owned bank.
Confirming comments to Reuters from sources earlier on Monday, Monte dei Paschi (MPS) said its board had hired  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to help Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) in the task of studying strategic options and sounding out market interest for the Tuscan bank.
Despite the turmoil in the ruling coalition which risks precipitating a government crisis, the Italian Treasury is moving forward with plans to cut its 64% stake in MPS and meet pledges made to the European Union as part of the 2017 bailout.
Rome has identified UniCredit as the ideal merger partner for MPS, sources have said previously, but Italy's second-biggest bank wants strict terms to be met before considering an acquisition and is yet to sign a confidentiality agreement.
The Treasury wants to see if Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest bank which Rome last year had looked at as a possible partner for MPS, could be interested in entering the data room, one of the sources said.
Banco BPM was not immediately available to comment.
UniCredit, which is in the process of picking a new chief executive after Jean Pierre Mustier decided to step down by April, would only consider a deal that did not affect its capital reserves.
It also wants to be sure that the package of incentives Rome is readying to ease a sale will be approved in Brussels and Frankfurt, the sources have said.
UniCredit's board is expected to examine a list of CEO candidates at a meeting on Wednesday before taking a final decision in early February.
In the latest push to get the Milan-based bank to consider the deal, Rome is studying a plan to shift at least 14 billion euros in impaired loans from UniCredit to state-backed loan manager AMCO, sources have said.
That could rise further to 20 billion to 21 billion euros, accounting for almost all of UniCredit's 22.7 billion euros in problematic debts at the end of September, one source added.
The Treasury has also set aside 1.5 billion euros to cover part of an up to 2.5 billion euros capital shortfall at MPS.
The Siena-based bank must tell the European Central Bank by the end of January how it plans to fill the gap. MPS said on Monday it was pushing back by around 10 days to Jan. 28 the board meeting called to approve the capital measures.
Tax breaks introduced by Rome for mergers taking place in 2021 would entail a 2.4 billion euro net benefit for UniCredit if it took on loss-making MPS.
But a potential takeover has resistance from inside bank as well as among some of UniCredit's leading domestic investors.
To remove the key hurdle to a potential deal, Italy is working on a complex scheme entailing both guarantees and a possible spin-off involving state-owned firm Fintecna to address around 10 billion euros in claims, both judicial and out of court, faced by MPS.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>","Wall St ends lower with Washington turmoil, earnings in view","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Monday as investors took some profits after last weeks' records while they waited for earnings season to begin and eyed events in Washington with trepidation.
U.S. stocks had rallied last week as investors bet that Democrats' win of Georgia runoff elections would bring a higher likelihood of a heftier fiscal stimulus package to boost the pandemic-savaged economy. 
But some investors worried stimulus could be delayed as House Democrats introduced a resolution to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting insurrection following a violent attack on the Capitol by his supporters.
""When markets are looking at something as critical as the governance of the United States, even a little bit of uncertainty can have a meaningful impact,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. ""What does that do to the ability of the parties to work together to pass policy things like stimulus."" 
McMillan said investors also worried about more attacks. The FBI has warned of possible armed protests being planned for Washington, D.C., and at all 50 U.S. state capital cities in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, a federal law enforcement source said on Monday.
""Generally speaking, Washington doesn't make too much of a difference but since policy is influencing so much of what's expected around the economy, this is kind of a unique time,"" said McMillan. 
But U.S. Treasury yields rose as safe haven bonds sold off on Monday and economically-sensitive sectors such as energy and financials outperformed while defensive bond proxy sectors like utilities and real estate sold off. 
These trades suggested to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta, Georgia, that investors were still hopeful about stimulus.
""After last week the market is in a little bit of a digestion phase. Underneath the surface what you're seeing continue is the reflation trade,"" said Lerner. ""This is a continuation of the expectation of more fiscal stimulus.""
And along with wariness about Trump's last nine days in office, Lerner cited uncertainty ahead of the unofficial start of earnings season on Friday when banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) report results. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 89.28 points, or 0.29%, to 31,008.69, the S&P 500 lost 25.07 points, or 0.66%, to 3,799.61 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 165.54 points, or 1.25%, to 13,036.43.
Among the S&P's 11 major industry indexes, consumer discretionary and communications services were the biggest percentage decliners. 
Shares of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) tumbled 6.4% and weighed on the communications sector after the micro-blogging site permanently suspended Trump's account. But it shares were still more than 160% higher that where they traded before Trump won the Presidential election in 2016. 
Other Big Tech firms  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) were also weak on Monday as they took their strongest actions yet against Trump to limit his social media reach.
Meanwhile investors were waiting for 2021 guidance on earnings and the economy from the fourth-quarter conference calls from big companies JP Morgan, Citi and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) starting on Friday.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co shares fell 1.5% on Monday after a 737-500 jet operated by Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air with 62 people on board crashed on Saturday.
However, shares in Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co rose 11.7%, making it the biggest single boost for the S&P 500 after a small trial of its experimental Alzheimer's drug found that it slowed by about a third the rate of decline in a combined measure of cognition and function in patients at an early stage of the disease.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 183 new highs and three new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 14.08 billion shares changed hands on Monday compared with the 11.87 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 04:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FBI probes Russian-linked postcard sent to FireEye CEO after cybersecurity firm uncovered hack - sources,"By Christopher Bing
(Reuters) - The FBI is investigating a mysterious postcard sent to the home of cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE)'s chief executive days after it found initial evidence of a suspected Russian hacking operation on dozens of U.S. government agencies and private American companies.
U.S. officials familiar with the postcard are investigating whether it was sent by people associated with a Russian intelligence service due its timing and content, which suggests internal knowledge of last year's hack well before it was publicly disclosed in December.
Moscow has denied involvement in the hack, which U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributed https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29G0XT to Russian state actors.
The postcard carries FireEye's logo, is addressed to CEO Kevin Mandia, and calls into question the ability of the Milpitas, California-based firm to accurately attribute cyber operations to the Russian government.
People familiar with Mandia's postcard summarized its content to Reuters. It shows a cartoon with the text: ""Hey look Russians"" and ""Putin did it!""
The opaque message itself did not help FireEye find the breach, but rather arrived in the early stages of its investigation. This has led people familiar with the matter to believe the sender was attempting to ""troll"" or push the company off the trail by intimidating a senior executive.
Reuters could not determine who sent the postcard. U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies are spearheading the probe into its origin, the sources familiar said.
The FBI did not provide comment. A FireEye representative declined to discuss the postcard.
A disinformation researcher from the Rand Corporation, Todd Helmus, received a similar postcard in 2019, based on an image of it Helmus posted to Twitter. Helmus, who studies digital propaganda, said he received the postcard after testifying to Congress about Russian disinformation tactics.
FireEye discovered the Russian hacking campaign - now known as ""Solorigate"" for how it leveraged supply chain vulnerabilities in network management firm Solarwinds - because of an anomalous device login from within FireEye's network. The odd login triggered a security alert and subsequent investigation, which led to the discovery of the operation.
FireEye worked closely with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to determine that the infiltration at FireEye in fact represented a hacking campaign that struck at least eight federal agencies including the Treasury, State and Commerce Departments.
When the postcard was sent, FireEye had not yet determined who was behind the cyberattack. A person familiar with the postcard investigation said ""this is not typically the Russian SVR's playbook"" but ""times are rapidly changing."" SVR is an acronym for the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia.
A former U.S. intelligence official said the postcard reminded him of a now public mission by U.S. Cyber Command where they sent private messages to Russian hackers ahead of the 2018 congressional elections in the United States.
""The message then from the U.S. was 'watch your back, we see you' similar to here,"" the former official said.
The extent of the damages tied to the U.S. government hack remains unclear. Emails belonging to senior officials were stolen from an unclassified network at the Treasury and Commerce Departments.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said its iShares ETFs have complied with index provider moves to drop certain China securities in response to pressure from Washington.
In a note to clients provided by a spokesman for the New York asset manager on Monday, BlackRock listed five ETFs affected by the index provider changes, including four funds based on indexes provided by MSCI Inc and one benchmarked against the FTSE Russell China 50 Index.
The move is the latest as Wall Street firms cut their exposure to China, and shows the influence of index providers whose products determine the flow of passive investments.
Since last month MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones have said they will remove a total of 15 different companies from equity indexes, among those that the U.S. Defense Department has said have links to the Chinese military. Many of the companies have denied the assertions, and China's government has said the claims lack evidence.
BlackRock has declined to make executives available for interviews. In its note to clients BlackRock said, ""iShares ETFs have adjusted and will continue to be responsive in accordance with their respective indexes’ treatment of securities impacted by recent U.S. sanctions on certain Chinese companies.""
An MSCI-based fund listed by BlackRock is the $6.8 billion iShares MSCI China ETF. As of Jan. 8, its top holdings were  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, according to BlackRock's website.
Sanctioned firms like China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, and Hangzhou Hikvision, among the ETF's investments in 2020, are not currently listed.

Investing.com – The Dow closed lower Monday, on rising political tensions after lawmakers stepped up efforts to remove President Donald Trump from office, though losses were stifled by gains in energy and healthcare stocks.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) weighed on industrials, falling 1.5% after its 737-500 jet crashed on Saturday, following takeover from Jakarta’s main airport.
Energy and healthcare helped keep a lid on losses, with the latter boosted by a jump in Eli Lilly.

Investing -- Stocks gave back some of last week’s gains on Monday in a muted trading session as Congress introduced an article of impeachment accusing President Donald Trump of “incitement to insurrection.”
Political tensions spilled over into this week with just nine days left in Trump’s presidency as lawmakers tried to find a way to remove him from office early.
President-elect Joe Biden will inherit some of the fallout of the latest Trump scandal, while also having to get a growing pandemic under control in the early weeks of his administration. Vaccine distribution has remained a frustration.
Biden also wants to get moving on a stimulus package that will give more money to households and help relieve local and state governments. The pressure on the stimulus front comes after last month’s jobs report was far worse than expected.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Lots of Fed speeches
Five Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak on Tuesday on various topics beginning with an appearance by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 9:00 AM ET (1300) GMT. Bostic is supposed to talk about racism and the economy, according to a notice.
But investors could reasonably expect some if not all of the Fed officials to talk about the economy. The U.S. recovery will not get up to full steam until vaccines are distributed widely enough to end the pandemic, Bostic said in a speech on Monday.
""At heart it is a public health crisis first. All the economic fallout has been a function of how we responded to the public health crisis,"" Bostic said, as reported by Reuters. ""Until that gets settled the economy is going to play out in a slower way.""
Also scheduled to speak Tuesday: Lael Brainard, Robert Kaplan and Loretta Mester.
2. A window on hiring
JOLTs job openings data for November are due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The number was 6.6 million for the month before that.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey provides a glimpse at what is happening in the labor market with respect to hiring.
3. Can oil continue to climb?
The industry’s weekly survey of crude inventory would give another indication about the direction of oil prices. The American Petroleum Institute report comes out at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GT).
Last week’s report showed a draw of 1.66 million barrels in the prior week. Oil prices have been rising -- over $50 a barrel for the first sustained time since the beginning of the pandemic. Last week, Saudi Arabia agreed to cut 1 million barrels a day in production in February and March to help stabilize prices.

Investing.com – The Dow pared some losses Monday, on gains in energy and healthcare stocks, but remained under pressure from rising political tensions after lawmakers ramped up efforts to remove President Donald Trump from office.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.37%, or 116 points, though had been down 266 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 was 0.37% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.11%.
The House introduced an article of impeachment on Monday, accusing Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"" following the invasion of the U.S. Capitol, and plans to vote on it this week. The Democrats have given Vice President Mike Pence 24 hours to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president, or will move forward the impeachment that could also result in a ban on Trump from taking public office.
Beyond politics, the corporate world has also moved to curb Trump's reach.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) said it would ban Trump from accessing his account indefinitely, sending its shares down more than 5%.
While there is a near-term threat to Twitter's daily active user count in the first quarter, owing to ""churn from the conservative community"" … ""strong political activists will remain on the social media platform for other content,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said.   
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, fell more than 2% after banning conservative social media platform Parler from their app stores, as the company failed to take measures to stop content that incited violence and promoted illegal activities.  
Boeing (NYSE:BA) weighed on industrials, falling 2% after its 737-500 jet crashed on Saturday, following takeover from Jakarta’s main airport.
Energy and healthcare helped keep a lid on losses, with the latter boosted by a jump in Eli Lilly.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) rose 12% after announcing that its experimental drug appeared to slow the decline of patients with the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
Energy rose more than 1% as oil prices turned positive even as concerns over fresh lockdowns hurting energy demand persisted amid the ongoing pandemic.
Financials also cut losses to end the day in the green ahead of big week as Wall Street banks are to kick of quarterly earnings season on Friday. 
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6%, shrugging off positive remarks from Bank of America.
Bank of America upgraded its price on the stock to $900 from $500, citing the electric automaker's fundraising potential."

Biden told reporters he was “appalled” to learn that some Republican members of Congress refused to wear masks while hiding with colleagues from a mob that overran the Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers counted Electoral College votes.
Representative Bonnie Coleman, a New Jersey Democrat, announced Monday on Twitter that she had tested positive for coronavirus infection after sheltering “with several colleagues who refused to wear masks.”
“It’s irresponsible,” Biden said. “It’s not a political issue, it’s an issue of public safety and it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”
He added that 3,000 American deaths per day from Covid-19 is “beyond the pale.”
Biden is due to unveil a proposal for another coronavirus aid package on Thursday, and will meet remotely with his advisers later Monday as he plots a plan to speed up vaccinations and pass a relief bill.
“My number one priority is getting vaccine into people’s arms, like we just did today, as rapidly as we can,” Biden said. “It’s going to be hard, it’s not going to be easy, but we can get it done.”
Biden said he has asked whether lawmakers can “bifurcate” handling an impeachment trial along with confirmation of his cabinet and passage of a new aid package.
“My priority is to get, first and foremost, a stimulus bill passed,” he said. “Could you go half a day on dealing with impeachment and half a day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package? So, that’s my hope and expectation.” He said he hasn’t yet been told if that’s possible.

The automaker said Monday it will close two factories in Brazil immediately and a third by the end of the year, resulting in an end to sales of three locally made models. The job losses include employees in both Argentina and Brazil, it said.
The latest streamlining effort will cost the company about $2.5 billion in pretax charges for 2020 and around $1.6 billion this year, Ford said.
“With more than a century in South America and Brazil, we know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,” Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.

On Monday, the PGA of America said it was stripping the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster of the 2022 PGA Championship following a vote by its board of directors. 
In a video announcing the decision, PGA of America President Jim Richerson said: ""It has become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand.” 
Hours later, the R&A followed suit, saying it would not stage any championships at the Trump-owned Turnberry golf course in Scotland for the foreseeable future. 
The R&A described its decision this way: ""We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances.""
Turnberry, which Trump purchased in 2014, has been the home of four previous Open championships. 
Golf is one the first major industries to distance itself from the president and his business operations after Trump stoked supporters to attack Capitol Hill last week, pushing lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to implore him to either resign early or get impeached for the second time. 
A representative for the Trump Organization said it was ""incredibly disappointed"" with the PGA's decision."

Investing.com --  Stop the presses. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock traded down on Monday.Shares fell more than 4% from a record after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) said Nio (NYSE:NIO) and other electric vehicle companies are now using its technology, which features the “world’s most advanced processor” for use in autonomous vehicles and robots.
Nio’s ET7 vehicle puts Tesla ""squarely in its sights,"" according to 24/7 Wall Street.
It's all about computing power, and that’s what Nvidia’s Orin brings to Nio. The scalable supercomputer-on-a-chip can deliver up to 254 trillion operations per second (TOPS). Nio’s Adam platform uses four of the chips on a single board to deliver a total computing power of 1,016 TOPS.  
Data from 2019 showed that the Orin chip could perform 200 trillion operations per second, almost seven times NVIDIA’s previous Xavier chip (30 trillion operations) and more than Tesla’s FSD Computer (144 trillion), according to Electrik.
Last week, Nio said it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin for advanced automated driving technology in its future fleets. Li Auto said in September it would use Orin in its next generation of cars, which are being developed with Desay SV. Xpeng, also working with Desay, uses NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier in its XPilot. 
The three Chinese automakers doubled their sales in 2020, with a combined volume of more than 103,000 vehicles, Nvidia said in a statement. 
The Orin-powered supercomputer will debut in the flagship ET7 sedan, scheduled for production in 2022, and will be in every subsequent NIO model.

Pfizer’s German partner now aims to churn out around 2 billion doses this year. 
That’s up from an earlier target of 1.3 billion. 
The new goal comes as extra production lines come on stream. 
BioNTech has also found ways to extract more doses from each vial of the product. 
In a presentation Monday (January 11), the firm said it would use so-called ‘low dead space syringes’. 
They allow it to extract six doses from each standard vial, instead of the usual five. 
A new production site in Marburg, Germany, has also been acquired from Novartis. 
It will become operational by the end of February, and have an annual capacity of 750 million doses. 
Contractors who supply ingredients have also ramped up capacity. 
BioNTech said it had shipped 32.9 million doses as of Sunday (January 10). 
A spokeswoman said the firm had actually made 50 million by the end of last year. 
But shipments were held back to avoid excess storage time. "

803,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",Goldman Managers Say Buy U.S. Stocks Despite Dot-Com Valuations,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks are the most expensive since the dot-com bubble, but to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s $575 billion wealth management division, they’re still the best game in town.
Strategists there are telling clients to cast aside valuation worries as the S&P 500 soars to records through the pandemic. It’s all justified in a world of rock-bottom interest rates and where U.S. profit growth is faster than just about anywhere.
“When we look at these companies, they’ve not reached the types of valuations that would imply a fundamental scenario that just defies reason,” Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation for the group, said on a call with reporters on Friday. “That was the case back in the late 1990s.”
Goldman’s wealth-management team says they expect the S&P 500 to post a return of about 8% this year on earnings growth of about 26%, which is slightly above consensus. While U.S. equities currently trade near forward price-to-earnings levels last seen in 2000, it says the key difference is that some of today’s most popular stocks, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., have positive free cash flows.
Conviction on the U.S. recovery is spurring strategists to go all-in on America First trades, recommending cheaper value shares and small-cap U.S. stocks. Equities outside the U.S. may trade at a discount to the S&P 500, but Goldman’s strategists say valuation concerns are no reason to overweight European or emerging-market stocks which have inferior earnings potential.
Reflation trades are the talk of Wall Street in the wake of last week’s Georgia victories for the Democrats -- making it easier to push through more aggressive fiscal measures. In the view of Goldman, however, the Democrats’ control of the Senate won’t guarantee passage of the more aggressive fiscal policies, another bullish set-up for equities.
“Our view is that it’s very much a government that is divided between Republicans and Democrats, and it’s very tight,” said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for wealth management at Goldman Sachs.
Another reason to overweight equities: Goldman projects negative returns for Treasuries in 2021 thanks to the global economic recovery, already low rates and stimulus measures.
“That’s the first time we’ve ever forecast negative returns for U.S. Treasuries over a five-year period going back to the Great Financial Crisis,” said Nelson.
While 10-year benchmark yields are expected to rise, they’re unlikely to reach a 3% tipping point that would tighten financial conditions and undermine the case for equities, Goldman’s strategists said.

On Friday, Twitter said it permanently banned Trump from its service “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” cutting him off from his greatest megaphone, the New York Times reported. Twitter said in a blog post that Mr. Trump’s personal @realDonaldTrump account, with more than 88 million followers, would be shut down immediately.
""Trump has a very high and loyal following and a lot of those eyeballs will go away if Trump is permanently restricted from posting,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at brokerage TS Lombard, according to Reuters.
The company is set to report its first quarterly sales above $1 billion when it publishes results next month, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Shares of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)are up about 160% since Trump was elected in 2016.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission blocked Staple's $6.3 billion offer in 2016, saying a merger between the two could reduce competition for nationwide contracts for office supplies. 
The two companies agreed to merge in 1996, but the deal was put to rest as a government lawsuit argued the move would have meant higher prices for pens, paper and other office supplies.
Staples was a public company when it attempted the acquisition. It went private in 2017.
Staples said it is prepared to take ""all necessary measures"" to divest ODP's B2B Business to a FTC approved and qualified buyer. 
USR Parent Inc, or Staples, said it would offer $40 per for each ODP share, a premium of 8.2% to Friday's close. 
ODP's shares rose about 11% to $41 before the opening bell.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the biggest U.S. banks begin reporting fourth-quarter results on Friday some of the headlines could show profits plunged by as much as 40% from a year earlier, before the pandemic struck.
But investors will be focused on digging out clues to the earnings rebound expected in 2021.
""You can look at Q4 as somewhat of a transition quarter as you put some of the challenges from 2020 in the rear-view mirror and look ahead to an improved 2021,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Jason Goldberg.
The pandemic caused interest rates to plunge and produced a record decline in the margin between what lenders charge for loans and what they pay for money, said Goldberg.
The pandemic also pushed big U.S. banks to set aside more than $65 billion for expected loan losses.
From those low points, banks could see profits more than double in first and second quarters of 2021, according to Refinitiv's IBES estimates.
Bank stocks have risen 35% since early November. Since then, effective COVID-19 vaccines started being distributed, Democrats took power in Washington, promising more economic stimulus, and the Federal Reserve said it would allow banks to repurchase stock again, which will increase earnings per share.
Analysts have been ratcheting up 2021 estimates, but as of Friday, they showed  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) reporting a 42% fourth-quarter profit decline and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co posting a 39% drop. Estimates for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) suggest a more moderate 5% fall.
Those three banks report on Friday.
The following week, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is expected to report a 33% quarterly profit decline.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is expected to be up 1% and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is expected to show a 43% increase on the strength of share of the booming capital markets businesses.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla hunts for design chief to create cars for China - sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is searching for a design director in China, part of efforts to open a ""full-function"" studio in Shanghai or Beijing and design electric cars tailored to Chinese consumer tastes, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
The U.S. carmaker's human resources managers, as well as several headhunters, have been trawling the industry over the past four months, the sources said. 
They are looking for ""bi-cultural"" candidates with 20 or more years of experience who are familiar with Chinese tastes and can bridge the gaps between China and the United States, they added.
Some candidates have been interviewed by Tesla's global design chief Franz von Holzhausen, according to the people, though it was not clear how many potential candidates had been approached by the company and recruiters.
All three sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity and confidential nature of the matter. 
Tesla and von Holzhausen did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
China is the world's biggest auto market, plus the largest for all-electric vehicles with sales volumes expected to reach roughly 1.5 million vehicles there this year, according to consultancy LMC Automotive. It is also Tesla's No.2 market after the United States. 
The carmaker's plans for the design studio are not fully developed, and the sources believe Tesla will likely wait for more clarity on strained U.S.-China relations under a new U.S. president before making a final decision on the move and all its details.
The talent search, which the sources said was mainly focused within China, fits with comments from Tesla boss Elon Musk early last year. 
""I think something that would be super cool would be ... to create a China design and engineering centre to actually design an original car in China for worldwide consumption. I think this would be very exciting,"" he said at a media event in Shanghai.
FLURRY OF ACTIVITY
Musk's interest in developing cars in China is part of a broader push by Tesla to boost the company's global sales volume well past the 500,000-vehicle-a-year mark, which it came just 450 short of hitting in 2020.
All three sources said Tesla's search for a China studio director began around September, and that there was a flurry of activity as recently as December when a number of headhunters used LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and other means to approach candidates. 
One of the sources, who has knowledge of Tesla's headhunting activities in China, said that once a design director was hired, Tesla would recruit the director's team which would likely be around 20-strong and include designers plus modellers who help turn design renderings into clay models.
All the sources said the planned centre aimed to be a comprehensive design outfit, with one describing it as a ""full-function studio"", which would not only help conceptualize the design of a car but also come up with the final shape – digital three-dimensional data - of a model.
The data could then be handed over to Tesla's vehicle engineers, who are mostly based in northern California.
Two of the sources said Tesla's China studio would likely also carry out research on Chinese consumer tastes, as well as work for cars expected to be produced at Tesla's vehicle assembly plant in Shanghai, where designs are tweaked to make sure specific components fit within engineers' specifications. 
""They want to give vehicle design a lot more bias toward China; they have already done a lot here, setting up a major manufacturing site and having sold a ton of EVs, but it seems Tesla's ready to put roots down,"" said one of the sources. 
This push might lead to a more independent Tesla China, added the person, who has spent more than a decade in the country working at design centres run by global automakers, among other places.
Chinese consumers bought around 145,000 Tesla vehicles last year, accounting for roughly a third of the company's overall global volumes, LMC said. 
$25,000 ELECTRIC CAR
Two of the sources said one likely ""China-specific"" model was a lower-cost volume generator such as a $25,000 electric car that Musk referred to at a Battery Day event in September, which he said Tesla might aim to bring to market in about three years.
Musk said Tesla was confident it would be able to hit the market with ""a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that's also fully autonomous"".
At that price, according to two of the sources as well as industry experts, it was likely to be a compact car, smaller than Tesla's Model 3, which would be as affordable as some mainstream gasoline-fueled vehicles.
Compact cars are not big sellers in the United States where bigger, taller vehicles such as Ford's F-150 pickup truck and SUVs, as well as midsize sedans, rule the road. 
They account for about 10% of America's overall vehicle market. By contrast, compacts make up 25% of sales in China, or around 5-6 million cars a year, according to consultancy LMC Automotive. 
That's why the planned $25,000 car Musk has discussed would be better suited to the China marketplace, according to the two sources and industry experts. 
""A compact Tesla car would do well in China, as well as the rest of Asia and Europe,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. ""It could potentially put a serious dent in sales of cars like Toyota's Corolla and the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Golf.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares came off record highs on Monday as caution over rising coronavirus cases saw some profit-taking from investors, while elevated Treasury yields helped the dollar hit its highest levels in over two and a half weeks.
Worldwide coronavirus cases surpassed 90 million on Monday, according to a Reuters tally.
European shares dipped in early trading, with rising coronavirus cases across the continent and China dragging down commodity stocks. Germany's DAX lost 0.55%, Britain's FTSE 100, Italy's FTSE MIB, and France's CAC 40 fell about half a percent each, and Spain's IBEX fell 0.2%. (EU)
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.3%.
With Asian stock markets also lower, MSCI's All Country World index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, was down 0.2%, just off Friday's record high. 
Futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% from record highs, after gaining 1.8% last week. 
""There was an awful lot of optimism about prospects for stimulus with the Biden administration winning those two Georgia Senate seats,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, noting Friday's record highs that followed the Democrats winning control of the U.S. Senate. 
""Friday's (U.S.) payrolls report was disappointing, underscoring the need for more significant fiscal response. But as we head into week two (of the new year), I think some of that optimism has been tempered a little bit with profit-taking."" 
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.2%, having surged 5% last week to record highs. Japan's Nikkei was closed for a holiday after ending at a 30-year high on Friday.
South Korea reversed an early jump to fall 0.1%, and Chinese blue chips fell 1%.
Last week, Wall Street bankers warned of toppy stock markets and a looming retreat after exuberance from unprecedented economic stimulus had led to ""frothy"" asset prices.
""I think there's a perception perhaps markets are getting slightly ahead of themselves,"" Hewson said.
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients that he didn't see valuations as a barrier for the equity rally to continue, ""especially against the backdrop of continued policy stimulus and the rollout of vaccines."" 
Longer-term Treasury yields were at their highest since March after Friday's weak jobs report fanned speculation of more U.S. fiscal stimulus now that the Democrats have control of the government.
President-elect Joe Biden is due to announce plans for ""trillions"" in new relief bills this week, much of which will be paid for by increased borrowing.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve is sounding content to put the onus on fiscal policy. Vice Chair Richard Clarida said there would be no change soon to the $120 billion of debt the Fed is buying each month. 
With the Fed reluctant to purchase more longer-dated bonds, 10-year Treasury yields jumped almost 20 basis points last week to 1.12%, the biggest weekly rise since June.
Mark Cabana at BofA warned stimulus could further pressure the dollar and cause Fed tapering to begin later this year.
""An early Fed taper creates upside risks to our year-end 1.5% 10-year Treasury target and supports our longer-term expectations for neutral rates moving towards 3%,"" he said in a note to clients.
The poor payrolls report will heighten interest in U.S. data on inflation, retail sales and consumer sentiment.
Earnings will also be in focus as JP Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are among the first companies to release fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15.
The climb in yields in turn offered some support to the dollar, which rose to its highest in over two weeks at 90.520 against a basket of currencies from last week's low of 89.206.
The euro fell to its lowest since Dec. 23 at $1.2155, from a recent higher of $1.2349, breaking support around $1.2190. The dollar also gained to 104.18 yen from a trough of 102.57 hit last week.
Gold, which pays no interest, rose 0.1% to $1,850 an ounce after skidding as low as $1,816. [GOL/]

820,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>",Novavax bosses cash out for $46 million with COVID-19 vaccine trials still under way,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Top executives at U.S. pharmaceutical company  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc aren't waiting to see how well their COVID-19 vaccine works before they reap the financial rewards.
Chief Executive Stanley Erck and three of his top lieutenants have sold roughly $46 million of company stock since the start of last year, according to a Reuters review of securities filings, capitalizing on a near 3,000% rally in Novavax shares fueled by investors betting on the success of the shot under development.
Erck cashed out $8.7 million over the course of 2020, eclipsing the $2.2 million in shares he sold in the previous five years. The stock sale amounts to more than 20% of his vested stake in Novavax, or less than 10% if stock options that are yet to vest are counted, according to the review of the filings, an analysis by compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC and a company spokeswoman.
The lucrative liquidations, which have not previously been reported, underscore the transformation in Novavax's fortunes during the global pandemic and the opportunity for its executives to lock in big profits from market optimism.
There is no certainty that Novavax, which has yet to bring a vaccine to market, will be successful in its latest endeavor. The 34-year-old company has become a key contender in a global race to develop vaccines against COVID-19 thanks to $1.6 billion in taxpayer funding it received under the U.S. government's ""Operation Warp Speed"" program.
    The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company was worth only $250 million until about a year ago, when news of its experimental vaccine and its participation in Operation Warp Speed drove its valuation up to as much as $11 billion.
A Novavax spokeswoman said the executives were responsible for the stock sales.
""Our leaders remain confident in the value and potential of our vaccines and are passionately committed to contributing to ending the COVID-19 pandemic and improving public health around the world,"" Novavax said in a statement. ""They continue to hold substantial personal and professional interest in Novavax' success as well as a financial one."" 
The executives did not respond to requests for comment. The Novavax spokeswoman did not make the executives available for interview.
     Only peers at rival biotech company  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc have sold more stock than Novavax executives among major firms that received U.S. taxpayer funding to develop or manufacture COVID-19 vaccines, according to an analysis by consumer advocacy group Accountable.US which looked at transactions from May to November 2020. Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is already being rolled out after it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 18.
To be sure, many of the other companies in the vaccine race are far larger than Moderna and Novavax, limiting the impact of news on their shares.  
   Pfizer Inc's vaccine was the first to be approved by the United States on Dec. 11. AstraZeneca Plc won approval in Britain for its vaccine on Dec. 30, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is scheduled to report trial data in January, lining it up for U.S. authorization in February. 
Novavax, meanwhile, announced last month that it had begun a late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, after delaying it twice due to issues in scaling up its manufacturing. It expects to see the results from another late-stage trial, in the United Kingdom, sometime in the first quarter of 2021. 
Early-stage data from Novavax's small clinical trial of its vaccine have shown it produced high levels of virus-fighting antibodies and the company has already inked supply deals for it with countries including Japan, Canada, Australia and the UK as well as with the United States.
    Some corporate governance experts said Novavax offered a striking example of how boards use company stock to incentivize their management teams without always linking them closely to their long-term prospects.
    ""Board members should have insisted that the executives held onto their shares,"" said Sanjai Bhagat, a finance professor at the University of Colorado. ""Then they would have the incentive to do everything that they could to get the vaccine out sooner.""
The chairman of Novavax's board, James Young, did not respond to requests for comment.
Jesse Fried, a Harvard Law School professor and a member of the research advisory council at proxy advisor Glass, Lewis & Co., said he didn't think it was inappropriate to reward executives during the drug development process.
""It may be a once in a lifetime opportunity to lock in huge gains,"" said Fried. ""I don’t have a problem with them making a lot of money even though they don’t have a drug yet.""
Investors will get to express their views on the stock sales this summer at Novavax's annual shareholder meeting, where they will be asked to approve the company's board of directors and executive compensation.
""If investors think the actions were unreasonable, they will ask what the board's role was in overseeing this disposition of stock,"" said Peter Kimball, head of advisory and client services at ISS Corporate Solutions, which advises companies on corporate governance. 
To be sure, last year Novavax awarded more than $85 million worth of stock options to executives, including $41.1 million to Erck, that are specifically tied to the vaccine's development and cannot be exercised until they start vesting in August. However, this award was contingent on the vaccine entering a mid-stage clinical trial, not its eventual success, Reuters reported in July.
TRADING PLANS
Development milestones for drugs can trigger big share price moves so pharmaceutical executives sometimes adopt a fixed schedule for stock sales -- known as a 10b5-1 plan -- to avoid any suggestion of insider trading.
Novavax executives disclosed in regulatory filings that they sold some of their shares using such trading plans.
A Novavax spokeswoman said executives adopted the plans in the summer, but did not provide the exact dates.
Moderna and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) disclosed the dates when trading plans were adopted by executives in their filings. Such disclosure is not required and is less common across U.S. companies, said Dan Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Out of the approximately $46 million of stock sold, Novavax chief commercial officer John Trizzino sold about $13 million, while Novavax's head of research and development, Greg Glenn, sold about $13.4 million, according to securities filings. The company's chief legal officer, John Herrmann, sold $10.9 million. 
Executives at Emergent BioSolutions Inc, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, also recipients of federal funds, sold $24 million, $10 million and $4 million worth of stock, respectively, according to Accountable.US. Moderna executives sold $166 million worth, according to Accountable.US.
Nina DeLorenzo, a spokeswoman for Emergent BioSolutions, said in a statement that the majority of the transactions were planned in advance under a 10b5-1 trading plan adopted in February by the company's executive chairman Fuad El-Hibri. 
""Our executive team and board of directors are held to the highest ethical standards and follow strict compliance with company policies for equity holding, as well as all laws and regulations governing financial transactions,” according to the statement.

Pfizer and Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 07:03AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Down 184 Pts; Consolidating From Record Highs,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, consolidating off record highs as Covid-19 cases continue to surge and investors await details of additional fiscal stimulus.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 230 points, or 0.8%, S&P 500 Futures traded 26 points, or 0.8%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 88 points, or 0.7%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.6% last week, closing at a record high, while the S&P 500 gained 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.4% in the prior week, both also recording all-time closing highs. 
Wall Street is expected to give back some of those gains early Monday as the country struggles to cope with the surge in Covid-19 cases despite the attempted ramp-up of the vaccination program.
The United States is now averaging 3,000 deaths and 245,000 new cases a day, according to Reuters data, with almost half of the states setting records for daily infections this month. This is stretching healthcare systems to their breaking points.
Many countries in Europe are in lockdown as the cases there surge with a new highly-transmissible strain circulating, while China saw its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in more than five months, 
Some help may be on the way as President-elect Joe Biden touted Friday a new Covid-relief package, which he said will be “in the trillions of dollars.” More details are expected to emerge later in the week.
The political climate in Washington DC remains fraught, with Democratic-led efforts to impeach President Donald Trump for his role in Wednesday’s violent protests in the Capitol gaining momentum.
In corporate news, the social media giants, including Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), will be in focus as they have banned Trump from their sites after Wednesday’s furore, while the earnings season starts later in the week, with the big banks up first.
The economic data slate is relatively quiet Monday, but consumer price inflation is due on Wednesday, while retail sales figures for December are scheduled for Friday. 
Oil prices weakened Monday amid concerns of declining fuel demand following a jump in new Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s second-largest consumer of crude.
Still, prices remain above the $50 a barrel level, supported by Saudi Arabia's surprise pledge last week to cut output by 1 million barrels per day for two months.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $51.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $55.42. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,848.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.2165.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>","Business as usual for EU banks in 'open' London, says Bank of England","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European Union banks' branches in London should see no major change in how they are supervised following Britain's formal departure from the bloc last month, the Bank of England's supervisory arm said on Monday. 
Britain is keen to maintain the City of London's attractiveness as a global financial centre after full access to the EU, hitherto its biggest customer, ended last month.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and other leading EU banks have major operations in London, and BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said last week that Britain should remain open to financial firms from the rest of the world.
""Overall, the Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority's (PRA) approach to the supervision of international banks remains stable and consistent following the UK's withdrawal from the EU,"" the BoE said in a statement on Monday.
""Those firms which have operated in the UK for some time as either branches or subsidiaries should find the proposals to be in line with their experience of the PRA's supervision.""
The BoE published a consultation paper on updating how it will supervise international banks in London, which is home to 150 branches and 90 subsidiaries of banking groups from around the world.
Many banks in London have opened new hubs in the bloc to avoid being cut off from the EU.
""The shift has corresponded to a proportion of the revenues and assets of UK-based investment banks moving to their EU entities,"" the BoE said.
The BoE said it wants to make sure that foreign banks in London have adequate safeguards and controls on how they book stock, bond and derivatives transactions.
""The PRA remains open to highly integrated global booking arrangements, provided that they are effectively controlled and the PRA has sufficient visibility of the group risks,"" the BoE said.
There are 66 banks from the EU seeking permission to operate as a branch in Britain, leading to a significant increase in the proportion of UK banking assets that will be represented by branches, the BoE said.

The level of new COVID-19 cases in the United States is starting to rise again, amidst the slow rollout of vaccine. Experts say the country should expect another surge in mid-January due to holiday gatherings. 
The antiviral, currently authorized to treat COVID-19 patients across the world, was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump's coronavirus infection. 
Gilead said it was raising its total product sales forecast to the range of $24.30 billion to $24.35 billion, reflecting increased sales of remdesivir.
The company also said there was a higher uptake of its HIV drug, Biktarvy.
The U.S. drugmaker expects adjusted earnings for 2020 in the range of $6.98-$7.08 per share, compared with the earlier forecast of $6.25- $6.60 per share.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank will defend itself in a trial starting in a Canadian court on Monday in which liquidators of the collapsed Antigua bank of former Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford are seeking $5.5 billion in damages.
The joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank (SIB) allege ""negligence and knowing assistance"" by TD, Canada's second-biggest lender, in allowing SIB to maintain correspondent accounts, according to a statement filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2019.
Correspondent banking is the business of providing services to offshore financial institutions. The joint liquidators are Grant Thornton in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. The trial is scheduled to last three months, a spokesman for one of the plaintiffs' lawyers said.
Stanford is serving a 110-year prison term after being convicted in 2012 of running a $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme.
""Like everyone else, during the time that Stanford International Bank was a customer of TD, we had no knowledge of, and no reason to suspect, any fraudulent activity was taking place,"" a TD spokesman said. ""TD is not responsible for the fraud committed by Allen Stanford.""
TD estimated reasonably possible losses from legal and regulatory actions including the Stanford litigation of between zero and C$951 million ($750 million) as of Oct. 31. Provisions related to legal action will be taken when a loss becomes probable and an amount can be reliably estimated, it said in its 2020 annual report https://www.td.com/document/PDF/ar2020/ar2020-Complete-Report.pdf.
The plaintiffs allege that SIB's ""exponential"" growth from 2002 to late 2008 made it TD's largest correspondent banking customer and a significant source of revenue, claims the Canadian bank has denied. 
They are also seeking a full accounting of the revenue and profit from TD's dealings with SIB and a return of those funds to Stanford's investors. 
In November, a Swiss court ordered Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA to surrender $150 million deposited by Stanford, saying it had failed to do proper due diligence.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Some investors including William Ackman and Glenn Welling, who push corporations to perform better, posted record-breaking returns in 2020 when activist investors generally backed off demands during a year marked by wild and unexpected business conditions.
Ackman's publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings fund rose 70.2%, marking the best-ever return at his 16-year-old firm Pershing Square Capital Management and one of the best in the hedge fund industry. In 2019, the fund rose 58%, also a record.
Welling's Engaged Capital, founded in 2012 and known for pushing companies like Medifast (NYSE:MED) Inc and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) Group Inc to make changes, returned 51%. That tops the firm's previous record return set in 2019 with a 34% gain.
And Andrew Left, who has targeted companies he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors that his hedge fund returned 155% in 2020, after gaining 43% in 2019, the fund's first year in business.
The gains reflect a late-year rebound among activists - fueled partly by strong stock market gains - with the average fund up 6.7% in the first 11 months of 2020 after a 27% drop in the first quarter, Hedge Fund Research data shows. Activist campaigns were down 20% in 2020 from the previous year, Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) data shows.
At Third Point (NYSE:TPRE), where Daniel Loeb unveiled a late-year campaign at  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), the Offshore Fund finished up 20.6%, its best return since 2013 when it gained 26%. That came after Loeb repositioned the portfolio and personnel in the wake of a 16% loss in the first quarter.
Blackwells Capital, currently bidding for  Monmouth Real Estate Investment  (NYSE:MNR) Corp, gained 32% last year, their first time reporting their activist fund returns.
Falcon Edge Capital, a steady investor in blank check companies like the ones Ackman and Loeb's firms have created, gained 43% last year.
Representatives for the funds declined to comment.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Former Gatwick owner outbids Blackstone for Signature Aviation,"(Reuters) - An investment fund that used to own London's Gatwick Airport has struck a $4.63 billion deal to buy Bill Gates-backed private jet services firm Signature Aviation, trumping rival suitors private equity giants Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Carlyle.
Shares in Signature Aviation, which runs bases used by private jets around the world, jumped 9% to top the UK midcap index on Monday amid speculation of a counter bid. 
""Nothing precludes either Blackstone and Cascade or Carlyle from making an offer proposal that the board of Signature Aviation will consider,"" a spokesman for Signature said.
Monday's deal with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), which still manages a 49.99% stake in Gatwick on behalf of investors, offers Signature shareholders $5.50 per share in cash. That's higher than the $5.17 jointly proposed by Blackstone and Signature's top shareholder Cascade Investment.
Signature's shares were last up 8.6% at 440.9 pence ($5.95). 
While commercial airlines across the world are struggling with COVID-19 travel curbs, private jet operators have fared better as wealthy passengers switch to what is seen as a safer way to fly, given the significantly lower passenger numbers.
Gates-owned Cascade, which holds 19% of Signature, last week agreed to work exclusively with Blackstone on a joint bid. They have until Jan. 14 to make a firm offer under UK takeover rules. 
Blackstone's agreement with Gates landed hours after Signature confirmed an initial takeover approach from Carlyle.
Blackstone did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Monday, while Carlyle declined to comment. 
Signature, formerly known as BBA Aviation, rejected an approach from New York-based GIP last month, saying the price was lower than the one outlined by Blackstone in its sixth proposal. Blackstone's first proposal was in February last year. 
Since the takeover interest was made public in December, Signature shares have jumped more than 60% in value. 
GIP, which owns Edinburgh Airport, plans to take Signature Aviation off the London Stock Exchange if the deal goes through.
It used to own Gatwick but no longer has a direct stake following a deal two years ago which saw France's Vinci Airports take control of London's second largest airport.

""Just as 9/11 marked a paradigm shift for global security, 20 years later we are witnessing a before-and-after in the role of digital platforms in our democracy,"" the Commissioner for the Internal Market wrote in a column for Politico. 
Twitter permanently cut off U.S. President Donald Trump's personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence after Trump exhorted thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol.
""If there was anyone out there who still doubted that online platforms have become systemic actors in our societies and democracies, last week's events on Capitol Hill"" were their answer, Breton wrote.
By blocking Trump's account, social media companies had finally recognised their responsibility, duty and means to prevent the spread of illegal viral content, he added.
""They can no longer hide their responsibility toward society by arguing that they merely provide hosting services,"" the member of the EU's executive said.
Hungary, meanwhile, criticized Twitter for interfering with official accounts after suspending the Budapest government's account in September.
""Today, their censors upped the game, removed nearly 200 of my followers without explanation,"" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said on Twitter. ""Big Tech preaches tolerance and pluralism. They talk the talk but don't walk the walk.""
In December, the European Commission announced draft rules to rein in tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The new rules would oblige the companies to do more to tackle illegal content such as hate speech and intentional manipulation of platforms.

829,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: JD Sports Thrives as British Land Suffers Through Latest Lockdown,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Two separate reports out of the U.K. threw a harsh, if predictable, spotlight on the outlook for the retail sector this year.
JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (OTC:JDSPY) hit an all-time high with a 4.6% rise after upgrading its profit forecast for the year ending January 31 and, more importantly, predicting another solid increase in profit in the coming year.
The latter part of that guidance is remarkable for two reasons. First, it suggests that there is no end in sight to the trends that drove retail stocks in 2020: an ever-accelerating transition to online channels (which JD has managed with obvious skill), and an increased share in overall retail spending for sports and leisure gear over more formal dress.
Second, it marks a big contrast from the first wave of the pandemic, when all but the boldest companies completely suspended their guidance. In JD’s home market of the U.K. right now, new cases of Covid-19, hospital admissions and deaths are all running at levels well ahead of the 2020 peak, and yet JD appears to have no qualms about forecasting results 13 months ahead.
JD said profit before tax for the current year will be over 400 million pounds ($540 million), more than one-third above the street consensus. Such a big revision so late in the fiscal year is a powerful statement as to the underlying momentum of the business.
It also said it expects pretax profit to rise by between 5%-10% in the coming year, despite assuming that its U.K. stores will remain closed for the next three months.
But investors should avoid rushing to conclude that the broader retail sector is out of the woods. British Land (OTC:BTLCY), the U.K.’s largest commercial landlord, said on Monday that it collected only 46% of rent due from its retail clients in December, as the U.K. government’s pre-Christmas lockdown hit, breaking what had previously been a steadily improving trend.
The company had had to forgive 12% of rent due from retailers in the spring, a number that fell to only 6% in the three months through September and nearly nothing in the subsequent three months. However, as of last Friday, less than one-third of the retail stores in its portfolio were open, and that seems unlikely to improve any time soon, given that the country’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned on national radio Monday that “The next few weeks are going to be the worst weeks of this pandemic.”
That all suggests that more distress on Main Street is likely in the short run - a factor that JD, among others, appears to have anticipated already last month by abandoning its plans to rescue Debenhams, a fashion retailer in long-term decline. "
830,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:09AM ET</span>",What Strategists Are Saying About Impact of U.S. Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street strategists are going all-in on reflation bets that powered global markets through last week’s U.S. political mayhem and the spreading pandemic.
Thank the prospect of narrow Democratic control of the Senate, which is spurring investment banks to raise projections on spending, inflation and growth.
Among the takes: Saxo Capital Markets Pte says it’s game-on for trillions in green infrastructure. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) sees a stronger dollar.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is betting on higher yields. Barcalys Plc warns the more progressive policies may still struggle to secure legislative support.
Here’s what market watchers are saying about potential stimulus and its cross-asset impact:
Boosting  Target  (NYSE:TGT)
“Democratic control of Washington, D.C. after January 20th will bring greater fiscal spending, faster GDP growth, more inflation, and higher interest rates than we had previously assumed,” Goldman strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. “We raise our 2021 S&P 500 earning-per-share growth rate by 2 percentage points to 31% (to $178). But an increase in corporate tax rates will trim 2022 EPS growth by a net 2 percentage points to 10% (to $196).”
“The benefit of slightly higher EPS is offset by modestly higher bond yields, which will limit absolute price/earnings multiple expansion at 22x,” they added. “Our year-end 2021 S&P 500 target remains 4,300.”
Bringing Continuity
“The policy implications of a one-vote majority should bring more continuity than disruption to the 2021 consensus,” JPMorgan strategists led by John Normand wrote Friday. “Under a unified government, the late December stimulus package of $900 billion should be matched by another $900 billion in early 2021. We also assume that tax hikes will be token given a fragile economy.”
“The disruption is potentially through higher inflation expectations, higher bonds yields and a stronger dollar, which upends the emerging-market component of value rotation within equities as well as the most compelling mean-reversion opportunity within fixed income,” they said.
Infrastructure Plans
“A Blue Wave increases the likelihood of an immediate $1 trillion Covid stimulus and $2 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure spending package later in 2021,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). research head Candace Browning wrote in a note Sunday outlining the firm’s recommendations. “Mark Cabana warns stimulus could further pressure the dollar and cause Fed tapering to begin later this year. An early Fed taper creates upside risks to our year-end 1.5% 10-year Treasury target and supports our longer-term expectations for neutral rates moving toward 3%. As a result of the outlook for further stimulus, Savita Subramanian moves the industrial sector to overweight and reiterates her top sector picks of finance and energy.”
‘Goliath and Epic’
The “slow-motion” Blue Wave is “truly Goliath and epic in every way,” said Kay Van-Petersen, global macro strategist at Saxo. “With Harris to break the 50/50 potential Tie in the Senate, about $7 trillion in Green Infrastructure that Biden and Harris campaigned on has risen several magnitudes in not just probability but scope.”
“We are not saying the full $7 trillion will come into fruition, it could actually be more -- but even if it’s ‘only’ $3.5 trillion the ripples are huge and we once again add onto the reflexivity of not enough assets and too much money,” he said.
Extra $1 Trillion
“The moderate Blue Wave scenario is back in the picture, and markets reacted in a risk-on manner, reflecting a perceived higher likelihood of a large stimulus package in the U.S.,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists including Lhamsuren Sharavdemberel wrote in a note. “We expect an additional fiscal package of $1 trillion in size, but a 50-50 split in the Senate seems unlikely to bring large policy shifts, as moderate Democrats may not support progressive initiatives and tax hikes.”
Constructive
The Democratic victory in Georgia “paves the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push for fiscal stimulus bigger than the $900 billion program approved in December last year,” said DBS Bank Ltd. Chief Investment Officer Hou Wey Fook in a note Monday. “In the longer run, more spending will also likely be allocated for the infrastructure space.”
“While higher fiscal will eventually be funded by higher taxation, the impact on U.S. corporate earnings will be negligible. Our constructive view stays,” he added.
Pent-Up Demand
“With the Democrats taking control of the Senate, hopes of further fiscal stimulus have risen (we expect an additional US$1 trillion for Covid-19 aid in the near term and further health-care/infrastructure spending initiatives later in 2021), along with prospects for an even stronger recovery,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economist Chetan Ahya wrote on Sunday, adding that “if the supply side is more flexible than we think, it may help to keep inflation at bay but risks stoking asset bubbles. In that case, financial stability would outweigh price stability concerns.”

831,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street firms reduce exposure to Chinese telcos as U.S. ban approaches,"By Alun John and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/ SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wall Street firms in Hong Kong including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have set out plans to reduce exposure to Chinese telecom companies named in a U.S. ban on investments in companies Washington considers linked to China's military. 
Parts of the ban were set to come into force later on Monday. 
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in filings to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Sunday evening that they will delist 500 Hong Kong-listed structured products that are linked to telecom companies China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) or are linked to local indexes including the Hang Seng Index - whose components include the telecom companies.
In a separate statement, U.S. custodian bank  State Street  (NYSE:STT) said an exchange-traded fund it manages which tracks the Hang Seng Index would not make any new investments in sanctioned stocks, though it would continue to maintain its existing shareholdings. 
The statement said that according to information published by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the fund was no longer appropriate for U.S. individuals or companies to invest in.
The announcements follow statements last week by OFAC clarifying a November order from U.S. President Donald Trump that banned Americans from investing in Chinese companies that the U.S. considers to have links with China's military.
The investment banks' filings cited a piece of OFAC guidance saying the three telecom companies were specifically included in the initial executive order. 
They also said the order would take effect for the structured products from 0930 EST (1430 GMT) on Monday, when Wall Street opens.
From Tuesday, there will be limited trading in the affected products with the investment banks only buying from investors and not selling, until Jan. 25 when all trading will be suspended. The products will be delisted on Jan. 28. 
Bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said it was ""working closely with the relevant issuers to ensure orderly delisting, and facilitate buyback arrangements being arranged by the issuers.""
There are over 12,000 structured products listed in Hong Kong issued by 15 companies.
Alex Wong, director at Ample Finance Group in Hong Kong, said the delistings would ""not have too much impact"", as customers could switch to Europe or China based issuers. 
Hong Kong's markets watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said it had stressed to the investment banks that ""any action taken by them should be necessary, fair, and having regard to the best interest of investors and integrity of the market, and that investors should also be properly informed as appropriate.""
Hang Seng Indexes Co Ltd, Hong Kong's main index provider, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Global index providers MSCI Inc, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices said last week they would cut the three Chinese telecom companies from benchmarks, wiping a combined $5.6 billion off the value of their Hong Kong-traded shares on Friday.
The New York Stock Exchange - after some flip-flopping - last week said it would delist the three firms' U.S.-traded American Depositary Receipts on Monday.

China's foreign ministry has previously said it firmly opposes what it called U.S. abuse of its power to oppress Chinese companies.

PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) has agreed to buy British immunotherapy firm Kymab for up to $1.45 billion, the latest in a string of deals as it belatedly expands in a fast-growing medical area. 
The deal, which will see Sanofi pay $1.1 billion upfront, will give it full rights to Kymab's KY1005, an antibody therapy viewed as having the potential to treat a wide range of inflammatory disorders and immune-related diseases.
KY1005 passed a mid-stage Phase IIa clinical trial in August.
The deal price could increase by $350 million based on reaching certain milestones, Sanofi said on Monday. 
Its shares were little changed in early trading. 
The deal is the latest acquisition for Sanofi. 
In November, it spent 308 million euros ($376 million) on Dutch biotechnology company Kiadis, which specialises in cell-based immunotherapy products to treat cancer.
In August, it scooped up U.S. autoimmune diseases specialist  Principia Biopharma  (NASDAQ:PRNB) for $3.7 billion, following a $2.5 billion investment to acquire immuno-oncology treatments group Synthorx in December 2019.
Sanofi was late to capitalise on the take-off of immunotherapy - drugs that activate the body’s immune system to attack tumour cells - in the early 2010s.
It is now trying to catch up and is focusing on a pipeline of several medicines that it hopes will secure it a piece of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market.
Kymab's pipeline also includes KY1044, a cancer treatment currently in Phase I/II clinical development.
The acquisition, to be paid in cash, is expected to be completed by the end of June.
Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is acting as Sanofi’s legal counsel, Sanofi said, while J.P. Morgan is acting as financial adviser to Kymab and Goodwin PLC is acting as its legal counsel.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded mostly lower Monday, consolidating after recent gains amid rising Covid-19 cases globally.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.6%.  
There were, however, significant outliers, with the STOXX Technology index hitting another all-time high, and U.K. sports gear retailer JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (LON:JD) rising 4.5% to an all-time high after reporting a strong Christmas trading season.
Stock exchange operator Euronext has resolved a technical issue that affected trading on futures contracts tied to the CAC 40.
Many European countries are battling a surge in Covid-19 cases following the emergence of a new highly transmissible strain of the virus, racing to vaccinate their elderly, the most vulnerable members of society.
Cases are also increasing globally, with mainland China seeing its biggest daily increase in more than five months, the country's national health authority said on Monday. This has prompted a lockdown in Shijiazhuang, the capital of the province of Hebei and the epicenter of the new outbreak.
China had recovered better than any other major economy from the Covid-19 hit, with the manufacturing sector, in particular, thriving as global consumers switched demand to (often Chinese-produced) goods from locally produced services.
Losses are likely to be limited following the solid start to 2021 as investors remain focused on the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus in the U.S. after a Democratic sweep of Congress. This remains the case even after the violent scenes on Capitol Hill last week that continue to reverberate. 
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, while in the corporate sector, British Land (OTC:BTLCY) stock fell 1.8% after the U.K.'s largest commercial landlord reported a drop in rental collection in December, with only 46% of retail rents paid in full and on time.
Swiss healthcare giant Roche (SIX:RO) stock rose 0.4% after receiving EU approval for its influenza treatment Xofluza, and  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) stock rose 0.7% after agreeing to buy U.K. pharmaceutical group Kymab. 
Oil prices weakened Monday amid concerns of declining fuel demand following a jump in new Covid-19 cases in China, the world’s second-largest consumer of crude.
Still, prices remain above the $50 a barrel level, supported by Saudi Arabia's surprise pledge last week to cut output by 1 million barrels per day for two months.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $51.87 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $55.50. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,848.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2188.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 03:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nintendo ships 1 million Switches in China since late-2019 launch,"By Pei Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) has shipped 1 million  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) consoles in China since it launched the device in the world's largest video games market at the end of 2019, its Chinese partner Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd said on Monday. 
The Japanese company launched its Switch console in China in December 2019 in partnership with distributor Tencent, China's biggest video games and social media company, in a drive to expand the reach of the home-portable device. 
The official figures released by Tencent suggest Nintendo has surpassed  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Sony  Corp (T:6758) as the country's biggest console device seller, according to consultancy Niko Partners.
The 1 million sales figure is bigger than the combined sales of Sony (NYSE:SNE)'s PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One over the same period, said Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad.
While early sales were hampered by a limited number of available games and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, they were later boosted by the August release of popular home exercise game ""Ring Fit Adventure"" in the country. 
A Tencent spokesman called the sales of the 2,099 yuan ($323) units ""a good start"", and said ""the games published on Nintendo Switch (China-Exclusive Version) have been well received by the market.""
Globally, Nintendo forecasts it will sell 24 million Switch units for year ending March 2021.
Console games are still considered a niche market in China, the world's biggest video games market, where most of the focus is on mobile games. 
The country banned console games until 2014, with consumers only able to access them via the grey market. 
Microsoft's Xbox entered China in 2014 and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles a year later.
Switch consoles sold in China are locked and buyers can only play games that are approved by regulators. Tencent has released 13 games for the China Nintendo Switch so far, but hits such as ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and ""Animal Crossing"" have yet to be green lighted.
Niko Partners forecasts China's console market revenue will reach $2.15 billion in 2024, double that of 2019, due to the success of Switch and the next generation console launches. Most games published for the China Nintendo Switch are from local developers, said Niko's Ahmad. 
""China is important to Nintendo because the country does not yet have a console culture in the same way that the U.S. or Japan does, which represents a growth opportunity for the company.""

Segev, who would remain in his current role for six months or until a successor is in place, plans to join as co-CEO of DAZN, a privately-owned global sports streaming platform. He, however, added that MGM's approach had had no bearing on his decision to leave.
The company also said the board remained fully in favour of its rejection of the MGM offer as undervaluing Entain.
""I can confirm that this changes nothing with respect to the Board's view of the recent proposal from MGM Resorts International to acquire Entain. The Board remains unanimous in our view that the proposal significantly undervalues the Company and its prospects,"" Chairman Barry Gibson said.
Segev was a long-term employee who took the reins of the company after the departure of Kenny Alexander last year, who was credited for the company's development away from high street betting into an online gambling powerhouse.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 12:25AM ET</span>",Rolling with the changes: Bridgestone America's CEO on leadership now,"By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As first years on the job go, Paolo Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), president, CEO and COO of Bridgestone Americas, Inc., has certainly had an eventful one.
Ferrari joined the tiremaker in January 2020. Within weeks, he found himself having to navigate a new job and firm amid a rapidly escalating global pandemic.
What helped, the 50-year-old Ferrari said, was keeping his eyes on the rest of the world.
""I have immediate family in Milan and Turin and those parts of Italy were the biggest first clusters after China, so I immediately knew how severe this was,"" said Ferrari, who is based in Nashville, Tennessee. ""As soon as I saw this coming, in February, I got my team together, and we immediately put together a very simple and effective governance to manage this safely.""
Before joining Bridgestone, Ferrari held leadership roles in companies spanning a range of industries, from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) First Boston in London and TIM (  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)) Group to Pirelli and Ermenegildo Zegna.
Ferrari talked to Reuters about managing through a crisis, sustainability, and the importance of a work ethic. Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What was an early lesson on work?
A. In my neighborhood (in Turin) there were these two clay tennis courts, and there was nobody giving tennis lessons, so I put up a little note in 1985 offering lessons. I was 15.
I got a lot of requests. I made maybe 10,000 lira, which was about $3.50, an hour.
I would get grief from my friends because it was summer. They said, ""Let's hang out! Why are you working?"" I could have given up, but it was in my DNA to be like: ""You have a commitment, you're doing a good job, these people are counting on you.""
The lesson I learned was about leadership and going in your own direction.
Q. What are you priorities for Bridgestone?
A. Sustainability is very high. The company that only seeks profit will never thrive.
My goal is to rally the company around creating services and products with more sustainable solutions. For example, designing tires that have very, very low rolling resistance, and therefore there's less drag and less fuel consumption.
Also, the sensor and data component of a tire - all of this data can help drivers or fleet managers optimize performance of the vehicle and be more efficient, more productive. And designing tires that can be retreaded multiple times over a lifetime.
Q. What is your work mantra?
A. Once, a mentor said to me, ""Life is a marathon.""
I like to say, ""A marathon seems too long but maybe life is a half-marathon with some sprints.""
Be ambitious, sure, but don't rush it. Make sure that whatever you do you, you are creating value and equity.
Q. What was your toughest job - and what did you learn from it?
A. When I first joined the tire industry in late 2011 (at Pirelli), I didn't know anything about the tire industry. It was a tough transition.
The lesson I learned was that it's about being humble. I learned about product. I sat down with customers, learned from them, and eventually I gained respect from the team.
Q. What's your workday been like in this pandemic?
A. There was a movie with Hugh Grant, ""About a Boy,"" where he said at one point that his life was like the TV guide - it was made of half-hour slots.
That's been my day. I have the one-hour meetings but then maybe there's a half an hour break, with no commute.
In that time, I ask, ""Can you put in a speedy workout in that half an hour?"" Yes you can. ""Can I go sit outside and just get some sun?"" Yes. I've never been so tan outside of my time in my Sardinia (summer home). In blocks of half an hour, I have work, family, workouts and downtime.
Q. What permanent impact will 2020 have on work?
A. The chance for recalibration has been huge this year, and my new life after COVID will be slightly different from before. Pre-COVID, every day outside of the house I would be in the office or traveling - I would take a flight across the world for half a day just for a meeting and then come back.

We're not going to go back to that. I think a typical week may be two days in the office, a couple of days at home, and some days traveling.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with investor sentiment boosted by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s promise of more stimulus measures to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 virus.
U.S. shares rose to record levels on Friday after Biden said that he would lay out proposals for trillions of dollars in fiscal support in the coming week to fight the economic toll of surging COVID-19 cases. The number of global COVID-19 cases continues to rise, surpassing 90.2 million as of Jan. 11 according to Johns Hopkins University data. Of these, over 22 million cases are U.S. cases.
The prospect of more stimulus saw equity gauges and Treasury yields climb over expectations of eventual control of the COVID-19 virus, aided by vaccines rollouts, and a global economic recovery. Although the stretched stock valuations have been tolerated by investors so far, there were worries that the global shares could be running too hot.
“After being bullish for several months, we are definitely becoming more cautious on the stock market up at these levels,” Miller Tabak + Co. chief market strategist Matt Maley said in a note, which added that the bulk of the S&P 500 rally from March lows is “behind us.”
Although the results of the runoff elections in the state of Georgia gives the Democrats control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, it remains to be seen whether more ambitious measures, such as raining the amount of stimulus checks from $600 to $2,000, can be passed by a Senate split 50-50 with the Republicans.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.23% by 10:35 PM ET (3:35AM GMT), while the SZSE Component was up 0.41%. China’s producer price index (PPI) contracted 0.4% year-on-year in December, higher than the -0.8% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s -1.5% reading, data released earlier in the day showed. December’s consumer price index (CPI) also beat expectations, rising 0.7% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year, according to the data
However, tensions with the U.S. rose after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday that the U.S. will remove self-imposed restrictions on diplomatic interactions with Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its territory.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.87% and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.49%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.88%.
Japanese markets are closed for a holiday. However, a COVID-19 variant similar to the strains seen in the U.K. and South Africa has been found in passengers arriving in the country from Brazil. It is presently difficult to ascertain how infectious this latest strain is and how effective current vaccines are against it.
Meanwhile, investors are keeping an eye on plans for a vote later in the day urging Vice President Mike Pence to take steps to remove incumbent President Donald Trump from office. House of Representatives Democrats are leading calls to impeach Trump for inciting his supporters to storm Capitol Hill during the previous week.
On the data front, the U.S. will release its own CPI on Wednesday, with the PPI and retail sales figures due to be released on Friday."

After successive delays in its chip fabrication processes, Santa Clara, California-based Intel has yet to make a final decision less than two weeks ahead of a scheduled announcement of its plans, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Any components that Intel might source from Taiwan wouldn’t come to market until 2023 at the earliest and would be based on established manufacturing processes already in use by other TSMC customers, said the people, asking not to be identified because the plans are private.
Intel is still holding out hope for last-minute improvements in its own production capabilities. Talks with Samsung (KS:005930), whose foundry capabilities trail TSMC’s, are at a more preliminary stage, the people said. TSMC and Samsung representatives declined to comment. An Intel spokesperson referred to previous comments by Bob Swan, the company’s chief executive officer.
Swan has promised investors he’ll set out his plans for outsourcing and get Intel’s production technology back on track when the company reports earnings Jan. 21. The world’s best-known chipmaker has historically led the industry in advanced manufacturing techniques, essential for maintaining the pace of performance increases in modern semiconductors. But the company has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and contract TSMC to do the manufacturing.
Intel shares slid 1% Friday. Samsung soared more than 9% to an all-time high in Seoul Monday, the biggest gain since March on an intraday basis. TSMC, which is already operating at full throttle and may not have spare capacity in the short run, stood largely unchanged in Taipei after a 7-day wining streak.
Read more: Intel Talks With TSMC, Samsung to Outsource Some Chip Production
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Intel’s discussions with TSMC and Samsung solidify expectations that the company will outsource some production, a move we view as unlikely to be easy, cheap or quick, and one that’s likely to dent Intel’s competitive gross margin. Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing operations have been integrally woven into product design and delivery roadmaps since the company’s inception.
- Anand Srinivasan, analyst
Click here for the research.
Under the leadership of Jim Keller, Intel designers moved to a more modular approach to creating microprocessors. This provides more flexibility to either make chips in-house or outsource the work. But Keller left Intel last year, and rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., have forged ahead with their own capable designs and TSMC’s more advanced production technology. That has put Intel under intense competitive pressure and forced it to make last-minute changes to product road maps, complicating its decision making, the people said.
“We have another great lineup of products in 2022, and I’m increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both,” Swan said on a conference call in October. Semiconductor manufacturing processes are measured in nanometers, with ever more microscopically small transistors crammed onto silicon wafers with each new iteration.
At subsequent investor conferences, Swan explained that the timing of his decision is driven by the need to order chipmaking equipment to make sure he has enough factory capacity or give a partner enough of a heads-up to make similar preparations. Being able to predictably deliver leading products to customers on time, at the right cost, will determine how much outsourcing Intel uses, he said.

TSMC, the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies, is preparing to offer Intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, according to the people. The company has said it will make test production of 4-nanometer chips available in the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments the following year.
The Taiwanese company expects to have a new facility in Baoshan operational by the end of this year, which can be converted to production for Intel if required, one of the people said. TSMC executives previously said the new Baoshan unit would house a research center with 8,000 engineers.
Activist investor Dan Loeb has also given voice to shareholder discontent with what’s perceived to be Intel’s technological stagnation, urging that the company make aggressive strategic changes.
While Intel has outsourced production of lower-end chips before, it has kept the manufacturing of its best semiconductors in-house, considering it a competitive strength. Its engineers have historically tailored their designs to the company’s manufacturing processes, making a shift to outsourcing of flagship products unthinkable in the past.
As the provider of 80% of personal computer and server processors globally, Intel produces hundreds of millions of chips each year. That scale dictates that any potential supplier must create new capacity to accommodate Intel.
In July, the company said its 7-nanometer production would arrive a year later than previously planned. That followed a three-year delay in the introduction of the preceding 10-nanometer generation, which is only reaching mainstream use now. Those holdups have allowed TSMC and Samsung to lay claim to better technology for the first time, with TSMC already producing 5-nanometer silicon at volume for Apple and others. That timeline suggests other customers could move to better TSMC production before Intel would.

Intel’s strategic shifts are happening at a time of booming demand as well as technological change in the chip industry. The traditional method of improving performance by shrinking and cramming more transistors into each package is being supplanted by more sophisticated techniques that include stacking processor and memory components into single chips and the introduction of more tailored designs for tasks like artificial intelligence.
AMD and others have partially mitigated the risk of manufacturing advances not proceeding at the expected pace by segmenting their designs, allowing the assembly of various component parts of the processor in stages. Intel has said it’s also moving toward that modular approach.

The fund, KKR's first in the region for the sector, closed at its hard cap to become the largest pan-regional infrastructure fund for Asia Pacific, the firm said in a press release. 
KKR invested about $300 million in the fund alongside external investors through its balance sheet and employee commitments.
KKR first established its global infrastructure team and strategy in 2008 but entered Asia only 11 years later when it poached David Luboff, then CEO of Macquarie Group’s Asia Infrastructure Fund, to build out its Asia team. It launched the fundraising later that year.

The firm has committed US$1.8 billion across six investments in the infrastructure sector, including a roughly $400 million acquisition of a controlling stake in India Grid Trust, India’s leading infrastructure investment trust and a $192 million purchase of a minor stake in First Gen, a leading Philippines power producer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Major HSBC shareholders are calling on Europe's biggest bank to toughen its commitment to cut lending linked to fossil fuels and to turn its climate ""ambitions"" into targets.
Investors collectively managing some $2.4 trillion in assets have filed the resolution to be voted on at HSBC's annual general meeting, after HSBC in October stated its ambition to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
That pledge was criticised by campaigners for not directly addressing HSBC's lending to fossil fuel firms, including a relatively large share of clients involved in the coal sector.
""HSBC is strongly committed to addressing climate change, in line with our clear ambition to align our financed emissions of our entire business portfolio to net zero by 2050 or sooner,"" a spokesperson for the bank said.
But after a four-year period of engagement with HSBC, the investors coordinated by responsible investment group ShareAction and including Europe's largest asset manager Amundi said they wanted to see the bank go further. 
""As Europe's largest bank and the second largest provider of fossil fuel financing, HSBC has the unique opportunity to help lead the financial services sector towards Paris-aligned commitments rather than mere ambitions,"" said Jason Mitchell, Co-Head of Responsible Investment at Man Group.
The investors want HSBC to set short and medium-term targets that are in line with the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms by mid-century.
Among those supporting the resolution are British hedge fund Man Group, Swedish insurance company Folksam and British pension scheme investor Brunel Pension Partnership, alongside 117 individual shareholders.
The spokesperson said HSBC will continue to engage with shareholders and ShareAction over the detail of its plans.
The HSBC resolution, the second such action taken against a major British lender, will need to receive backing from 75% of the votes cast at its meeting in April to pass. 

ShareAction targeted  Barclays  (LON:BARC) with a similar motion in May, which was defeated but garnered 24% of votes cast.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 08:10AM ET</span>",Investors look to upcoming U.S. earnings for a view into 2021,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will be anxious to see whether upcoming quarterly reports and outlooks from U.S. companies validate expectations for a strong 2021 rebound in earnings and the economy, which were ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic last year.
U.S. stocks are at record highs, boosted largely by optimism that the rollout of vaccines to fight the COVID-19 virus will allow for that recovery, while hopes of more fiscal stimulus under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden have also underpinned the market.
Earnings reports for the last quarter of 2020 kick off this week, with the release of results from JP Morgan, Citi and other big banks. 
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have dropped 9.8% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
But earnings are expected to rebound this year, with a gain of 16.4% projected for the first quarter. That forecast has improved since the fall, while S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 23.6% in 2021, benefiting from easy comparisons with 2020.
Investors may be even more keen to find out what company executives say about 2021 than they are to see fourth-quarter results, which come as virus cases are surging across the United States and Europe.
""Managements and analysts are really going to be focused not necessarily on the rear mirror. They're really thinking about 2021,"" said Kenneth Leon, research director at CFRA Research.
What's also going to be key is ""the pulse of each sector and how it affects investors in terms of thinking whether there's an attractive value there or whether they might need to take a breather,"" Leon said.
The S&P 500 is trading at 22.7 times forward earnings, well above the long-term average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. earnings for Q4: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlqnqepb/Pasted%20image%201610146723283.png)
""Stocks already reflect a pretty positive outlook for earnings,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.
Earnings for energy and industrials sectors are expected to have declined the most of all sectors in the fourth quarter.
While economically sensitive sectors such as those have been outperforming the broader market in recent months, they still lagged technology for 2020, and their valuations in general are seen by some as less pricey than other sectors. 
A large portion of cyclical names fall under the ""value"" label, and investors have watched the Russell 1000 value index close the gap on the Russell 1000 growth index following upbeat vaccine news.
With virus cases still rising, many strategists expect the bigger recovery to take place in the second half of the year.
""Most likely, second-half outlooks will move higher as corporations gain clarity and ultimately confidence,"" Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Invest, wrote in a report Friday.
Yet the uncertainty surrounding the recovery makes getting information from companies even more critical at this stage, even if it's not ""formal"" guidance, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.

""That's important for a market anxious to turn the corner,"" after a tough year, she said.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 04:38AM ET</span>",Indonesia locates black boxes of crashed jet as body parts recovered,"By Fransiska Nangoy and Bernadette Christina Munthe
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities on Sunday located the black boxes of the Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the sea soon after taking off from the capital Jakarta, as human body parts and suspected pieces of the plane were retrieved.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500 with 62 passengers and crew was headed to Pontianak in West Kalimantan on Saturday before it disappeared from radar screens four minutes after takeoff. 
It is the first major aircrash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max in 2018 also plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
Even before the latest crash, more people had died in air cashes in Indonesia than in any other country over the past decade, according to Aviation Safety Network's database.
Indonesia National Transport Safety Committee chief Soerjanto Tjahjono said the locations of Flight SJ 182's two black boxes had been identified.
""Hopefully, we can retrieve them soon,"" said military chief Hadi Tjahjanto, without giving an estimated timeframe.
Pieces of wreckage were brought to Jakarta port by rescuers. Authorities said they came from a depth of 23 metres (75 feet) near a group of islands off the Jakarta coast. 
One twisted piece of metal was painted in Sriwijaya Air's blue and red colours. Indonesian authorities said they had also retrieved body parts and clothing.
Police asked families to provide information such as dental records and DNA samples to help identify bodies. 
The plane had 12 crew and 50 passengers on board, all Indonesians and including seven children and three babies.
President Joko Widodo, speaking at the palace in Bogor, expressed ""deep condolences"" over the disaster and urged the public to pray the missing people could be found. 
""WE FEEL POWERLESS"" 
Tracking service Flightradar24 said the aircraft took off at 2:36 p.m. local time (0736 GMT) and climbed to reach 10,900 feet within four minutes. It then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later.
There were no immediate clues on what caused the jet's sudden descent. Most air accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors that can take months to establish, safety experts say.
A transport ministry spokeswoman said air traffic control had asked the pilot why the plane was heading northwest instead of on its expected flight path seconds before it disappeared.
The pilots had decades of experience between them with the flight captain reported to be a former air force pilot and his co-pilot at Sriwijaya Air since 2013, according to his Linkedin profile. 
The Sriwijaya Air plane was a nearly 27-year-old Boeing 737-500, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.
""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families.""
Distraught relatives waited in Pontianak about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta for news of their loved ones. At Jakarta's main airport a crisis centre was set up for families. 
""We feel powerless, we can only wait and hope to get any information soon,"" Irfansyah Riyanto, who had five relatives on the flight, told reporters.
Founded in 2003, Jakarta-based Sriwijaya Air group flies largely within Indonesia's sprawling archipelago. The budget airline has had a solid safety record, with no onboard casualties in four incidents recorded on the Aviation Safety Network database.

In 2007, the European Union banned all Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance since deregulation in the late 1990s. The restrictions were fully lifted in 2018.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",India retail king Biyani sees quick OK of Future's $3.4 billion deal despite Amazon dispute,"By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Future Group expects swift regulatory approval of its $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets, its chief executive said, even as its warring business partner Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) intensifies efforts to block the deal.
Future and Amazon are at loggerheads over the Indian group's August deal with Reliance Industries Ltd. The U.S. giant alleges the deal breached some of its pre-existing contracts with Future.
A New Delhi court in December dismissed Future's request to restrain Amazon's repeated attempts to get authorities to stall the deal. But the judge left the fate of the transaction with the regulators.
""The court has already given their view that every institution can take a view"" on the sale, Future Group founder and CEO Kishore Biyani told Reuters in an interview. ""So there is no reason why things should be delayed.""
Amazon declined to comment on Biyani's remarks. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the market regulator that has been reviewing the deal for months, did not respond to a request for comment.
SEBI and India's stock exchanges could still reject or take more time in approving the deal, which is critical for the survival of Future Retail , whose more than 1,700 outlets were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Future Retail has warned that failure to close the deal could lead to the company's liquidation and job losses for more than 29,000 employees.
""We have restored businesses to a certain extent, but there are challenges,"" said Biyani, dubbed India's retail king for transforming the country's retailing in recent decades.
AMAZON PROTESTS
The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India's retail landscape, especially in deciding who will have an upper hand in the groceries market expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.
Following Amazon's 2019 deal with a Future unit, the Indian retailer's groceries and fashion products are offered for sale on Amazon's website, while Future stores also act as local warehouses serving the U.S. giant's food supply chain.
Biyani said he had no intention of changing his business ties with Amazon despite the souring relationship. Criticising Amazon, however, Biyani said he was confused what Amazon wanted to achieve by blocking his deal.
""I am disappointed,"" he said. ""What do they want? They want so many employees to suffer, business to go down?""
Amazon also took Future to a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. Although Future says that order is not binding, the U.S. e-commerce giant is continuing its efforts to block the deal.
In a letter on Tuesday, Amazon asked Indian stock exchanges BSE and NSE to suspend their review of the deal in light of the ongoing Singapore arbitration.
To buttress its case, Amazon on Dec. 30 shared with the exchanges a confidential 63-page legal opinion signed by a former chief justice of India, Dipak Misra. In the opinion, seen by Reuters, Misra said SEBI or any other statutory authority ""cannot ignore"" the interim order passed by the arbitrator.
Misra and the NSE did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment. BSE declined to comment.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have suspended Parler from their respective App Store and web hosting service, saying the social networking service popular with many right-leaning social media users has not taken adequate measures to prevent the spread of posts inciting violence.
The action by Apple and Amazon follows a similar move by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google on Friday. Parler is favored by many supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, who was permanently suspended from Twitter on Friday, and it is seen as a haven for people expelled from Twitter.
""We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,"" Apple said in a statement Saturday.
Apple had given Parler 24 hours to submit a detailed moderation plan, pointing to participants' using the service to coordinate Wednesday's siege of the U.S. Capitol.
Amazon's move effectively takes the site offline unless it can find a new company to host its services.
Amazon suspended Parler from its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, for violating AWS's terms of services by failing to effectively deal with a steady increase in violent content, according to an email by an AWS Trust and Safety team to Parler, seen by Reuters.
An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the letter was authentic.
Due to the ""very real risk to public safety"" that Parler poses, AWS plans to suspend Parler's account effective Sunday, at 11:59 p.m. PST, the email seen by Reuters showed.
Parler Chief Executive John Matze lashed out at Amazon, Google and Apple, saying it was a coordinated effort knowing Parler's options would be limited and it would inflict the most damage right as Trump was banned from other social media platforms.
""There is the possibility Parler will be unavailable on internet for up to a week as we rebuild from scratch,"" he said in a post on Parler.
""This was a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill competition in the market place... You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don't count us out.""

In addition to Parler, right-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to messaging app Telegram and hands-off social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Saturday vowed to take ""strong enforcement action"" against unruly passengers following reports of supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump disrupting flights returning from Washington.
The FAA said it shared the concerns raised by airlines and Association of Flight Attendants. 
""I expect all passengers to follow crew member instructions, which are in place for their safety and the safety of flight,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a statement. 
Trump supporters on Wednesday stormed the U.S. Capitol in an assault that was viewed with shock around the world.
Dickson said ""unruly passenger behavior ... can distract, disrupt and threaten crewmembers’ ability to conduct their key safety functions."" He added the ""FAA will pursue strong enforcement action against anyone who endangers the safety of a flight, with penalties ranging from monetary fines to jail time.""
Earlier this week, the flight attendants union said Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol should not be allowed to depart Washington on commercial flights after exhibiting ""mob mentality behavior"" on flights into the region.
Alaska Airlines said on Friday it banned 14 passengers from future travel with the carrier after ""unacceptable"" behavior on a flight from Washington to Seattle.
Seattle-based Alaska said a number of passengers on a flight out of Washington late on Thursday ""were non-mask compliant, rowdy, argumentative and harassed our crew members.""
This week, U.S airlines and law enforcement agencies bolstered security at Washington-area airports after reports of disruptive behavior by some Trump supporters on flights into the region, which had raised concern about their departure. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) temporarily halted alcohol service on flights departing and arriving in Washington after Wednesday's events.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) was harassed on Friday by supporters of Trump and called a ""traitor"" at Washington's Reagan National Airport before departing on a flight, according to videos posted on social media.
The FAA opened more than 1,300 enforcement actions against unruly passengers during the past decade, including recent cases for interfering with and assaulting flight attendants who instructed them to wear masks. 

There have been numerous videos posted of unruly behavior on Washington flights, including one American Airlines flight to Phoenix in which the pilot threatened to divert to ""the middle of Kansas and dump people off.

852,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 09, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",What Biden and a Blue Wave Mean for First Solar,"By Liz Moyer and Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- With a solidly blue Congress, President-elect Joe Biden’s $2 trillion clean energy plan has a greater chance of succeeding, and that’s welcome news to solar companies.
The prospect has lifted the energy sector overall this year after a decade of being the dog of the S&P 500.
 First Solar Inc  (NASDAQ:FSLR) could be a beneficiary of this trend, but will weakening profitability make it lag peers in the solar panel market?
Investing.com’s Liz Moyer argues the growth case for First Solar, while Peter Nurse explains the downside. 
The Bull Case
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar makes solar panels and modules, putting it in position to benefit from Biden’s ambitious clean energy plans. 
As a candidate, Biden pledged to install 500 million solar panels in the U.S. over the next five years, and he could present other plans that could light up the solar market. 
The goal, of course, is to phase out the use of fossil fuels, especially coal. The International Energy Agency said renewable energy is on track to overtake coal as the largest power source by the year 2025, adding that solar energy is leading the pack, ahead of wind and other renewable sources.
First Solar is a key maker of something called thin-film panels, which cost one-third less to make and can operate well in varied climates, including humidity and snow. They are easier to install than traditional panels and function in low-light settings.
The stock hit a 52-week high on Friday and is up 81% over the last year. 
It stands apart from others with its balance sheet. First Solar had about $1.4 billion of cash at the end of the third quarter, allowing it to generate interest income or invest in new technologies. Some competitors, on the other hand, owe debt.
First Solar maintained profitability through the pandemic shutdowns last year, too. It is on track to report 2020 year-end earnings per share of $3.62, according to analyst forecasts. That compares to EPS of $1.48 in 2019. Sales also dipped only slightly last year and are seen as returning to 2019 levels -- just over $3 billion -- by the end of this year.
Early estimates for 2021 do have full-year EPS slowing to $3.44, but it’s early.
Another benefit to First Solar is the renewal of a tax credit for investing in clean energy, which could encourage more sales. A green-oriented Congress could also pass more legislation that could boost attention and sales in the solar space. 
Solar energy used to cost between $140 and $150 per megawatt-hour (MWh) eve with investment tax credits. But in 2020, the cost was down to $25 to $35 per MWh, according to Motley Fool. That makes solar less costly than fossil fuels, and the cost should continue to fall. That pubs solar on the path to become the lowest cost of bulk energy even considering the cost of the battery.
First Solar's backlog of business means it will continue to see growth, Motley Fool said. The company currently has a backlog of contracts totaling 12.2 gigawatts of system sales and 8.3 GW of additional mid-to-late stage opportunities in the pipeline, the analysts said. ""For perspective, the company's current manufacturing capacity is 5.5 GW meaning it has years of future sales lined up.""
The Bear Case
It's a truism that solar power stocks will get more love from Washington in the next couple of years than in the last four. Even so, not all solar stocks are equal; First Solar is worth a sell.
The company has streamlined its activities to focus on its core business of making thin-film solar modules. It is no longer that big a player in the solar industry, after getting rid of its asset ownership business, its North American operations and management business and its unit involved in executing power plants.
This means First Solar is a more specialized business, which could lead to more efficiency and better margins long-term, but it doesn’t have the immediate growth opportunities some of its competitors have.
It’s already showing worrying signs of weakening profitability. First Solar is expected to report year-end 2020 profit of $3.62 a share, according to FactSet data, but profit for year-end 2021 is estimated to be only $3.44.
It’s this expected drop in earnings which prompted influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to downgrade its stance of First Solar stock to ‘sell’ from ‘buy’ earlier this week.
The bank sees First Solar's gross margins and earnings per share peaking by the middle of 2021, with EPS declining at a 17% compounded annual growth rate through 2022. 
Over the same time period, First Solar's peers will benefit from earnings growing by 20%-30%, the bank added.
This negative view is despite the benign regulatory environment. However, time pressure could see the incoming Biden administration choose to focus on other more pressing priorities.
Even with the victories in both Georgia Senate seats, the incoming administration will still need to seek out Republican moderates to pass swift legislation, meaning some of their  more ambitious proposals could yet be diluted.
“We suspect Joe Biden will initially seek to push ahead with infrastructure plans, which are more likely to get cross party support,” said ING analyst James Knightley, in a research note, earlier this week. “However, his $2trn green energy plan to decarbonize U.S. electricity production by 2035, is going to get more pushback from Republicans.”
The stock is already trading at over 50 times trailing 12-month earnings according to Investing.com data. That's expensive enough. If, as Goldman says, earnings are going to fall from here, that's not going to make it look any cheaper.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 08:00PM ET</span>","Wall St Week Ahead: As political risk fades, earnings may start to matter again","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With uncertainties regarding U.S. elections fading, some investors expect company earnings and economic data to play a greater role in moving stock prices this year.
For months, earnings and economic data have largely taken a backseat as investors grappled with two overarching uncertainties and their ultimate impact on financial markets: the changing political landscape in Washington and the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe.
Options data showed that bets on large earnings-related stock moves were profitable only 24% of the time in the last earnings season, compared with a historical win rate of about 40%, according to options analytics firm ORATS.
Stocks have surged to record highs even as Citigroup’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which tracks economic data relative to expectations, has slipped to its lowest level in six months.
""In 2020, the fundamentals kind of went out the window,"" said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS.
Graphic: No surprise, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmqzblpr/Pasted%20image%201610121370034.png
Some investors believe that is about to change. The resolution of the Georgia Senate runoffs tipped control of the chamber to Democrats earlier this week. That gave investors more clarity on fiscal policies that will have a greater chance of being advanced in 2021, namely, President-elect Joe Biden’s proposals for increased fiscal spending and higher taxes.
Congress certified Biden's election victory early on Thursday, hours after hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a shocking display that weighed only briefly on markets.
""With less focus on politics, there is greater bandwidth for focusing on other issues such as COVID and economic fundamentals,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Stocks overcame early weakness to close at a record high on Friday despite data showing the U.S. economy shed jobs for the first time in eight months amid a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.
Investors will get a snapshot of how the economy is performing next week with the release of data on inflation, retail sales and consumer sentiment.
JP Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are set to release fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15, among the first S&P 500 companies to post their results for the last period of coronavirus-stricken 2020.
Overall, S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to increase about 23% in 2021 compared with pandemic-hit 2020, leaving investors with the task of figuring out how much of that is sustainable.
Many are likely to be more discerning than they were last year, said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management.
Investors may be in for a certain degree of rotation, with companies whose businesses were battered by the pandemic in 2020 expected to show strong rebounds this year, analysts said.
The worst-performing sector in 2020, energy, is Aama's top pick for 2021. The sector is expected to post earnings growth of 668% in 2021, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Earnings growth for industrials, consumer discretionary and materials is expected to far outpace the earnings growth for the technology sector, data showed.
To be sure, expectations of fiscal stimulus and ultra low interest rates for the long term fueled “everything rallies” that have buoyed assets from big technology stocks to small caps, convincing some investors that betting on broader gains may be preferable than trying to be too selective. So far, that phenomenon has persisted into 2021, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both hitting new highs.
At the same time, investors may return to the ""stay at home"" trade that benefited big technology stocks if the coronavirus resurgence grows or the vaccine rollout goes awry.
Still, some investors believe a more refined approach may be key to stock selection in 2021.
For most of 2020, ""you had a market that really didn't care if a company missed earnings or met earnings. All it cared about was stimulus and vaccines,"" said Robert Almeida, portfolio manager and global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management.

Now, ""the market will be forced to reorient its attention on micro versus macro,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Twitter were down more than 2% in after-hours trading, moving lower after the company said it was permanently suspending U.S. President Donald Trump’s account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.
Shares of the stock recently traded at $50.20, down 2.4% from the closing price.

Separately, Google said in a brief court filing that it would not ask for the case to be thrown out at an early stage based on procedural issues.
The company said its initial response to the October complaint, which was joined by a dozen state attorneys general, would be filed by Feb. 15.
Judge Amit Mehta in Washington said he learned that some mutual funds held by him and his wife contain Alphabet stock and directed their sale. 
Mehta said ""neither my wife nor I directed the purchase of these particular funds; they were recommended to us, and we consented to their purchase. Nor did we know at the time that these funds contained Alphabet stock.""
He added that he directed financial advisors to monitor all future purchases.
Mehta said he does not believe he is required to recuse himself, but said any objections to him continuing to oversee the case could be filed no later than Jan. 20. 

He also is expected to oversee an antitrust lawsuit against Google filed last month by 38 other U.S. states and territories including Colorado and Nebraska.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street scaled new highs on Friday as hopes of more stimulus from Washington were shaken a bit by a senator's comments but later bolstered after U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said his economic package will be in the trillions of dollars.
The latest rally in the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq overcame labor market data early in the day that showed the U.S. economy shed jobs for the first time in eight months in December as the country buckled under the COVID-19 onslaught.
But late in the session, the S&P retreated slightly from a its most recent peak following a report that Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin opposed bigger direct checks before addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The remarks unsettled investor who expect further stimulus payments.
""It’s amazing how sensitive we are to the slightest tweaking of when and how big the stimulus will be,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. 
""Stocks are going to start to price in a bigger economic relief package from the Biden administration,"" Moya said. ""That is going to continue to be the driver on equities.""
Biden said his administration's economic package will also include unemployment insurance and rent forbearance. The package will be unveiled next Thursday, he said.
""It is necessary to spend the money now,"" Biden told reporters. ""The answer is 'yes,' it will be in the trillions of dollars, an entire package.""
Positive vaccine data and expectations of a bigger fiscal package and infrastructure spending under a Democratic-led U.S. Congress have pushed the S&P 500 above 3,800 points for the first time, and set all three major indexes on track for weekly gains.
The Democrats are going to want to inject a lot of stimulus and spending into the economy, which in the near term will be good for economic growth, said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst, at Baird.
""The market is pleased with the result,"" he said. 
Some Wall Street analysts expect an equity pullback in the near-term as exuberance from unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus has led to a ""frothy"" market.
But a resumption in consumer spending, together with the restocking of business inventories as COVID-19 restrictions ease, should lift economic activity in 2021, said Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments in a note. 
Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials, which have outperformed their peers and scaled record levels this week, dropping more than 1% at one point during the session. 
Market participants looked past a report that congressional Democrats plan to introduce articles of impeachment against U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, after a violent crowd of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 56.84 points, or 0.18%, to 31,097.97. The S&P 500 gained 20.89 points, or 0.55%, to 3,824.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 134.50 points, or 1.03%, to 13,201.98.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.40 billion shares.
The S&P 500 closed above 3,800 points for the first time on Thursday, while the Dow and the Nasdaq posted their fourth straight weekly gains.
For the week, the S&P rose 1.83%, the Dow added 1.61% and the Nasdaq gained 2.43.%
Electric car-maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc jumped 7.8%, taking its market capitalization to more than $800 billion for the first time ever. Tesla was the largest percentage gainer on the S&P. 
U.S.-listed shares of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) gained 15.6% on plans to form a company to make smart electric vehicles, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Baidu was the largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 04:35PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank to pay nearly $125 million to resolve U.S. bribery, metals charges","By Jonathan Stempel and Noor Zainab Hussain
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) will pay nearly $125 million to avoid U.S. prosecution on charges it engaged in foreign bribery schemes and manipulated precious metals markets, the latest blow for the bank as it tries to rebound from a series of scandals.
Germany's largest lender agreed to the payout as it entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, and a related civil settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Almost all of the payout relates to charges Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) violated the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) over its dealings in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, China and Italy, court papers show. Nearly two-thirds of the payout is a criminal fine.
The settlements were made public on Friday at a hearing in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York.
""Deutsche Bank engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to foreign officials and others,"" in order to win and retain ""lucrative business projects,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement.
A bank spokesman said, ""We take responsibility for these past actions,"" which occurred from 2008 to 2017, following ""thorough"" internal probes and full cooperation with authorities.
Deutsche Bank has been trying to restore profitability after five years of losses, including by exiting some businesses and reducing its workforce by 18,000.
It has also been trying to restore its image in Washington amid several investigations into its dealings with U.S. President Donald Trump, a longtime client.
Prosecutors accused Deutsche Bank of violating books-and-records provisions of the FCPA, which forbids companies with U.S. operations from paying bribes elsewhere.
They said the violations included disguising bribes paid to a client's ""decisionmaker"" in Saudi Arabia as ""referral fees,"" and recording millions of dollars of payments to an intermediary for an Abu Dhabi official as ""consultancy"" fees.
The SEC also accused Deutsche Bank of making improper payments to a consultant to help establish a clean energy investment fund with a Chinese government entity, and to an Italian tax judge for referring wealthy clients.
In the metals case, prosecutors accused Deutsche Bank traders of placing fraudulent trades, known as spoofing, to induce other traders to buy and sell futures contracts at prices they otherwise would not have.

In 2019, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $16.2 million to resolve SEC charges it violated the FCPA by hiring unqualified relatives of government officials in China and Russia in order to win or retain business. https://reut.rs/3i76g6Z

Investing.com – The Dow closed at a record high Friday, after staging a comeback as President-elect Joe Biden talked up his spending-fueled plans to boost the recovery at a time when the virus continues to spread.      
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.18%, or 56 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.55%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.03% to remain on course for another record close.
Biden restored hopes for further stimulus, insisting that the focus should be on budget spending to boost growth. ""We should be investing in deficit spending in order to generate economic growth,"" Biden said.
Biden comments arrived on the heels of confusion over West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Machin's remarks, which had earlier left market participants worried that plans to boost stimulus checks under a Democratic-controlled Congress would meet resistance. 
Manchin was reported to have shot down the idea of boosting checks to $2,000, but later claimed his comments in The Washington Post were mischaracterized. Manchin was quoted as saying ""absolutely not"" when quizzed about backing an idea to boost stimulus checks to $2,000, but the West Virginia senator said this was in response to whether checks should be the first priority. 
In another boost to stimulus optimism, Federal Reserve Deputy Chairman Richard Clarida signaled that the central bank was likely to remain in a holding pattern on bond purchases this year.   
The need for further stimulus was highlighted by a wobble in the labor market following an unexpected drop in jobs in December. 
The U.S. economy lost 140,000 jobs last month, confounding expectations for a gain of 71,000, but economists suggested the near-term wobble in the economy will likely be overlooked as vaccines are deployed and Democrats are likely to roll out more stimulus.
The loss of jobs broke the streak of seven straight months of gains since the decline over March and April, but markets are ""likely looking through near-term considerations as a transitory hit in favor of longer-term upside risk tentatively reinforced by vaccines and ‘blue wave’ fiscal policy considerations,"" Scotiabank Economics said.
Value sectors including materials, industrials and financials kept gains in check.
Financials were weighed down by a fall in banking stocks ahead of their earnings slated for next week.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was flat,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) slipped 1% and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) was down 1%.
Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which had hit a more than 20-year intraday high on better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and guidance, fell 2% following a reversal in chip stocks.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus stuck to ambitions for a partial recovery in jet production later this year, amid speculation that it may have to delay the move as Europe faces new coronavirus lockdowns.
Airbus has said it wants to be in shape to raise benchmark A320-family output by 18% to 47 jets a month by July, but the goal has already slipped to the fourth quarter, according to analysts, with some saying it could slip further.
""It looks like the rate of 47 is slipping to the right,"" said one supply chain source.
Another supplier said the rate was beyond reach for 2021.
Airbus was producing 60 of the jets a month before the spread of COVID-19 grounded airline fleets earlier this year.
Asked about the output plans at a news conference on annual deliveries, Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said current plans pointed to an increase in the second half of the year, but noted ""a lot of uncertainties"" because of the coronavirus crisis.
Chief Operating Officer Michael Schoellhorn last month told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper that output ""could ... rise a little later or flatter"" than previously anticipated. 
An Airbus spokesman said no decision had been made.
Airbus plans a virtual briefing with the heads of some its major suppliers in coming days in a move expected to set the manufacturing tone for the coming year, industry sources said.
It is involved in a stand-off with some suppliers who want guaranteed or upfront payments for parts to support any output increase, in case volatile demand falls again. Those companies are in turn receiving similar demands from their own suppliers.
That is making it harder for Airbus to confirm the timing of an increase, sources said, though it is focusing for now on maintaining the flexibility to act whenever needed.
FINANCIAL PRESSURE
Delaying the planned increase in production to 47 aircraft a month would prolong financial pressure just as Airbus is struggling to reach targets for job reductions, especially at its headquarters in France and in German plants, sources said.
Airbus has extended a deadline for voluntary redundancies as part of a restructuring plan affecting up to 15,000 jobs. 
Faury is expected to force significant cuts among executive posts as part of the biggest restructuring in the company's history as it contends with a coronavirus slump in air travel.
The French CEO on Friday said that the restructuring was ""making progress, on track"".

Despite renewed lockdowns in Europe, Airbus confirmed its position as the world's largest planemaker with stronger than expected deliveries of 566 jets last year.

Investing.com -- TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) rallied 7% after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) called it a player in the post-vaccine travel recovery.
Deutsche added a short-term buy to the stock and reiterated its long-term hold rating, CNBC Pro reported. 
The positive take is  a result of the direct exposure to a post-vaccine travel recovery later this year, substantial fixed and variable cost reductions not well incorporated into consensus estimates, Deutsche Bank wrote, according to CNBC Pro. ""In our view, intriguing new product in the  Tripadvisor  Plus subscription plan that could drive a new bull case on shares.”
The subscription service will give members access to deals and perks on ""tens of thousands of hotels"" and 400,000-plus attractions, Travel Weekly reported. An annual subscription to Tripadvisor Plus will be priced at $99, and the company said members will likely get their subscription money back in savings on their first booking.
It's been a rough 12 months for TripAdvisor, as it has for so many travel-related industries. Revenue tumbled for the quarter ended in June to $59 million, the lowest since at least 2013. The company is expected to continue reporting losses -- another rarity -- but sales are expected to hit $107 million for the quarter ended in December, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Earlier this week,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) initiated coverage on TripAdvisor with a buy-equivalent rating, according to StreetInsider.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","Trump moves to loosen mining regulations, approve projects as he exits","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is moving to loosen mining regulations and green light new mineral projects before leaving office this month, with successor Joe Biden unable to reverse some of the changes. 
Administration officials tell Reuters they plan to publish a raft of decisions on Jan. 15 that will expand miners' access to federal lands, give final approval to Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp's Nevada lithium mine and approve a land swap for a Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd Arizona copper mining project, among other steps.
Biden will be able to reverse some of Trump's changes, especially proposed rules under regulatory review. But some of Trump's steps will either be irreversible or require Biden to restart the rule-making process, a years-long effort, which is a concern to environmentalists. 
""The Trump Administration's midnight dance to aggressively push these proposed rules follows four years of gutting already weak community and environmental oversight of the hard rock mining industry,"" said Lauren Pagel of Earthworks, an environmental advocacy group.
Trump administration officials finalized a rule on Friday that added mining to a list of industries that can receive fast-tracked permitting, part of a law signed by former President Barack Obama in 2015, according to government records https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/08/2021-00088/adding-mining-as-a-sector-of-projects-eligible-for-coverage-under-title-41-of-the-fixing-americas. The change becomes effective immediately.
The law, known as FAST-41, was intended to streamline permitting for utility projects, such as power transmission lines. 
""Congress never intended for FAST-41 to cover the mining sector,"" U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva of Arizona, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, wrote to regulators late last month, in an attempt to stop the change.
Officials may also allow the storage of mine waste, known as tailings, on federal land. The proposed change would essentially codify an existing practice in an area of law that environmentalists say is vague.
The Bureau of Land Management, the federal agency considering the new rule, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Several U.S. lawmakers have called for Trump's immediate removal after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. It is not clear if Vice President Mike Pence would continue Trump's regulatory steps.
Trump could exercise his power under the Administrative Procedure Act, which stipulates how regulations are drafted and enforced, to finalize proposals before he leaves office, a step that would require him to find ""good cause"" for the faster-than-normal approval.
The National Mining Association, an industry trade group, says it supports streamlining regulation, especially the FAST-41 changes.
""American mining is key to successfully repairing our nation's infrastructure,"" said Rich Nolan, the NMA's president. 
The Biden transition team said its incoming administration ""will begin to take swift and bold action across the federal government to roll back harmful Trump Administration policies, including those impacting climate and environmental policies, on January 20 to halt or delay Trump's damaging midnight regulations.""
Trump officials are also on the verge of approving several mining projects, or significantly advancing their regulatory review process. 
One of those, the Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project in Nevada, is expected to be approved on Jan. 15, according to an official at the Bureau of Land Management. 
""It's been a good, collaborative process with state and federal authorities. We look forward to the decision,"" said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which has been developing the project for more than a decade. Lithium is a key component of electric vehicle batteries.
At least 10 other projects were deemed important enough to the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that they should receive fast-track permitting, according to an executive order the president signed last June.
Several gold and phosphate fertilizer projects in Nevada and Idaho, respectively, have also either been approved by Trump recently or seen major advancements in the permitting process.
In Utah, developers of the Twin Bridges Bowknot Helium Project received approval to drill seven wells, build roads and install pipelines to produce helium in the Labyrinth Canyon Wilderness, a project environmentalists claim has been fast-tracked ahead of Biden's inauguration. 
A judge issued a temporary injunction to the project in late December, pending a full review. 
In South Dakota, the Dewey-Burdock uranium mine got several important permits from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in November, though it will need other permits before it can open. The mine, like Rio's project in Arizona, is strongly opposed by Native American tribes who say it will pollute their water reservoirs.
In Arizona, Trump's plans to approve the land swap needed for Rio to build a copper mine has run into stiff opposition from Native Americans who consider the land sacred. Rio fired its chief executive last year after he oversaw the destruction of indigenous sites in Australia. 

Its new CEO has vowed to ""restore trust"" with indigenous groups, though Native Americans say the company is poised to make the same mistake in Arizona as it did in Australia.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Voting machine company sues pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell over 'wild accusations',"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - A voting machine company sued former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell on Friday, accusing her of spreading false conspiracy theories about November's election that Republican President Donald Trump lost to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.
Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems Inc filed the case in federal court in Washington, alleging defamation and seeking $1.3 billion in damages.
Powell, a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign also did not immediately responds to an e-mail seeking comment.
In news conferences and media appearances, Powell falsely claimed that Dominion had rigged the U.S. presidential election, that Dominion was created in Venezuela to rig elections for that country's late president, Hugo Chavez, and that Dominion bribed Georgia officials for a no-bid contract. 
""Powell’s wild accusations are demonstrably false,"" Dominion's lawyers said in the complaint. ""Far from being created in Venezuela to rig elections for a now-deceased Venezuelan dictator, Dominion was founded in Toronto for the purpose of creating a fully auditable paper-based vote system that would empower people with disabilities to vote independently on verifiable paper ballots.""
Powell, appearing with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, claimed without evidence at a November news conference that Dominion's electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.
Trump had referred to Powell as one of his ""wonderful lawyers and representatives"" in a Nov. 14 tweet.
Giuliani and another Trump legal adviser, Jenna Ellis, later distanced themselves from Powell, saying in a statement released by the campaign that ""Powell is practicing law on her own"" and ""is not a member of the Trump Legal Team.""
But Trump then met with Powell at the White House on Dec. 18 and discussed naming her a special counsel to investigate the election, the New York Times reported.
Eric Coomer, director of product strategy and security for the voting technology company, sued Powell, the Trump campaign, and others for defamation in a Colorado court last month.

Coomer said Powell's claims led to “devastating consequences,” including death threats which forced him to leave his home out of fear for his safety.

Tesla's stratospheric rally has helped Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk surpass Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s top boss Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest man, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
At today's session high, Musk's 21% stake in the automaker as per Forbes contributes more than $170 billion to his net worth, dwarfing the combined market capitalization of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the three Detroit automakers.
In the previous session, Tesla's market value crossed $774 billion, making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, just behind Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and ahead of social media giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose 6% Friday to -- you guessed it -- a record. 
Evercore SI upgraded shares, offering a mea culpa and acknowledging that it had gotten the stock wrong in the past, but now's the time, according to CNBC Pro. Tesla can capitalize on a climate bill, among other things, with President-elect Joe Biden taking office later this month. The firm bumped the stock to inline from underperform. 
""Whether we call it valuation confusion or valuation rotation (into full Tech from hybrid growth Auto & Tech), we have been on the considerably wrong side of TSLA for over a year now,” Evercore SI said in a note. 
There are warnings, however, of overexcitement. Saxo Bank listed Tesla among its bubble stocks with 206 times 12-month forward earnings, Reuters reported. That compares to Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s 10 times forward earnings and Toyota's 16 times.
Analysts are divided over the stock, which has seven buy ratings, 12 holds and six sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com.

The merger, initially expected to close in the second half of Cisco's fiscal 2020, was cleared by the United States, Germany and Austria, but had been under regulatory review by China, the only remaining closing condition of the deal. 
Shares of Cisco rose nearly 1% early trading, while Acacia jumped about 9%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street bankers warned of toppy stock markets and a looming near-term retreat after exuberance from unprecedented economic stimulus has led to ""frothy"" asset prices.
BofA's latest weekly fund flow data on Friday reflected some of that sentiment, with investors storming into money markets and gold funds while pulling some money out of emerging markets that had attracted billions of dollars over the past 16 weeks.
U.S. stocks, however, were the standout performer with inflows of $10 billion.
In the week to Wednesday, cash funds attracted $29.1 billion and gold $1.5 billion, marking the largest inflow since August, the U.S. investment bank said.
""Sell the vaccine: frothy prices, greedy positioning, inflationary and desperate policymakers, peaky China and consumer all ultimately (a) toxic brew in 2021,"" said BofA's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett.
The recent buying spree has sent U.S. stock valuations soaring to 23 times 12-month forward earnings - levels hit during the peak of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s. The numbers prompted Citi to downgrade the region to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" on Thursday.
Stock valuations approach late 90s levels https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/oakvejbmmpr/Pasted%20image%201610109547153.png
Citi, however, was bullish on British and emerging market stocks, citing ""reasonable"" valuations.
BofA said the 2020 trend to ""buy everything"" had trickled into 2021, but it expects a slowdown in risk assets as ""policy, positioning and profits"" peak around the end of the first quarter.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Chief Executive David Solomon said he was preparing for more stock market volatility, particularly in the near term, and sees some ""excess in markets"", Axios reported on Thursday.
'SPECULATIVE FEVER'
Analysts at investment bank Saxo also warned investors on Friday about ""aggressive speculative fever"" in some technology and green stocks, recommending they start reducing exposure to so-called bubble stocks.
At 206 times 12-month forward earnings, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is among the list of bubble stocks Saxo highlighted in its note to clients. That's a far cry from Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s 10 times forward earnings and Toyota's 16 times.
The recent jump in cryptocurrencies also sparked debate among bankers.
Noting the violent inflationary price action boosting bitcoin in the past two months, BofA said the world's popular cryptocurrency ""blows the doors off prior bubbles"", such as the dotcom boom, China in the 2000s and gold in the 1970s.
Bitcoin hit $40,000 on Thursday, having doubled in price within a month, and has rallied more than 900% since a low in March. It topped $30,000 for the first time on Jan. 2, having breached $20,000 on Dec. 16.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has said bitcoin's current highs are unsustainable, but it added that the digital currency could climb much higher in the long term.

880,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 09:44AM ET</span>","Wall Street Rises to New Highs, Shrugging off Weak Jobs Report; Dow up 75 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at fresh record highs again on Friday, set to round off a remarkable week on a high note despite the drama in Washington DC and the weakest labor market report in eight months.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 76 points, or 0.2%, at 31,117 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%. All three had closed at record highs again on Thursday. 
The market took in its stride figures showing that the economy lost 140,000 jobs in December. The development had been largely anticipated after private payrolls processor ADP's report on Wednesday, and market participants were mollified by a big upward revision to November's hiring numbers. The jobless rate stayed at 6.7% of the workforce.
The risks to the economy from a sharp rise in unemployment appear to have been reduced in the near term by the Democrats' victory in Georgia's two Senate runoff elections. Their consequent control of the upper chamber means that the incoming administration of Joe Biden will have less resistance to replacing the incomes of those who find themselves out of a job due to Covid-19.  BlueBay Asset Management's chief investment officer Mark Dowding said he expects between $1 and $2 trillion in extra fiscal spending that should lift the outlook for GDP this year.
Moreover, Dowding added, the Democrats' narrow margin of control in Congress means ""it is unlikely much of the more expansive or radical aspects of the Biden agenda will see the light of day.""
""Increased regulation on the energy sector, banks and big tech are all likely to be watered down in the face of state-level opposition,"" Dowding said .  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock powered another 4.4% higher, adding another $30 billion to its market value without any news flow beyond the constant upward ratcheting of analyst price targets, all of which remain comfortably below the spot price. Its market value topped $800 billion for the first time, cementing founder Elon Musk's new position as the world's richest man.
Meanwhile Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 0.6% after a curious flurry of press releases from Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor  (OTC:HYMLY), which was forced to walk back overnight claims of having held early stage talks about cooperating with the iPhone maker in the auto sphere. 
Various news reports have suggested that the company is intensifying its efforts to develop an electric-powered, self-driving car, a project that the company had appeared to put on the back burner a couple of years ago. Quantumscape (NYSE:QS), whose research into solid-state batteries had prompted speculation that it could partner with Apple in such a venture, eked out a 0.5% gain.
 Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock rose another 13% on sustained enthusiasm after South Korea's SK Group agreed to invest $1.5 billion in a joint venture with the hydrogen fuel cell developer earlier in the week. The company is still unprofitable after 20 years, but its market value has risen nearly 100% in the last month to over $20 billion.

(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump returned to Twitter on Thursday with a video acknowledging that Joe Biden would be the next U.S. president as other social media services including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) blocked his accounts over concerns that his messages might spark further violent protests. 
Twitter unlocked the president's @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, which has 88 million followers, after Trump removed three rule-breaking tweets. His first post back on the platform featured a video in which he said he was focused on a peaceful transition of power and which was viewed 1.4 million times within 15 minutes of posting.
Tech companies have been scrambling to crack down on the president's baseless claims about the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in unrest that resulted in four deaths.
Trump's accounts remain blocked on Facebook and Instagram for at least two weeks and perhaps indefinitely. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that the risks of allowing him to use the platform were ""simply too great."" 
Facebook's move marked the most significant sanction of the president by a major social media company. Live-streaming platform Twitch and photo-sharing service  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) issued similar bans. 
""The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,"" Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post.
White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said in response that the companies had censored the president at a critical time for the country. ""Big Tech is out of control,"" he said. 
Zuckerberg said the block on Trump's Facebook page, which has 35 million followers, would last at least until Biden takes office on Jan. 20. 
At an all-hands meeting on Thursday, Zuckerberg told employees he considered it important political leaders ""lead by example and make sure we put the nation first.""
""What we've seen is that the president has been doing the opposite of that and instead fanning the flames of those who think they should turn to violence to overturn the election outcome,"" he said, according to audio of the remarks heard by Reuters.
Social media companies have been under pressure to police misinformation about the U.S. election on their platforms, including from the president. Trump and his allies for months have amplified baseless claims of election fraud and the president told protesters to go to Capitol Hill, with both Republicans and Democrats saying he was responsible for the resulting violence. 
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Twitch disabled Trump's channel due to the ""extraordinary circumstances and the president's incendiary rhetoric,"" it said. A spokeswoman said the company would reassess Trump's account after he leaves office. 
E-commerce platform Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) shut service for stores affiliated with Trump for violations of its ""acceptable use"" policy, prompting e-commerce sites for both the campaign and the Trump Organization to go offline.
BLOCKS 'LONG OVERDUE'
Facebook's decision follows bans in recent years of some government officials in India and Myanmar for promoting violence. A Facebook spokesman said the company had never before blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state. 
In a video posted to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on Wednesday, which was later deleted by the platforms after garnering millions of views, Trump repeated election fraud claims as he told protesters to go home.
Civil rights groups including Color of Change have called for social media companies to ban Trump permanently from the platforms, where he has repeatedly violated policies.
The Anti-Defamation League praised Facebook's move, calling it ""an obvious first step,"" while the NAACP in a statement said the move was a ""long overdue"" gesture that ""rings hollow.""
Facebook has drawn criticism for exempting politicians' posts and ads from its third-party fact-checking program and repeatedly said it does not want to be ""the arbiter of truth."" The company has in recent months started labeling some of Trump's statements but faced questions about why it had not acted sooner against violent rhetoric that proliferated in the past few weeks as organizers planned the rally online.
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement he was ""deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol"" for Facebook to take action and wondered ""if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.""
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the social media actions did not go far enough.
""These platforms have served as core organizing infrastructure for violent, far right groups and militia movements for several years now – helping them to recruit, organize, coordinate and in many cases (particularly with respect to YouTube) generate profits from their violent, extremist content,"" he said in a statement. 
YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, said Thursday any channel that posts videos with false claims about the election results will be temporarily restricted from uploading or live streaming. 

YouTube did not respond to a question about whether it would ban Trump's account in the same manner as Facebook, while a Twitter spokesman said it was continuing to ""evaluate the situation in real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter."" He said Twitter would inform the public if an ""escalation"" in its approach was necessary.

883,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Fastest Rally in History Takes Emerging-Market Stocks to Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The emerging-market equity benchmark rose to a record Friday, topping its previous high reached before the 2008 financial crisis, as a flood of liquidity and optimism over a global economic rebound fuel risk appetite.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 1.8% to 1,345.64 points as of 1:49 p.m. London time, extending its recovery from the March rout to 79%. The milestone comes after stock valuations and market capitalization both reached record highs in a rally that’s added $10.6 trillion in a little over nine months, the fastest bout of wealth creation in the history of emerging markets.
While the flurry of records underscores the strength of the risk-on shift in global markets since Joe Biden’s victory in U.S. elections, it is already sparking nervousness among some investors that emerging equities are overheating. Even though earnings estimates continue to rise, the index has surged so fast that technical indicators are flashing red. Short traders have bet record amounts the gains are unsustainable. And a rise in volumes signals a sense of urgency among traders.
Biggest Gains in Emerging Markets
Yet, for the moment, investors may be forgiven for savoring the record, which has come after a wait of 13 years. Emerging-market stocks have underperformed U.S. peers over the past decade and often bore the brunt of risk-off shifts ranging from the taper tantrum to slowing growth in China and Donald Trump’s trade war.
But developing nations have also been a picture of resilience. Equity values, driven by the addition of countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to the asset class, have almost doubled since the previous record high to $26 trillion. The MSCI gauge now trades at 15.8 times the projected earnings of its members, compared with its 15-year average of 11.2. Analysts have raised profit forecasts for the index by 24% in the past nine months.
Still, with annualized volatility of about 25%, emerging-market stocks remain vulnerable to sudden changes in direction. While the risks surrounding the pandemic and U.S. presidential transition may have waned, there are many threats that could yet arrest the rally.
U.S. Treasury yields are rising, which may force traders to demand a higher earnings yield from developing-nation equities, leading to a drop in stock prices. Any surprise in Biden’s foreign and trade policies may have to be factored in. Growth recovery across emerging economies remains uneven and struggles with mass vaccination could spell trouble.
Any celebration over the MSCI Index reaching a record would have to be short, and tempered by measures to protect against potential losses. The relative strength index on the gauge’s monthly chart has reached the so-called “overbought” level of 70, which has heralded bear markets in the past.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, continuing to post record highs with investors looking through the near-term political turmoil and expecting increased fiscal spending to result in a strong economic recovery.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 96 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 66 points, or 0.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Thursday 0.7% higher, closing above 31,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq Composite ended above 13,000 for the first time after gaining 2.6%, while the S&P 500 closed up 1.5%, also a new record high. 
President Donald Trump attempted late Thursday to cool the political climate in the wake of Wednesday’s violent scenes on Capitol Hill, denouncing those who broke the law and finally conceding that President-elect Joe Biden will take charge on January 20th. 
This statement came after a number of officials in Trump’s administration, including Transport Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, resigned amid widespread calls for him to be removed from office, even with less than two weeks of his term to go.
Still, investors remain buoyant based on the expectation of more fiscal spending by the incoming Biden administration, with control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, while the Federal Reserve continues to keep borrowing costs at very low levels.
The U.S. reported a new record daily level of deaths associated with the Covid-19 virus on Thursday, with 4,110 people passing away while 268,000 new cases were registered. Over the last week alone, there have been 1.6 million new cases and over 19,000 deaths.
This rise in cases, and the associated mobility restrictions, could be reflected in the December nonfarm payrolls data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The report is expected to show a gain of 71,000, which would be far lower than the 245,000 jobs added in November. 
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over the plane crashes that led to the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been linked with South Korean carmaker Hyundai over the potential development of a vehicle.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing the bullish tone created by Saudi Arabia’s surprise announcement earlier this week that it would voluntarily cut output by one million barrels per day for the next two months.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $51.59 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.8% to $55.33. Both benchmarks are on track to post gains of around 5% this week, and are trading around the highest levels seen since February last year.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,893.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2250.

Shares in Germany's second largest bank fell 3% after the announcement by new chief executive Manfred Knof, which was seen as an indication that Commerzbank will post a larger loss than analysts had been expecting.
Commerzbank is working on a strategy update under Knof in an effort to improve profitability, and the new CEO has warned that the bank needs ""a fundamental transformation"".
The goodwill writedown was ""due to deteriorating market parameters"", including low interest rates in the euro area and Poland, where it has a presence, Commerzbank said.
""After this balance sheet clean-up, we are well prepared for the road ahead of us,"" Knof said in a statement. ""Our goal is to make the bank more profitable in the long-term.""
Commerzbank increased its risk provisions related to the coronavirus pandemic to at least 1.7 billion euros, up from its previous guidance of 1.3-1.5 billion euros.
The increase takes into account the impact of a second lockdown currently taking place in Germany, it said.
""By increasing our risk result we are responding to the ongoing corona pandemic and feel well prepared for further developments,"" Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp said.
Last week Commerzbank said it would book 610 million euros in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter after reaching a deal with staff on previously announced job cuts.
Analysts had been expecting Commerzbank to post a loss of more than 300 million euros for 2020 when it is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 11.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 06:55AM ET</span>","Blackstone, Gates team up for Signature Aviation bid as Carlyle circles","By Muvija M
(Reuters) - Blackstone (NYSE:BX) won over Signature Aviation's biggest shareholder Bill Gates for a possible $4.3 billion bid for the British private jet servicing company, going head-to-head with another potential suitor Carlyle.
Blackstone's agreement with Gates' Cascade Investment Llc for its planned offer announced on Friday comes just hours after Signature confirmed an initial takeover approach from Carlyle.
Blackstone and Cascade, which already owns a 19% stake in London-based Signature, are in advanced talks with the company about their proposal that involves a cash offer of 3.81 pounds per share, they said in a joint statement.
The company said last month it was minded to recommend the Blackstone proposal. 
Shares in the company formerly known as BBA Aviation fell 4.2% to 4 pounds on the FTSE 250 midcap index by 1020 GMT as the prospect of an extended bidding war faded, handing back some of the 65% gain in the three weeks since Signature Aviation confirmed talks with Blackstone.
The offer will be made through Brown Bidco Ltd, a newly incorporated company which will be 70% owned by Blackstone with Cascade holding the rest. 
Signature Aviation has said this was Blackstone's sixth proposal, its first being in February last year.
Signature declined to comment on Friday. Carlyle also declined to comment.
Blackstone said the terms of its agreement with Cascade meant Cascade will vote against any competing proposal after a firm bid is made Blackstone.
While airlines across the world are struggling to survive the COVID-19 travel curbs, operators of private jets have fared better as wealthy passengers switch to what is perceived as a safer way to fly.
In its half-year results statement last year, Signature Aviation pointed to a recovery in flight activity in August compared to April when most countries had just begun lockdowns to stymie the spread of the virus. 
Signature also disclosed in December it had rebuffed another proposal from Global Infrastructure Partners about a bid that was lower than Blackstone's.
As per UK takeover rules, Blackstone and Cascade are required to either announce a firm intention to make an offer or walk away by Jan. 14.

Chief Executive Steve Rowe said the pink sweets, along with about a third of the products in M&S's food business, are subject to very complex ""rules of origin"" regulations that form part of Britain's trade deal with the EU struck on Christmas Eve.
The rules relate to the composition of individual products and how much of it has been altered in the United Kingdom. 
Any product that is manufactured in Europe, imported into the UK and then re-distributed to EU countries faces a tariff.
""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" Rowe told reporters, as M&S updated on Christmas trading.
""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he said.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Hyundai says in early talks with Apple after electric vehicle tie-up report,"By Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said on Friday it was in early talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), after local media reported the firms were discussing an electric car and battery tie-up, sending Hyundai shares surging 25%. 
The report comes weeks after Reuters reported that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology and was aiming to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology as early as 2024.
Earlier on Friday, Korea Economic Daily TV said the iPhone maker and Hyundai were in discussions to develop self-driving electric vehicles by 2027 and develop batteries at U.S. factories operated by either Hyundai or its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. The broadcaster didn't cite sources.
""Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is early stage, nothing has been decided,"" Hyundai said in a statement. It didn't say what the talks were about and omitted a reference in an earlier statement to Apple being in discussions with other global automakers as well as Hyundai.
In a regulatory filing issued later, the automaker said it was ""getting requests for cooperation on joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies"", without identifying any of them.
Apple declined to comment. The iPhone maker is known to keep product plans under tight wraps. 
An Apple-branded car could be a big challenge to electric vehicle (EV) market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. It remains unclear who would assemble such a car, but analysts have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner.
""We continue to strongly believe Apple ultimately announces an EV strategic partnership in 2021 that lays the groundwork to enter the burgeoning EV space,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note.
LOWER COSTS
Hyundai and Apple already work together on CarPlay, Apple's software for connecting iPhones to a variety of vehicles.
""Apple outsourcing car production to Hyundai makes sense, because (the Korean firm) is known for quality,"" said Jeong Yun-woo, a former designer at Hyundai and a professor at UNIST in South Korea.
""But I'm not sure whether it is a good strategy for automakers to be like the Foxconn of Apple as automakers face risks of losing control to tech firms,"" he added, referring to the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer's supply contract with Apple on iPhones.
Analysts said Apple may be interested in using Hyundai's electric car platform and facilities to cut costs to develop and make vehicles.
""Apple could see Hyundai as an ideal partner, because when it comes to legacy U.S. automakers, they all have strong unions, which Apple would like to avoid,"" said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities.
""Moreover, their (legacy U.S. automakers) labour cost is much higher than that of Hyundai, which often plays a big role when it comes to car production."" 
TIE-UP BOOST
A tie-up with Apple would be a major boost to Hyundai, whose global sales last year fell more than 15% as the pandemic took a toll on demand. Friday's share price surge added nearly $8 billion to Hyundai's market value.
A longtime champion of rival hydrogen fuel cell cars, Hyundai recently increased bets on battery-powered electric cars, a move welcomed by investors eyeing the recent success of Tesla. 
The South Korean company, which sources batteries from SK Innovation Co Ltd and LG Chem Ltd and others, is expected to launch its first car based on a dedicated electric car platform known as E-GMP early this year.
In 2019, Hyundai and auto parts supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) launched a $4 billion venture to develop self-driving technologies, naming it Motional. Last month, ride-hailing firm  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Motional said they would launch a multi-city U.S. robo-taxi service in 2023.
Hyundai does not have dedicated electric car factories in the United States and it may have to gain consent from its powerful union in South Korea were it to seek to build EVs overseas, analysts said. 
It is not known whether Apple is in talks with other carmakers.
Japanese automaker Honda Motor has not held talks with the iPhone maker, a spokesman told Reuters. Bigger rivalToyota Motor Corp said it does not comment on speculation, as did Foxconn.
Shares in Hyundai Motor jumped as much as 24.8%, hitting a more than seven-year high of 255,000 won, before closing up 19%. Auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd ended the session 18% higher, while Kia shares jumped 8.4%.

Battery makers also gained ground, with SK Innovation closing up 7.6%. The broader KOSPI market closed up 3.97%.

Investing.com -- Europe ended last year with a heated dispute about fish. Could the first hot story of 2021 be about chips? 
Shares in Germany's Infineon  (DE:IFXGn) and Dutch-based  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI) have soared to record highs this week, distinguishing themselves even in the middle of an indiscriminate ""everything rally"" predicated on the expectation of more fiscal spending by an unconstrained Democratic Party administration in the U.S. (Those hopes are being further buttressed by confidence that central banks will continue to keep government and corporate borrowing costs at or close to record low levels).
By mid-morning in Europe on Friday, NXP's Frankfurt-listed stock was up 13% for the week, while Infineon (OTC:IFNNY)'s was up 7.3%. Shares in French-based STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) were likewise up over 10% after adding another 3.1% on the last day of a frenzied opening week to the year.
That enthusiasm has also bubbled through to Dutch-based ASML (AS:ASML), the world's biggest maker of high end machines for making silicon chips. ASML stock was up another 3.1% at a fresh record high. 
There's nothing exclusively European about this, naturally. Chipmakers in the U.S. and Asia have been flagging a cyclical upturn for some months, and the sector is in any case in the middle of a huge secular boom driven by the increased digitization of everything from shopping to driving and recreation. Industry giant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) stock has risen 50% in the last three months alone, albeit helped by factors that are more company-specific.
The performance appears to be driven at least in part by rotation out of overheating U.S. names into companies with less stretched valuations. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock, for example, have essentially flatlined since the start of winter, amid the first hints of disappointment in third-quarter earnings reports.
But the valuations attached to the European chipmakers are now also looking increasingly hard to justify. Infineon trades at over 82 times trailing earnings, STMicro over 60 times and ASML over 55 times. 
How confident can investors be that earnings will catch up? A report in the Financial Times on Friday, detailing a severe shortage of chips for the automotive industry that is a major customer for all of the big three, certainly suggests that margins will be a lot fatter this year. And the quickening pace of adoption of electric vehicles, which require much more in the way of semiconductors, will help further. Battery electric vehicle sales in Germany, Europe's largest market, tripled in 2020 and, together with hybrids, accounted for over 20% of all new registrations in the fourth quarter, according to figures from Germany's Federal Vehicles Office (KBA) this week.
The FT cited complaints from Europe's three biggest components suppliers - Bosch, Continental  (DE:CONG) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) - that they had all had trouble sourcing chips for components in recent months. More than one of the companies expects such bottlenecks to last well into 2021. 
That's not to say that this week's momentum can be sustained forever, or even for long, but it is at least a solid fundamental story to underpin prices when the froth finally comes off the broader market.

(Reuters) -European stocks were on track for their strongest weekly gains since November on Friday, with Germany's DAX hitting a record high on the back of better-than-expected economic data and encouraging earnings updates from chipmakers.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% and was set to end the first week of 2021 with gains of about 3%, largely driven by hopes that a Democrat sweep of the U.S. Senate would lead to a large U.S. fiscal stimulus package. 
That, along with optimism that the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will fuel a strong global recovery, boosted U.S. and Asian markets to all-time highs. Europe's STOXX 600 trades nearly 5% below its record high hit in February 2020.
Germany's DAX index outperformed, gaining 0.7%, after data showed both industrial output and exports rose more than expected in November.
""Germany is the powerhouse in Europe. If you get data out with value, especially at these uncertain times, that is going to push prices up and that seems to be what is happening now,"" ETX Capital analyst Michael Baker said. 
A European Commission monthly survey showed the economic sentiment in the euro zone ticked up in December, but inflation held in negative territory, lending weight to expectations of loose monetary policy in the bloc.
Tech stocks topped sectoral gains as chipmakers Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), AMS and ASM International (OTC:ASMIY) rose between 1.6% and 6.9% after global peers Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd reported strong earnings. 
Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics rose 4.3% after its revenue estimate for the fourth quarter came in above the previous range.
Travel stocks got a boost after French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) raised its margin outlook for the first-half of 2021. Its shares surged 6.7% to the top of STOXX 600, while peer Compass gained 3.1%.
Economically sensitive sectors such as miners, oil and gas, and banks were mixed after strong gains this week. 
UK's FTSE 100, also heavy on bank and commodity stocks, rose just 0.1% after a 6% surge this week. Retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) slipped 1.4% after it reported another big fall in sales of clothing and homewares in the three months leading up to Christmas.

Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) fell 3.1% after it forecast a net loss for its fourth quarter due to higher provisions for a long-running dispute in the United States.

Europe's Euro STOXX 600 opened up 0.7%, with Frankfurt's index up 0.8% after German industrial output and exports rose in November.
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini stock futures also pointed to a cheery open, rising 0.51%. 
The upbeat mood came after Wall Street hit record highs on Thursday, while bond prices fell as markets bet a new Democratic-controlled U.S. government would lead to heavy spending and borrowing to support the country's economic recovery.
Investors were also awaiting U.S. non-farm payrolls data due later in the day to gauge the jobs market's health.
""Investors are buying the end of an erratic Trump administration and looking forward to something new, which is a Biden presidency and the prospect of a significant spending programme,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""People are going for cyclical names and this is driving the market forward but there has to be care taken as this relies on a rebound in the economy in the coming quarters.""
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in almost 50 countries, rose 0.4%, extending its push into record territory and set to close out its best week since late November. 
In Asia, South Korea's Kospi led the way, charging 4% higher, its best daily showing in nearly seven months, while the Nikkei added 2.36%, hitting its highest level since August 1990. The dollar-denominated Nikkei share average rose above its 1989 peak to a record high.
Bucking the trend, Chinese blue-chip shares fell 0.3%, retreating from a 13-year high, after index providers MSCI and FTSE Russell said they would cut three Chinese telecom companies from their benchmarks after the close on Friday in response to a U.S. investment ban.
The announcements, which means global funds have one day to adjust billions of dollars of passive investments, wiped a combined $5.6 billion off the value of their Hong Kong-traded shares on Friday.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1% despite reports that the Trump administration was considering banning U.S. entities from investing in an expanded list of Chinese companies in the waning days of his presidency.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.69%, the S&P 500 gained 1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.56% - with all three indexes finishing at record closing highs.
The gains follow expectations that Democratic control of both U.S. houses of Congress will help the party of President-elect Joe Biden push through larger fiscal stimulus and comes despite political unrest in Washington, DC.
U.S. government officials have begun weighing removing President Donald Trump from office before Biden's inauguration date of Jan. 20, after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building.
Rising risk appetite weighed on bonds, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield scaling a fresh high since March. Ten-year notes yielded 1.1% on Friday, up from 1.017% on Thursday. 
The dollar held onto its gains helped by the rising yields. The dollar index gained 0.35% against a basket of currencies to 90.121 with the euro down 0.45% to $1.2216.
""We're sure to see a synchronised global recovery in the second half of this year,"" said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski.
""Right now, there's lots of concern about the virus and noise surrounding the vaccine. But we need to take a slightly longer view.""
Cryptocurrency bitcoin fell about 2% to $38,733 after topping $40,000 for the first time on Thursday on high demand from institutional and retail investors. Market watchers have said a pullback is likely following its recent run-up.
In commodity markets, oil traders continued to focus on Saudi Arabia's pledge to deepen production cuts.
Brent crude was up 0.51% at $54.66 a barrel, near 11-month highs. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 0.45% to $51.06. Both benchmarks are on track for weekly gains of more than 5%.
Spot gold dipped 1.3% to $1,888.46 per ounce as the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields firmed.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, with investors looking beyond record deaths from Covid-19 and U.S. political turmoil, and pricing in a strong economic recovery in the second half of the year.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, climbing to a record high, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.2%. 
Wall Street also hit record highs on Thursday, and European markets benefited from this increased confidence. Investors are looking to the incoming Democratic-controlled U.S. government for additional fiscal spending, while European economies are also set to get a boost from the European Recovery Fund.
With this in mind, investors are prepared to overlook the rising number of Covid-19 cases: Germany recorded the most fatalities since the pandemic started, the associated national lockdowns throughout Europe and the hesitant start to the vaccination program. The U.S. also notched over 4,000 deaths in a single day for the first time.
Helping was a new study that indicated that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is also effective against the new virulent strains of the virus found primarily in the U.K. and South Africa.
Additionally, late Thursday President Donald Trump finally conceded that President-elect Joe Biden would take control of the White House later this month, for the first time condemning the violence that broke out on Wednesday when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol while lawmakers were confirming Biden’s election victory.
Turning to economic data, German industrial production rose 0.9% in November, ahead of expectations, but the key economic release will be the December U.S. nonfarm payrolls number, after Wednesday’s ADP release suggested the country’s jobs recovery had ended.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock fell 1.6% after the Swiss banking giant said it expects to book a net loss for its fourth quarter after increasing its provisions for a long-running legal dispute in the United States by $850 million.
On a brighter note, STMicroelectronics NV (PA:STM) stock rose 4.1% after the chipmaker offered an early revenue estimate for the fourth-quarter above the previous range.
Oil prices edged higher Friday, continuing the bullish tone created by Saudi Arabia’s surprise announcement earlier this week that it would voluntarily cut output by one million barrels per day for the next two months.
This move has helped to allay worries over declining fuel demand due to the pandemic surge and the associated increase in restrictive measures.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $51.22 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $54.86. Both benchmarks are on track to post gains of around 5% this week, and are trading around the highest levels seen since February last year.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.2% to $1,890.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.2221.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",Can companies drive social change? PwC's Roy Weathers on racial equity,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corporate America is not known for advancing deep societal change.
Roy Weathers is trying to fix that.
The U.S. vice chair of accounting and advisory giant PwC is spending most of his time these days heading up CEO Action for Racial Equity, a group of more than 100 prominent firms and chief executives trying to move the needle on social issues.
After an emotional year in which the Black Lives Matter movement drew increased attention to injustice, Weathers is focused on leveraging the skills, dollars and influence of corporate America to bring about societal change. Where communities of color have been left behind in areas like education, health or economics, Weathers is assembling a strike force to attack those gaps.
First up: a fellowship program, in which each member company devotes at least one employee to work full-time on these efforts and start cementing change in public policy around the country.
Reuters spoke with Weathers about what has divided the United States – and how to bring it back together. Edited excerpts are below.
Q: How exactly did CEO Action for Racial Equity come about?
A: For almost four years we have been part of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, which PwC chair Tim Ryan helped launch and now has 1,500 organizations and CEOs signed on. CEO Action on Racial Equity is basically a spinoff of that, after the George Floyd killing and all the events last summer.
Q: Why is it important for this to happen at the C-suite level?
A: The best place to operate is in a society that is healthy. These individuals who are protesting are putting forth a desire for change and are advocating basic principles of social justice: equity, rights, participation. They are our customers and our employees. 
We want to operate in a society that is healed and engage in America beyond just the financial impact to stakeholders.
Q: Was there a particular event that impacted you emotionally?
A: Whether it's Breonna Taylor or George Floyd, this is all right in front of us on TV. There is no turning away from it. 
As a father of a 13-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter, watching them process what they are seeing on television, or hearing through social media, is very challenging. 
Q: How do these fellowships work?
A: Each fellow is still an employee of their own company, but for two years they will be working on issues like education, economic empowerment, safety, and health. 
For instance, in an area like education, is there some new policy that could help at the city, state or federal level? So they are thinking about gaps, they are doing research, and they are driving public policies to help bring change.
Q: Since so many people are isolated right now, how are they all working together?
A: There are 250 fellows from 115 different companies so far, and by the end of January, we should have another couple of hundred. 
It's all virtual because of COVID, but they are still very connected with each other. There are virtual meetings, weekly town halls with guest speakers and policy experts, and a tech platform called 'Idea Hub,' where they can collectively see all the policies and issues that we're working through. The goal is to roll out our first slate of policy ideas in January.
Q: COVID-19 has disproportionately affected communities of color, so will that be a primary focus?
A: What COVID-19 did was really expose the challenges that were already there in our society. So whether the subject was healthcare access, or food insecurity, or having enough savings to survive, it just completely ripped the Band-Aid off.
But COVID is also helping us identify innovative ways to solve these problems. For example, there are huge gaps in healthcare access, and telehealth is one way to close those gaps. That didn't really exist before, so maybe policy changes can help in making that shift permanent.
Q: The U.S. is very divided right now. Are you wary about being able to build consensus on these issues, or are you hopeful?
A: No matter what your political perspective, society's well-being is on the agenda. People vary on how to get there, but I'm hopeful that we can make progress. 

It won't be easy. It feels like this is a once-in-a-generation moment – and I don't say that lightly.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",Chinese bargain hunters pile into stocks blacklisted by Trump,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As U.S. investors dump shares in Chinese companies blacklisted by outgoing President Donald Trump, bargain hunters in China are taking the opposite side of that trade, wagering that a Joe Biden presidency will reverse the investment ban.
Trump signed an executive order on Nov. 12 that bars U.S. securities investment in Chinese companies allegedly owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
The outgoing U.S. president is considering expanding that blacklist of 35 firms to include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent.
As U.S. investors rush to sell shares in the sanctioned companies and their subsidiaries before the executive order takes effect on Jan. 11, Chinese investors are swooping in.
Since the order was announced, holdings by mainland Chinese in the Hong Kong-listed shares of China Railway Construction Corp (CRCC) and CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd via the China-Hong Kong Connect roughly tripled, according to bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. 
Other blacklisted stocks, including railway equipment maker CRRC Corp, China Communications Construction Co and semiconductor giant SMIC also witnessed heavy money inflows.
Zhu Haifeng, a veteran Chinese retail investor, said he bargain hunted in CNOOC and CRRC, which both had lost as much as 27% since the Trump order. 
""They are globally-competitive companies, and are China's 'name cards',"" said Zhu, who sees limited impact on the companies' fundamentals from the U.S. sanctions. 
Wan Chengshui, portfolio manager at Hangzhou-based Golden Eagle Fund Management Co, said he plans to increase his holdings in Tencent, if prices fall further.
""Trump politicized everything in the name of national security. When Biden takes office, I think things will take a turn for the better,"" said Wan, predicting Trump's executive order will be nullified, and sanctions against Tencent and Alibaba won't materialize.
Wan is not alone. 
When Tencent slumped nearly 5% in Hong Kong following news of the potential blacklisting on Thursday, Chinese investors ploughed a net HK$4.6 billion ($593.29 million) into its shares via a cross-border trading channel, making it the most actively-traded stock under the scheme that day. 
Global index publishers MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Index have all scrambled to delete the blacklisted securities from their global benchmarks, forcing passive investors to shed those holdings. 
Phillip Wool, head of investment solutions at Rayliant Global Advisors, said investors could find bargains as active investors dump shares to front-run passive outflows.
""Non-U.S. investors will look at prices of those stocks falling and, at some point, decide it's a buying opportunity,"" Wool said. 
Meanwhile, uncertainty lingers around the scope and implications of Trump's executive order, while the gradual expansion of the list is another guessing game, Wool said. 
Therefore ""there's also a potential opportunity for active investors in terms of outguessing the rest of the market as to how the political situation is going to unfold.""
After making U-turns twice this month on the issue, the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday said it will delist three Chinese telecom companies.
Since NYSE's first delisting announcement on Jan 1, Chinese investors have been adamant buyers. Mainland holdings under Connect in China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd, have jumped 37%, 28% and 41%, respectively.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Friday, with investors looking beyond record deaths from Covid-19 cases and U.S. political turmoil and expecting a strong economic recovery in the second half of the year.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.9% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
Wall Street hit record highs on Thursday. Investors are looking to the incoming Democratic-controlled U.S. government for additional fiscal spending, while European economies are also set to get a boost from the European Recovery Fund.
“2021 is starting on the wrong foot, with the eurozone economy still struggling,” said ING analyst Peter Vanden Houte, in a research note. “But even though the vaccination process will be drawn-out, we believe that from the second quarter and beyond, some of the excess savings households built up in 2020 will be unleashed, boosting consumption.”
With this in mind, investors are prepared to overlook the rising number of Covid-19 cases: Germany recorded the most fatalities since the pandemic started, the associated national lockdowns throughout Europe and the hesitant start to the vaccination program.

(Reuters) - Venture capital backed companies in the United States raised nearly $130 billion last year, setting a record despite the COVID-19 pandemic, figures from data firm CB Insight released on Friday show.
While the investment total is up 14% from 2019, the number of deals is down 9% to 6,022. And so-called mega-rounds, deals that are $100 million or higher also hit a record amount and number with $63 billion raised in 318 deals.
""What we're seeing is a 'rich get richer' phenomenon where successful, high momentum technology companies are vacuuming up most of the financing,"" CB Insights chief executive Anand Sanwal told Reuters by email.
He said that data showed a big drop in a very early stage investment called seed stage, and expected some of those companies that stand out to see ""insatiable investor demand"" with fewer competitors for the money.
The trend of big investments doesn't look like it will slow in 2021 as there is a lot of capital chasing investments, say some venture capitalists.
Already on Thursday Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Metric, a startup that provides customer analytics and improvement tools for online businesses, said it raised $200 million in its latest financing round, which values the firm at more than $1 billion.
In 2020, many of the mega rounds were raised by tech companies that got a boost from COVID-19, which drove up remote work and e-commerce.
""Capital tends to follow categories that have a lot of legs. And I think right now you're seeing a lot of conviction behind categories and companies that are riding un-doubtable trends,"" said Arun Mathew a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Accel, an early investor in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""I think it's pretty safe to say 2021 is going to be a banner year for many tech companies,"" Mathew said.

904,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 12:54AM ET</span>",Europe’s Contested Deal With China Sends Warning to Joe Biden,"(Bloomberg) -- After more than seven years of negotiation with Beijing, the European Union’s landmark deal with China landed with a thud. Ill-timed, unenforceable and naive were just some of the charges leveled at the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment concluded Dec. 30.
Now, after a week of relative silence, governments are fighting back at criticism they see as unfair. Interviews with government officials in Europe’s main capitals showed a common conviction that the deal not only contains real concessions by Beijing, but that it puts the EU on a stronger footing to reengage with Washington after four years of antagonism by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Rather than a rebuke to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, as critics have charged, the accord represents the first step back to a multilateral order after Trump’s “America First” stance, according to a senior official in Berlin. The U.S. needs Europe as a global player, not a vassal, so it’s in American interests that the bloc presents itself as a geopolitical force in its own right, said another senior official in Rome.
“Yes, it may be seen as more of a strategic, autonomous approach towards China,” and one that Biden may not like, Sigmar Gabriel, the former German foreign minister and vice chancellor, told Bloomberg Television. “But on the other hand there is enough room to maneuver to join hands” and forge a common stance on China.
Forced Labor
European lawmakers and China watchers on both sides of the Atlantic argue the bloc’s leaders were naive to trust Beijing on the deal’s provisions on sustainable development, including commitments on forced labor that they say will never be met. By signing the agreement now, EU leaders are gifting China a diplomatic coup as it quashes dissent in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, they say.
EU officials say that the deal, which commits China to provide greater market access, potentially increasing bilateral trade worth some $650 billion in 2019, was as good as it could get and significantly more than anyone else has achieved. The investment deal isn’t devised to address human rights issues, but still grants Europe leverage in its discussions with China, according to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office. The Italian official said it would have been unthinkable until recently to bring China toward adherence on international standards on workers’ rights.
“This is the most ambitious outcome on market access, on the level playing field and on sustainable development that China has ever agreed with a third country,” Valdis Dombrovskis, EU Commission executive vice-president in charge of economic matters, told reporters on Dec. 30 in Brussels. While “not a panacea” for all Europe’s issues with China, “it certainly helps to address a number of challenges.”
Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who joined a video call with EU leaders and President Xi Jinping on Dec. 30, see the CAI as a start, with ongoing talks with China on issues outside the scope of the deal to come, according to the French president’s office. These include climate, where they want China to “green” the Belt and Road Initiative; global health, with vaccines to become a universal asset; debt relief for Africa; and human rights.
Wait for Biden
A core charge directed at the EU and Germany, as its biggest economy and the deal’s main proponent, is that the 27-member bloc is handing Beijing ammunition in its future dealings with the U.S. It should have held off for Biden to take office to agree on a common approach to China, the argument goes. 
Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, said in late December that he would welcome “early consultation” with Europe on joint concerns about China, but the deal was done anyway. He avoided criticism of Europe in a weekend interview with CNN, saying that “we are confident we can develop a common agenda” with partners on those concerns, from human rights to technology.
Asked this week about criticism of the deal attributed to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed his remarks as “sour grapes.”
In Europe, however, where the Trump administration has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum, berated leaders over defense spending, and attempted to torpedo the nuclear deal with Iran, key governments regard the deal as a demonstration of their collective ambition to stake out a role for the EU in a world increasingly defined by great power rivalry. While not directed against the U.S., it’s a demonstration of Europe asserting itself, according to the Elysee.
Creating friction
“Obviously this has created some friction, but it’s also sent a message that when we’re talking about China, coordination with the United States cannot and will not translate into the United States telling Europeans what to do,” said Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute of International Affairs in Rome. “We share notes, we agree more often than we disagree, but we don’t always have the same position. This is what a more balanced relationship means.”
For Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, who has seen the deal-making up close over the long years of its progress, criticism of the final outcome fails to acknowledge the nature of interacting with Beijing. He compared it to “barking at the Great Wall of China,” with the result that “nothing will happen.” Instead, he said, “we managed to get through the door.”

“Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided,” the South Korean company said in a statement Friday.
Korean media reported the discussions earlier in the day. It was also reported that Hyundai has completed internal discussions on the collaboration and is currently awaiting approval from Chairman Eui Sun Chung.
Apple declined to comment.
Apple is advancing its self-driving car technology and targets producing a passenger vehicle that could include its own battery technology, Reuters reported in December. However, work on such a vehicle is still in the early stages, with Apple expected to take at least five years to launch an autonomous, electric vehicle.
For its part, Hyundai Motors is accelerating its push into new technologies such as electric, driverless and flying cars, including setting up a $4 billion autonomous-driving joint venture with Dublin-headquartered Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) in September 2019."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -The company used by hackers as a springboard for the worst-known breach of U.S. government computers in at least five years has hired some of the biggest names in security to help it recover.
SolarWinds Corp, which had backdoored versions of its network-management software go out to thousands of customers, had already hired CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Inc to help it assess the intrusion and protect it going forward.
On Thursday, it hired a new consulting business formed by former U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency head Chris Krebs and Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
Krebs was the first leader of Homeland Security unit CISA and led the national effort to keep the 2020 election safe from hacking and to dispel related misinformation. He was fired by President Donald Trump after he continued to assert the election was not ""rigged"" but free from electronic chicanery.
Trump has falsely claimed that the Nov. 3 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was riddled with fraud.
Stamos, an adjunct professor at Stanford, helped coordinate a broader effort by academics and nonprofits to rapidly dispel coordinated attempts to spread false election-related information. He also was among those brought in to advise on security at fast-growing videoconferencing company  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc after a series of flaws were reported.
Krebs said he planned to fully devote himself to the new business, which will recommend security practices for multiple clients and also combat coordinated misinformation. 
""There have been successful leaders that embrace cybersecurity but also the community and engagement, and they tend to not just survive in this environment, but thrive,"" Krebs said in an interview. ""We want to help executives become those leaders. There's a process that we want to help organizations build.""
SolarWinds code has been found inside a half-dozen federal agencies that were then exploited further by hackers said by U.S. officials to have been working for the Russian government, which has denied it.
SolarWinds Chief Executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna, who joined the company this week, said in a blog post that hiring the experts was part of an effort to help transform the company, which has been criticized for poor security.
""We have brought in the expertise of Chris Krebs and Alex Stamos to assist in this review and provide best-in-class guidance on our journey to evolve into an industry leading secure software development company,” a company spokesman said by email.
Stamos said he was not interested in a full-time job in Biden's administration, and would rather advise part-time with multiple companies either in crisis or hoping to get in better shape before one.

“These current Russian attacks have created a new set of companies who now realize they need to be playing at a much higher level,” Stamos said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning over rising hopes for more U.S. stimulus measures and a peaceful transfer of power in the U.S. on Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden and his administration are due to be sworn in.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.75% by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT). After declaring a state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area on Thursday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said earlier in the day that the government would liaise with other prefectures on whether to extend the state of emergency.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.57%. Korean shares are outperforming over reports than  Hyundai Motor  Co. (KS:005380) is in early stage talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to develop self-driving electric vehicles. Hyundai shares rose as much as 24% earlier in the session.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.44%, with the country’s third-largest city of Brisbane entering a three-day lockdown from later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.24%. MSCI Inc. said that it would remove the Hong Kong listed shares of China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd from its benchmark indexes at the close of business on Friday. However, confusion as to whether the trio be included in a U.S. ban on investments in Chinese companies with military ties remains, with the New York Stock Exchange revived plans to delist the trio’s U.S. shares.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.47% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.20%.
Investors are still digesting the violence wrecked on Capitol Hill by supporters of President Donald Trump, which aimed to disrupt lawmakers’ certification of Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 presidential election. The certification was eventually completed, and alongside Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock’s victory in the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia earlier in the week, clears the way for Biden’s agenda to be implemented once he and his administration take office.
Meanwhile, Trump said on Thursday, “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20th … my focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.”
However, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer are leading calls for Trump to be immediately removed from office, threatening a new drive to impeach him if there is no action form his cabinet. A growing number of Trump’s top officials, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, have tendered their resignations.
However, some investors remained optimistic despite the drama in Washington D.C.
“Markets, rightly, in our view, see the U.S. government as ultimately a stable-enough set of institutions even if things occasionally go pear-shaped,” DataTrek Research co-founder Nick Colas said in a note.
“Politics play second fiddle to economic and corporate fundamentals when it comes to setting asset prices. The country’s economic future coming out of the pandemic remains promising,"" the note added.
Data released on Thursday showed that December’s ISM Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was 57.2, higher than the 54.6 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 55.9 reading. Although gains in business activity and new orders helped offset the decrease in the number of initial jobless claims for the week, the U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, is forecast to show a sharp slowdown in hiring when it is released later in the day."
909,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>",Boeing to pay $2.5 billion to settle U.S. criminal probe into 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson, Eric M. Johnson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) -Boeing Co will pay more than $2.5 billion in fines and compensation after reaching a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over two plane crashes that killed a total of 346 people and led to the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner.
The settlement, which allows Boeing (NYSE:BA) to avoid prosecution, includes a fine of $243.6 million, compensation to airlines of $1.77 billion and a $500 million crash-victim fund over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design.
Boeing said it would take a $743.6 million charge against its fourth-quarter 2020 earnings to reflect the deferred prosecution agreement, a form of corporate plea bargain. Boeing had put aside reserves of $1.77 billion in prior quarters to provide for compensation to airlines.
The Justice Department deal, announced after the market close on Thursday, caps a 21-month investigation into the design and development of the 737 MAX following the two crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
The crashes ""exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers,"" acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns said in a statement accompanying the agreement.
""Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 MAX airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception,"" Burns said, referring to the Federal Aviation Administration.
The crashes triggered a hailstorm of investigations, frayed U.S. leadership in global aviation and have cost Boeing some $20 billion.
Plaintiffs lawyers representing families of victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash said the settlement strengthens civil litigation against Boeing in Chicago, where the company is headquartered. Boeing has already settled most lawsuits related to the Lion Air disaster in Indonesia. 
Because of the crashes, the U.S. Congress in December passed legislation reforming how the FAA certifies new airplanes.
Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who oversaw a lengthy probe into the crashes, said the ""settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist and is an insult to the 346 victims who died as a result of corporate greed.""
He added, ""Not only is the dollar amount of the settlement a mere fraction of Boeing’s annual revenue, the settlement sidesteps any real accountability in terms of criminal charges.""
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019, and the grounding was not lifted until November 2020, after Boeing made significant safety upgrades and improvements in pilot training.
Boeing, the largest U.S. airplane manufacturer, was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States. It faces a three-year deferred prosecution agreement, with the charge dismissed if it complies.
DPAs are corporate plea bargains that typically allow a company to avoid criminal charges that could disrupt activities such as access to public contracts, in return for a fine and admission of wrongdoing, as well as internal reforms.
DECEPTION 
Boeing admitted in court documents that two of its 737 MAX technical pilots deceived the FAA about a safety system called MCAS, which was tied to both fatal crashes. The documents also say Boeing belatedly cooperated with the probe but only after it initially ""frustrated"" the investigation. 
In a note to employees, Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said the agreement ""appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations.""
Reuters has reported https://tinyurl.com/y26h5xkv that Boeing managers told engineers working on the MAX, including MCAS, their designs could not trigger more comprehensive training designations from the FAA. 
The deferred prosecution agreement says one employee wrote another in 2014 that if the FAA required higher-level training it would ""cost Boeing tens of millions of dollars!""
The $243 million fine, which the Justice Department said was at ""low end"" of the sentencing guidelines, represents the amount of money Boeing saved by not implementing full-flight simulator training for the 737 MAX, the agreement stated. 
The airline payment fund will include payments already made by Boeing to airlines, which had to cancel flights due to a shortage of aircraft.
On MCAS, Boeing disclosed changes that gave the system greater power to some FAA personnel but it did not disclose it to other FAA key personnel responsible for determining pilot training, the agreement said.
""The purpose of the conspiracy was to defraud the FAA (Aircraft Evaluation Group) ... in order to bring about a financial gain to Boeing,"" it said. 
But the Justice Department stopped short of requiring an independent compliance monitor because ""the misconduct was neither pervasive across the organization, nor undertaken by a large number of employees, nor facilitated by senior management.""
The agreement also cited remedial steps Boeing had taken since the crashes, such as firing its previous chief executive in late 2019 and adding a permanent safety committee at the board level. 
Under Thursday's agreement, Boeing agreed to adopt a new compliance program, or to modify its existing one, to ensure it maintains an effective compliance program and system of internal controls to root out fraud.

""This settlement is protection for Boeing rather than justice, as it is a continuation of Boeing evading accountability and transparency,"" said Michael Stumo, whose daughter died in the MAX crash in Ethiopia.

Investing.com -- Stocks reached record highs again on Thursday, this time led by tech, as the fallout from Wednesday’s violence on Capitol Hill included demands that President Donald Trump be immediately removed from office.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and former government officials called on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Short of that, they called on Congress to bring another set of impeachment charges.
Later in the afternoon, The New York Times reported that Trump has discussed granting himself a Presidential pardon.
Technology companies railed against Trump, who had encouraged demonstrators to protest the confirmation of President-elect Joe Biden's victory. 
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) locked Trump’s account until at least the end of his term on Jan. 20, while  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) locked Trump out of his account for at least 12 hours.  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP) said it would block Trump-affiliated stores on its platform.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Jobs report for December 
Since the pandemic began almost a year ago, investors have watched the monthly nonfarm payroll report for clues on the underlying health of the economy. Everyone knows the coronavirus situation has grown more dire in recent months, but it has yet to show up in the government’s monthly jobs report. That may change.
Earlier this week, a payroll report by ADP said private businesses cut 123,000 jobs in December, far worse than economists' had expected. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show a gain of 71,000, which would be far lower than the 245,000 jobs added in November. The data are due out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
2. Dow component strikes big legal settlement
Late on Thursday, regulators announced that  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) would pay $2.5 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation into two crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft that killed nearly 350 people. The settlement includes a criminal penalty of nearly $250 million.
Boeing's 737 Max was recertified late last year after the aircraft maker fixed the problems that led to the crashes. Its shares, which have a big influence in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, could react on Friday to the news of the settlement. 
3. Bitcoin reaches the stratosphere
The cryptocurrency everyone loves to talk about spiked above $40,000 for the first time ever on Thursday and is on a seemingly unstoppable climb after gaining more than 300% last year. It’s up 36% in the first few days of trading in 2021.
Institutional investors and popular apps like  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) have raised the profile of Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) in the popular culture. Investors have several reasons for buying up bitcoin, including its use as a store of value and inflation hedge (like gold) and also its use in secure payments. Expect investors to watch for even more records."

Shares in the company led by Elon Musk jumped nearly 8% to end the session at $816, putting its market capitalization at $774 billion and making it Wall Street's fifth-most-valuable company, just behind Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and ahead of Facebook.
Facebook's stock market value was $765 billion after its shares rose about 2%, according to Refinitiv data.

Tesla, up over 700% in the past 12 months, has become the most valuable auto company in the world by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Musk surpassed Amazon's Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest person, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.
Tesla's latest lift came after RBC raised its rating on the stock to ""sector perform"" from ""underperform.""
RBC analyst Joseph Spak said in his research note that he previously underestimated Tesla's ability to use its soaring stock price to raise capital to fund the company's expansion.
""We took a fresh look at the growth opportunity, what we got wrong about TSLA's positioning and the valuation and conclude that the stock price itself is likely to be somewhat self-fulfilling to TSLA's growth and strategy,"" Spak wrote.

Analysts, on average, expect Tesla to report $1.2 billion in net profits for 2020, compared with $5.8 billion in net profits expected from GM and $27.1 billion in net profits expected from Facebook, according to Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street hit record levels on Thursday as investors bet a Democrat-controlled Congress will deliver more stimulus spending to help the U.S. economy overcome a steep pandemic-induced downturn.
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all set new highs amid growing calls for President Donald Trump's removal, one day after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a harrowing assault on American democracy.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Trump's immediate removal from office through the 25th Amendment. President-elect Joe Biden accused Trump of fomenting violence and said Wednesday was one of the darkest days in U.S. history.
""The market is now looking past Trump and it's looking forward to a Biden presidency, more structure and stimulus,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC.
""A Democratic Congress is going to obviously be more concerned about the small businesses, and the Main Street.""
Economy-linked financials jumped while industrial and materials sectors hit new records on expectations Biden will line up a bigger fiscal package and boost infrastructure spending with Congress under Democrat control.
Rate-sensitive bank shares gained, tracking another surge in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield above 1%. [US/]
Plain vanilla growth stocks, relatively speaking, are less likely to benefit from more stimulus spending, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group in Newport Beach, California.
""Overall value-type stocks probably do better than growth,"" Bahnsen said. ""On the margin, if they're going to go get another $1 trillion and push bond yields higher and the slope of the yield curve steeper, banks are going to benefit.""
The S&P 500 technology index more than made up for its losses from a day earlier, when shares of some of the biggest technology companies dropped on fears of increased regulation.
The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes the core FAANG group of stocks that have led the Wall Street rally from pandemic lows, gained more than 2%.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 211.66 points, or 0.69%, to 31,041.06, the S&P 500 gained 55.69 points, or 1.49%, to 3,803.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 325.78 points, or 2.56%, to 13,066.57.
The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits unexpectedly dipped last week, while staying elevated, a Labor Department report showed, with the job market recovery appearing to stall as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the country.
""With more stimulus coming, even if we do have a miss on claims, it's going to be a little bit less severe, because we know there's going to be a bigger back up for those who are recently unemployed,"" said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors in Newport Beach, California.
Investors are now awaiting a comprehensive December jobs report, which is expected on Friday.
DXC Technology Co surged as France's IT consulting group Atos SE made a more than $10 billion takeover approach for its U.S. rival, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.

Electric-car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc jumped to a record high, with its chief and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk surpassing Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s top boss Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest man, according to a report.

The investigators are looking into whether AmEx allegedly ""used aggressive and misleading sales tactics to sell cards to business owners and whether customers were harmed,"" according to the report. (https://on.wsj.com/3oqlUMK)
A spokesman for AmEx said the company had been cooperating with a regulatory review of small business card sales between 2015 and 2016 since spring, but declined to give further details including about the regulators involved.
""We have conducted a detailed, independent review of these sales from this time period, and found no evidence of a pattern of misleading sales practices,"" the spokesman said in an email.
The business units responsible for these sales represented about 0.25% of the 65 million total new cards AmEx acquired worldwide between 2014 and 2019, the statement said.
The Inspector General's office at the Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Federal Reserve are also examining whether specific employees contributed to the alleged behavior and if higher-level employees supported it, the WSJ report added.
Shares of AmEx were down 3.7% at $117.95.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is also investigating business-card sales practices at the company, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Smithfield Foods shakes up management team under new CEO,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods on Thursday unveiled a management shakeup as the world's largest pork processor and its new chief executive deal with the ripple effects of a pandemic-led drop in restaurant meat consumption and coronavirus infections among U.S. workers.
The pandemic has reduced demand for meat at restaurants, cafeterias and other food-service outlets, delivering an economic shock to Smithfield and its rivals. Thousands of meatpacking workers have been infected with the new coronavirus, including at Smithfield plants, and meat companies have faced criticism for not doing more to protect their employees.
Smithfield CEO Dennis Organ, who was previously the company's chief operating officer, had been scheduled to take the reins in early 2021, but the change was pushed up to late November.
The shake-up announced by the Smithfield, Virginia-based company on Thursday includes the retirements of the chief commodity hedging officer, two executives in the packaged meats division and a senior adviser to the CEO, after decades at the company.
The company, owned by Hong Kong's WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd, said Organ had promoted some executives to new positions, including Russ Dokken to chief sales officer from executive vice president of U.S. packaged meats.
Scott Saunders becomes chief supply chain officer after working as executive vice president of the company's U.S. supply chain and president of fresh pork. 
Joe Weber was promoted to chief commodity hedging officer from executive vice president of growth and emerging business. 
""This team will carry our company forward and make Operational Excellence our standard,"" Organ said in a statement.
Smithfield announced the retirement of Dhamu Thamodaran, who was chief commodity hedging officer, executive vice president and chief strategy officer.
Also retiring are John Pauley, chief commercial officer of packaged meats; Bill Michels, senior vice president of operations for packaged meats; and Michael Cole, senior advisor to the CEO and corporate secretary, according to Smithfield.
The company said in November that Organ, who replaced former CEO Kenneth Sullivan, had ""moved swiftly to install a new leadership team.""

Smithfield last year said it was headed for record profits before the pandemic hit and spent more than $600 million on employee health and safety measures.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Moderna vaccine may protect for several years,"Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine may be effective for much longer than you think. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) CEO Stephane Bancel addressed the issue Thursday at an event organized by a financial services group. 
 “The nightmare scenario described in the media in the spring, if you recall, ‘Oh, the vaccine will not work more than a month or two,’ these nightmare scenarios, I think, are out the window. We believe there will be protection potentially for a couple of years.” 
But he said more data is still needed to make a definitive assessment. He said the immediate focus is on the vaccine’s effectiveness on seniors. 
 “The question I think is going to be around the elderly, because that is true for every virus, the immune system of the elderly goes down in terms of the ability over time.” 
 The length of protection was a lingering question for scientists and regulators given that Moderna is just one of the companies that worked at warp speed to turn out a coronavirus vaccine in just a few weeks. Normally, vaccines take years to develop. The European Commission approved Moderna’s vaccine on Wednesday. 
Bancel said Moderna was about to prove that its vaccine would also be effective against variants of the coronavirus seen in Britain and South Africa. 
Moderna shares, which have jumped six-fold over the last 12 months, rose in early trading Thursday. "

(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc said on Thursday it expects benefits from COVID-19 vaccinations to cushion the impact of pandemic-induced restrictions, and stuck to its full-year earnings growth forecast, sending its shares up 7%. 
The drugstore chain has taken a number of steps to bolster profit after the health crisis hammered sales and forced it to cut jobs, shut some UK-based Boots stores and sell its distribution unit to AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp for $6.5 billion.
Rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the United States through a voluntary program. 
Walgreens said it expects to see some benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations in the second half of fiscal 2021. 
""The administration of vaccinations to care homes is not a particularly profitable business,"" Chief Executive Officer Stephano Pessina said.
""That being said, the vaccines will be accretive to the profile in the second half of the year. And that's why... we did change the tone of our guidance."" 
Walgreens maintained fiscal 2021 forecast of low single-digit growth in adjusted EPS, after it beat analysts' estimates for adjusted first-quarter profit.
Same-store sales in Boots UK pharmacies rose 2.5% in the quarter, while Boots.com saw a 106% sales growth.
Walgreens expects significant growth in its UK business in the second half of the year from cost cuts. The company, however, cautioned that the lockdown in the UK could hurt its business.

""The big negative and the big question mark, and it's the reason why we basically maintain guidance is, we actually have a lockdown in the U.K. right now that runs through the middle of February,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said.

Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters to come to Washington for a rally on Wednesday.

Attempts to access TrumpStore.com and shop.donaldjtrump.com, which sold ""Make America Great Again"" hats and similar items, were unsuccessful on Thursday, as the websites displayed error messages.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>",Mercedes supersized display aims to outdo Tesla's hallmark touchscreen,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s unveiled a new display screen on Thursday that will cover almost the entire dashboard of its luxury Mercedes-Benz models, in a bid to outdo Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's hallmark touchscreen infotainment system.
In a video presentation, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Chief Executive Ola Kallenius said the new ""Hyperscreen"" - which at 56 inches (142.24 cm) in width dwarfs Tesla's vaunted 17-inch screen - will make its debut in the EQS later this year, Mercedes' new fully electric sedan.
The EQS, with a driving range of 700 kilometers (435 miles), will be the first in a family of four vehicles built on the same all-electric platform.
""There's huge customer demand for this screen,"" Kallenius told reporters on a conference call. He said the dashboard would be an optional feature in the EQS, ""but we expect a very high take-up rate,"" from buyers.
As well as including vehicle functions such as the speedometer, and music and navigation features, the screen will allow passengers to access some vehicle functions and, in some markets, to watch television without disturbing the driver.
Kallenius said besides revenue from the screens themselves, Daimler expects future profitable growth of subscription services, such as maps or entertainment customers will download.
""It is part of our business strategy to increase this profit pool of recurring revenues,"" he said. 
Tesla has dominated global electric vehicle sales and traditional carmakers like Daimler have been pushing to develop vehicles to compete for market share. 

The pressure to outdo Tesla has been heightened by tighter emissions standards in the European Union and China, and the decision by a growing number of countries to start banning sales of new petrol or diesel cars as early as 2030.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>","LVMH gives Tiffany a makeover, promotes Arnault scion after $16 billion deal","By Sarah White and Jessica DiNapoli
PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) -LVMH installed the son of company founder Bernard Arnault in a new leadership team at Tiffany on Thursday after the French luxury goods group concluded its $15.8 billion acquisition of the U.S. jeweller.
The conglomerate also picked two executives from its Louis Vuitton handbag brand to run Tiffany, and said it would overhaul the design team ahead of a makeover which analysts expect will focus on courting young shoppers and Asian customers. 
The official closing of the deal, meant to boost LVMH's standing in a segment it was less exposed to than fashion or spirits, follows a bitter legal dispute. LVMH backed away as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered luxury goods sales, but ultimately renegotiated a discounted purchase price.
Alexandre Arnault, one of four scions with roles at LVMH, who had already been stepping up his profile after previously running luggage label Rimowa, will be executive vice president at Tiffany, in charge of product and communication.
A fluent English speaker, the 28-year-old accompanied his father on a U.S. trip to meet outgoing President Donald Trump in 2017 shortly after his election. 
Under his tenure, Rimowa paired up with sportwear brand Supreme for a collaboration and made a big social media push, a formula luxury groups have favoured to draw younger clients. 
In his new role the young Arnault will work under two LVMH heavyweights, including Michael Burke, chairman and CEO at Vuitton - the group's biggest money spinner - who will now also chair Tiffany. 
Anthony Ledru, who ran Vuitton in the U.S. as well as the label's global commercial activities, will take over as CEO from Alessandro Bogliolo, who is set to leave on Jan. 22, LVMH said.
Ledru had a previous stint at Tiffany and has also worked for rival jeweller Cartier. 
""The idea of pairing experienced managers with up and coming family members (and possible future leaders) creates a fruitful environment,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note. 
According to court papers from the legal battle, Bogliolo's payout stemming from a change of control could top $44 million.
GROWTH TACTICS
Analysts expect that LVMH, home to brands including Fendi and Veuve Clicquot champagne, will review everything from Tiffany's network of stores to strategies in areas such as online sales as it repositions the brand and streamlines it. 
The conglomerate said artistic director Reed Krakoff was set to leave the company along with Chief Brand Officer Daniella Vitale. It did not name replacements. 
""We are optimistic about Tiffany's ability to accelerate its growth,"" LVMH's Bernard Arnault said in a statement. 
Tiffany's last quarterly earnings indicated the retailer had recovered from some of the impact of the pandemic, with a 70% rise in sales in China and an e-commerce sales surge of 92% in the quarter. 
LVMH will draw on its experience with jeweller Bulgari, acquired in 2011, where it has lifted margins and sales.
LVMH is unlikely to shy away from any moves to improve costs, although it also has the cash to invest heavily in marketing. It has praised Tiffany's branding - the robin-egg-blue used on its boxes for instance - as a big strength.

(Reuters) - Online lending startup Social Finance Inc (SoFi) is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with  Social Capital Hedosophia  Holdings Corp V, a blank-check acquisition company led by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
The deal would value SoFi at more than $6 billion and could be announced in the coming days, the sources said, cautioning that the talks could still collapse and the terms could be changed. 
The sources requested anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. SoFi and Social Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Units of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp V jumped as much as 47.9% following the report and later pared gains to trade up around 26% at $15.30 apiece at 11:01 a.m. eastern time. 
Social Capital Hedosophia V is one of three so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) backed by U.S. investor Palihapitiya and London-based Ian Osborne that are currently looking for acquisitions. 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result.
They have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised.
Palihapitiya has been one of the most prolific sponsors of SPACs, merging them with a range of companies, from space tourism firm Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc to home-selling platform Opendoor Technologies Inc. 
Social Capital Hedosophia V raised around $800 million in an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in October. 
Founded in 2011, San Francisco-based SoFi capitalized on the retrenchment of banks from large swaths of consumer lending in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. 
It started with refinancing student loans and expanded into mortgages and personal loans. The company said in October it had received preliminary, conditional approval from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in its application for a national bank charter. The company has also branched out into stock trading and cash management accounts.

Reuters reported in December that SoFi had held discussions with SPACs about a merger.

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened at fresh record highs after Congress's delayed certification of the presidential elections results was followed by a statement from Donald Trump agreeing to an orderly transition of power. 
The developments settled nerves after a mob of armed and violent Trump supporters stormed the government building on Capitol Hill on Wednesday attempting to overturn the election result. Investors have chosen to look through the shocking scenes - and another week of painfully high jobless claims numbers - and focus on the prospect of amped-up stimulus spending from a Congress that is now set to be united under Democratic Party control.  New York Senator Chuck Schumer, who is set to take over leadership of the chamber from Mitch McConnell, said late on Wednesday that one of the party's first priorities would be to raise the direct stimulus checks to households to $2,000 from the $600 currently foreseen.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 116 points, or 0.4%, at 30,946 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.4%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that the number of initial claims for jobless benefits stayed at the high level of 787,000 last week, a negligible decline from 790,000 the week before but still better than expectations. 
The most prominent moves included hydrogen fuel cell company  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock, which rose by over 29% after South Korean group SK Group said it will invest $1.5 billion into a new joint venture aimed at providing hydrogen fuel-cell systems, fueling stations and electrolyzers in South Korea and elsewhere. SK is acquiring its shares in Plug at a price of $29.29 a share. This morning's rise has propelled the stock price over $45.
Elsewhere, bank stocks were again in vogue as the anticipation of higher borrowing and bigger stimulus drove bond yields higher, widening the margins that banks can earn on their lending (and arguably reducing the risk of a big new wave of bad loans). Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock hit an all-time high and PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC) hit a 52-week high, both gaining 2.9%. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock also posted notable gains of 4.3% after long-term bear Royal Bank of Canada repented of its skepticism and raised its price target significantly. 
On the downside,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs extended Wednesday's losses, which were triggered by a report that the U.S. government may add it and rival Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) to the blacklist of companies in which U.S. entities may not invest. Alibaba was down 2.1%, while Tencent ADRs lost 1.6%."

(Reuters) - Burger King has redesigned its brand including its logo, food packaging and restaurants in order to reflect improvements such as eliminating preservatives, the fast food chain announced on Thursday.
""We've been doing a lot in terms of food quality and experience,"" said Fernando Machado, global chief marketing officer of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King. ""We felt that putting a wrap around all that with an upgrade of our visual identity would help signal to our consumers that this is a brand that's evolving.""
The rebranding, Burger King's first in over 20 years, includes a new logo with a rounded font that mirrors the shape of its burgers and other menu items.
Bold colors in shades of brown, red and green are a nod to Burger King's flame grilling process and its use of fresh ingredients, the company said.
Burger King earlier this year announced it would remove all artificial colors and preservatives from its signature Whopper burgers as fast food chains are increasingly introducing healthier options to follow consumer tastes.
The company's famously quirky plastic-faced mascot - The King - won't be going anywhere despite the rebranding.
""We love him the way he is, and he will continue to be weird,"" Machado said.

Shares of the Chicago-based company rose 2% in premarket trading after Conagra also posted a 45% rise in second-quarter earnings.
With a surge in cases in the United States and signs of more pandemic-related curbs, shoppers have been restocking pantries in preparation for potential lockdowns, prompting retailers to place more orders for Conagra's packaged foods with long shelf lives.
That has led to a surge in demand for products including, Birds Eye frozen vegetables and Duncan Hines cake mixes, driving a 12.5% rise in sales at Conagra's grocery and snacks business and a 6.8% rise in its refrigerated and frozen unit.
Conagra said it continued to see a ""sustained increase"" in demand from its retail customers so far into the third quarter. It expects adjusted earnings between 56 and 60 cents per share for the period, compared with analysts' estimates of 57 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Organic sales are expected to rise in the 6% to 8% range, with adjusted operating margins seen between 16% and 16.5%.
For the second quarter ended Nov. 29, adjusted operating margins were 19.6%, mainly due to costs savings from supply chain streamlining. 
Overall, net profit attributable to Conagra was $378.9 million, or 77 cents per share. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 81 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 73 cents per share.

Sales rose 6.2% to nearly $3 billion, in line with expectations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kentucky Fried Chicken will switch to a new chicken sandwich nationally by the end of February, it said on Thursday, amid a fast food frenzy to win a share of the growing chicken market.
The company, owned by Yum Brands Inc, said its existing Crispy Colonel Sandwich was not ""living up to our legacy as experts in fried chicken"" so it will eventually be pulled off menus in favor of the KFC Chicken Sandwich.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) on Monday confirmed that it will launch three new versions of a crispy chicken sandwich late next month.
With burger chains entering the fray, even poultry purveyors are revamping their menus. 
In 2019, a social media-fueled feud over similar sandwiches between Chick-fil-A and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc's Popeyes sparked a rise in chicken sales across the industry and spurred other restaurants to announce competing menu items.
KFC's new sandwich will contain a quarter pound of white meat fillet - 25% larger than in its existing sandwich - that is double-breaded, fried and served on a new buttered brioche bun with thicker crinkle-cut pickles. It includes mayonnaise or spicy sauce.
The restaurant chain will roll out the new sandwiches beginning on Thursday in Chicago, Kansas City, Louisville, Portland, St. Louis, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle and Tulsa, expanding to all 4,000 U.S. locations by the end of February, it said in a statement. 
KFC's new sandwich will cost $3.99, in line with those from competitors.

KFC tested the new item in Orlando in 2020 and ""nearly doubled our sales expectations,"" KFC U.S.'s chief marketing officer, Andrea Zahumensky, said in a statement.

“There is no graceful way to put this other than to say we got TSLA’s stock completely wrong,” analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a report lifting Tesla to sector perform. The broker had maintained a sell-equivalent underperform rating since January 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. During that time, the shares have surged by about 1,200%.
Reevaluating his view “in the spirit of New Year’s resolutions,” Spak said his biggest miss was underestimating Palo Alto, California-based Tesla’s ability to take advantage of its stock price to raise capital and fund growth or acquisitions. He also increased his 2025 delivery estimate to 1.7 million autos from 1.3 million, based on capacity and market share assumptions, and his price target for the stock to $700 from $339.
RBC’s comments follow a 50% price-target boost on Tesla earlier this week by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas to a Street-high $810, after the carmaker posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter deliveries and a $5 billion capital increase. In November, the broker gave the stock an overweight rating for the first time since 2017.
Tesla shares were up 3.1% to $779 a share in premarket trading as of 6:05 a.m. in New York. Electric-vehicle peers also rose as Joe Biden’s formal recognition by Congress as the next U.S. president was seen as a positive for the industry. Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc. and Nikola Corp. gained 3.6% and 2.2%, respectively.
Among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, Tesla now has 13 buy recommendations, 13 holds and 14 sells.

The armed attack on the seat of government -- unprecedented in modern history -- is leaving nary a dent in most assets, underscoring both conviction in reflation trades after the Georgia runoff and the privileged position of the U.S. in global finance.
As hundreds stormed the Capitol building Wednesday amid smoke bombs, forcing legislators to cower for safety, the S&P 500 moderated from the highs. Even still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record and Russell 2000 Index surged almost 4% for the day.
Joe Biden was formally recognized by Congress as the next U.S. president early Thursday, while President Donald Trump pledged “an orderly transition.”
In Thursday trading, U.S. equity futures advanced, Asia-Pacific shares headed for an all-time high, while emerging-market currencies hovered near their strongest level on record.
“It’s disappointing to witness such behavior on Capitol Hill -- in fact, it’s an embarrassment,” said Gregory Perdon, the co-chief investment officer at Arbuthnot Latham in London. “But equities are just doing what they do best: Looking past a few more weeks of noise.”
Insurrection Day Was Easier for Markets Than Us: John Authers
For money managers, the Georgia election carried greater significance than the mobs in the Capitol Building, where order was ultimately restored. With the prospect of Democrat control of the Senate, more expansive economic policies are coming, according to Julian Rimmer, a trader at Investec Bank Plc in London. That could sustain a weaker U.S. dollar, supporting riskier assets around the world, he said.
The iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which is heavily traded by retail investors, took in $1.4 billion on Wednesday, the most in nearly two months. The  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust  (ASX:SPY), or SPY, added $2.4 billion. Investors also plowed money into financial shares, adding $1.6 billion to the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLF), the most since 2016.
“Markets look ahead, beyond what we see now, which is chaos and pandemic,” said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. “In the short-term, the Fed will keep rates low and QE to help the recovery and we’ll likely get more stimulus and certainty, not to mention vaccine distribution.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, continuing record highs with investors positioning for increased fiscal spending following the Democrats claiming control of the Senate after the Georgia runoff elections.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 66 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 13 points, or 0.4%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 97 points, or 0.8%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4%, or 437 points, higher on Wednesday, a record high, and the S&P 500 ended up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.6%. 
Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are now projected to win the runoffs for Georgia's two seats in the Senate, meaning that their party will now have control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, in addition to the White House.
This will make it easier for President-elect Joe Biden to enact his policies, likely resulting in more fiscal largesse, particularly after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that increasing stimulus checks to $2,000 would be one of the first legislative proposals.
Earlier Thursday, Congress reconvened and formally confirmed the election of Joe Biden as the next President, after Wednesday’s dramatic scenes with pro-Trump supporters storming Capitol Hill and forcing lawmakers to seek shelter. 
President Donald Trump finally tried to tone down the inflamed situation, saying early Thursday he was willing to allow an “orderly transition” of power.
The key economic data release Thursday will be the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), ahead of Friday’s crucial nonfarm payrolls report. ADP private payrolls in December declined 123,000, evidence of a significant slowdown in the economy.
Balance of trade data for November are also due later Thursday, along with the December ISM non-manufacturing figures. 
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) report quarterly earnings before the bell on Thursday, while chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) reports after the bell.
Oil prices traded mixed, but still at relatively elevated levels after a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles added to the bullish tone created by Saudi Arabia’s pledge earlier this week to cut output by one million barrels per day in February and March.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $50.80 a barrel, moving decisively above the $50 level for the first time since February, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $54.24.

In a report to clients late Wednesday, the economists led by Jan Hatzius predicted the economy would expand 6.4% this year, faster than the 5.9% they previously expected.
The upgrade was driven by the anticipation President Joe Biden will now be able to deliver a fiscal stimulus package of $750 billion this quarter, $300 billion of which will be in the form of checks to households. The economists cautioned the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations may still slow the spending boost.
The revision means the Goldman economists now reckon unemployment will reach 4.8% by the end of this year and 3.6% by the end of 2024. They said faster inflation will also allow the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in the second half of 2024, earlier than the previous forecast of early 2025.

948,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>","StockBeat: On Late-Stage Bubbles, and How to Survive Them","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Fund managers’ letters to investors can be tedious affairs, but sometimes there comes one so brilliant that all you can do is to reproduce it as exactly as possible.
The latest from GMO founder Jeremy Grantham is one such example. You can find the full version here, but for those who don’t have the time to read it, the main points are as follows
The long bull market since 2009 has matured into a ""fully-fledged epic bubble"", and is generating almost all of the most reliable signs that this bubble is in its late stage.
These signs include behavior, especially by small investors, that Grantham characterizes as “crazy”. He notes that 150 micro caps have tripled over the last year, “which is over three times as many as any year in the previous decade.” Additionally, he notes, “the volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.”
There have been increasingly frequent signs of mania with regard to single stocks: he highlights Hertz (OTC:HTZGQ), Kodak (NYSE:KODK), Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) “and, especially, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),” whose valuation now equates to $1.25 million per car sold each year, compared to $9,000 for General Motors (NYSE:GM).
“What has 1929 got to equal that?” Grantham asks.
The other tell-tale sign of a late-stage bubble all the way back to the 18th century, is the acceleration of gains. In recent times, he notes, that has been around 60% in the final 21 months before the peak. In the current rally, the major indices have done all of that and more in just nine months.
Sadly, there is just no way of timing the top. Bubbles typically don’t burst in response to single negative events. A veteran of over four decades, Grantham freely admits getting out of the Japanese stock bubble almost three years too early in the 1980s.
“The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday,” he argues. “And that is why they are always missed.”
However, he points to one telling, if anecdotal factor, common to bubbles, namely the “intensity and enthusiasm of bulls” and the “rising hostility toward bears.” He cites 1999, when his clients acted “as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains”.
The above factors make it impossible for most sell-side analysts to go against the consensus. Here, we just have to quote Grantham at length.
So what is to be done? If you can’t time the end of the bubble, then at least concentrate exposure where things are relatively cheap, Grantham argues. Value stocks have had their worst-ever relative decade ending December 2019, followed by the worst-ever year in 2020. Likewise, emerging market stocks are at one of their three “more or less co-equal relative lows” against U.S. equities over the last 50 years.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>","U.S. considering adding Alibaba, Tencent to China investment ban -sources","By Alexandra Alper, Andrea Shalal and Josh Horwitz
WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The Trump administration is considering adding tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent to a blacklist of firms allegedly owned or controlled by the Chinese military, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Targeting Asia's two most valuable companies would be U.S. President Donald Trump's most dramatic step yet in a recent raft of measures unleashed against Chinese companies as he seeks to cement his hardline policy against Beijing during his final days in office.
Defense Department officials, who oversee the blacklist designations, have not yet finalized plans and are also discussing adding other Chinese firms to the list, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.
Both companies declined to comment. The discussions were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. 
Shares in Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce firm, finished down 3.9% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange while Tencent, a gaming and social media behemoth, lost 4.7%. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares closed down just over 5% on the news on Wednesday.
Some investors expressed skepticism, however, that Alibaba and Tencent would face long-term restrictions - given that they are worth a combined $1.3 trillion, widely held by U.S. investors and the likely reputational and financial hit to U.S. stock markets.
""It's a very bad policy and there's enough money in Asia, lots and getting bigger, that one shouldn't force these companies out of America,"" said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Investment Management in Toronto and an investor in the New York Stock Exchange. ""Money and markets should be neutral."" 
Trump escalated measures against Chinese firms in November with an executive order that bans U.S. investors from buying shares of Chinese firms. 
On Tuesday, he ordered a ban on transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Group's Alipay mobile payment app and Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay.
The November executive order sought to give teeth to a 1999 law that tasked the Defense Department with drafting a list of Chinese companies deemed to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military. 
The Pentagon has so far blacklisted 35 firms, including China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO). 
While release of the November directive prompted index providers like MSCI to begin deleting blacklisted companies from their indexes, confusion about the scope of the rules has prompted some dramatic flip-flops by the New York Stock Exchange in recent days. 
The NYSE originally on Dec. 31 announced plans to delist China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. On Monday, it did a U-turn after consulting with regulators in connection with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and decided to keep them listed. On Wednesday it said it will return to the original plan.
S&P Dow Jones Indices have followed the NYSE and said late on Wednesday it will remove the American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of the three telecom companies.
In response to news of the potential Alibaba and Tencent blacklisting and the NYSE's decision to delist the telecom firms, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Thursday that China would take action to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its companies.
CROSSHAIRS 
The Trump administration has had both Tencent and Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group in its crosshairs for some time. 
In August, Trump signed an executive order to ban some U.S. transactions with Tencent's WeChat. But the restrictions were blocked by courts mainly on freedom of speech grounds.
Reuters reported in November that the U.S. State Department had submitted a proposal to add Ant Group to another trade blacklist to deter U.S. investors from taking part in its now-aborted initial public offering. But the Commerce Department, which oversees the blacklist, shelved the proposal after Alibaba President Michael Evans urged Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to reject the proposal.
Ant Group's $37 billion IPO was halted after co-founder Jack Ma publicly criticized China's regulatory system in October, setting off a concerted regulatory crackdown in the country on Alibaba and Ant.
Alibaba's market value has shrunk by more than a quarter since November after the Ant Group IPO failed. But valued at more than $600 billion, it is still among the biggest 10 companies globally.

The damage, tallied by the German reinsurer Munich Re, increased from $166 billion in the previous year, and comes as a warming planet heightens risks.
Losses that were insured rose to $82 billion from $57 billion in 2019, Munich Re said. They add to the burden of the coronavirus pandemic that has hit the insurance industry hard. 
""Climate change will play an increasing role in all of these hazards,"" said Munich Re board member Torsten Jeworrek, pointing to hurricanes, wildfires and other storms. 
""It is time to act,"" he said.
The hurricane season was ""hyperactive"", with a record 30 storms, surpassing 2005's 28 storms, Munich Re said.
Heat waves and droughts are fuelling wildfires, with $16 billion in damage last year in the U.S. West.
Floods in China were the most costly individual loss at $17 billion, but only 2% of the damage was insured.

The U.S. biotech company, which stunned the world last year by coming up with a vaccine against the disease caused by the new coronavirus in just a few weeks, received approval for its shot from the European Commission on Wednesday.
Given vaccines development and pharmacovigilance usually requires years, the protection duration of COVID-19 shots is a lingering question for scientists and regulators.
""The nightmare scenario that was described in the media in the spring with a vaccine only working a month or two is, I think, out of the window,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said at an event organised by financial services group Oddo BHF.
""The antibody decay generated by the vaccine in humans goes down very slowly (...) We believe there will be protection potentially for a couple of years.""
Bancel added his company was about to prove that its vaccine would also be effective against variants of the coronavirus seen in Britain and South Africa.
Scientists have said newly developed vaccines should be equally effective against both variants.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Portugal confident it will get EU green light for TAP rescue plan in first quarter,"By Sergio Goncalves and Ingrid Melander
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal is confident the European Commission will approve its plan to rescue ailing flag carrier TAP, Finance Minister Joao Leao said in an interview, adding that he expected that green light by the end of March.
The government unveiled its overhaul plan last month, proposing 2,000 job cuts by 2022 and pay cuts of up to 25%, while saying the airline would need around 2 billion euros ($2.46 billion) in extra funds with state guarantees to cover financing needs until 2024.
The stakes are high: if the EU executive rejects Lisbon's proposal, TAP would have to immediately repay a 1.2 billion euro rescue loan agreed in June, which could lead to its insolvency.
Leao told Reuters that, as part of the rescue plan, the government envisaged converting that loan to equity, which could raise the government's stake in the airline to about 90%. The government was not contemplating asking private bond holders to take a haircut on payments to ensure TAP's financial viability, but had not yet ruled it out either.
""The main concern of the plan is that to make the firm sustainable,"" Leao told Reuters.
Formal negotiations with the European Commission formally started this month, he said, adding: ""We expect in the first quarter to have the plan approved."" 
""We are proposing that a big part of this (1.2 billion euro) loan is converted from loans to equity, so that the financial indicators of the firm improve,"" Leao said.
The Portuguese government currently has a 72.5% stake in the company. Leao said ""one possibility"" was to turn the whole loan into equity, which he estimated could boost that stake to around 90%. 
He stressed that ""the support measures by the government are limited in time,"" adding that the aim was that TAP would eventually return to financing itself on the markets.
""It is important for the firm to live by itself ... so that as soon as possible, if possible starting next year or later on, the firm can stop having to be financed by the state.""
Asked if the ailing carrier should aim to do so on a standlone basis or strike an alliance with another air carrier, he said: ""it might be interesting to have another player to also help TAP to make sure the firm becomes competitive and profitable.""
TAP reported losses of more than 700 million euros for the first nine months of 2020.
Asked if there could be a haircut on the 725 million euros of debt held by TAP's bondholders, he responded: ""so far, is not in the plan, but that is a discussion we need to have with the European Commission to make sure that all stakeholders are involved"".

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bonds licked their wounds and stocks rose on Thursday as investors bet Democrat control of the U.S. Congress would enable President-elect Joe Biden to borrow and spend heavily, with a bruised dollar hovering near its lowest in almost three years.
U.S. Treasuries extended their steepest selloff in months after Democrat victories in two Georgia races handed them narrow control of the Senate, bolstering President-elect Joe Biden's power to pass his agenda. 
Europe's Euro STOXX 600 gained 0.3%, with indexes in Frankfurt and Paris up 0.4% and 0.6% respectively. Growth-linked sectors from energy to miners rallied on the prospects of more U.S. stimulus. 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in almost 50 countries, rose 0.3%. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6% and Japan's Nikkei hit its highest since 1990. 
Even after risk sentiment was earlier knocked by images of President Donald Trump's supporters storming Capitol Hill to attempt to overturn his election defeat, S&P 500 futures rose 0.6% as order was restored and Congress returned to work. 
It quickly became clear that objections from pro-Trump Republican lawmakers to Biden's victory in battleground states would be rejected overwhelmingly, including by most Republicans. 
""For stocks it will be a net positive, for other assets classes it will be different,"" said Olivier Marciot, a portfolio manager at Unigestion said of the Democrat victory. 
""The bond moves yesterday were something we hadn't seen for a long time. The case is for reflation."" 
Wednesday's bond selloff pushed the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which rises when prices fall, over 1% for the first time since March. It rose as high as 1.0660% on Thursday. [US/]
Euro zone government bond yields also edged higher, with Germany's 10-year Bund yield up slightly to -0.55%. Japanese government bond prices had also slipped, taking cues from the U.S.
BRUISED DOLLAR 
The ramifications of the Democrat victory played out in currency markets, too. 
The dollar had sunk on the Georgia results to a near-three year low against a basket of six major currencies, with traders betting growing U.S. trade and budget deficits would weigh on the greenback. On Thursday it bounced 0.3% to 89.529. 
Against the euro it hovered near an almost three-year low of $1.2349, and also languished near recent multi-year troughs against the Aussie, kiwi and Swiss franc.
Still, some analysts said rising bond yields may help the dollar's fortunes. 
""Higher Treasury yields should benefit the dollar against the euro and the yen,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. 
""However, the dollar will remain weaker against commodity currencies like the Aussie and emerging market currencies."" 
Other risk-on assets climbed. 
Copper, a barometer for global growth, gained 0.3% to hover near an 8-year high. 
In Asia, miners Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and BHP earlier surged to all-time peaks, while chipmakers Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix drove South Korean stocks to a record high. 
Oil prices held around a 10-month high, basking in the afterglow of a production cut promised by Saudi Arabia. Brent crude futures were last up 0.7% to $54.68 a barrel.

Gold was steady at $1,921 an ounce, and bitcoin firm after hitting a fresh record high of $37,800. The cryptocurrency has soared over a quarter already this month after almost quadrupling last year.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely higher Thursday, with a strikingly broad range of stocks hitting all-time highs as investors looking for additional fiscal spending following a projected win for Democrats in the U.S. Senate.
At 4:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index dropped 0.3%.  All-time highs were posted by companies in both growth and cyclical sectors, from Germany's Zalando (DE:ZALG) and Delivery Hero (DE:DHER) to miners such as Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO)  and energy companies Neste Oil  (HE:NESTE),  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Solaria (MC:SLRS).
The Democrat pair of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are projected to have won the two Senate seats in Georgia, raising expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will have an easier path to push his agenda, including more stimulus measures, when his administration takes over in a couple of weeks.
This optimism appears to be undimmed by violent scenes in Washington on Wednesday, as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Biden’s victory in November’s presidential election.
Congress early Thursday confirmed the election of Biden as president, paving the way for him to be swore in on Jan. 20.
Back in Europe, the Covid-19 pandemic remains a key concern, with a number of countries forced back into lockdown as new cases continued to mount. However, the European Medicines Agency approved Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, adding to options as authorities throughout the region try to organise large-scale vaccination programs.
In corporate news, LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY) stock rose 0.8% after the world’s biggest cement maker said Thursday it plans to buy Firestone Building Products from Bridgestone Americas for $3.4 billion.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock fell 2.4% after the low-cost airline slashed its annual traffic forecast to below 30 million passengers due to fresh lockdowns in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
German factory orders surprised to the upside, climbing 2.3% on the month in November when a drop of 1.2% had been expected, while euro-zone flash inflation figures and retail sales are due for release later Thursday.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, with a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles adding to the bullish tone created by Saudi Arabia’s pledge earlier this week to cut output by one million barrels per day in February and March, once the chaos in Washington dissolved.
Crude inventories were down by 8 million barrels in the week to Jan. 1 to 485.5 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. This was much more than expected, and followed the American Petroleum Institute reporting a draw of 1.663 million barrels on Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $51.09 a barrel, moving decisively above the $50 level for the first time since February, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $54.64. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,921.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% lower at 1.2282.

ZURICH (Reuters) -LafargeHolcim, the world's biggest cement maker, on Thursday announced $3.4 billion deal to buy Firestone Building Products from Japan's Bridgestone Corporation in its biggest acquisition in more than a decade.
The purchase of the roofing products business is the biggest under CEO Jan Jenisch, who since taking over in 2017 has focussed on paying down debts, quitting less profitable markets and smaller bolt-on deals.
It will help LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY) tap increasing demand for roofs that generate solar energy and cool buildings, with cities such as San Francisco requiring solar panels on new buildings.
Jenisch said his company's focus was now on growth, with plans to roll out Firestone Building Products beyond the United States where it currently generates nearly 90% of its $1.8 billion in annual sales.
""We said we wanted to have a fourth leg for our company - building solutions and products - for this we need a bigger acquisition,"" Jenisch told reporters.
""We needed a platform which had technologies and an innovative product range to kick start this fourth segment and this is exactly what this Firestone business is offering to us.""
The Nashville, Tennessee-based business generated an operating profit of $238 million in 2020. 
LafargeHolcim said it expects the deal to be earnings accretive from its first year, with mid-single digit percentage organic sales growth.
Jenisch said there was scope for rapid growth in the $50 billion global market for flat roofs, which he expects to reach $65 billion by 2027, noting increasing demand for roofs that generate solar power and increasing urbanisation.
""We want to become the market leader in flat roofing systems. We are currently number four in this fragmented market,"" Jenisch said. 
""We will be significantly increasing the business, we have a lot of opportunities in the core market of the U.S. and then we will expand rapidly into Latin America and also accelerate our business in Europe.""
The deal was also a sign of confidence in the construction industry, which was battered early last year but which has since recovered, he added.
""No one thought back in April and May when we were all in the coronavirus shock and sales dropped, we couldn't see the amazing recovery especially in construction and for LafargeHolcim.
""We couldn't imagine making such a deal, but we made it. Now it is time for us to consolidate this and also to start the growth plans in the U.S. and also outside.""

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Thursday, with investors looking for additional fiscal spending following a projected win for Democrats in the U.S. Senate even after amid tumultuous scenes in Washington DC.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%.
The Democrat pair of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are projected to have won the two Senate seats in Georgia, unseating their Republican rivals David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. 
Democrats are now set to have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, raising expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will have an easier path to push his agenda, including more stimulus measures, when his administration takes over in a couple of weeks.
This optimism appears to be undimmed by violent scenes in Washington on Wednesday, as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Biden’s victory in November’s presidential election. Biden called the riot an ""insurrection"". while Trump refused to disavow the violence.
Back in Europe, the Covid-19 pandemic remains a key concern, with a number of countries forced back into lockdown as new cases continued to mount. The U.K. reported more than 60,000 new daily cases on Wednesday for the first time since the pandemic started.
The European Medicines Agency approved Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, which is expected to result in the distribution of the drug around the region shortly.
Turning to economic data, German factory orders surprised to the upside, climbing 2.3% on the month in November when a drop of 1.2% had been expected, while euro-zone flash inflation figures and retail sales are due for release later Thursday.
In corporate news, LafargeHolcim (OTC:HCMLY) will be in focus after the world’s biggest cement maker said Thursday it plans to buy Firestone Building Products from Bridgestone Americas for $3.4 billion.
Oil prices pushed higher Thursday, with a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles adding to the bullish tone created by Saudi Arabia’s pledge earlier this week to cut output by one million barrels per day in February and March, once the chaos in Washington dissolved.
Crude inventories were down by 8 million barrels in the week to Jan. 1 to 485.5 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. This was much more than expected, and followed the American Petroleum Institute reporting a draw of 1.663 million barrels on Tuesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $51.16 a barrel, moving decisively above the $50 level for the first time since February, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.9% to $54.81. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,925.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2319.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - European companies are expected to hunt for assets in China, mainly in insurance, healthcare and automobile sectors, after the world's second-largest economy and the European Union agreed to an investment deal last month, lawyers and bankers say.
The agreement, which took nearly seven years to reach and commits to more liberalisation of China's market will likely take another year to enter into force. It is not clear if the deal grants more leeway on mergers and acquisitions.
However, bankers believe China inbound dealflow, which for decades has remained small compared with its economic size and market potential due to barriers to entry for foreign capital, will pick up in time.
""The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) will certainly facilitate the FDI, including M&A, by EU investors into China,"" said Cherrie Shi, a senior counsel at law firm FenXun Partners, Baker McKenzie's Joint Operation partner.
The deal would provide EU investors with ""more certainty and predictability"" for their investment, Shi said.
Total M&A value of EU companies into China amounted to $71 billion for the past three decades, much lower than the $117 billion recorded over the same period from American companies, data from Refinitiv showed.
The deal agreed on Dec. 30 lets European firms operate in China in electric cars, telecom cloud services and certain activities linked to air and maritime transport.
They will also be allowed to fully own units in the automotive sector, many financial services, private hospitals, advertising, real estate and environmental services, such as sewage.
""These are the major growth areas with massive amounts of investments. EU companies are pretty keen to get a piece of the action,"" said Alan Wang, Partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. 
China's economic recovery, in contrast to most major economies reeling from measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, will make its market, particularly healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, more attractive to EU investors, Wang said. 
IMPLEMENTATION KEY
European companies are already stepping up the ante in auto and financial services, which China had opened up prior to the deal. Carmakers BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) have moved to take control of their China joint ventures, Reuters has reported.  
Insurers such as AXA and Allianz (DE:ALVG) have also gained approval for full ownership of their China units. Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, last year launched a wealth management venture in Shanghai. More are expected to follow suit.
Gaining full ownership of their businesses will make it easier for the companies to acquire and integrate local peers. 
""An increasing number of international buyers, primarily from Europe, are lining up to break into China,"" said Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS.
Lawyers, however, cautioned no companies will rush investment decisions with details of the agreement yet to be finalised.
China will ban the forced transfer of technology from foreign companies and bar state-owned enterprises from discriminating against foreign investors, but red tape and other issues could still pose challenges.

""The big question really comes down to implementation,"" said Freshfields' Wang. ""In practice, what are the practical local barriers you might still face from a regulatory process that is something difficult to foresee.""

Cross-border investors sold a combined total of $49 billion in Indonesian, Philippine, South Korean, Taiwanese, Thai and Vietnamese stocks last year, stock exchange data showed.

However, the trend has changed since the fourth quarter of last year, due to a weakening dollar and a recovery in EM earnings, he said.
On the other hand, Indian equities lured $23 billion worth of inflows last year, helped by a flood of money arriving in the fourth quarter.
Zhikai Chen, head of Asia Equities at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, said a growth recovery in the fourth quarter and implementation of key long-term policy reforms such as Production Linked Incentive schemes, labor code and agricultural reforms led to substantial inflows into Indian equities.
India still has the second-highest number of coronavirus infections in the world. However, the number of active cases have reduced sharply over the past few months, prompting the country's economy to be back in full swing.
Asian equity markets have lured inflows of $26.8 billion in the fourth quarter of the year, the highest since March 2012, the exchange data showed. 
""Some macro, top-down investors would position on emerging equities as an asset class. When it happens, these are Korea, Taiwan, along with China which benefit most because of their weighting in emerging equities benchmarks,"" said Societe Generale's Benzimra.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When you sit down at the end of the day with a glass of Johnnie Walker or Captain Morgan, you probably do not think much about all the water that goes into that glass.
But Perry Jones does.
As head of the North American supply chain for beverage behemoth  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc - which produces not only the above brands, but everything from Tanqueray gin to Don Julio tequila to Guinness beer - the buck stops with Jones.
So from the water used in producing raw materials, to the water in the finished product, to the wastewater produced along the way, Jones is constantly thinking about how to source it, how to treat it, and how to use less of it.
It is a pressing issue on a global scale: Climate change, droughts, population growth and pollution are all squeezing supply. As a result, 2 billion people live in nations that are facing water stress, according to the United Nations.
Reuters sat down with Jones to peek into the future of a most precious global resource. Edited excerpts are below. 
Q: You are rethinking your relationship to water, so what targets have you set?
A: We have set our 2030 goals, which represent our 10-year ambition for a more inclusive and sustainable world. 
We are focusing on three areas: One is promoting responsible drinking, the second is championing inclusion and diversity, and the third is devoted to grain-to-glass sustainability. That means things like water preservation, replenishing sources, carbon neutrality, wastewater treatment, sustainable packaging, and supporting small farmers.
Q: What does this mean in terms of water usage?
A: We have already made a lot of progress, but from this point forward we are calling for another 30% reduction in our water usage by 2030. We want to leave Earth in a better place than we found it, so at a minimum we want to replenish what we are taking.
Q: How exactly do you replenish water sources?
A: There are a few different ways you can look at it. One is the planting of trees, which reduces runoff and helps get water back into aquifers. 
Another is to improve water quality and access to clean drinking water – in India, for example, we set up community water purification plants with chillers and water ATMs in villages in the Nagpur district. Other projects cover rainwater harvesting, wetland restoration and desilting dams.
Q: How do your water targets filter down to the factory level – or how do suggestions filter up?
A: We have a management process where we review what our actual water usage is, versus what our theoretical usage should be, every day across the globe. So water issues or concerns or suggestions get elevated up to the manager level, then to site directors, then to VPs, then to the C-Suite level. 
We have metering that tells us what came in the door, how it was deployed, and how much went out in the product. That helps us identify any losses, so we can correct them.
Q: How is technology helping with these goals?
A: You want to get water usage to the optimum level the equipment is designed for, and where the systems are outdated and you can’t meet your water targets, you want to upgrade to new technology. 
For example, in our Plainfield, Illinois, plant, we saw a 40% reduction in water usage. And in one of our Canadian plants, we reduced our water loss by 50%.
Q: People are worried about water supplies, so has this issue become front-and-center in recent years?
A: It has always been a center of discussion, but what I am seeing is a broader collaboration across the beverage industry, as we support each other on this journey. We may be competitors when we go to market, but when it comes to sustainability we look at everyone as a partner. 
We share technology and learning, because we don’t operate in a vacuum. This is a much bigger issue than just our company.
Q: When you are having a drink, do you think about all this stuff?

A: I’m a vodka drinker, so I usually drink Smirnoff. I think about everything that went into that glass, and I’m proud of it.

The comments from the world's biggest asset manager come after Top Glove saw an extensive coronavirus outbreak among its workers late last year. More than 5,000 foreign workers were infected and one died in what became Malaysia's biggest cluster.
Reuters reported last month that Top Glove fired a whistleblower who raised concern about the firm's lack of COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Workers have also told Reuters that they lived in crowded dormitories.
BlackRock cited workers' accounts of working and living conditions, the firing of the whistleblower and the virus cluster at Top Glove in its criticism of the board. It also voted against re-electing six board members at Top Glove's annual general meeting on Wednesday.
""We view the board's ineffectiveness in COVID-19 mitigation and inadequate oversight of worker health and safety issues as especially egregious with potentially serious implications for its reputation as a supplier of such equipment to hospitals around the world,"" BlackRock said in a statement late on Wednesday.
Top Glove did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has acknowledged that much more needs to be done to raise the standard of employee welfare and has promised to rectify shortcomings quickly. 
A BlackRock unit, BlackRock Institutional Trust Co, is the tenth biggest shareholder in Top Glove, holding 1.07% of its shares.
The U.S. firm said it intended to hold other incumbent directors accountable by voting against their re-election at future meetings.
An influential Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), also voted against their re-election, according to voting records published by NBIM on its website.
The fund, which owns 0.84% of Top Glove shares, declined to comment on worker safety concerns. 
The board members were re-elected despite the objections.
BlackRock's comments were the first public criticism of Top Glove from an investor since the virus outbreak among workers.
The company posted record profits last year as demand for its gloves soared due to the pandemic. Its share price more than tripled in 2020.
In July, the United States banned two units of Top Glove over forced labour allegations. Malaysian authorities plan to charge the company over poor worker accommodation. 
BlackRock said the living conditions described by the workers, U.S. and Malaysian authorities were in ""stark contrast"" to what the board conveyed to shareholders.

Top Glove's factories, some of which were closed due to the virus outbreak, reopened last month.

The companies are forming a joint venture to provide hydrogen fuel-cell systems, fueling stations and electrolyzers in South Korea and elsewhere, SK and Plug said in a statement Wednesday.
The move comes as companies and governments around the globe push to use hydrogen in power plants, vehicles and elsewhere in place of fossil fuels. While most hydrogen is produced from natural gas, it can be generated from water through electrolysis powered by renewable energy. When burned, it produces no greenhouse gases.
South Korea has aggressively pursued fuel cells and hydrogen, making it a prime focus for U.S. fuel cell companies. Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) Corp. recently signed a deal with SK Engineering & Construction to deploy 28 megawatts of fuel cells in the country.
Plug Power, based in Latham, New York, has spent more than 20 years losing money as it pushes to find profitable applications for hydrogen fuel cells. It’s best known for offering fuel cells that run forklifts and other freight-handling gear. But it’s also expanded into stationary fuel cells to run data centers and mobile ones for delivery vans.
The company’s stock has soared in recent months as investors sought ways to bet on the emergence of a hydrogen economy. Although it had been making fuel cells for more than a decade, last year it expanded into hydrogen production and distribution through a pair of acquisitions.
SK Group is acquiring about 51.4 million shares of Plug for $29.29 apiece. The shares closed Wednesday at $35.
SK Innovation, the energy and chemicals unit of SK Group, is currently building two electric car vehicle battery plants in Georgia, with initial operations at the first facility scheduled to begin this year.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 11:00PM ET</span>",NYSE to delist three Chinese telecoms in dizzying about-face,"By John McCrank and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -The New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it will delist three Chinese telecom companies, confirming its latest U-turn on the matter a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the NYSE chief he disagreed with an earlier decision to reverse the delistings.
The latest move, which is effective Jan. 11, marks the third time in less than a week the Big Board has ruled on the issue. 
The flip-flopping highlights the confusion over which firms were included in an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in November barring U.S. persons from investing in publicly traded companies Washington deems to be tied to the Chinese military.
It also comes amid escalating tensions within Washington on China policy in the final days of the Trump administration.
""There is a unique situation where there is an outgoing administration that is disengaged and (there are) orders sitting out there, so something has to be done, but no one wants to take on responsibility,"" said Leland Miller, the CEO of the U.S.-based consultancy China Beige Book.
""I think in future that anyone getting these orders will say: 'Tell us exactly what you want us to do,' and force administrations to be more focused."" 
The NYSE originally on Thursday announced plans to delist China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. On Monday, it did a U-turn after consulting with regulators in connection with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and decided to keep them listed. Wednesday's decision marks a return to the original plan. 
The decision to keep the companies listed had prompted criticism that Treasury was being dovish on China. 
Mnuchin has long been seen as seeking to thwart attempts by hardliners in the administration - many led by the State department - to crack down on Chinese companies. 
But sources who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter said Mnuchin had called NYSE President Stacey Cunningham on Tuesday to express his concerns over the decision to relist the companies, as the exchange sought further confirmation on the matter.
""The Treasury secretary was on the phone with the NYSE (president) now and was told that NYSE would reverse their decision,"" a U.S. official told Reuters on Tuesday. 
INVESTOR COMPLIANCE URGED
On Wednesday the exchange operator said in a statement its latest decision, to move forward with the delistings, was based on ""new specific guidance received on January 5, 2021, that the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control provided to the NYSE"".
Trading in the securities will be suspended at 4 a.m. ET (0900 GMT) on Jan. 11, the NYSE said.
A spokeswoman for the exchange operator declined to comment further.
The flip-flopping caused investors to sell positions in the securities, the prices of which dropped on the initial announcement, then rose on the next, and tumbled again on Wednesday.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the decision was the ""right call"". 
""Chinese firms that reject fundamental transparency requirements and have ties to the Chinese military shouldn’t benefit from American investment,"" Sasse said. 
Trump's executive order technically takes effect on Jan. 11 but does not ban purchases by U.S. investors until November.
While the directive stops short of forcing a delisting, a separate bill signed into law by Trump in November will kick Chinese companies off U.S. bourses if they do not fully comply with the country's auditing rules in three years. 
The U.S. State Department plans to release as soon as Wednesday a fact sheet urging U.S. investors to comply with the executive order, according to three people familiar with the matter and a copy of the document seen by Reuters.
The Treasury said on Wednesday that market intermediaries could help investors divest securities of the blacklisted companies.
S&P Dow Jones Indices, which has also made U-turns in decisions, said late on Wednesday it will remove the three telecom firms' ADRs from its benchmarks before Jan. 11.
Other index makers including FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc have cut a dozen Chinese companies on the list from their benchmarks, but have not removed the three telecom firms, all of which have major passive U.S. funds amongst their top shareholders.

""S&P DJI's announcement to move forward with removing the above-referenced ADRs from its indices is due to the New York Stock Exchange's (NYSE's) latest confirmation that the ADRs will be delisted,"" it said in an emailed statement.

Investors had sold positions in the securities after the NYSE first announced plans last week to delist China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. But the shares rose after NYSE said it would not do so and tumbled again after the latest about-face.
Less than 24 hours before its latest announcement, S&P Dow Jones Indices too had said it would not remove the ADRs of the firms, in line with NYSE's decision at the time.
Hong Kong shares of China Unicom led losses among the three China telecom stocks to be delisted by NYSE at the start of trading in Asia, down as much as 9.4%.

China Mobile shares were down as much as 6.8%, and China Telecom Corp shares dropped 5.8%.

The Democrat pair of Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won the two seats in the chamber up for grabs in Georgia, unseating their Republican rivals David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The victories saw U.S. shares edge higher over expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will have a smoother path to push his agenda, including more stimulus measures, when his administration takes office on Jan. 20.
Democrats now have control of the political trifecta, including the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives. Sentiment was dampened, but not sunk, as protesters supporting President Donald Trump descended into the Capitol where lawmakers were meeting to certify Biden’s victory in the Nov. 3 presidential elections.
The events did little to dimmish some investors’ trust in the U.S. institutions, as lawmakers were re-escorted into Capitol Hill and resumed the interrupted meeting.
“The mob has interrupted the process of Biden’s confirmation, but the mob will not overturn the process,” Mizuho Securities chief currency strategist Masafumi Yamamoto told Reuters.
“The market is optimistic that Biden’s victory will not be overturned,” and investors are positioning for a U.S. economic recovery, he added.
Other investors pointed to the work ahead for Biden and his team.
“Even though we are bearing witness to the markets’ keen knack of ironing itself out quickly, the most important question now is the sequencing of the Biden policy plan,” Axi Chief Global Market Strategist Stephen Innes said in a note.
“Hopefully, for investors’ concerns, it’s in order of stimulus, infrastructure, and tax changes … while Biden could theoretically get the ball rolling and undo many of the Trump tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals on Day One, I cannot imagine that tax hikes are the priority number one when the current mandate is to rid the U.S. of COVID-19 and get the economy roaring again,” the note added.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its December policy meeting on Wednesday. The Federal Open Market Committee will continue purchases of bonds at least at its current pace until the economic recovery had made “substantial further progress,” the minutes said."

Money managers mainly focused on the prospect of more government spending after control of the Senate tipped to the Democrats in the wake of Wednesday’s runoff vote in Georgia, helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit new records. Stocks did pare some gains as intensified.
“The markets are perceiving (the unrest) as a one-off event that hopefully won’t lead to anything further,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Asset Management. “That’s why you’re seeing such a muted reaction.”

However, analysts cautioned about the potential for market moves if the situation worsens. 
“If this goes on... you’ll see a safety trade,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU). 
Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, also cautioned that if the situation escalates stocks could be hit but said investors were taking it in stride.

U.S. crude futures settled on Wednesday at $50.63 a barrel, and fell as low as $49.49 a barrel in the post-close trading. However, the oil market rebounded shortly after.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 08:05PM ET</span>","U.S. to urge firms comply with China investment ban in new guidance, sources say","By Humeyra Pamuk and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department plans to release as soon as Wednesday a fact sheet urging U.S. investors to comply with an executive order banning investments in alleged Chinese military companies, according to three people familiar with the matter and a copy of the document seen by Reuters. 
The executive order, released by the Trump administration in November, bars Americans from buying securities of 35 Chinese companies that the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has deemed to be owned or controlled by the Chinese military, starting in November 2021.
Confusion over what the order requires prompted the New York Stock Exchange last Thursday to announce plans to delist three Chinese telecom companies that the Pentagon added to the blacklist. On Monday the NYSE scrapped the move and then in a surprise twist the exchange reversed course a second time on Wednesday and vowed to continue with its bid to delist the firms.
The State Department guidance sheds little new light on the order but explicitly exhorts Americans to comply. 
""Ample warning has been given to the compliance officers and risk managers to understand and disclose to their constituents the material risk associated with the Executive Order,"" a draft of the State Department release states. 
""CEOs and their boards now have a legal duty to implement and be in full compliance with the Executive Order,"" it adds.
Three people, who declined to be named since the matter was not yet public, confirmed plans to release the document and two of them confirmed the contents. 
A spokesperson for the State Department declined to confirm the fact sheet but said, ""We continue to work with Treasury, DoD, and others to implement the President's Executive Order to address the threat from securities investments that finance Communist Chinese military companies.""
The November executive order is part of a bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy in the waning days of his administration. It also gives teeth to a 1999 law that required the DoD to compile a list of Chinese firms backed by the Chinese military. 
The catalog now includes China's top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO). Index providers like MSCI have begun shedding the blacklisted Chinese firms from their indexes in the wake of the November directive.
The confusion comes against a backdrop of tension among U.S. agencies about how stringently to construe the November executive order. Reuters and other news outlets reported that the State Department and DoD had pushed back against draft guidance that the Treasury Department was planning to issue that was seen as watering down the order.
Both U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin later wrote in tweets that there was no disagreement over the executive order.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German biotech firm CureVac has agreed to an alliance with drugmaker Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) to get global support in seeking approval for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine and for distribution, the daily Bild reported.
Under the deal, Germany's Bayer will provide access to international pharmaceutical markets, as well as its global supply chain and distribution network, the tabloid newspaper reported in an excerpt made available to Reuters ahead of publication.
The report did not specify its sources and did not disclose financial terms.
Bayer and CureVac were not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.
CureVac, which has said it was looking for a larger partner, last month started a late-stage clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, banking on the same technology that has allowed rivals BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to lead the development race.
The Nasdaq-listed biotech firm, which is backed by investors Dietmar Hopp, the Gates Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and the German government, has said it aimed to produce up to 300 million doses of the vaccine in 2021 and up to 600 million in 2022.
In March last year, CureVac was at the centre of a row over alleged attempts by U.S. President Donald Trump to gain access to the vaccine but the company denied at the time having received any U.S. offers for the company or its assets.
Ahead of any regulatory approval, the European Union has secure up to 405 million doses of the immunisation, among a slew of supply deals agreed between the bloc and other vaccine developers.
Bayer's pharma unit, which is trying to build a new cell and gene therapy business, has expertise in cancer, haemophilia, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and women's health but not in vaccines.
The group's stock has been battered by billions of euros in writedowns at its agriculture division, litigation woes and a bleaker profit outlook, in large part related to the $63 billion takeover of seed maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON).

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks have provided $1.7 trillion of finance to 40 companies in the plastics supply chain without imposing any requirements to tackle plastic pollution pouring into the world's rivers and oceans, according to a report published on Thursday.
With European and U.S. banks increasingly spurning the most polluting fossil fuel projects to help slow climate change, campaigners want lenders to take a similar approach to plastics by making loans conditional on measures to boost recycling.
""What the financial sector needs now is someone to step forward and say 'okay, we're going to take a look at plastics,' and then others will follow,"" said Robin Smale, director of Vivid Economics, a consultancy, which audited the report.
Compiled by https://portfolio.earth, a research network, the report ranked Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) as the three biggest financiers of plastics between January 2015 and September 2019.
Each bank provided from $144 billion to $172 billion in loans and underwriting to companies from chemicals, packaging and drinks manufacturers to retailers, the report found.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) and HSBC were ranked as the largest plastics financiers among European peers, extending $118 billion and $96 billion respectively.
Citigroup referred Reuters to existing sustainability commitments. JPMorgan, Barclays and HSBC declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Public concerns over plastic have risen in recent years, as scientists have discovered contamination in once pristine environments from ocean depths to the Arctic.
The report said none of 20 global banks that provided the bulk of financing for the plastic packaging industry had introduced any due diligence or exclusion criteria.
But banks could tackle plastic pollution by making loans contingent on ambitious re-use and recycling schemes, and by lobbying governments to support such measures, the report said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a little girl who spoke no English when she moved to the United States from Taiwan, Annie Young-Scrivner learned early on about challenging times. 
But the new CEO of Germany-based hair care company Wella AG likes to remind people that nothing is impossible, even in a pandemic.
""Look at me, a little Chinese girl who couldn't speak a stitch of English, right?"" she said, adding that her recipe for success is simple. ""Dream big, find your own destiny, take calculated risks, don't be afraid of failure.""
On Dec. 1, Young-Scrivner joined Wella from Godiva Chocolatier, where she had been CEO. Wella, which has about 6,000 employees in 100 countries, became an independent company late last year following KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc's acquisition of 60% of Wella from Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc. 
Young-Scrivner, 52, had a chat with Reuters about thriving under any circumstances as well as transitioning to a new job. Edited excerpts are below.
Q. What were your early lessons about work?
A. When I was 10, I knew I was going to run a business. I used to sell perfume on our block. I would take little candies and dissolve them in water and put that in perfume bottles and sell it. It didn’t work very well, but it was a fun exercise.
When my family migrated over to the U.S., my dad worked for a shipping company and my mom was an accountant, but on the side they also had businesses. We had a restaurant, we had a jade store and a video arcade. I grew up around entrepreneurs. 
It showed me that if you run a business, you get to create your own culture. You get to really have an impact.
Q. What was your toughest job?
A. When was 12, I picked strawberries. I used to go to the strawberry fields and think, “Wow, I could get paid doing something I love.” It was a horrible experience because to make money, you didn’t just pick the best-quality strawberries. You had to pick strawberries that weren’t perfect, every strawberry in the field. 
I didn’t quit, but I learned that if you want to do something that’s fun as a job, you should really understand what it means when you have to do it every day. For many years after that, I didn’t eat anything strawberry.
Q. What is it like to be a leader now?
A. In any transition, it is about the people. It’s really making sure that you understand what they’re going through and learning the business as much as you can.
I’ve been doing listening tours, meeting with groups of 12 to 25 people and asking them, 'What’s working for you, what’s not, and if you have a magic wand, what are the three things you would change tomorrow to make the company better?' Then synthesizing that and bringing it back to the leadership team on a weekly basis so we can decide how to go forward. 
Q. How is working from home impacting the grooming business?
A. We’re very fortunate to be in hair and nails because there’s a lot more videoconferencing. 
I never saw myself as much as I have since this started because when you’re talking to someone, usually, you don’t see a mirror of yourself. Now you’re looking at yourself all the time.
We’ve been sharing how to do the one-minute groom before a chat. What do you do to make your hair look right for your audience? What hair products can help that? 
We serve close to 400,000 salons and millions and millions of hairdressers. We’ve been communicating with them and leveraging this time to do additional education on the products, so when things do open up, people are ready to serve their customers and clients. 
Q. What is your biggest business challenge?
A. It’s 24-7, especially when you're working in a global business. The sun is always up somewhere across the globe. And with accessibility, it’s so easy to always be in touch. 
For me, even pre-pandemic, it was hard to draw that boundary. I’m trying to get back into yoga. It gives me a sense of peace, a little time every day just to reflect.
Q. What’s your approach to assembling a team?
A. I often think of myself as an orchestra conductor. You hear all these different instruments, and they play at different speeds. Their loudness is different, but they play to one sheet of music. 

A team should be very aligned to one plan. But there has to be diversity because if everyone all played the exact same way, it would be really, really boring.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Some investors including William Ackman and Glenn Welling, who push corporations to perform better, posted record-breaking returns in 2020 when activist investors generally backed off demands during a year marked by wild and unexpected business conditions.
Ackman's publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings fund rose 70.2%, marking the best-ever return at his 16-year-old firm Pershing Square Capital Management and one of the best in the hedge fund industry. In 2019, the fund rose 58%, also a record.
Welling's Engaged Capital, founded in 2012 and known for pushing companies like Medifast (NYSE:MED) Inc and Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN) Group Inc to make changes, returned 51%. That tops the firm's previous record return set in 2019 with a 34% gain.
And Andrew Left, who has targeted companies he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors that his hedge fund returned 155% in 2020, after gaining 43% in 2019, the fund's first year in business.
The gains reflect a late-year rebound among activists - fueled partly by strong stock market gains - with the average fund up 6.7% in the first 11 months of 2020 after a 27% drop in the first quarter, Hedge Fund Research data shows. Activist campaigns were down 20% in 2020 from the previous year, Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) data shows.
At Third Point (NYSE:TPRE), where Daniel Loeb unveiled a late-year campaign at  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), the Offshore Fund finished up 20.6%, its best return since 2013 when it gained 26%. That came after Loeb repositioned the portfolio and personnel in the wake of a 16% loss in the first quarter.
Blackwells Capital, currently bidding for  Monmouth Real Estate Investment  (NYSE:MNR) Corp, gained 32% last year, their first time reporting their activist fund returns.
Falcon Edge Capital, a steady investor in blank check companies like the ones Ackman and Loeb's firms have created, gained 43% last year.
Representatives for the funds declined to comment.

Investing.com -- An unruly mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers met to confirm the electoral college vote for President-elect Joe Biden.
Shocking scenes of chaos in the nation’s capital unfolded on television and over social media as lawmakers scrambled for shelter, suspending their vote count. Stocks became almost an after-thought, after touching new record highs earlier in the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave back some of its gains, though ultimately ended the day in record territory. Earlier, the markets reacted positively to the prospect of more stimulus under a Biden administration that will likely have control of both chambers of Congress.
Two runoff elections in Georgia will hand Democrats an equal number of seats in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaker. That clears the way for Biden and the Democrats to pursue their agenda without fear of being blocked left and right by Republicans.
Clean energy, more economic aid to boost the recovery, and infrastructure are on that agenda. Shares of banks and energy companies surged in early trading.
Here are some things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Violence leads to uncertainty
The violence in Washington could weigh on stocks as uncertainty breeds volatility. Police worked to force the rioters out of the Capitol building Wednesday afternoon, and the Mayor of D.C. called for a 6:00 PM ET curfew in the city.
If the violence spills overnight and into a new day, stocks could retreat and hard assets like gold could rise as investors rush for safe havens. 
2. Electoral confirmation suspended
The violence disrupted the confirmation of electoral college votes for Biden, and there wasn’t word mid-afternoon when the counting could begin again. Congressional leaders had to leave the House chamber when rioters stormed the building.
Jan. 6 is the day set aside for Congress to do this usually perfunctory task, in order for the inauguration to go forward on Jan. 20, which is just two weeks from now. 
3. Jobs data
Thursday brings data on initial and continuing jobless claims, which are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Private payrolls in December declined 123,000, according to ADP, evidence of a significant slowdown in the economy.
Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect nitial jobless claims of 800,000, which would be up from the prior week. Continuing claims are expected to be 5.2 million.
The labor market data come just a day ahead of the crucial nonfarm payrolls report due Friday. "

Investing.com – The Dow closed at record highs Wednesday, as violent protests at Capitol Hill to stop the confirmation of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory was offset by a wave of optimism that more stimulus is on the way as Democrats won the Georgia runoff elections to take control of the Senate.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.44%, or 437 points, though had been up 630 points intraday. The S&P 500 was up 0.60%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.61%. 
Protests quickly turned violent after demonstrators stormed the Capitol building after President Donald Trump urged them to protest the confirmation of Biden’s victory, before calling for calm.  
The turn of events triggered a wave of caution, prompting traders to rein, albeit temporarily rein in their bullish stimulus-led bets on stocks.  
Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock unseated Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler in one of the Georgia runoff elections, while Democrat Jon Ossoff reportedly won against Republican David Perdue.
Following the victory in both races, the Democrats now match the 50 seats the Republics hold in the Senate. But Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will have the tie-breaking vote, paving the way for Democrats to carry out their legislative agenda amid control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that increasing stimulus checks to $2,000 would be one of the first legislative proposals.
But some on Wall Street have suggested the stimulus-led boost to the economy could trigger the Federal Reserve to tighten policy sooner than expected.  
The legislative agenda could ""close the output gap by roughly four to six quarters,"" ahead of schedule, improve the unemployment rate and set inflation on path to reach 2%, which which ""will put the Fed in a position to lift off in early 2023, a full year ahead of our previous forecast,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Financials led the broader market higher, with banking stocks in the ascendency - ahead of the quarterly earnings report due next week -  driven by a jump in Treasury yields as the United States 10-Year rose above 1% for the first time since March.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rallied 7% and 6% respectively, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was up 5%.
Higher yields tend to boost the net interest income banks earn on their loan products.
Energy stocks continued their gains from a day earlier, as oil prices tracked higher on data showing a larger-than-expected draw in weekly crude supplies.
Crude inventories fell 8 million barrels, compared with a forecast for a 2.1 million-barrel decline, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Tech lagged the broader move higher as investors fear big tech is set to come under increasing regulatory scrutiny with democrats at the legislative helm.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) the so-called Fab 5, which make up for about 25% of the S&P 500, traded in the red."
990,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 04:35PM ET</span>","Factbox-Democratic U.S. Congress could bring better green cars, more pressure on tech","(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's party appears poised to control Congress as well as the presidency, with two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia likely to go to Democrats, which could mean Corporate America faces stricter regulation on everything from auto emissions to prescription drug prices.
Democrats have won one of the Georgia seats with the second leaning their way. Here are six key industries that could change under Democrats, with the caveat that the margin of control would be razor-thin.
AUTOMAKERS
Democratic control of Washington would make it likely that automakers will once again face tougher carbon emissions targets. Biden has pledged to let California require zero-emission vehicles, which the Trump administration had challenged, and improve fuel-efficiency standards.
The auto industry could also get more help with a transition to electric vehicles if Biden can deliver on promises to expand electric vehicle tax credits and fund charging infrastructure.
Biden has identified a team to oversee environmental and climate policy, including former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy at the White House, who will be pivotal in defining new climate standards for the auto industry.
Strong advocates of climate action also could have an easier path to confirmation and could put more pressure on automakers after four years of relatively hands-off regulation.
TECH
The regulatory cloud over Big Tech is not likely to dissipate, with some Democrats eager to go even further than the Trump administration in scrutinizing practices at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). The Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, filed last October, is expected to continue and could even be broadened.
A Biden administration and a Democratic Congress could also mean new privacy regulations and a revision of a key law that protects internet companies from liability for the content posted on their services. But tech companies have many friends among Biden advisers, including Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, and will fight hard to water down any new laws.
The biggest changes for the tech sector could come on China and trade policy. The fate of China-owned TikTok, if not sealed before Inauguration Day, could be an early test of Biden’s approach. Tech companies hope a Biden administration will take a less confrontational approach than President Donald Trump, although few analysts expect a quick return to warm U.S.-China relations.
Tech companies stand to benefit from any rollback of Trump-era restrictions on worker immigration, while gig economy companies like Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc,  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and DoorDash Inc could come under pressure over classifying gig workers as independent contractors with lower benefits and protections than employees.
Democrats in control of two branches of the U.S. government may mean a higher tax bill: tech companies were among the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s reduction in corporate income tax rates.
PHARMACEUTICALS
    The pharmaceutical industry has spent millions on lobbying and campaign contributions to head off a push by Congress to slash U.S. drug prices, a possibility that has become more likely with Biden as U.S. president-elect and with Democrats expected to hold a slim Senate majority.
    Biden has vowed to reduce drug costs and to allow Medicare, a U.S. government health insurance program, to negotiate drug prices. He has support from Democratic lawmakers to pass such legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office has said could cost the industry more than $300 billion by 2029.
    One silver lining for the industry is that Biden's promise to expand health insurance coverage to more Americans through the creation of a government-run health insurance option could lead to more people being able to afford drugs, boosting demand for drugmakers' products.
MINING
Democratic control of Washington is likely to mean an increase in domestic production of lithium, copper and other metals used to make electric vehicles and other environmentally friendly products crucial in the push to reduce carbon emissions.
Where such mines will be developed, though, and how large they will be is likely to be a major point of conflict within the Democratic government, with aggressive climate plans - including the Green New Deal favored by many progressives - seemingly at odds with the bipartisan push to boost U.S. manufacturing.
Neither Biden nor many congressional candidates talked much about mining during their campaigns, either for or against.
For his part, Biden has set lofty goals of making the United States a carbon-neutral nation by 2035, a plan that can be achieved only with wind turbines, solar panels and other materials made from mined rock.
MEDIA
News organizations may see a dip in their audiences once Biden takes office. He is less incendiary than Trump and less likely to use social media, so ""doomscrolling"" readers of negative news may find less ire and fewer conspiracy theories from Biden and fellow Democrats than from Trump.
Trump could still generate headlines, via potential post-White House legal battles or remarks on his own platform.
To be sure, with a COVID-19 vaccine not expected to be generally available in the United States until mid-2021, homebound Americans are likely to continue to seek clarity from the media about what happens next, and a united government could produce news-making progress on policy issues.
RETAIL/TRADE
Trump has imposed $370 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China, part of his ""America First"" agenda. Those tariffs on products ranging from handbags to small electronics are estimated to have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion through early September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.

Retailers argue the tariffs raised prices for consumers and cost U.S. jobs, and they hope that Biden will re-evaluate the policy.

Investing.com – The Dow eased from a record high Wednesday, after pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol building, stopping the election certification process, though sentiment remained supported by stimulus-fueled optimism.     
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1.52%, or 461 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.21%. 
The protests that quickly turned violent were seemingly fueled by President Donald Trump who had urged supporters to protest the confirmation of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, before calling for calm.  
The disruption to the election certification process triggered a wave of caution, prompting traders to rein in their bullish stimulus-led bets on stocks.  
Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock unseated Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler in one of the Georgia runoff elections, while Democrat Jon Ossoff is reportedly in the lead against Republican David Perdue.
A victory in both races would see the Democrats match the 50 seats the Republics hold in the Senate. But Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will have the tie-breaking vote, paving the way for Democrats to carry out their legislative agenda amid control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that increasing stimulus checks to $2,000 would be one of the first legislative proposals.
But some on Wall Street have suggested the stimulus-led boost to the economy could trigger the Federal Reserve to tighten policy sooner than expected.  
The legislative agenda could ""close the output gap by roughly four to six quarters,"" ahead of schedule, improve the unemployment rate and set inflation on path to reach 2%, which which ""will put the Fed in a position to lift off in early 2023, a full year ahead of our previous forecast,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Financials led the broader market higher, with banking stocks in the ascendency - ahead of the quarterly earnings report due next week -  driven by a jump in Treasury yields as the United States 10-Year rose above 1% for the first time since March.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rallied 7% and 6% respectively, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) was up 5%.
Higher yields tend to boost the net interest income banks earn on their loan products.
Energy stocks continued their gains from a day earlier, as oil prices tracked higher on data showing a larger-than-expected draw in weekly crude supplies.
Crude inventories fell 8 million barrels, compared with a forecast for a 2.1 million-barrel decline, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Tech lagged the broader move higher as investors fear big tech is set to come under increasing regulatory scrutiny with democrats at the legislative helm.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) the so-called Fab 5, which make up for about 25% of the S&P 500, traded in the red."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare shares rose on Wednesday as Georgia elections appeared to shift Senate control to Democrats - long considered a risk for the sector - with investors factoring in support for current government insurance programs and downplaying chances for systemic overhauls.
The S&P 500 healthcare sector was up about 1.4% in afternoon trade, in line with the gain for the broader S&P 500, as Democratic candidates closed in on a sweep of two Senate runoff races in Georgia that would give the party full control of Congress and aid President-elect Joe Biden's agenda.
Concerns that a Democratic-led government could take tougher measures in areas such as prescription-drug pricing or begin a push for more government involvement in the healthcare system have clouded the sector's outlook for most of 2020. 
But after Tuesday's vote, investors pointed to the fact that the Democrats would only have a slim edge over Republicans, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote with a 50-50 split in the Senate, far short of 60 votes many bills need to overcome a procedural threshold.
""Even though technically they have the majority, they don’t have the 60 votes to get much accomplished,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.
Biden has been a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, that was enacted when he was vice president, and the Senate results could further add backing, analysts said.
Shares of insurer  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) and hospital chain HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA), two stocks seen benefiting from ACA support, surged over 9% and 5%, respectively.
Insurers specializing in the Medicaid health program for low-income Americans and healthcare facility companies were likely benefiting from increased investor expectations for more stimulus spending, according to Stephens analyst Scott Fidel.
The Georgia results represented ""an incremental negative"" for pharmaceutical stocks, according to JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott. Still, Schott said in a note that, ""we remain far short of the 'Blue Wave' scenario contemplated ahead of the November U.S. elections.""
Pharma and biotech stocks were generally underperforming on Wednesday. The S&P 500 pharmaceuticals and biotech indexes were up only 0.8% and 0.4% respectively. 

“I think the Democrats want to do something about drug prices...,"" said Les Funtleyder, a healthcare portfolio manager at E Squared Capital. ""Democrats have never been the biggest fans of the drug industry, and I think that is going to manifest itself to some degree.”

994,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",Reuters editor-in-chief Adler to retire after decade at the helm,"By Reuters Staff
(Reuters) - Stephen J. Adler, editor-in-chief of Reuters for the past decade, said he would retire from the world's largest international news provider on April 1.
A search for his successor will begin over the next few days, Reuters President Michael Friedenberg said on Wednesday in a memo to Reuters staff.
During his tenure, Adler expanded the scope and ambition of Reuters' news offerings, introducing innovations across multiple platforms to serve the news agency's financial, media and professional clients. 
The journalism he championed – impartial and courageous reporting both at speed and in-depth – won global plaudits and hundreds of journalism awards, including seven Pulitzer Prizes.
""We have reported the news with speed, accuracy, fairness and insight in every medium. We have provided unique value to our customers, spoken truth to power, and made the world a better place with our factual and fearless journalism,"" Adler said in a memo to the newsroom on Wednesday announcing his retirement.
Adler, 65, guided the Reuters newsroom through years of financial pressure and intensifying dangers for journalists around the world. 
In 2017, two Reuters reporters in Myanmar were arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison. The reporters, who had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians, were set up, arrested and then spent more than 500 days behind bars before they were freed. 
Adler advocated publicly for their release, appearing at the United Nations in 2018 with international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who had been retained by Reuters to defend the reporters. 
Just this week, a Reuters cameraman in Ethiopia was released after police had detained him for 12 days without charges. 
""Steve has always cared deeply about journalists,"" Friedenberg said. ""He has worked tirelessly to secure freedom for journalists in custody or under threat."" 
The Reuters president added that Adler has overseen stricter safety standards for journalists, including enhanced hostile-environment training and new mental health programs. 
Steve Hasker, president and CEO of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), which owns Reuters, praised Adler as a ""tireless advocate for independent journalism and a champion for press freedom and media literacy.""
Adler also gained attention when he called for a non-partisan approach to U.S. political coverage during the early days of the Trump presidency. In a February 2017 memo, entitled ""Covering Trump the Reuters Way,"" Adler instructed Reuters journalists to ""operate with calm integrity,"" practicing the same ""intrepid and unbiased"" journalism that enabled the news agency to operate in more than 200 locations around the world. 
""So what is the Reuters answer? To oppose the administration? To appease it? To boycott its briefings? To use our platform to rally support for the media? All these ideas are out there, and they may be right for some news operations, but they don’t make sense for Reuters,"" Adler wrote. 
The memo was posted on Reuters.com and was viewed more than 720,000 times. https://reut.rs/38ZpCXa
PRESS FREEDOM
A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Adler got his start in journalism at local newspapers in Florida. He was a top editor at The American Lawyer from 1983 to 1988, before joining The Wall Street Journal where he held a variety of positions, including running investigative reporting teams and overseeing the paper's online edition.
He was editor-in-chief of BusinessWeek before joining Thomson Reuters in 2010 as Senior Vice President and Editorial Director of the company's Professional Division. He became editor-in-chief of Reuters the following year.
Reuters supplies other news organisations and financial clients around the world, and its video, text, pictures, and graphics reach billions of people every day.
Though Reuters has a diversified business model, it has not been immune to cost constraints felt across the industry. In 2013, Reuters employed around 3,000 journalists. The newsroom now numbers 2,500. In 2013, Reuters shuttered its digital initiative, Reuters Next, and last year closed its direct-to-consumer television app Reuters TV after five years.
Reuters gained a significant measure of financial security in 2018, with a 30-year, $325 million-a-year agreement to supply news to Refinitiv - the financial information provider formed after Thomson Reuters' sale of a majority stake in its former Financial & Risk business to a group led by private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) LP. The deal made Refinitiv the largest single customer of Reuters.
In the year after the deal closed, Reuters reported that Refinitiv acquiesced to pressure from the Chinese government and blocked from its terminals in mainland China more than 200 Reuters articles that could be seen as critical of Beijing.
Adler and Friedenberg publicly criticized Refinitiv for the decision.
The London Stock Exchange has agreed to buy Refinitiv for $27 billion in a deal that is expected to close in the first quarter of this year.
Friedenberg said that, in searching for the person to succeed Adler, Reuters had the opportunity for a new leader to build on Adler's ""remarkable legacy.""
In his memo announcing his retirement, Adler said he plans to write and teach. He also will continue in his roles with advocacy groups such as the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which he chairs, and the Committee to Protect Journalists. He counselled colleagues to uphold the Trust Principles, a set of standards adopted in 1941 which continue to define how 170-year-old Reuters operates.

""If I have one piece of advice,"" he said, ""it's to stay true to the Trust Principles - and preserve our defining commitment to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.""

995,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 01:17PM ET</span>",Europe prepares for Moderna vaccine rollout as fears grow over virus variants,"By Bart H. Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - EU countries could begin rolling out  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine as soon as next week after authorities approved the region's second shot on Wednesday, with more infectious variants of the virus adding extra urgency to inoculation efforts.
Vaccinating the European Union's 450 million people could be crucial to ending a pandemic that has killed almost 1.9 million people globally. Countries are scrambling to contain two variants found in South Africa and Britain that are more transmissible and have driven a surge in infections.
""With the Moderna vaccine, the second one now authorised in the EU, we will have a further 160 million doses. And more vaccines will come,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.
She was speaking after the EU executive gave the vaccine the final go-ahead for rollout, hours after the EU drug regulator, the European Medicines Authority (EMA), approved the shot for use on people aged over 18.
The first deliveries to European countries will begin next week, Moderna said following the news.
The EU approval, coming just over a year since the first outbreak of the virus was identified in China, marks the fourth authorisation for U.S. biotech company Moderna's vaccine after the United States, Canada and Israel, and further validation of the new genetic mRNA technology it uses. 
The EU approved a shot from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), also based on mRNA technology, two weeks ago.
The EMA has given a conditional marketing approval for both, rather than the ultra-fast emergency use clearance issued by Britain, which the EU regulator says requires more detailed study of the data.
Additional authorisations for the Moderna shot are under review in Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, the U.S. company said in a statement after the news.
Moderna shares were up more than 4% in early New York trading. The company's value has surged more than 450% since February last year as the pandemic gripped the world and drugmakers rushed to develop shots.
EFFECTIVE AGAINST VARIANT?
The EU has ordered 160 million doses of the Moderna shot, enough to vaccinate 80 million people in its 27 member states, but the first initial volumes are expected to be small. 
Moderna did not disclose details on volumes on Wednesday.
The vaccine was about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials, which found no serious safety issues. 
The Dutch national drugs authority, the CBG, said the Moderna vaccine was expected to be effective against the variant of the coronavirus detected in Britain, but cautioned this had to be confirmed by further research.
It has to be stored and shipped frozen, but does not require the ultra-cold temperatures of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Once thawed, it can be kept at typical refrigerator temperatures.
Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the Moderna vaccine could be kept in a fridge for up to 30 days. 
""Each vial has 10 doses so again, once the vaccine has reached room temperature there is a need to ensure that it is all used within 18 hours at most, so the logistics of delivering the vaccine are more complicated than for say flu vaccines,"" he added.
SYNTHETIC GENES TECHNOLOGY
EU countries started vaccinations on Dec. 27 and are trying to catch up with countries such as Britain and Israel where large numbers of people have already received inoculations.
The campaign has already gotten off to an uneven start, with officials in Germany and France frustrated at the slow rate of progress. 
Hundreds of thousands of Europeans have received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot since the rollout began just over a week ago. By comparison, Britain has administered more than a million of the vaccine in just under a month. 
The Netherlands started vaccinations with that shot on Wednesday, giving its first injection to a 39-year-old care home nurse. 
The Moderna vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart. Like the Pfizer shot, it relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.
On Monday, Moderna raised its production target for 2021 to at least 600 million doses, up by 100 million. 

Switzerland's Lonza Group has a contract to supply ingredients for the vaccine, while Spain's Rovi is assembling the shots for fill-finish services.

With Raphael Warnock defeating Kelly Loeffler, and Jon Ossoff close to prevailing over David Perdue, the result would create a 50-50 split between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate for two years. But since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris votes in the case of a tie, the victories mean Democrats will effectively control both the presidency and Congress.
And that has important implications for the nation’s economic recovery.
Read more: What Biden Gets With Slimmest Possible Control of U.S. Senate
In the near term, that could result in a $750 billion to $1 trillion pandemic relief package this year on top of the $900 billion in aid signed into law last month, Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), said earlier this week. The precise impact of a package on economic growth would depend on the details, but it presents “a sizable upside risk to our growth forecast” in 2021, currently 4.3%.
Economists predict additional aid could include support for state and local governments, another extension of enhanced jobless benefits and more stimulus payments like the $2,000 direct payments supported by both President-elect Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“In the event of a Democratic sweep in Georgia, we think additional near-term pandemic relief and accompanying stimulus could stretch into the $600 billion to $800 billion range. The high end could be sufficient to lift growth by roughly 1.7 percentage points in 2021, to 5.2% year-over-year, with a faster pace continuing into 2022.”
-- Andrew Husby, economist
For the full note, click here
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) LLC economists said in a note that they see Democratic victories in both seats spurring an additional $1 trillion of stimulus in the next few months, adding about 2 percentage points to economic growth over the next two years.
U.S. stocks and long-term Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday with the vote count nearly complete. Traders also boosted expectations for inflation in coming years, as five-year breakeven rates steadied around a two-year high.

The unemployment rate, which many economists are already expecting to come down substantially this year amid widespread vaccinations and a snapback in activity, could be slightly lower at the end of the year -- maybe 0.2 or 0.3 percentage points -- as a result of a Democratic sweep compared with Republican control of the Senate, said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
Additional stimulus would also accelerate the nation’s return to pre-pandemic gross domestic product and unemployment levels, Luzzetti said.
But in the longer term, a razor-thin majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would make it tough to get agreement among Democrats on bigger policy shifts, Luzzetti said.
The need to get consensus among senators ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to moderate Joe Manchin will likely constrain Biden’s policy goals. Biden, for example, pledged to raise taxes on corporations and people earning more than $400,000 a year during his campaign.
With a 50-50 split,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analyst Alec Phillips expects tax increases to be around a quarter of what the campaign proposed.
One potential area for bipartisan compromise is infrastructure, which could have a positive impact on the economy in several ways including job creation. If passed later this year, it could support the economy in 2022.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker sold 542,749 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down from 601,862 a year earlier.
The automaker posted a 12.5% decline in truck sales, while passenger car sales fell 41.1% as it continues to phase out traditional sedan models in North America that have become increasingly unpopular with consumers.
Sales of its SUVs, however, rose 4% to 216,732 units.
""Fourth quarter represented an inflection point at Ford in our transition from cars to a much greater focus on iconic trucks, SUVs and electric vehicles,"" said Andrew Frick, vice president at Ford's sales in the United States and Canada.
""We are well positioned to see the benefits of our focused efforts throughout 2021,"" Frick added.
GM reported a 4.8% increase in U.S. sales for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) recorded a sales increase of 9.4% and 10.8%, respectively.
""It might seem at odds with unemployment levels and the harsh financial conditions ... but the consumers who are buying new cars during the pandemic are clearly on the other side of the economic divide,"" industry consultant Edmunds said in a report on Tuesday.
Industry experts expect a rebound in demand this year, fueled by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, record low interest rates and healthy consumer savings as people held off spending money on large purchases and vacations during the pandemic.

However, rising COVID-19 cases in the United States have increased the uncertainty over a speedy rebound.

U.S.-listed shares of Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA) Inc,, Hexo Corp and  Cronos  Group (NASDAQ:CRON) rose between 10.4% and 13%.
Pot stocks have rallied since Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential elections in November and higher demand for pot during the coronavirus-led lockdowns. 
Vice President-elect Kamal Harris' has promised pot decriminalization, which would remove it from the classified substances list. But with republicans gaining control of the senate in November elections, the passage of acts to decriminalize it, had looked bleak. 
While marijuana has been legalized in some states, its use is still illegal at a federal level. Import of marijuana into the U.S. from other countries, or even across states, is prohibited and federally governed institutions, like banks, can even be charged with money laundering if they work with marijuana growers.
Democrat Raphael Warnock's victory over Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler and Jon Ossoff's lead over incumbent David Perdue on Wednesday would give Democrats the power to advance President-elect Joe Biden's policy goals.
""Given Democrat President-elect Joe Biden will take office later this month, and the House remains controlled by the Democrats – a Democratic sweep could clear the way for more progressive cannabis legislation to be passed,"" said Aaron Grey of Alliance Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) in a note.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",British company bosses warn against 'race to the bottom' in listing review,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - British corporate lobby group the Institute of Directors on Wednesday said relaxing rules to attract more stock market listings to London could put at risk the UK's strong track record on corporate governance.
A review of the UK's rules on company stock market listings was announced in November by finance minister Rishi Sunak with the aim of boosting the number of new companies that choose to float in London, which faces tough competition from New York.
Post Brexit, stock exchanges in continental Europe could also become bigger rivals to London in terms of attracting new listings business.
The Institute of Directors, in one of the first public responses to the listing review, said it favoured leaving the main ""premium"" listing rules unchanged. But it suggested creating a separate category for a ""new breed"" of innovative start-up firms that could have different rules, such as allowing dual class shares, which give some shareholders more voting power than others.
""The government must proceed with caution,"" said Roger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the IoD.
""A race to the bottom to win extra listings would ultimately be self-defeating. Good governance is one of the UK’s key selling points."" 
The London Stock Exchange has said in its submission to the listing review that it supports easing a rule that requires companies listing on the LSE to have a minimum float of 25%, a person familiar with the LSE position said.
The LSE also supports dual class shares, the person said. Dual class shares are common in the United States.
Relaxing the minimum free float rule and allowing dual class shares would potentially make London more attractive to start-up companies where founders or major shareholders often want to maintain some control after the company floats. But dual class shares can create conflicts of interest with minority shareholders. 
The Investment Association, whose members manage 8.5 trillion pounds in assets, said the minimum free float requirement was ""working appropriately,"" but could be cut to 20% for a three-year period in some circumstances.
The principle of ""one share, one vote"" should be retained on the LSE's ""premium"" segment, the IA said. The so-called premium segment rules apply to blue-chip companies.
The IA also said Britain should look into helping to attract listings by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies or SPACs, which have boomed in the United States as a lower cost way for start-up companies to go public.
There have been a few listings by SPACs in Britain, where listing rules for this type of deal are tougher than in the United States.
SPACs are shell companies that use proceeds from going public to buy another company, not yet identified at the time of listing. They have reshaped U.S. capital markets and continental Europe is set to catch up this year.
Former European Commissioner Jonathan Hill, who is conducting the review, is expected to make recommendations this year.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy could take on $17 billion of UniCredit bad loans to ease MPS sale - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's government is working on a plan to take on about 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) of UniCredit's non-performing loans to make a takeover of state-owned Monte dei Paschi more attractive for the country's second-biggest bank, sources said.
Bad loan manager AMCO, which is backed by Rome and ran by former UniCredit executive Marina Natale, is looking to hoover up a significant tranche of UniCredit's bad debt while also ridding Monte dei Paschi of its high-risk loans, two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The plan is part of measures being readied by the Treasury in order to press ahead with the sale of MPS, whose plight has come to symbolise Italy's long-running banking crisis. 
Shares in UniCredit were up 6.3% after Reuters reported on the plan. Italy's Treasury, AMCO and UniCredit declined to comment.
The Treasury aims to have a range of solutions ready by the end of January, despite rifts within the ruling coalition which risk toppling the government.
It is working with advisers to tackle the complexities of a deal, including providing possible state guarantee to shield a MPS future owner from around 10 billion euros in legal claims which face the bank after decades of mismanagement.
""It won't be possible to resolve all the outstanding issues by the end of January, but there will be material progress in identifying the solutions that would eventually lead to a deal,"" one of the sources said.
The goal is to have a deal ready to be approved by UniCredit's annual meeting in April, another source said.
UniCredit has yet to sign a non-disclosure agreement to enter formal talks, three sources said, because it wants more reassurance that both the European Union and the European Central Bank will back the package of measures.
Discussions are ongoing despite CEO Jean Pierre Mustier's decision to step down in April at the latest over disagreements with the board.
UniCredit, which had shunned deals under Mustier, has set strict terms for a potential takeover and would only consider buying MPS if it did not affect its capital ratios.
If successful, the NPL sale would rank as one of Italy's biggest bad loan deals and would make the MPS acquisition more palatable for UniCredit's investors.
""If it goes ahead, this deal will make it easier to sell the MPS purchase to the market,"" the first source said, adding that AMCO would also hoover up another chunk of high risk loans from MPS totalling several billion euros.
LEGAL RISKS 
To address the costly legal risks, the Treasury is working with its advisers on three options which would entail either a ""guarantee scheme"" or alternatively some kind of ""insurance contract"" with cash as collateral, one of the sources said.
Another option is a subordinated loan whose principal could be wiped off under certain circumstances, the source added.
Only just over half of MPS' legal risks stem from lawsuits, while the remainder relates to extra-judicial claims mainly from the bank's former controlling shareholder, local foundation Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
Sources have said the foundation and MPS are discussing a settlement that would see 3.8 billion euros in damage claims being dropped in exchange for shares in the bank.
Rome spent 5.4 billion euros in 2017 rescuing the loss-making Tuscan bank, which now needs up to another 2.5 billion, giving fresh urgency to efforts to cut Italy's 64% stake as agreed with European Union authorities.

After warning its capital reserves would breach minimum thresholds in the first quarter, MPS must tell the ECB by the end of January how it plans to address the shortfall.

Some 650 staff, employed by Deutsche Bank subsidiary DB Direkt in Berlin and Essen, have been seeking a 6% pay increase, but they opted to strike after a fourth round of talks ended without an agreement.
The official with the Verdi labour union, Roman Eberle, said the strike accomplished its goal of disrupting business at a critical time for the bank. He said that he had not yet heard from management about resuming talks.
Banks, including Deutsche Bank, have had to rely more on call centres during the coronavirus crisis and also after branch closures to trim costs.
""Call centres are more important than ever,"" Eberle said.
Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

The FTSE 100 Index has risen as much as 5.7% in the first three sessions of 2021, on track to surpass the previous record set in 2009. This time around, the benchmark is getting a boost from investors piling into economically sensitive sectors as U.S. Democrats closed in on control of the Senate, while a Brexit deal has ended a long period of uncertainty for the unloved shares.
Banks, miners and energy shares pushed the FTSE 100 up for a third day on Wednesday on speculation that a Senate win for Joe Biden’s Democrats will fuel more stimulus that will drive economic growth and inflation. That’s adding to bullishness about the market after the U.K. reached a trade deal with the European Union, even as the nation has gone back into lockdown.
“Markets are clearly preparing for a sharp rise in commodity demand thanks to big green infrastructure plans in Europe and the U.S.,” Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG Group Holdings Plc, wrote in a note. “The sharp rise in upside from FTSE banking stocks does highlight the feeling that the more expansive Biden will provide as much support as necessary to avoid major economic suffering, thus lowering the potential losses that come from job losses and defaults.”
The gains come on the heels of the FTSE 100’s worst annual drop since 2008, and signal a shift in sentiment toward the market that’s been the worst performer among major equity markets since the 2016 Brexit referendum. For investors betting on a global recovery from the pandemic, the cheapness of U.K. equities may be attractive as value stocks are forecast by many strategists to shine in the coming year.
The FTSE 100’s stellar beginning to 2021 means the benchmark is on track to surpass the 4.6% gain seen in the first three sessions of 2009 and is heading for the best start to a year since its creation in 1984, when constituents included confectioner Rowntree Mackintosh Plc, acquisitive conglomerate Hanson Trust Plc and oil & gas producer Britoil Plc.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday amid signs that the Democratic Party is set to break the Republicans' six-year control of the Senate, finally completing the sweep of administration and Congress that they had appeared to fall short of in November.
Preliminary projections put Democratic candidates ahead in the runoff elections for both of Georgia's Senate seats, results that - if confirmed - would create a 50-50 split in the upper chamber and leave overall control in the power of vice president Kamala Harris' casting vote. 
Global stocks had received the news positively overnight, pricing in greater expectations of higher fiscal stimulus and a more collegial foreign policy than that pursued by outgoing President Donald Trump. Such hopes were reinforced by the announcement by payrolls processor ADP that private-sector employment fell by 123,000 in the month through mid-December, paving the way for a big negative surprise when the official nonfarm payrolls numbers are announced on Friday.
However, the news revived fears among U.S. investors of higher taxes and tighter regulation. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57 points, or 0.2%, at 30,449 points, but that was overshadowed by a 0.9% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. The S&P 500 was down 0.1%.  All three indices were rebounding, after their futures contracts had initially posted bigger losses overnight.
The stocks that fared best were those likely to be most affected by the loss of Republican restraint on new legislation. That went particularly for pot stocks -  Canopy Growth  Corp (NASDAQ:CGC) (TSX:WEED) stock rose 16% and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock rose 14% - and banking stocks, which rose broadly as the market anticipated more federal government borrowing, driving the 10-year Treasury yield above 1% for the first time since last February. Higher bond yields help bank profitability by widening the margin short and long-term lending rates. Shares in  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) all rose by more than 5%.
By contrast, shares in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all fell by more than 2%, amid fears that a unified Democrat Congress and administration could regulate them more tightly, particularly with regard to antitrust issues. 
Tech stocks are also in general highly exposed to profit-taking driven by fears that a Democratic Congress will raise taxes on capital gains, most of which have accrued in a relatively small number of megacap tech companies over the last few years. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock fell 2.9%, while Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell 4.6% and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock fell 4.0%.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",NYSE may make second U-turn on China telecom delistings amid confusion over policy,"By John McCrank, Alexandra Alper and Pei Li
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON/HONG KONG/ (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange is reconsidering its plan to allow three Chinese telecom giants to remain listed, the latest twist to a saga amid confusion over rules set by the Trump administration and tension within Washington on China policy.
If it does so, it would mark a second sudden U-turn. The bourse said late Monday it reversed a decision announced just last week to delist China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd after consulting with regulatory authorities in connection with the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The about-face was due to ambiguity over an executive order issued by President Donald Trump barring investment in firms Washington says are tied to the Chinese military, and whether the three firms were banned under the order, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
However, it will go ahead with the delistings, which were planned on or before Jan. 11, if it deems the companies are subject to the order, said the person who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions are ongoing.
Bloomberg earlier reported that the NYSE may flip back. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin phoned New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham on Tuesday to tell her he disagreed with the exchange operator's decision to reverse course on the delistings, a separate source said.
Coming in the final days of the Trump presidency, the back and forth at the NYSE underscored the lack of clarity about, and the tensions around, the implementation and implications of the administration's ban on investment in 35 Chinese companies. 
One China expert who has worked with Congress on delisting issues said the NYSE may have made the U-turn if they sought clarity from Treasury about the rules and been told they did not need to delist. 
Republican Senator and China hardliner Marco Rubio expressed outrage that the U.S. Treasury may have caused the NYSE to wind back the delisting procedures. 
""If it is true that someone at (Treasury) advised (NYSE) to reverse the decision to delist these Chinese companies, it was a outrageous effort to undermine (President Trump's) Executive Order,"" he tweeted.
The Treasury declined comment on the NYSE decision. OFAC, which is responsible for enforcing sanctions, declined comment. 
The NYSE is owned by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc (NYSE:ICE), which is run by billionaire Jeffrey Sprecher, whose wife Kelly Loeffler, also a former ICE executive, is one of two Republican senators facing run-off elections on Tuesday in Georgia. Loeffler is a staunch Trump supporter.
NEW GUARD 
The flip-flopping at the Big Board also sowed confusion among investors.
Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong, said he had almost completely unwound his positions in China Mobile shares in both Hong Kong and New York, partly in anticipation of needing to find investments for U.S. clients with less exposure to risks associated with the investment ban.
The are also questions about how the order will be handled by President-elect Joe Biden who is set to take office on Jan. 20 and could revoke it easily. His transition team has not commented on plans for the directive. 
William Kirby (NYSE:KEX), a Harvard Business School professor focused on China, said on Monday that whereas the Trump administration has taken a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to its regulation of Chinese companies, the Biden administration would likely have company-by-company reviews. 
Miller said that while the last year had seen toughening policies on investment flows into Chinese companies, ""many of these rules are likely to fall by the wayside.""
FLIP-FLOP 
The executive order banning U.S. investors from buying shares of companies Washington alleges are owned or controlled by the Chinese military technically takes effect on Jan. 11 but does not ban purchases until November 2021.
While the directive stops short of forcing a delisting, a separate bill signed into law by Trump in November will kick Chinese companies off U.S. bourses if they do not fully comply with the country's auditing rules in three years.
S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Wednesday it would no longer remove the three firms' ADRs, which had been due to be deleted before Jan.7, from its benchmarks after the NYSE's latest decision.
Other index makers including FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc have cut a dozen Chinese companies on the list from their benchmarks, but have not removed the three telecom firms, all of which have major passive U.S. funds amongst their top shareholders.
The three telecom firms said in statements that they had taken note of the NYSE's latest announcement and would release information in accordance with regulations, adding that investors should pay attention to investment risks.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing on Wednesday that some political forces in the United States were continuing with an unreasonable suppression of U.S.-listed foreign firms, which she said highlighted the arbitrary nature of its policies.
""We hope the U.S. respects the legal system and the market,"" she said.

The deal will help Walgreens focus more on core pharmacy unit as well as its retail business, where sales have tanked due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a nearly 30% slump in shares in 2020. 
AmerisourceBergen will pay the debt-laden pharmacy chain $6.27 billion in cash and deliver 2 million of its common stock at closing of the transaction. With a 30% stake, Walgreens is the largest shareholder of AmerisourceBergen.
Walgreens' unit, Alliance Healthcare, is one of the largest drug distributors in Europe. The deal will not include operations in China, Italy and Germany and Alliance Healthcare UK will remain a partner of Walgreens' country unit until 2031.
Reuters reported in May last year that AmerisourceBergen had approached Walgreens to explore a deal for the company's drug distribution business.
Walgreens had in 2019 explored going private and held preliminary discussions with private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

The company has an agreement to source branded and generic drugs from AmerisourceBergen in the United States. The companies said their U.S. distribution agreement will be extended by three years until 2029.

(Reuters) -Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index sank 2% on Wednesday as the possibility of Democrats gaining control of the Senate sparked fears of tighter regulations on technology mega-caps.
Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock won a hotly contested Senate race in Georgia over Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, while Democrat Jon Ossoff held a narrow lead over incumbent Republican David Perdue in the other race.
A so-called ""blue wave"" would give more scope for President-elect Joe Biden to act on his reform plans including new COVID-19 stimulus, but it could also mean higher corporate taxes and more regulations for technology behemoths, which had led Wall Street's recovery from a coronavirus-driven crash last year.
""If Democrats hold both Houses then there will be more pressure to regulate some of the bigger play within growth and most of the (market) gains are concentrated in them,"" said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) dropped between 2.2% and 3.2% in early premarket trading. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc was the only major technology stock trading higher.
At 06:50 a.m. ET, Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 253 points, or 1.98%, and S&P 500 E-minis were down 13.75 points, or 0.37%.
However, Dow e-minis climbed 0.2% as bets on a larger fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending propped up shares of industrial bellwethers  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and 3M Co. Futures tracking the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 2.5% to a record high.
Hopes of a vaccine-powered economic recovery in 2021 had sent Wall Street's main indexes to record highs in late-December, with sectors that had previously lagged, including banks, industrials and energy, fuelling the rally.
""You are seeing more evidence of a rebound in value over growth, and it feeds into the debate as to whether investors should pile into more cyclicals which are co-related with value or stick to bigger players within the growth space given that valuations in some cases are quite extreme,"" Galy added.
""Market is quite nervous about its position in large tech.""
Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) rose between 1.3% and 2.4%, tracking a sharp rise in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. [US/]

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Britain to name former Goldman banker Sharp as BBC chairman -Sky News,"LONDON (Reuters) -Britain is to name former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Richard Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) as the next chairman of the BBC as the broadcaster faces questions about its future funding and purpose as viewers turn to new competitors, Sky News reported on Wednesday. 
Sharp has recently been acting as an adviser to finance minister Rishi Sunak, Sky said. 
He will succeed David Clementi, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who is stepping down next month after four years. 
The chairman, who is officially appointed by the queen on the recommendation of the government, is responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC, which is funded by a licence fee paid by every TV-watching household.
The new chairman will join the broadcaster as it faces some of the biggest threats to its future since it was founded 98 years ago.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has voiced scepticism about the licence fee at a time when the BBC's TV audiences are shrinking and streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are growing in popularity.
The BBC is often accused of bias by critics from both ends of the political spectrum. While some Conservatives perceive it to be London-centric and left-leaning, those on the left of the opposition Labour Party see it as biased against them.
A review of the BBC's funding is due in 2022 before its royal charter needs to be renewed in 2027.
Clementi confirmed he would step down in June when he announced the appointment of Tim Davie as the new director general of the broadcaster. 
Davie is editor in chief, responsible for the BBC's content across television, radio and online services, as well as leading it operations. 
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on the Sky News report.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Wednesday, with technology stocks getting slammed as investors factored in a Democratic win in crucial U.S. Senate run-off elections in Georgia.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 84 points, or 0.3%, but the S&P 500 futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 futures slumped 196 points, or 1.5%. 
The official results in the runoffs for Georgia's two seats in the Senate have not yet been announced so far Wednesday, but U.S. TV networks have called one for Democrat Raphael Warnock over Republican Kelly Loeffler. In addition, election prediction services indicated that Jon Ossoff was on course to unseat Republican David Perdue in the other. 
These votes are expected to be confirmed later Wednesday, and are seen as crucial in deciding whether President-elect Joe Biden enjoys full control of Congress or faces stiff opposition to his plans.
A win for the Democrat pair would likely result in more stimulus and tax hikes as well as potential policies to restrict the monopoly power of big tech companies, hence the selloff on Nasdaq.
Sticking with the tech sector, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday banning transactions with eight Chinese apps, including WeChat Pay and Alipay. This move is likely to ratchet up already high U.S.-China tensions, with only two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
The economic data slate Wednesday offers a first look at the U.S. job market ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls. The ADP December jobs report is expected to show a gain of 88,000 jobs when it hits at 8:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), but some are predicting a negative number as the surge of Covid-19 cases caused many states to restrict activities. 
Also on tap are Markit PMIs and factory and durable goods orders, while the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting are also due.  
Oil prices gained Wednesday, continuing Tuesday’s strong tone after Saudi Arabia’s surprise decision to make additional production cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March.
U.S. crude oil inventories dropped by 1.7 million barrels in the week to Jan. 1, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Official data is due later Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $50.08 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $53.92. Both contracts climbed late Tuesday to their highest levels since February last year.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,951.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2342.

The price cut is its second in a year and the California-based company is asking distributors to pass on the savings to restaurants and consumers.
The Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) rival has tied up with several restaurants including Burger King, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and White Castle, and expanded its retail footprint to thousands of stores across the United States last year.
With the latest cut, the lowest possible price to distributors for the Impossible Burger would be $6.80 per pound, but it is still significantly higher than ground beef prices which range from about $2 to $3 per pound for low fat and non-organic varieties, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.
Impossible Foods Chief Executive Officer Patrick Brown in a statement noted the price cut is ""not the last"". 
The company, known for its vegan patties that taste and cook like real meat, said it is also lowering prices for distributors in Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, with varying cuts based on the region. 
Demand for plant-based meat has risen during the pandemic after beef and pork producers shut many meat plants to curb the rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Impossible Foods said production has increased six-fold since 2019.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",Markets shift to price in chance of Democrat Senate wins,"By Ritvik Carvalho and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The growing chance of Democratic wins in two pivotal Senate contests on Wednesday triggered financial market moves mirroring hopes of more COVID-19-related stimulus and increased regulatory scrutiny of tech companies.
Analysts generally assume a Democrat-controlled Senate would be positive for economic growth globally and thus for most risk assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar as the U.S. budget and trade deficits may widen further.
In stocks, infrastructure and renewable energy sectors were rising, while the Nasdaq, home to big tech stocks, took a hit.
Early voting results were still very close and Democrats need to win both contests to take control of the Senate, while just one win would see Republicans remain in charge and likely lead to legislative gridlock.
Raphael Warnock, the Democrat seeking to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler, held the lead in one of two races, although no major news outlet had projected a winner for either contest.
In line with those assumptions, 10-year U.S. bond sold off, with yields topping 1% for the first time in 9-1/2 months. The dollar fell further to its lowest levels since March 2018, adding to a 13% decline since March.
""U.S. 10 year Treasuries have tipped over 1% yield for the first time in nine months – correctly identifying the potential for greater stimulus which could buoy markets even from their current highs and as a result we have seen inflation expectations start to tick up also,"" said Stuart Clark, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors.

Democratic control of the Senate would give more scope for President-elect Joe Biden to act on his ambitious agenda, which includes new stimulus and infrastructure spending.
It might also include higher corporate taxes and tighter regulations, policies not typically favoured by Wall Street.
That in turn could increase regulatory risks for banks, healthcare, big-tech and fossil fuel companies, while crimping after tax earnings and EPS valuations.
The risk was enough to see NASDAQ futures down 2% and the Frankfurt-listed shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) off 1.5%.
Rising yields outweighed some of those risks in banks with Wall Street's JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) poised for 2% gains at the open, while their European peers rallied hard with the region's banking index up 4.4%.
Futures for the Russell 2000 index - which tracks U.S. small-cap companies - rose 1.7% and were just shy of a record high. Small cap stocks are generally seen as the first to recover as the U.S. economy pulls out of a recession. 
European renewable energy stocks - already up since the U.S. presidential elections in November added to gains, on expectations that a Democratic 'Blue Wave' would unleash a 'green wave' of increasing spending on renewable energy.
For a graphic on Green stocks surge on Biden victory:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxjbgjvx/Pasted%20image%201609931228208.png
Shares in European wind-turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems and Siemens Gamesa rose 3% and 2.4% respectively.
Some investors were cautious about the potential for sweeping changes, however.
""While change is in the air for the U.S., changes in US legislation may not be very radical,"" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. 
""With a 50:50 distribution of seats in the Senate if the Democrats indeed prevail in Georgia, any legislation that does not garner some bipartisan support would have to be backed by the most moderate Democrats in the Senate to become law. Not all Democrats are in favour of what are called “very progressive” policies in the U.S."" 
Analysts assume a much-needed splurge on infrastructure would be positive for economic growth, jobs and sectors such as construction and transport.
Yet it would have to be funded by more borrowing, a negative for the dollar which is already creaking under the burden of ballooning budget and trade deficits.

""The U.S. basic balance of payments - the current account plus long‑term investment flows - is the most negative in over a decade, suggesting there is no underlying demand for dollars,"" said Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at CBA.

Under the new rules in England, schools are closed to most pupils, people should work from home if possible, and all hospitality and non-essential shops are closed. Semi-autonomous executives in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have imposed similar measures.
With the hospitality sector shut, there is pressure on supermarkets to meet demand. December trade hit record levels.
Asda, Britain's third largest supermarket group after market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, said it had strong product availability across its stores and depots and its staff were working around the clock to keep shelves stocked.
""Asda is also asking customers to play their part by continuing to shop considerately and not buy more than they normally would,"" it said.
The group is also stepping up its digital capacity to help more customers shop online during the crisis. 
Asda has increased its grocery home shopping capacity by 90% since last March to 850,000 weekly slots and expects this to rise to 900,000 slots per week by the start of April.
It is also doubling the size of its partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats with 200 stores providing customers with a 30-minute delivery service on 350 Asda-branded products from February.
Asda is currently owned by U.S. giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT). However, in October the Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital agreed to buy a majority holding in Asda in a deal giving it an enterprise value of $8.8 billion.

The deal, under which Walmart will keep a minority stake, requires regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2021.

1030,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 05:39AM ET</span>",StockBeat: European Stocks Like a Blue Wave More Than U.S. Ones,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Europe’s stock markets are taking the prospect of a delayed Blue Wave better than their counterparts in the U.S.
By mid-morning in London, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was up 0.7% at 403.60, a new post-pandemic high, as the more immediate challenges of the pandemic yielded to optimism over expectations of bigger U.S. stimulus packages under a Democrat-controlled Congress, accompanied by more action by the Federal Reserve to ensure that any increased debt issuance doesn’t lead to higher bond yields.
By contrast, U.S. stock futures were mostly lower: Dow Jones futures eked out a gain of 0.2% but Nasdaq futures fell 1.8% and S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%, as fears of tighter regulation and higher taxes – especially capital gains taxes – dominated.
The moves were a reaction to signs that Democratic candidates won both of Georgia’s two Senate seats in runoff elections on Tuesday. That result, if confirmed, will mean that the Republican Party loses control of the Senate: it is now split 50-50, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ casting vote in the event of a tie means that Biden will find it easier to push through his cabinet appointments and his future fiscal policy.
The market moves may look paradoxical but are easily enough explained. A fresh tide of U.S. stimulus will lift most, if not all, equity market boats around the world, while the effects of regulation and taxes will hit U.S. investors disproportionately.
Beyond that, though, the gains for Europe from a Blue Wave are less clear. True, it reduces the risk of trade wars between the U.S. and European Union, given that Biden and his team appear more committed to multilateral policymaking. But this was not an issue that depended on control of the Senate, and had been largely priced in already: shares in Remy Cointreau and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), two French drinks makers who were set to be hit with tariffs this year under the Trump administration’s plans, both fell over 1.2%.
More importantly, the prospect of a more concerted attempt by authorities to weaken the dollar and generate more inflation is pushing the euro up to a level where European exporters have – in recent years at least – started to struggle. The euro hit a fresh 32-month high of $1.2346 in response to the news and its upward momentum still appeared to be intact as of 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT).
Conspicuously, the commodities-heavy FTSE 100, up 1.8%, was far outperforming the export-sensitive German DAX, which rose only 0.8%.
Other big gainers in Europe included building materials group CRH (NYSE:CRH), which rose 5.6% on knee-jerk expectations of higher infrastructure spending from the new administration despite countless disappointments on this issue over the last decade. But banking stocks, too, gained on expectations of a faster global recovery that will reduce the risk of bad loans. After CRH, the Euro Stoxx 50’s biggest gainers were three banks: ING Group (NYSE:ING), Santander (MC:SAN) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), which all gained between 4% and 5.2%.
That's despite the obvious risk that the European Central Bank will be under more pressure to ease its own monetary policy further to keep the exchange rate at an acceptable level. Negative ECB rates and aggressive financial repression through quantitative easing have been two of the biggest factors behind the poor performance of Eurozone bank stocks in recent years. "

Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff held a slim lead over Republican David Perdue in the other, with 98% of votes counted, according to Edison. https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/GEORGIA-RUNOFF/xklvyjrjbpg
Along with a narrow majority for Democrats in the House of Representatives, a ""blue sweep"" of Congress could usher in larger fiscal stimulus and pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes. 
""A Democratic-led government is expected to add more stimulus, essentially spend more, to help mitigate the virus crisis,"" said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions, APAC, at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""That means that there's going to be a weaker dollar.""
Analysts generally assume a Democrat-controlled Senate would be positive for economic growth globally and thus for most riskier assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar on the assumption the U.S. budget and trade deficits would swell even further.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose above 1% for the first time since March, on expectations of larger government borrowing under a Senate split 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the upper chamber, becoming the tie-breaker.

Other industries, such as banks, oil and gas and healthcare, could come under heavier scrutiny, while infrastructure and alternative energy sectors could benefit.

GM, China's second biggest foreign automaker, delivered 2.9 million vehicles in the country last year, the company said on Wednesday, for a third straight decline in annual sales.
But sales have been recovering in the second half of last year, up 12% between July and September and 14% in the final three months.
GM has a Shanghai-based joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp, in which the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicle brands are made. It also has another Liuzhou-based venture, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, in which they make no-frills minivans and have started to make higher-end cars.
Sales of its Buick brand grew 4% on the year and Wuling rose 9%, the statement said. Luxury brand Cadillac's sales increased 8%.
Sales of GM's more affordable Baojun brand dropped 33% last year, while sales of its mass-market Chevrolet tumbled 30%.

Michelin's share price was up 0.7% shortly after the stock market open, outperforming a 0.15% rise in Paris' CAC 40 index.
The job cuts equate to almost 2% of its global workforce.
The COVID-19 pandemic has hammered the auto industry, which was already struggling with the shift to electric vehicles from diesel and gasoline cars.
""The plan is part of a broad co-construction and social dialogue approach and will rely on negotiating a three-year framework agreement that will not entail any layoffs"", the group said in a statement.
""The plan does not rely on plant closures"", it added.
Michelin said the measures would affect up to 1,100 positions in offices and 1,200 positions in plants, stressing nearly 60% of the job reductions would be based on voluntary early retirement schemes.

The company, which employs more than 127,000 worldwide, also said it remained committed to locating ""high value-added businesses in France"", saying its ""ambitious expansion strategy in hydrogen solutions"" was an illustration of this.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, with investors keeping a watchful eye on U.S. political developments as well as the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
At 3:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.8%. 
U.S. TV networks called one of the runoffs for Georgia's two seats in the U.S. Senate for Democrat Raphael Warnock, while election prediction services such as Decision Desk HQ indicated that Jon Ossoff was also on course to unseat Republican David Perdue. The results are expected to be announced later Wednesday. These votes are seen as crucial in deciding whether President-elect Joe Biden enjoys full control of Congress or faces stiff opposition to his plans.
A win for the Democrat pair would likely result in more stimulus and tax hikes as well as greater corporate regulation. However, a win for either or both of the incumbent Republican candidates would mean a much more difficult path for Biden’s agenda.
Back in Europe, the European Medicines Agency is expected to give its assessment of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine later Wednesday. 
A new strain of the Covid-19 virus has forced the U.K. to enter another national lockdown earlier this week, while Germany on Tuesday extended its own lockdown until Jan. 31. 
The U.K. has approved the use of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford University drugs, and its vaccination campaign is proceeding relatively quickly. However, the rest of Europe has been slower in implementing its program.
In corporate news,  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stock rose 0.7% after the French tire maker said it would cut up to 2,300 jobs over three years as part of a new cost-cutting plan.
Turning to economic data, the major release will be the final European composite PMI number for December, while French inflation disappointed, coming in flat on the year, but consumer confidence came in ahead of expectations for December.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Alibaba plans $5 billion bond this month amid regulatory scrutiny - sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd plans to raise at least $5 billion through the sale of a U.S. dollar-denominated bond this month, four people with knowledge of the matter said, amid regulatory scrutiny of co-founder Jack Ma's empire.
Depending on investor response, proceeds could reach $8 billion which the e-commerce leader is likely to use for general corporate expenditure, one of the people said.
The fundraising will be a test of investor sentiment towards Alibaba, amid a regulatory crackdown on it and financial technology affiliate Ant Group. Chinese officials have come down hard on Ma's business empire since he publicly criticised the country's regulatory system in October setting off a chain of events that resulted in the halting of Ant Group's $37 billion stock market listing.
Ma's absence from public view in the intervening time has fuelled social media speculation over his whereabouts.
The bond sale plan, including timeline, is not finalised and is subject to change, the people said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Alibaba declined to comment.
Since Ma's speech, Chinese regulators have begun an antitrust probe into Alibaba and ordered fintech Ant to change its lending and other consumer finance businesses, including the creation of a holding company to meet capital requirements.
U.S. President Donald Trump has also ratcheted up tensions, moving to ban transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Group's Alipay mobile payment app.
Chinese regulators are also reviewing Ant's equity investments in dozens of companies and considering whether to instruct the firm to divest some of those investments, Reuters has reported.
""Investors will need Jack Ma to make some sort of public appearance to give them confidence for the bond to be well received,"" said an Asia credit analyst with a European bank, who was not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be identified.
""Given Alibaba's current situation they'll need to price it at a premium,"" the analyst said. ""But in the long term Alibaba is still a company worth investing in.""
Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares rose as much as 4% on Wednesday, versus a 0.4% decline in the benchmark index. The stock's price had fallen 5.6% over the last three sessions.
Last month, Alibaba said it would increase the value of a share repurchase programme to $10 billion from $6 billion.
DEBT MARKET BOOM
Alibaba's international bond offering, if finalised, would be the group's third, Refinitiv data showed. It sold an $8 billion U.S. dollar bond in 2014, and a $7 billion tranche in 2017, the data showed.
With its latest bond sale, Alibaba will join a slew of Asian companies that in recent months have taken advantage of cheaper borrowing costs and abundant liquidity in global markets.
Companies sold was $363.2 billion worth of U.S. dollar bonds in Asia last year, 9% more than a year earlier and the highest value on record, Dealogic data showed.
The terms of Alibaba's offering were not immediately known. Two of the people said the tenure is likely to be 10 years and that marketing documents were likely to be available as soon as next week.
One of the people involved in the deal said Alibaba wanted to use the issuance to send a message to the market that ""in the light of the latest regulatory scrutiny, the firm is still doing fine and has the backing of some investors"".
LightStream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri, who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, said Alibaba has about $10 billion worth of long-term debt due in November so it makes sense to refinance it - even if timing suggests this is about instilling confidence.

""However, I'm more pragmatic and would still be worried to go long on Alibaba with the current regulatory scurrility.""

The PIMCO GIS Global Bond Fund was the top-rated global fixed income fund, and the Swiss AtonRa Fund was the highest-ranked in large-cap global equities, according to the platform, which enables sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and funds of funds to rate investment funds.
While global economies reel from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many assets have performed well, boosted by stimulus from governments and central banks.
Rather than focusing on past performance, however, the allocators rate funds based on the quality of their asset managers, the fees they charge and the make-up of the funds' portfolios, including environmental, social and governance factors, Oren Kaplan, co-founder and CEO of SharingAlpha, said.
SharingAlpha, which set up in 2016 as a TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) style platform for fund reviews, has more than 13,000 fund selectors on its platform, rating over 12,000 funds.
The pandemic had resulted in ""exponential growth"" in the use of the platform to search for funds, Kaplan told Reuters.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>","Huawei to pack less of a punch in the new year after bruising 2020, analysts say","By David Kirton
SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd this year will likely see slower 5G business and push further into software, while hoping its smartphones get a reprieve from U.S. sanctions which last year struck the chip-reliant heart of its group, analysts said.
Limited access to high-end semiconductors means rationing during China's network upgrade, they said, while the dissection of its mobile arm will send Huawei tumbling down rankings while it continues to develop a proprietary operating system.
China's leading telecommunications equipment maker found itself on a U.S. trade blacklist in May 2019 due to national security concerns. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is a risk.
That effectively banned U.S.-based firms from selling Huawei essential U.S. technology. Last August, the ban was extended to foreign firms with U.S. business, reaching chief suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).
The change hit an Achilles heel as Huawei depends on TSMC to make advanced chips for its handsets, fifth-generation (5G) network base stations, servers, cloud computing and artificial intelligence products, said Paul Triolo, head of global tech policy at Eurasia Group. Stockpiles only last so long, he said.
""Passage of this death sentence does not involve a swift execution,"" technology analyst Dan Wang said in a client note. ""Instead, the process is much more like a slow strangulation.""
Huawei declined to comment.
Wang said Huawei will feel the impact most acutely in its consumer business, which brought in 54% of revenue in 2019.
In November, Huawei spun off budget smartphone line Honor in a sale founder Ren Zhengfei said would allow the brand to regain access to chips. Huawei could look to do the same with its premium lines this year, Triolo said.
Huawei was the world's biggest smartphone maker as recent as the second quarter of 2020, but the Honor sale and chip shortage will likely take it out of the top six this year, said data firm Trendforce.
Its luck may change with the U.S. presidential inauguration of Joe Biden, from whom analysts expect more leniency towards Huawei's smartphone business. The inauguration this month comes as Chief Financial Officer Meng Wangzhou discusses a deal with U.S. prosecutors over allegations of doing business with Iran.
In the meantime, Huawei will likely focus on the Harmony operating system it is developing for its smartphones after being cut off from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android, said Nicole Peng, VP of Mobility at consultancy Canalys.
Elsewhere in software, Huawei will likely pivot more towards services such as cloud computing and internet-of-things devices, though these are unlikely to offset slowdown in smartphones and telecommunication infrastructure, analysts said.
Huawei's network business does have bright prospects, but with major markets such as Britain and Japan banning its equipment, it will likely focus on China, analysts said.
The company has enough chips to make around 500,000 5G base stations, said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Edison Lee. Yet rather than use up that supply, the government will likely slow 5G introduction, taking ""a middle-of-the-road approach to balance between expanding coverage and waiting for Huawei to catch up,"" he said.

1042,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 01:18AM ET</span>",Treasury 10-Year Yield Hits 1% for First Time Since March Tumult,"(Bloomberg) -- Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields touched 1% for the first time since the pandemic-driven turmoil in March as traders weighed the possibility of Democrats winning control of the U.S. Senate.
The 10-year yield, a key global benchmark interest rate, climbed as much as five basis points, on expectation that the Democrats could win two runoff Senate elections in Georgia. The move drove the yield curve steeper, reflecting expectations for a spending surge that would revive the U.S. economy.
“The Georgia election results have been one of the key uncertainties plaguing global markets -- the Democrats pulling ahead has a clear implication on U.S. fiscal policy and bonds,” said Andrew Ticehurst, strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Sydney. “Additional stimulus would have to be funded and markets have clearly indicated they want to test the 1% level for Treasuries today.”
Treasury yields were gaining ahead of the U.S. elections in Nov propelled in part by the expectation of more stimulus under a Democrat-led government. The move then faltered with control over the Senate in balance until the Georgia races, though progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollouts have also buoyed yields, along with the easing in global trade tensions after a historic post-Brexit agreement.
Inflationary expectations have also gained, with the 10-year breakeven rate -- a measure that draws on the pricing of inflation-linked Treasuries -- climbing past 2%, a level last seen more than two years ago.
Investors will be watching whether the 10-year Treasury yield’s advance can push beyond March’s high of 1.27%, for a clear sign of a breakout from the tight ranges that prevailed through much of last year.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese money managers are rushing to launch new energy funds, seeking to capitalize on investors' green fever which has been fuelled by President Xi Jinping's carbon neutrality pledge.
China's first photovoltaic industry exchange-traded fund (ETF), launched by Huatai-PineBridge Fund Management Co in December attracted hot demand, with assets under management jumping nearly six-fold in just a month to 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion).
A slew of mutual fund houses are following suit, with Yinhua Fund Management Co raising money for a rival product this week while Tianhong Asset Management Co plans to launch an index fund that invests in solar power companies next Monday. More green energy funds are in the pipeline.
The funds will likely bring more money into an already red-hot sector. China's new energy index doubled last year, pushing up the sector's earnings multiples to almost 90 compared with 22 for Chinese stocks broadly.
""Renewable energy is the only option for the human race in the combat against climate change,"" said Richard Pan, portfolio manager at China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC). 
Pan, who made lucrative investments in battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) and solar equipment maker Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor Co, said the government's green pledges and China's strong competitiveness in new energy means the industry has much more room to grow. 
President Xi has vowed to make China, the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, carbon neutral by 2060. The commitment will require more than $5 trillion of investment in renewable power and other sectors, consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates.
Xi also pledged to raise wind and solar capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030, more than double the current level. 
China's ""energy revolution"" will boost solar power, said Kai Wenming, analyst at New Times Securities, who forecast a 67.3% capacity expansion this year. 
Investors are also encouraged by the fact that technological advances helped slash solar production costs by 90% over the past decade, weaning the industry off government subsidies, said Liu Xiaoming, who will manage Tianhong's new photovoltaic fund.
Other funds preparing to launch solar energy funds include Harvest Fund Management Co, Guotai Asset Management Co, and Penghua Fund Management Co.
But soaring stock prices are fuelling fears of a bubble, with China's new energy index already jumping over 8% in the first two trading days of 2021.
""The sector's prospect is bright, but valuation is too high,"" said Stephen Huang, vice president at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management Co, a hedge fund house.
""We're seeing too much exuberance.""

Dicos will replace its conventional egg patty in items like breakfast burgers and bagels with the U.S. firm's 'Just Egg' - made from mung beans - at restaurants in cities including Beijing and Shanghai, Eat Just's co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Josh Tetrick told Reuters in a telephone interview. Though still a tiny business compared to China's giant animal based supply chain, vegetarian alternatives to meat, dairy and seafood are rapidly gaining in popularity. Euromonitor International, a market research provider, predicted China's meat substitutes market would be worth $12.3 billion by 2025 up from $10.8 billion in 2020.
Tetrick didn't disclose financial terms of Eat Just's deal with Dicos, but he said the COVID-19 pandemic had renewed concerns about domestic food safety in China. ""There is more awareness in China on safety, on clean protein and protein free of antibiotics,"" said Tetrick. He said his company was in talks with other Chinese restaurant chains to supply Just Egg.
Dicos confirmed its cooperation with Eat Just on social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) on Wednesday, stating it was ""an innovative new food that helped to support sustainable development for humanity in future"". Dicos launched vegan chicken burgers and nuggets in October last year. Brands like  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), KFC, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc, and Oatly rolled out plant based food and beverage offerings in China last year, in an aim to pull in more curious and environmentally conscious diners.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with vote counting for a U.S. Senate runoff election in the state of Georgia currently underway.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.33% by 9:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.05%. The Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December, released earlier in the day, read 56.3, above the 50-mark indicating expansion but lower than November’s 57.8 figure.
The data follows Monday’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which read 53 for December, as well as the release of the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI during the previous week.
Tensions between the U.S. and China are up, with U.S. President Donald Trump also signing an order banning U.S. transactions with eight digital Chinese payment platforms, including Ant Group’s Alipay.
Investors are also focused on whether the New York Stock exchange will delist China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941),  China Telecom Corp Ltd  (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd (NYSE:CHU) on security grounds. Although the bourse reversed its decision to delist the trio on Tuesday, it could reportedly restart delisting plans.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.50%. Over 50 activists and politicians were taken into custody earlier in the day on suspicion of violating the city’s national security law. The group included former opposition politicians Alvin Yeung, James To, Andrew Wan and Lam Cheuk-ting, as well as academic and activist Benny Tai.
The charges stem from an informal primary in July 2020 to choose candidates for the legislative election due to have taken place in September and which was subsequently postponed.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.38% and South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.08%. In Australia, the ASX 200 slid 1.09%.
In the Georgia election, the two Democrat candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock currently have leads in early returns.
The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a short-term backseat as investors await the election results, due later in the day. A win for the Democrat pair would mean that President-elect Joe Biden can push his agenda, which includes more stimulus and tax hikes, more easily through a Democrat-controlled Congress. However, a win for the two incumbent Republican candidates would mean a much more difficult path for Biden’s agenda.
“Democrats would need to win both races to control the Senate and hence both houses, allowing them far more freedom to run larger fiscal packages,” Nordea Investment senior market strategist Sebastien Galy said in a note.
“A dual win should lead to a steeper curve and a weaker dollar as the fiscal situation would be seen as unsustainable, but it would also be welcomed by the equity market, particularly cyclicals, while in growth pressure might appear on the monopolistic Internet giants.,” the note added.
Congress will also meet to count the electoral votes from the Nov. 3 presidential election and certify Biden’s victory later in the day. The Federal Reserve will also release the minutes from its December policy meeting."

The end of the consent order is a positive sign for the bank, which has been trying to repair its frayed relationship with regulators, particularly the OCC, which has taken a tough line on the fourth-largest lender in the United States. 
Wells Fargo is still working on a separate 2018 sweeping OCC consent order related to the mis-selling of mortgage and auto-insurance products, which imposes a number of constraints on the bank's business. 
The anti-money laundering consent order terminated on Tuesday required the bank to implement customer due diligence standards, which included the collection of current beneficial ownership information for certain business customers. 
Wells Fargo said on Tuesday it had undertaken significant work to enhance its bank secrecy act/anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) compliance program. 
The end of the consent order provides new Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf momentum going into the January earnings call, where he plans to unveil his vision to reshape the scandal-plagued bank. 

Scharf has repeatedly said that the bank was not moving efficiently enough to resolve its regulatory woes.

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher Tuesday as rallying oil prices on a surprise Saudi production cut sent energy stocks soaring, but upside was limited by uncertainty over the outcome of the Georgia election run-offs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55%, or 167 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.95%. 
Energy stocks supported the broader market as oil prices jumped above $50 for the first time since February after Saudi Arabia pledged to cut output by 1 million barrels a day from January levels to offset a rise in output from OPEC+, led by Russia and Kazakhstan.
The agreement allows Russia and Kazakhstan to lift production by 75,000 bpd in February from January levels and another 75,000 bpd in March.
Gains were kept in check as investors awaited results from the Georgian runoff elections that holds the key to control of the Senate. Voting closes at 7pm EST on Tuesday. 
""Market sentiment toward potential outcomes is mixed, with a Democratic victory likely resulting in more fiscal stimulus in the short-term, but higher taxation and regulation in the long-term,"" D.A. Davidson said in a note.

The overall sentiment on the aviation sector, however, appears timid on fears of further restrictions as the new coronavirus variant that sent the UK into lockdown has been detected across four different states so far.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",Ontario has 'fiscal firepower' to provide pandemic support -new finance minister,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario has the fiscal capacity to support its economy during the coronavirus pandemic, the new finance minister of Canada's most populous province told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that debt sustainability is a priority for another time.
""The fiscal sustainability of this province is a focus of ours in the long term but right now what's important is that we protect the health and well being of people,"" Peter Bethlenfalvy said in an interview.
Bethlenfalvy was appointed as Ontario's finance minister last Thursday, replacing Rod Phillips, who resigned after public outrage over a Caribbean vacation he took last month.
""We have the capacity to provide the fiscal firepower to keep Ontarians safe,"" said Bethlenfalvy, who also serves as President of the Treasury Board and has previously worked for financial sector firms, including Manulife Financial (NYSE:MFC) Corp and TD Securities.
Ontario, one of the world's largest sub-sovereign borrowers, projected in November a record budget deficit of C$38.5 billion ($30.4 billion) for 2020-21 and additional shortfalls over future years as it raised pandemic-related spending.
The yield on Ontario's 10-year bond has fallen by about 80 basis points since last March to 1.34%, helped by Bank of Canada interest rate cuts and a program by the central bank to buy provincial bonds.
Last month, credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar, which gives Ontario its fourth highest rating of AA (low), said a negative rating action could result from the government's failure to reduce budget deficits over the medium term.
Much like the rest of Canada, Ontario has seen a resurgence in coronavirus infections. It began a lockdown on Dec. 26 to curb the spread of the virus, which is likely to weigh on the economy.
The province has been using contingency funds set aside in the November budget, Bethlenfalvy said, adding that he has spoken since his appointment to Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland about the prospect of increased transfers from the federal government to fund healthcare.
""We have been very clear about the Canada health transfers to help support our top priority, which is our health system,"" said Bethlenfalvy. ""We have an aging population, we have a pandemic.""

(Reuters) -Qualcomm Inc, the world's biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, said on Tuesday it had named its president and chip division head Cristiano Amon as its new chief executive.
Amon, who has been with the San Diego-based company since 1995 and became president in 2018, will replace outgoing CEO Steven Mollenkopf, effective June 30. 
In recent years Amon has overseen the company's chip division, which supplies processors to most Android phones and modem chips that help Android devices and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhones connect to wireless data networks. 
A strong proponent of 5G, the new generation of faster wireless networks, he has led Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s push to put 5G chips into low and mid-priced handsets. He has also guided the company's expansion into new areas such as 5G infrastructure equipment, automotive computers and personal computers.
""We have been at the forefront of innovation for decades and I look forward to maintaining this position going forward,"" said the 50-year-old, a native of Brazil who restores vintage muscle cars in his spare time.
But Amon, who also played a role in Qualcomm's licensing division as company president, will face some tough challenges as CEO, such as how to deal with Qualcomm's heavy reliance on intellectual property from Arm Ltd for its processor chips.
Arm is in the middle of a $40 billion takeover by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, which has a brewing rivalry with Qualcomm in chips for artificial intelligence. 
Amon could be forced to find a replacement for Arm's intellectual property if Qualcomm concludes that depending on a competitor creates too much long-term risk. 
Qualcomm has already started using more of its own intellectual property in chips for artificial intelligence and is using an Arm alternative called RISC-V in certain parts of its phone processors.
Qualcomm designs chips but outsources their manufacturing, largely to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd in Korea. U.S. lawmakers recently approved a program to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Amon said Qualcomm, which has huge sway with chip factories because of its sales volume, plans to retain its outsourcing strategy but would consider future U.S. factories.
""We're one of the few companies that actually have multi-sourcing on the leading node. And we expect to be that way,"" he told reporters during a press conference. ""We actually look very favorably on more foundry investment, including in the United States. That's very good for Qualcomm and very good for the industry.""
The current CEO, Mollenkopf, is himself no stranger to challenges, having guided Qualcomm through three crises: A hostile takeover attempt by Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, an antitrust challenge by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and a protracted legal battle with Apple. 
Qualcomm prevailed in all three cases, and the 52-year-old, who has been with the company for 26 years, leaves with its shares riding at nearly three times their value during the depth of the crises.
""Steve navigated through unprecedented circumstances during his tenure, facing more in his seven years as CEO than most leaders face in their entire careers,"" said Mark McLaughlin, chair of Qualcomm's board.

Mollenkopf will remain with Qualcomm as an adviser for a period of time, the company said.

1061,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",White American Wealth Hits Record High on Pandemic Stocks Surge,"(Bloomberg) --
The net worth of White Americans hit a record high last year, driven by a stock-market rebound that defied the pandemic, while other ethnic groups saw their share of the nation’s wealth decline, according to recently released data from the Federal Reserve.
Wealth held by White households rose to $98.6 trillion in the third quarter of 2020. That amounts to 84.6% of the total, the biggest share in three years.
By contrast, the portion of overall wealth held by Black Americans fell to 3.8% -- down from 4.4% two years earlier -- while for Hispanic Americans it dropped to 2.1%.
The shift was largely driven by stock markets. White households own almost 90% of corporate equities and mutual funds, which posted a $2 trillion jump in value during the third quarter.
Meanwhile, assets held by other groups proved more vulnerable to the coronavirus slump. Wealth held by Hispanic households in the form of business ownership, for example, slumped by almost one-quarter from a year earlier to $188 billion, the lowest since 2013.
Non-Hispanic White people account for about 60% of the U.S. population. That figure has been declining in the longer term, one reason why the White share of national wealth has dropped from 92% in 2000. White Americans are also older on average than other groups, meaning they’ve had more time to accumulate wealth.

1062,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 12:42PM ET</span>",Roku Rallies on Street-High Price Target as Quibi Talks Underway,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --    Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) rose 4% after getting a Street-high price target from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), ahead of a potential acquisition of Quibi.
The firm boosted its price target on the streaming provider to $414 from $275 as we keep streaming. 
Shares hit a record last month, after more than doubling over the year. Wells Fargo is seeing opportunity in AVOD: advertising-based video on demand, in which ad revenue is used to offset production and hosting costs.
“Despite a strong rally in Roku we think there is a big runway for ROKU’s AVOD-driven ARPU in 2021+,"" Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in a note. ""Streaming behaviors for the 2015-2019 period were largely driven by content on subscription video on demand (e.g. NFLX, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime, Disney+) and YouTube, whereas 2020 and beyond suggests a big push into monetizable AVOD.”
Quibi was the biggest bust of the streaming boom. But it has something Roku wants — more than 100 original programs.
Roku is in talks with the failed service Quibi, which announced that it was closing six months after a much-hyped introduction, The New York Times reported, citing a person familiar. The deal is apparently close to completion. Quibi was created by film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg.
Yesterday, Roku started streaming Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Plus alongside Amazon's Fire TV, The Verge reported. Discovery Plus will include shows spun off from Discovery channel stalwarts, like 90 Day Fiancé, a new travel and food series from Bobby Flay and Giada de Laurentiis of the Food Network and and a new series from Magnolia Network’s Chip and Joanna Gaines, hosts of the Fixer Upper home repair series.
On the other side of the table, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell slightly after Rosenblatt said it sees churn risk as The Office moves to NBC's Peacock and prices rise.

""I certainly would expect a lot of Goldman Sachs employees back in full by the end of the year. We will get through this, and I'm really hopeful that over the course of the next six months we see a real improvement,"" Solomon said in the interview. https://bloom.bg/3pPnh81
The current focus for the bank is to get employees vaccinated, Solomon said, adding he was encouraged by the amount of vaccine production, but ""flexible, efficient"" ways need to be found to get shots distributed.
More than two-thirds of the 15 million coronavirus vaccines shipped within the United States have gone unused, U.S. health officials said on Monday, as the governors of New York and Florida vowed to penalize hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly.
Many Wall Street firms saw offices empty out as they shifted to working from home earlier in 2020 as the COVID-19 virus spread rapidly and companies reported confirmed cases. The country's biggest banks have since seen small numbers of employees return to work. 

Goldman Sachs declined to comment beyond the Bloomberg interview.

Citi analyst Christopher Danely upgraded the memory and storage company to buy from sell with a price target of $100, up from $35, according to StreetInsider. On Tuesday, it was trading around $78.
The DRAM downturn is finally over and a ""real,"" prolonged upturn is ahead, according to Danely. It's ""time to go long the 'Cron.""
DRAM represented about 68% of 2020 revenue. Shares have about doubled since March, boosting Micron's valuation. The stock is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 18 times, according to Yahoo Finance.
Despite the increased valuation, Danely sees ""plenty of upside as DRAM upturns usually last two years and supply/demand looks favorable over at least the next year.""
Susquehanna maintained a buy and increased the price target on Micron to $90 from $85.
""With key customers like Kingston (~12%) starting to refresh inventories while MU is benefiting from a richer mix of higher-margin products (GDDR6, HBM2E), consensus earnings estimates are expected to continue to go higher towards the (updated) peak EPS power of $9.00,"" analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a note, according to StreetInsider.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were up after a weak start on Tuesday as investors waited for the outcome of Georgia's Senate runoff elections, which are expected to determine the balance of power in Washington.
While a ""blue sweep"" of Congress could usher in greater fiscal stimulus to aid the coronavirus-ravaged economy, it could also pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes, hurting some areas of the market.
""Investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude ... there's a lot to be concerned about - not only in the U.S. with the elections but also because of the different strains of the virus that are now being reported around the globe,"" CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said.
The latest polls from data website 538 gave a slight edge to the two Democratic challengers in their respective races.
The Cboe Volatility Index flip-flopped after closing at its highest level in two months in the prior session, which saw Wall Street's main indexes drop to two-week lows on concerns over a persistent surge in coronavirus cases.
All major S&P sectors were higher, with energy stocks surging about 2% on the back of higher oil prices. [O/R]

Although the start of vaccine rollouts and massive monetary support powered the major U.S. stock indexes to record levels recently, the discovery of a more contagious strain of the coronavirus and the latest virus-related curbs have muddied the economic outlook.
Britain began its third national lockdown to fight the spread of a highly contagious variant that threatens to overwhelm the healthcare system. Meanwhile, New York on Monday found its first case of the ""UK"" variant.
""The market could end up being choppy for much of the first quarter as investors try to digest soft economic data because of the most current lockdowns,"" Stovall said.
ISM survey showed U.S. manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in December, likely as spiraling new COVID-19 infections pulled demand away from services towards goods.

U.S.-listed shares of China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd added about 10% each, while those of China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd advanced 16% after the NYSE reversed its decision to delist the stocks.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, as investors appeared largely content to adopt a wait-and-see policy ahead of the runoff elections for Georgia's two Senate seats.
The outcome of those elections - which is only expected to be clear on Wednesday morning according to state officials - will determine who has control of the Senate for the next two years. A single Republican victory would be enough to keep the upper chamber in the hands of the GOP, and defend its leverage over fiscal policy. If, however, both seats fall to the Democratic Party candidates, then the Democrats will have control of the presidency and both chambers, potentially paving the way for some sharp increases both in federal spending and taxes.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 159 points, or 0.5%, at 30,383 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were also up in parallel by 0.5%. All three cash indices had lost over 1% on Monday, the first time they had opened the year with a down day since 2016.
The mood was supported by signs of strength in U.S. manufacturing, with the Institute of Supply Management's activity index rising to its highest in 2 1/2 years at 60.7, defying expectations for a slight decline.
Among the conspicuous early movers was sports streaming service Fubotv (NYSE:FUBO), which rose 17% after issuing preliminary fourth-quarter numbers. The company said it had 545,000 subscribers as of year-end. After that bounce, the stock is now roughly where it was before being caught up in a speculative bubble in the middle of last month, which led to the stock doubling, then falling as much as 70%. Even before this morning's numbers, brokerages had started to say that the rout had gone too far.
Oil and gas stocks were lifted by reports suggesting that Russia and OPEC are set to abandon plans to raise their collective output by 500,000 barrels a day as of February. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose by 5.7%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose by 2.2% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose by 1.8%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell by 1.2% after figures that showed it losing market share in what is proportionally the most developed electric vehicle market in the world. The company was comfortably outsold last year by the likes of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Hyundai in Norway, where EVs accounted for over half of all new car registrations. That contrasts with its ongoing pre-eminence in the U.S. and Chinese markets for EVs.

LONDON (Reuters) -World shares struggled on Tuesday amid new COVID lockdowns in Europe and Senate runoff races in Georgia that could affect incoming U.S. President Joe Biden's ability to pursue his preferred economic policies.
Wall Street was expected to extend its worst start to a year since 2016 (N) and with volatility gauges up, the euro strong and Germany expected to follow Britain with a lockdown extension, European equities were under pressure. [.EU][/FRX] 
The FTSEurofirst 300 fell 0.5% as London, Frankfurt, Paris and U.S. futures all dropped between 0.2%-0.8%, leaving MSCI's main world index, which tracks nearly 50 countries, flat too. (N)
Markets were also watching to see whether Tuesday's Georgia run-off election enables the Democrats to flip both Senate seats and disrupt what markets have viewed as a delicate political balance in Washington following November's election. 
""The result could be quite crucial on how much leeway Biden has to push his own agenda,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management's global head of multi-asset solutions, Matthias Scheiber.
Markets are likely to ""move on"" if the vote sees Republicans maintain control of the Senate, Scheiber said, whereas they could react to a Democrat win that would make additional fiscal stimulus, but also stiffer regulation for the energy and tech sectors, more likely.
""We could see quite a mixed market,"" he said, adding that investors had also been increasingly looking to hedge their equity positions following the recent strong rally.
The currency markets were in focus again too as the dollar's slide continued. 
Overnight China raised its official yuan exchange rate by the biggest margin since abandoning its peg in 2005, which helped support demand for other currencies and kept MSCI's emerging-market currency index near the record high it had hit on Monday. [EMRG/FRX]
In the international 'offshore' market, the yuan strengthened as far as 6.4419 for the first time since June 2018. It started the week at 6.4944 and has now surged more than 12% since May as China's economy has rebounded and near-zero U.S. interest rates have cut the dollar's appeal.
""It's a very big move by any historical yardstick,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney. ""And I don't think you can ignore that.""
GEORGIA ON MARKETS' MIND
The high-flying euro also rose 0.2% to $1.22765 after reaching as high as $1.231 on Monday. 
The British pound also regained 0.2% to sit at $1.3573, having tumbled the previous day after a surge in COVID cases in the United Kingdom forced another nationwide lockdown until mid-February.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended at a record high thanks to chunky gains in South Korean and Chinese stocks. 
Japanese shares lost 0.4% as the country saw coronavirus infections hit record levels again.
In Hong Kong, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) rallied by more than 6% after the New York Stock Exchange suddenly scrapped plans to de-list the companies' shares following a U.S. executive order.
S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones stock futures were all fractionally lower ahead of their restart. (N).
Both Georgia elections are tight and the results may not be immediately known, which could lead to a repeat of the chaotic vote re-counts after the U.S. presidential election in November.
Outgoing Republican President Donald Trump's call to pressure Georgia's top election official to ""find"" votes to overturn his loss to President-elect Biden in the state has also unnerved some investors.
""While a possible Democratic victory (in Georgia) could raise concerns about more regulation, at least over the coming months this might be outweighed by expectations of larger fiscal stimulus,"" ING analysts wrote in a note.
In commodity markets, oil firmed as traders awaited a meeting later on Tuesday where major crude producers are set to decide output levels for February. [O/R]
Both Brent and U.S. crude futures were up 1.6% at $51.90 and $48.40 a barrel respectively. Gold also inched up 0.2% to $1,946 per ounce while cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which surged 300% last year, steadied at $31,500 after a sharp drop the previous day. [GOL/]

J.P.Morgan said in a research note that ""speculative mania"" could push Bitcoin to between $50k-$100k, though it added that such price levels ""would prove unsustainable"".

Honda also suspended production for a few days in December as some major container ports, such as Felixstowe, struggled to cope with disruption caused by COVID-19, pre-Brexit stockpiling and Christmas. 
The pandemic has upended normal trade flows, leaving stranded empty cargo containers in the wrong places, spawning bottlenecks around the world. 
Output at Honda's southern English factory in Swindon had resumed on Monday after the festive break. 
""The situation is currently being monitored with a view to re-start production on Thursday 7 January,"" the Japanese carmaker said in a statement. 
Major automakers operate just-in-time manufacturing, meaning some parts arrive moments before they are fitted to vehicles. 
Honda made just under 110,000 Civic cars in Britain in 2019 but is due to permanently close the site this year.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",How shoe tycoon Steve Madden got back on his feet,"By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steve Madden, founder and design chief of a multibillion-dollar eponymous shoe brand, knows something about being sanguine in a tough situation. 
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money laundering and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 41 months in prison. Madden had to resign as CEO of  Steven Madden  (NASDAQ:SHOO) Ltd , the company he founded in 1990 with just $1,100 in the bank. He remains the company's creative and design chief.
“First thing I learned in prison is to not whine about my situation. It was not helpful,” Madden said. “You can easily get into 'woe is me' - everybody does. But you’re better off looking at the positive.”
Last fall, Madden published a memoir, “The Cobbler: How I Disrupted an Industry, Fell From Grace & Came Back Stronger Than Ever,” about his experiences building his company, his conviction, prison time and recovery from drug addiction. 
Madden, 62, talked to Reuters about all the lessons he learned along the way and how he is surviving this pandemic. Edited excerpts are below. 
Q. What is the toughest job you have had?
A. Working in a shoe store. I started when I was 20, at Jildor in Cedarhurst, New York. It rivals prison as the longest two years of my life. 
As a shoe salesman, you have to learn how to be subservient and work hard and pay attention. But the biggest thing I learned was how to sell and what women want. That was a big thing. 
Q. What kept you going in prison?
A. I worked out a lot, and I read a lot of novels. I was always a reader but being able to take flight and go to another place when you read the book - it was really wonderful. I read a lot of '70s and '80s novels because that's what was available to me - Herman Wouk’s “War and Remembrance,” “The Winds of War."" I read all the books by Mario Puzo and Dominick Dunne. I like novels that ring true.
Q. What is your biggest challenge now?
A. Spending a lot of time alone is not the greatest place for someone who's a recovering addict. An alcoholic by himself is behind enemy lines. So I’ve been talking to other alcoholics and addicts online.
I’ve found that a little bit of fear can help you stay sober. I know once I open that trap door there's no coming back - and that’s very scary.
Q. What big lesson did you learn in 2020?
A. I always thought it would be bad shoes or something that would do me in - I didn’t think it would be a bug. While you’re never prepared for something like this, I think you should be prepared to lose some things.
Anything can happen. Stay somewhat humble and know that some of the gifts in our lives can be taken away. 
Q. What is the best piece of advice you have received?
A. The little things are hugely important. It’s something I learned from this fellow I worked for at the shoe store. If one of the shoe displays in the window was messed up, he would just lose his mind, because what is the message you are sending about your business to the public? 
There’s a line from a W.H. Auden poem that I love, “The crack in the tea-cup opens / A lane to the land of the dead.” I don't even know what Auden meant, but I know what it means to me - it’s my business philosophy.
Q. What advice do you have for those starting out right now?
A. There’s always time for a new idea, good ideas and hard work. I can’t remember ever in my life feeling that I'd hate to be a newcomer starting out now. I don’t buy that. There’s always room for something new.
Q. What do you think work attire will look like after the pandemic?
A. Right now, I wear my pajamas a lot. I do Zoom calls and I try to wear a nice T-shirt, but I’m in pajamas. You can’t see them because you can only see me from the chest up. 
After work-from-home, I think people are going to be more casual. Sneakers are going to be more important. I think dress shoes will be a casualty of war.

1084,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>",NYSE Scraps Plan to Delist China Telcos in ‘Bizarre’ U-Turn,"(Bloomberg) -- The New York Stock Exchange said it will no longer delist China’s three biggest state-owned telecommunications companies, backtracking on a plan that had threatened to escalate tensions between the world’s largest economies.
The U-turn came with scant explanation just four days after the NYSE said it would remove the shares to comply with a U.S. executive order. President Donald Trump -- who now has just over two weeks left in office -- signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as unfair business practices.
The exchange cited “consultation with relevant regulatory authorities” for the reversal in a brief statement late Monday, declining to elaborate further.
The about-face, described as “bizarre” by a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc. analyst, whipsawed investors who on Monday had sold shares of the Chinese telecom companies and raced to bet on which stocks might be delisted next. China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. all rallied on Tuesday.
A lack of clarity on why NYSE changed course left investors to speculate over whether it was simply a result of the exchange initially misinterpreting the November executive order, or something with broader geopolitical implications.
The episode has added to a sense of confusion surrounding implementation of Trump’s order in the waning days of his administration. Index providers FTSE Russell, MSCI Inc. and S&P Dow Jones Indices have all said in the past month they would remove some Chinese companies from equity gauges to comply with the order, but their lists of affected stocks have sometimes differed markedly.

The stakes are high for both Chinese and U.S. companies. The former have long turned to America’s stock market for capital and international prestige, raising at least $144 billion over more than two decades. Their U.S. counterparts, meanwhile, are keen to avoid any ratcheting up of tensions that might curb their access to China’s vast economy. Wall Street banks, in particular, have been pouring resources into the country after gaining unprecedented scope to operate there last year.
The NYSE’s reversal was “quite unexpected,” said Jackson Wong, director of asset management at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. “Some funds that had an obligation to unload these shares will now need to buy them back. Some investors are also starting to price in a scenario that the decision to halt delistings could be the start of a de-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S.”
Calls and emails to the media department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission weren’t immediately returned Tuesday. The CSRC had responded to NYSE’s initial plan by calling it groundless and “not a wise move.” Spokespeople for the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.
It’s unclear whether NYSE’s reversal will have any impact on index providers, which help guide investments worth trillions of dollars. FTSE Russell declined to comment on Tuesday, while MSCI and S&P Dow Jones couldn’t immediately be reached. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, also compiles stock and bond indexes.
In separate statements, China Mobile, China Telecom and Unicom said they will continue to monitor developments. China Mobile, the largest of the three, jumped 5.1% in Hong Kong on Tuesday. The company’s New York-listed shares surged as much as 13% before the official open of U.S. exchanges, while China Unicom’s U.S. shares rose as much as 22%.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that Beijing hopes the U.S. will respect the market and rule of law, and do things conducive to upholding order in the global financial markets.
The NYSE’s initial delisting proposal, announced on New Year’s Eve, marked the first time an American exchange had unveiled plans to remove Chinese companies as a direct result of rising geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers. In his executive order, Trump said the three telcos were among those directly supporting the Chinese military, intelligence and security apparatuses and aiding in their development and modernization.
The developments have unfolded in the last few weeks of the Trump administration, which for years has railed against China for what the U.S. president calls unfair trading practices. Trump has imposed tariffs on imports from China and carried out an aggressive campaign against Chinese technology firms such as Huawei Technologies Co., measures that have often elicited retaliation from Beijing. In a December article, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo discussed how U.S. investors are funding “malign PRC companies” whose shares are included in major indexes.
The NYSE has faced criticism from some market watchers over the way it handled the situation. Travis Lundy, an Asia markets veteran and independent analyst who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, said in a tweet that the U-turn reflected “rank ineptitude” by the exchange and “weak leadership” by the Treasury Department.
“They’ve had seven weeks to talk to Treasury about this,” Lundy said, adding that the department had published lengthy supplemental FAQs as well. “To implement the decision, and then four days later to backtrack -- that’s just odd.”
While the impact on China Mobile and its two peers was always likely to be minimal given the bulk of their shares trade in Hong Kong, the delisting plan had heightened concerns about tit-for-tat sanctions between China and the U.S. as tensions between the superpowers simmer.
Read more: TikTok, Hong Kong and More U.S.-China Flashpoints
Chinese businesses without military links are also potentially vulnerable to delisting after Trump signed legislation with bipartisan support last month that could kick firms off U.S. exchanges unless American regulators can review their financial audits.
The outlook may depend in large part on how U.S.-China relations evolve after president-elect Joe Biden enters the White House later this month. While China’s President Xi Jinping said in a congratulatory message to Biden in November that he hopes to “manage differences” and focus on cooperation, few expect tensions to ease anytime soon.
“We don’t know as to how the Biden administration will pick up the baton that’s been left by the Trump administration,” said George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and author of “Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy,” speaking on Monday before the NYSE’s reversal. “There will certainly be a transition cost to China if the mood in the U.S. remains sour.”

1085,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 06:59AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Georgia Senate Runoff in Focus,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses, although gains are likely to be modest ahead of Georgia’s Senate runoffs later in the day.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 27 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 8 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 382 points, on Monday, its first negative start to the year since 2016, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both slipped 1.5%. 
The focus Tuesday turns towards the dual runoff elections in Georgia that will determine the balance of power in the Senate.
A Democratic victory in both races could tip control of the Senate away from Republicans, allowing President-elect Joe Biden more leeway in getting additional stimulus through Congress -  but also potentially less business friendly policies like higher taxes and greater regulation.
This political uncertainty comes as the new coronavirus variant, initially identified in the U.K., continues to spread in the U.S.. The U.K. has announced a national lockdown, citing the rapid growth of cases based on the new strain, while Germany is also expected to extend its own measures later Tuesday. This raises concerns that further lockdown measures will be needed in the U.S. to curb the contagion.
The economic data slate Tuesday centers around December ISM manufacturing PMI data, although speeches from a couple of officials from the Federal Reserve--John Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Charles Evans--may be of more interest given they come a day before the central bank issues the minutes of its last meeting of 2020.
In the corporate sector, the New York Stock Exchange no longer intends to delist three Chinese telecom giants--China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU)--a reversal of an announcement made only last week. 
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, rebounding after early losses, ahead of the industry’s weekly estimate for crude inventories. The market expects the data to show a draw of 4.8 million barrels when the numbers come out at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT). Elsewhere, OPEC and allied producers including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, will continue discussions Tuesday, split over whether or not to proceed with a planned increase of 500,000 barrels a day from February. 
Geopolitical risk is also adding a modest premium: Iran has seized a South Korean vessel, saying the Asian country owed it $7 billion, while also announcing it would increase its nuclear activities.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% higher at $48.54 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.8% to $52.02. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,953/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2283.

Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) parent company PSA bought Opel, which trades as Vauxhall in Britain, in 2017, and said in 2019 that future investment in the northern English Ellesmere Port plant would depend on the final terms of Britain's exit from the EU.
On Christmas Eve, London and Brussels sealed a deal to secure tariffless trade for the industry, dependent on local content levels. 
""We call upon PSA to look at a longer term plan to build electrified vehicles at both Luton and Ellesmere Port with future regulatory and legislative changes in mind,"" said Unite national officer for automotive industries Des Quinn.
""At Ellesmere Port, it is also now time for our members to be rewarded for their ongoing commitment and having met all cost requirements to be awarded new product – currently, it is the only plant in Europe not to have been."" 

Shareholders on Monday approved the creation of the world's fourth largest automaker as part of a $52 billion merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Hedge funds increased bets against major gold miners, filings reviewed by Reuters showed, as COVID-19 vaccines weakened expectations for the yellow metal after a year of record gains. 
Gold prices have dipped from last year's record highs above $2,000 per ounce as vaccines deployed against the coronavirus encouraged investment in assets that perform well during periods of economic growth.
""While we are by no means out of the woods in our view, the light at the end of the tunnel means that gold markets should begin to see an unwind of the trends that became quite exaggerated over the course of 2020,"" Royal Bank of Canada analysts said last month.
The bank cut its 2021 forecast for gold to $1,810 per ounce from $1,893.
Short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) rose to 24.8% for the second half of last month, from approximately 14.9% for the first half of December, according to filings reviewed by Reuters.
Newmont Corp saw an increase to 11.4%, from 8.8%, over the same period, while trades in  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC) rose to 20.6%, from 18.2%, according to the data.
Hedge funds typically engage in the practice of short-selling by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when shares fall, pocketing the difference.
Tougher lockdown restrictions to combat a new variant of the virus and huge government debt, nonetheless, could propel gold higher.
Short bets against miners  Yamana Gold  (NYSE:AUY) fell to 17.7%, from 25.7%, while the number for Alamos Gold (NYSE:AGI) fell to 19.5% from 21.9%.
Spot gold rose to its highest in two months on Monday. 

""History has always told us to own gold when central banks run out of control,"" said Joseph Boskovich Sr., chairman and chief investment officer at Old West Investment Management in Los Angeles.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Volatility in U.S. stocks jumps as investors brace for Senate 'blue sweep',"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Expectations for market gyrations are rising as investors face U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine which party controls Congress, amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases. 
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" on Monday notched its highest closing level since Nov. 5, at 26.97, while posting its biggest one-day gain since late October.
The VIX futures curve, which reflects longer-term expectations for market volatility, has also inverted for the first time since early November. An inversion of the curve suggests investors view the short-term outlook as more uncertain than the longer-term.
If either of the incumbents, Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, wins in Georgia, Republicans will maintain control of the Senate. But victories by challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff would give control of the Senate - and Congress - to the Democratic party via a tiebreaker vote from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
While a ""blue sweep"" of Congress could usher in greater fiscal stimulus to aid the coronavirus-ravaged economy, it could also pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through a more aggressive policy agenda, including greater corporate regulation and higher taxes. That prospect has troubled some investors on Wall Street.
""The 'blue sweep' does create some policy implications that need to be addressed,"" said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group. ""Those two barbells are keeping vol elevated.""
Overall, implied volatility - the measure of anticipated market moves embedded in options prices - has jumped far ahead of realized volatility, or actual stock movements.
According to data from Susquehanna Financial Group, the gap between implied and realized volatility is near its highest level in two years for the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SI:SPY), which tracks the benchmark U.S. stock index. 
The gap is similarly wide for several U.S. exchange-traded funds in technology and healthcare, sectors seen as prime targets for stricter regulation under a Democratic Congress.
Christopher Murphy, Susquehanna's co-head of derivatives strategy, anticipates implied volatility will decline soon after the Georgia runoffs, as it did after the presidential election.
Yet this time around, concerns about the COVID-19 resurgence may keep volatility elevated even after the runoff, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

""A 'blue sweep' would certainly have implications for the market, but I don't see current volatility as specifically having to do with an administration change,"" she wrote in an email to Reuters.

1089,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 05:59AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Norway Gives a Sobering Look Into Tesla's Future,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What happens when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gets competition?
Those looking for the electric carmaker's unhinged market valuation to revert to something more rational have often pointed to the emergence of competitors as a potential trigger for a rerating.
However, Tesla’s considerable ‘first-mover’ advantage has kept such thinking hypothetical so far: even in China, the world’s biggest market for electric vehicles, it delivered more cars last year than Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Nio (NYSE:NIO) – its three New York-listed Chinese rivals – put together.
But there are signs that its advantage is not going to last forever, especially outside of the U.S., where the personality cult of Elon Musk has less of a stranglehold on the public imagination.
Take Norway, for example. Its extremely high income levels and massive government subsidies have accelerated the adoption of the new technology. According to registration data released by the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) on Tuesday, battery electric vehicles accounted for over 54% of all cars sold, while hybrids accounted for another 29%. In December, their combined market share rose to over 92%.
As such, Norway provides a rough idea of what a car market will look like when, if ever, the average consumer can afford an EV. 
But the average car buyer here does not appear to favor Tesla over any other brand that can produce a halfway decent alternative: the Model 3 was the company’s only representative in the top 20 car models sold last year, with 7,770 sales. coming in comfortably behind the Audi e-tron, with over 9,200. That bodes well for its parent Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), whose ID.3 model was the third-highest seller (the ID.4, which most analysts say represents a significant step up for VW's EV offerings, was launched too late in the year to have an impact). 
Before the fanboys get too worked up, this is not to say that any of the above are objectively better cars. But what it does reflect is that Tesla’s marketing does not have the same effect on everyone. Almost half of cars bought in Norway are bought by businesses (48.7% in 2020, according to the OFV), and across Europe, almost half of retail car sales are accounted for by women. Neither segment is as susceptible to the tech bro geekery that drives Tesla sales in the U.S., and it is hard to imagine that they ever will be.
Tesla can argue, with reason, that it will be more competitive in Europe when its Berlin plant starts up later this year. And there is no reason to think that it won’t sell all of its output easily enough, given the size of the market and the regulatory forces pushing faster adoption of EVs. And it's true that capacity bottlenecks forced Tesla to redirect cars to other markets last year (Norwegian sales picked up smartly in December when those bottlenecks eased).
But the Norwegian model suggests that Tesla is not going to steamroller competition the way that its valuation demands it must. And, given the faster rollout of electric models by established marques, Tesla will soon see the revenue it gets from selling emissions credits shrivel, exposing its weak operating profitability.

1091,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 05:27AM ET</span>",Airlines Begin Scrapping U.K. Flights Following New Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Airlines kicked off 2021 by shrinking their already meager U.K. schedules, prompted by a new coronavirus lockdown and the prospect of further restrictions on travel abroad.
EasyJet Plc, Britain’s biggest discount carrier, pared back its flying program to prioritize essential connections between key U.K. cities and “a small number of international routes.” British Airways said it’ll keep crucial links open, while TUI AG on Tuesday halted all package holiday tours from the U.K. through mid-February, when the new lockdown is set to end.
A spokeswoman for Wizz Air Holdings Plc, which has been adding U.K. bases in an effort to emerge stronger from the pandemic, said it will review capacity to ensure that it remains appropriate to demand.
The fast-spreading virus strain that’s driven up the number of U.K. cases has also dashed hopes of relief from 2020’s unrelenting downturn. Prime Minister Boris Johnson late Monday announced a new coronavirus lockdown that will force most people to stay at home until mid-February, when a vaccine rollout reaches enough to stem the worst infection rates since the start of the outbreak.
“Last night’s news will see those numbers go down further,” Grant said in an email. “Whilst the news is no surprise and most airlines and airports had been expecting this to happen, it is nevertheless another setback to the recovery.”EasyJet had already reduced its schedule for next week by one-third and Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc, Europe’s biggest discounter, by two-thirds, said John Grant, senior analyst at travel data provider OAG.
Travel Restrictions
IAG (LON:ICAG) SA-owned British Airways will review its schedule while keeping key air connections open, a spokesman said.
TUI, the German tour operator with a big base of British customers, had already culled most of its U.K. program due to the pandemic, with only some destinations including St. Lucia, Cuba and Aruba served. These trips have now been canceled.
Measures to further restrict international travel from the U.K. are in the works, including talks with authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on coordinated curbs, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on LBC Radio.
The plans include requiring passengers arriving in the country to present a negative coronavirus test, the Times newspaper reported, citing an unnamed former Downing Street official.
Johnson said late Monday that people should stay home as Britain wrestles with the fast-spreading strain of Covid-19. The government said on its website that all leisure travel is forbidden and advised that U.K. residents should check with their travel operator on arrangements for returning.
Disruption to carriers is unlikely to be as great as that suffered last spring, when fleets were grounded across the world. Luton, England-based EasyJet, which has bases and operations across Europe, said the impact might be similar to that of a month-long lockdown in the U.K. in November, though that involved less severe measures with schools still open.
Ryanair, which has its biggest base at London Stansted airport, revealed Tuesday that its passenger count tumbled 66% to 52.1 million in 2020. Even in December the Dublin-based company was operating only 22% of its usual schedule.
Wizz separately posted a 58% decline, though with occupancy level of just 75% compared with 81% at Ryanair.
“Most airlines were resigned to the first quarter of this year being very weak, with no real recovery, so from that perspective many had already planned their networks accordingly,” said OAG’s Grant. “It’s unlikely that we will see any recovery in that capacity until the end of March, when the airlines normally begin to introduce their summer programs.”

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Electric cars rise to record 54% market share in Norway in 2020,"By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - The sale of electric cars in Norway overtook those powered by petrol, diesel and hybrid engines last year, with German auto-maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) replacing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the top battery-vehicle producer, new data showed on Tuesday.
So-called battery electric vehicles (BEV) made up 54.3% of all new cars sold in the Nordic country in 2020, a global record, up from 42.4% in 2019 and from a mere 1% of the overall market a decade ago, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.

https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/NORWAY/yxmpjqwrdvr/chart.png
Seeking to become the first nation to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2025, oil-producing Norway exempts fully electric vehicles from taxes imposed on those relying on fossil fuels.
The policy has turned the country's car market into a laboratory for automakers seeking a path to a future without internal combustion engines, vaulting new brands and models to the top of bestseller lists in recent years.
While the sale of BEVs had broken the 50%-mark in individual months, 2020 was the first time that fully electric cars outsold the combined volume of models containing internal combustion engines for a year as a whole.
""We're definitely on track to reach the 2025 target,"" OFV Chief Executive Oeyvind Thorsen told a news conference.
BEV sales accelerated in the final months of 2020, hitting its highest level for any single month in December, with a 66.7% share of the car market.
For a graphic on Norway new car sales:
https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/NORWAY/xlbvgmxbwvq/chart.png
Volkswagen's Audi brand topped the 2020 leaderboard with its e-tron sports utility and sportsback vehicles as the most sold new passenger cars in Norway last year, while Tesla's mid-sized Model 3, the 2019 winner, was relegated to second place.
Electric vehicle sales are set to continue to soar in 2021, industry analysts and car distributors said, as more models are brought to the market.
""Our preliminary forecast is for electric cars to surpass 65% of the market in 2021,"" said Christina Bu who heads the Norwegian EV Association, an interest group. ""If we manage that, the goal of selling only zero-emission cars in 2025 will be within reach.""
Tesla's mid-sized sports utility vehicle, the Model Y, is set to reach the Norwegian market this year, as are the first electric SUVs from Ford, BMW and Volkswagen.
By contrast, cars with diesel-only engines have tumbled from a peak of 75.7% of the overall Norwegian market in 2011 to just 8.6% last year.
New car sales in the country last year were 141,412, of which 76,789 were fully electric.
While the electric market share will keep rising, there is uncertainty around how many cars producers will allocate to Norway as European demand is increasing, said Harald Frigstad, chief executive at Norwegian car importer Bertel O. Steen.

The seller of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz as well as the Kia, Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Opel, Citroen, DS and Smart brands, predicted around 70% of its sales would be of fully electric models in 2021.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus delivered more than 560 aircraft in 2020, according to tracking data and airline industry sources, putting it on course to beat arch-rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) to be the world's largest planemaker for a second consecutive year.
The European aerospace group reached an informal target of 560 handovers, based on numbers that remain subject to auditing, the sources added.
Airbus, which is expected to announce 2020 orders and deliveries in the coming days, declined to comment ahead of their formal publication.
Total Airbus deliveries are expected to have fallen by about a third this year, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel and airlines.

But the European manufacturer has an insurmountable lead over Boeing, which had delivered 118 planes between the start of 2020 and the end of November, with the 737 MAX grounded during the period.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Tuesday, as investors weighed up better than expected German retail sales data with new Covid-inspired lockdowns and U.S. political uncertainty.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.4%. 
German retail sales rose 1.9% in November, against analysts' expectations of a contraction, thanks in part to very strong growth in online sales as consumers continued to spend despite the country being partially locked down to combat the rising Covid-19 cases. The country's unemployment data also surprised positively, with 37,000 jobs created in December instead of the expected 10,000 jobs lost.
That said, the number of its Covid-19 cases continued to rise sharply throughout the continent.
The U.K. ordered a new, more rigorous lockdown on Monday. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers are scheduled on Tuesday to discuss a possible extension of the current lockdown beyond Jan. 10. Restaurants, bars, museums and cinemas remain shut in France, while Italian ministers decided to keep nationwide restrictions in place this weekend to slow coronavirus infections.
Also prompting wariness among investors is the uncertainty surrounding the Senate runoffs in Georgia due later Tuesday. These could determine the control of this branch of the U.S. government and thus impact the economic policies President-elect Joe Biden will be able to introduce.
Both contests are seen as being very tight and the outcomes may not be immediately known, which could result in the type of political chaos which followed the presidential election in November.
Fashion retailer  Next  (LON:NXT) stock jumped 7.9% after saying its Christmas sales were much better than it had expected, while Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock fell 0.5% after the airline a sharp drop in December traffic as European nations imposed restrictions on movement.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday as a group of the world’s top producers continue to discuss a production policy for next month, amid concerns about demand growth due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
OPEC and allied producers including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, were unable to decide Monday, split over whether or not to proceed with a planned increase of 500,000 barrels a day from February. They decided last month to raise output by just 500,000 barrels per day in January, but are still holding more than 7 million barrels a day of output back from the market.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $47.72 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.1% to $51.15. Both contracts fell more than 1% on Monday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,945.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2274.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Tuesday morning, with investors bracing for a key runoff election in the U.S. state of Georgia. The ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases and the ensuing delay in the global economic recovery also dampened investor sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.01% by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT), with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to decide on the declaration of a fresh state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo area on Thursday.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.26%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.16%. The social-distancing measures currently in place, including a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and restaurant dine-in services after 6pm, were extended for another two weeks on Monday.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.41% while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.08%. The New York Stock Exchange reversed its earlier decision to delist China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941),  China Telecom Corp Ltd  (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd (NYSE:CHU).
The election results in Georgia, due to take place later in the day, will determine whether the Democrats or Republicans control the Senate. The party that wins either or both Senate seats up for grabs will determine the ease with which President-elect Joe Biden can implement his agenda, including fiscal stimulus, higher taxes and more regulation, when his administration takes office later in the month.
“2021 starts with a bang with pivotal political and economic news for markets to digest. The undisputed highlight will be the result of the Senate seat run-off elections in Georgia,” ING chief international economist James Knightley said in a note.
“If the Democrats win both seats this should lead to the most substantial 2021 fiscal stimulus. Nonetheless, it could be the excuse for a near-term consolidation in risk markets after a strong post-election rally,” the note added.
However, incumbent President Donald Trump’s call to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" votes to overturn his loss to Biden in the state unnerved some investors ahead of the election.
Congress is also due to count the electoral votes and certify Biden the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election on Wednesday. Several Republicans have vowed to vote against the certification, and Trump supporters expected to flock to Washington D.C. in protest.
Meanwhile, the ever-rising number of COVID-19 cases globally is dampening the enthusiasm triggered by the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines that began in December.
The spread of the B177 strain of the virus, which is more infectious that the original, also promoted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday to order a new, tougher national lockdown. Although he was cautious about giving a firm lockdown timetable Johnson said it could be possible to start moving out of lockdown by mid-February.
Despite the grim message for the short term, some investors were optimistic that it would be consigned to the first quarter of the year.
“The first quarter will no doubt be tough. The spread has been horrific throughout the festive period and restrictions are being tightened and extended. The toll on the economy will be significant but, thanks to the vaccine, consigned mostly to the first quarter,” Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam told Bloomberg.
On the data side, the Federal Reserve will also release the minutes from its December meeting on Wednesday. U.S. employment data for December, including manufacturing and non-farm payrolls, will be released on Friday."
1100,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 10:26PM ET</span>","Google workers form small union, eyeing more protests over working conditions","By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -More than 200 workers at Google and other Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc units on Monday formed a labor union for U.S. and Canadian offices, building on years of protests over working conditions and business practices but falling far short of the support needed to force the tech giant to the bargaining table. 
Backers believe the ""Alphabet Workers Union,"" which evolved from an informal group of activist employees, will better shield members from firings or other forms of retaliation. It will also enable the group to collect dues to hire support staff and attack the company more aggressively than in the past, internal leaders and outside labor experts said. 
The union will be part of the Communications Workers of America labor group, which also represents employees from  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) Alphabet members will pay dues of 1% of their total compensation.
Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in response on Monday that the company supports its employees' ""protected labor rights"" and will ""continue engaging directly with all our employees."" 
Unlike traditional labor unions in the U.S., the Alphabet group is a so-called ""minority union"" that will not be able to force the company to collectively bargain over wages or other issues. 
Under U.S. labor law, Alphabet can ignore the union's demands until a majority of employees support it. In addition, the union plans to represent third-party contractors, a class of workers whose demands Alphabet also may ignore. 
Union leaders acknowledge that widespread support is unlikely soon. Well-paying jobs, with perks such as free meals and gyms, mostly have kept unionization out of the tech industry.
But labor activism is creeping into the tech industry as workers and regulators grapple with the power of sprawling internet companies including Alphabet. 
Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Shaw, the Alphabet union's vice chair, said small fractions of the workforce successfully protested in recent years over workplace equity and ethical business practices. Those actions helped prompt Google to introduce new policies around workplace investigations and to drop a drone software project with the U.S. military. 
The union aims to mount similar campaigns, with the new funding and structure lending greater legitimacy and resources, Shaw said. 
Google has been under fire https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-labor-idUSKBN28C35V from the U.S. labor regulator, which has accused the company of unlawfully questioning several workers who were then terminated for protesting company policies and trying to organize a union. Google has said it was confident it acted legally.
Non-traditional unions of contractors or a small slice of employees at companies, universities and government agencies have successfully pressured for changes for more than a century, said Joseph McCartin, labor historian at Georgetown University.
Shaw, a site reliability engineer at Google, said he studied unionizing by small groups including Chicago public school teachers as well as staff and faculty at Tennessee colleges.

The companies are Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China United Network Communications Ltd. and Nanjing Panda Electronics Co., according to a statement dated Monday. They will be deleted from the FTSE Global Equity and China A Inclusion gauges effective Thursday.
The move comes as index providers and stock exchanges in New York and London rush to comply with an order by U.S. President Donald Trump in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military.
Last week, the New York Stock Exchange said it would remove three Chinese state-owned telecoms, while MSCI Inc. deleted 11 Chinese stocks from its global indexes effective Tuesday. S&P Dow Jones also listed 10 companies in December deemed ineligible from its equity measures, including SMIC.
FTSE’s fresh deletions follow guidance published by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control late last year. FTSE added in its statement that any additional names published by the U.S. as being subject to sanctions will be evaluated after Jan. 11.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 06:41PM ET</span>",McDonald's wants a bite of crispy chicken market with new sandwiches,"By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) is hoping 2021 is the year it cracks the crispy chicken sandwich by rolling out three different versions in the United States, as it takes on chains such as Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Popeyes for a share of the growing market.
The world's biggest burger chain confirmed to Reuters it plans to launch its crispy chicken sandwich in ""classic"", ""deluxe"" and ""spicy"" versions on Feb. 24. All will contain a new crispy white meat chicken fillet served with crinkle-cut pickles on a toasted, buttered potato roll.
The new McDonald's strategy is founded in part on the long-term popularity of Chicken McNuggets, which it has sold since the 1980s, and 2020's limited time Spicy Chicken McNuggets, which contributed to September U.S. comparative sales that were the highest in nearly a decade.
""As commonplace as chicken is, it's a growth area. You want to participate in that growth,"" said Mark Kalinowski, an independent restaurant equities analyst. 
But to really ruffle feathers in the market, McDonald's needs to overcome operational and structural hurdles, including a lack of pressure fryers, and prove wrong skeptics who doubt it can match sandwiches offered by pure poultry purveyors. 
""I would bet big time that McDonald's never competes in the chicken business,"" restaurant marketing consultant Chas Hermann said of the menu additions.
A social-media-fueled war between privately-owned Chick-fil-A and Popeyes raised the game for the fast-food industry after Popeyes launched its first-ever chicken sandwich in August 2019.
The Popeyes sandwich quickly sold out and drove sustained spikes in its comparable sales growth beginning that quarter, prompting other companies to try to follow its lead. 
Chick-fil-A's growth in the South also pressured McDonald's franchisees there, who pushed for the new sandwiches.  
""They'll definitely improve their chicken sandwich. It won't win awards. They will have some of the very best marketing around it,"" Hermann added of the McDonald's move.
At least two dozen restaurant chains launched new or improved chicken sandwiches in 2020 even as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supplies, workers and operations, trade publication Nation's Restaurant News said. 
If McDonald's crispy chicken is successful, an average location could sell as many as 150 sandwiches per day, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Lauren Silberman. 
By comparison, for a typical Burger King restaurant that 40 units of a new sandwich per day would be considered very successful, she said. 
McDonald's also needs to keep costs low to appeal to existing customers and compete with $4 sandwiches from rivals.
CHICKEN PLATFORM
At its Investor Day on Nov. 9, McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said the sandwich was a ""jumping off point"" for an even broader ""chicken platform"". 
""Our chicken-only competitors here and abroad have strong brand equity and credibility. Developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest aspirations,"" he said. 
The existing McChicken sandwich could also see new flavors, marketing and promotions, Erlinger said.
McDonald's McNuggets, which are processed, battered, partly pre-cooked and frozen before shipping, are one thing. A fresh-tasting fillet to beat chains at their own game is another.
""Trying to ensure large, thick pre-breaded chicken to 14,000 stores can be difficult,"" said former franchisee Jim Lewis.
McDonald's also lacks equipment used by poultry specialists - pressure cookers and hand-breading stations inside stores. 
It is ""very hard to do something with the equipment that they have and the complexity you have in the kitchen, it's very hard to manage that,"" Restaurant Brands' Chief Marketing Officer Fernando Machado said of McDonald's.
Popeyes' chicken is also marinated for 24 hours in the restaurant, he added. 
""If it were easy to do, we could do it at Burger King,"" he said of Restaurant Brands' burger chain. 
But McDonald's huge scale could help it. 
There about 13,846 McDonald's restaurants in the United States – about as many as all the Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, Yum-owned KFC, Church's, Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING), Zaxby's, Bojangles and El Pollo Loco locations combined. 

""Customers have to drive past two or three McDonald's to get to a (Chick-fil-A) or a Popeyes,"" said Richard Adams, a consultant to franchisees. ""That's an opportunity to pull in those customers with a comparable product.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Abbvie Inc and Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb raised U.S. list prices on more than 500 drugs to kick off 2021, according to an analysis by health care research firm 46brooklyn.
The hikes come as drugmakers are reeling from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced doctor visits and demand for some drugs. They are also fighting new drug price-cutting rules from the Trump administration, which would reduce the industry's profitability.
They include more than 300 price increases from companies like  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) reported by Reuters late last week.
Nearly all the increases were below 10%, and the median hike was 4.8%, down slightly from last year, 46brooklyn said https://www.46brooklyn.com/branddrug-boxscore. The firm's analysis is based on data from Elsevier's Gold Standard Drug Database.
Abbvie raised prices on around 40 drugs including a 7.4% hike on rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, the world's top-selling drug. Revenue from Humira is expected to top $20 billion next year.
Bristol Myers hiked prices on around a dozen drugs, including cancer drugs Revlimid and Opdivo by 4.5 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. It hiked the price of blood thinner Eliquis by 6 percent.
It said in a statement that it only raised prices on drugs with ongoing clinical research. It expects net prices, which include rebates and other discounts, to fall this year.
Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected.
However, 46brooklyn said its analysis of Medicaid data shows the average cost per branded drug is still ticking up.

    ""Over time, we end up cycling out cheaper brands designed to treat large populations, and replacing them with expensive brands designed to treat smaller populations,"" wrote Eric Pachman, president of 46brooklyn. ""With price increases losing their impact, launch prices will be the primary driver of U.S. drug list price inflation.""

1104,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 04:39PM ET</span>","Georgia Election, Oil Inventory, Fed Speeches: 3 Things to Watch","By Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- After reaching all-time highs at the close of 2020, stocks dropped on the first day of trading in the new year on concerns about a runoff election in Georgia that will determine the balance of power in the Senate.
If Republicans retain their majority, President-elect Joe Biden could have a more difficult time getting additional stimulus and an ambitious clean energy program through Congressional approval. 
If Democrats take control, higher taxes could result, but stimulus also is widely expected. 
Investors are also awaiting the first batch of corporate earnings reports for the fourth quarter, which could show the level of economic progress made in the last three months of 2020 after a harrowing drop in the second and third quarters because of pandemic restrictions.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow. 
1. Georgia on our minds
Investors will be watching Georgia voters make their decisions in two runoff elections for the U.S. Senate. The outcome could tip the balance of power to Democrats and give incoming President-elect Joe Biden a chance to push big energy and infrastructure spending.
As of Monday afternoon, the races were extremely tight. Fivethirtyeight, the polling site, has Democrat Jon Ossoff beating incumbent David Perdue by less than two percentage points, while Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock was ahead of Kelly Loeffler by slightly more than two percentage points.
2. Oil inventories
Last year was the worst for oil investors, as crude prices tumbled 21%. They began 2021 on a sour note as well, hampered by worries about rising production even as new lockdowns mean demand won’t come roaring back soon.
Late Tuesday, the industry will release its weekly estimate for crude inventories, a rough proxy of the amount of demand in the market. Rising inventory could indicate falling demand. The market expects the data to show a draw of 4.8 million barrels when the numbers come out at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT). 
3. Fed speakers
A couple of officials from the Federal Reserve are scheduled for speeches on Tuesday, a day before the central bank issues the  minutes of its last meeting of 2020.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is scheduled to appear in a virtual meeting 3:45 PM ET (1745 GMT) to talk about the Fed’s actions during the economic crisis created by the pandemic. New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) is expected to speak around the same time about the nexus of monetary and fiscal policy during a low interest rate environment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Shares on Wall Street closed sharply lower on Monday, sliding from all-time peaks on the first trading day of the year, as risk appetite ebbed amid upcoming runoff elections in Georgia and the persistent surge in coronavirus cases.
The Dow, which touched a record high earlier in the session along with the S&P 500, was also dragged down by a more than 4% fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's shares after Bernstein cut its rating to ""underperform,"" citing concerns about cash flow.
All three main indexes hit two-week lows, with record highs in the Dow and S&P 500 extending a 2020 rally fueled by monetary stimulus and the start of vaccine rollouts. 
The fate of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's agenda, meanwhile, including rewriting the tax code, boosting stimulus and infrastructure spending hinges firmly on Tuesday's twin Senate races in the battleground state of Georgia that will determine control of the chamber.
Wall Street's fear gauge touched a two-week high on Monday.
""Stocks are pulling back from a stunning year of gains,"" said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist, at Reynolds Strategy. 
""We're starting off with a virus out of control. We'll probably going to end 2021 with a virus that could be under control by that time. How we get from start to finish will be filled with frequent pullbacks because people will be looking at short-term headlines,"" he added.
Total U.S. deaths from COVID-19 have reached more than 350,000.
Almost all S&P sectors dropped with real estate, utilities and industrials posting the sharpest percentage declines. Consumer discretionary and materials hit all-time highs in early trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 382.59 points, or 1.25%, to 30,223.89, the S&P 500 lost 55.42 points, or 1.48%, to 3,700.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 189.84 points, or 1.47%, to 12,698.45.
The S&P 500 and the Dow posted their largest daily percentage falls since late October, while the Nasdaq had its biggest loss since Dec. 9.
""Investors are at a point where they want to take a breather while they assess all the different things coming in the new year,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
On the data front, U.S. manufacturing activity picked up at its briskest pace in more than six years in December, a survey showed on Monday. It comes on the heels of upbeat factory activity surveys across Europe and Asia earlier in the day.
Some investors are cautious about the pace of economic growth as U.S. jobless claims remain stubbornly high, while a new round of pandemic-related restrictions last month and a new variant of the coronavirus have cast a shadow on the outlook.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's shares extended a meteoric rally to scale a record high after the electric-car maker reported better-than-expected vehicle deliveries in 2020.
Shares of FLIR Systems Inc (NASDAQ:FLIR) jumped more than 19%after Teledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY) Inc agreed to buy the thermal imaging camera supplier for $8 billion in cash and stock. Teledyne's shares, however, dropped 7.5%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.43-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 151 new highs and 19 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges hit 14.15 billion shares, compared with the 10.94 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are facing stiff competition in the Georgian runoff elections from Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. The race has become too close to call, prompting investors to weigh the prospect of higher taxes and increased government spending under a Democrat-controlled Congress.
""Investors are beginning to weigh the prospect of higher taxes and massive government spending against the notion of further fiscal relief aid as the pandemic – and subsequent policy measures – continues to wreak havoc on the economy,"" Stifel said in a note.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",How the Georgia Senate runoffs could rattle U.S. stocks,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Control of the U.S. Senate is at stake with Tuesday's dual runoff elections in the state of Georgia, and the results may ripple through a stock market that closed 2020 at record highs. 
A Democratic victory in both races could tip control of the Senate away from Republicans, potentially boosting the agenda of President-elect Joe Biden.
Such a scenario could hurt areas of the market that benefited from expectations that a gridlocked Congress - with Republicans holding the Senate and Democrats running the House of Representatives - would prevent legislative overhauls such as higher corporate taxes and tougher regulations. 
The latest polling data gives a slight edge to both Democratic candidates in their respective races, according to data website 538 https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/georgia-senate-polls.
But even if both Democrats prevail, analysts have said the market impact could be blunted because the party will hold only a slim Senate margin, casting doubt on the prospect for significant legislative changes. Some investors, meanwhile, say the market will embrace any result as long as it creates clarity in the political landscape.
Here are some stocks and sectors that could swing with Tuesday's election:
BANKS: Along with higher corporate taxes, banks could face concerns over more stringent regulations should Democrats prevail on Tuesday, and their shares could be vulnerable because they were particularly strong at year-end. The S&P 500 banks index jumped about 30% over the last two months of the year, more than doubling the gain for the overall S&P 500, as breakthroughs on COVID-19 vaccines raised hopes for an economic reopening in the coming months.
At the same time, a Democratic sweep could pave the wave for more fiscal spending, a potential positive for bank stocks.
OIL AND GAS: Like bank stocks, energy shares soared following the positive vaccine news, with the S&P 500 energy sector up 32% in the final two months of 2020. But a Democratic sweep could halt momentum for oil and gas shares on fears of tougher rules for the industry.
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: A Democratic sweep could give further support to a strong ""green energy"" push expected under the Biden administration. Alternative energy stocks have already notched a big rally following Biden's Nov. 3 win, with the Invesco Solar ETF soaring some 50% in that period.
HEALTHCARE: A Democratic sweep could weigh on shares of health insurers and pharmaceutical companies. The S&P 500 pharmaceuticals index jumped more than 4% the day after the Nov. 3 election, nearly twice the broad index's gain, while the S&P 1500 managed healthcare index soared nearly 9% that day.
Healthcare stocks could feel pressure as investors worry about broad Democratic control paving the way for systemic changes, including to insurance coverage or measures to rein in medicine costs.
BIG TECH: Democrats could take a tougher stance on addressing the influence of big tech companies, pressuring stocks that have led the market for much of the past decade. The NYSE FANG+ index, which includes these tech giants, doubled in 2020, even as lawmakers scrutinized the tech industry's market power.
INFRASTRUCTURE: A Democratic sweep could set the stage for an infrastructure spending package that benefits a range of industrial, materials and construction shares.

The iShares US Infrastructure ETF has climbed about 10% since Nov. 3, roughly in line with the broader market.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 02:25PM ET</span>","Wall Street places bet on solid revenue growth for Airbnb, DoorDash","By Noor Zainab Hussain and Tanvi Mehta
(Reuters) - A slew of brokerages initiated coverage of Airbnb Inc and DoorDash Inc on Monday, having high hopes for their revenue growth and supporting eye-popping valuations obtained by both last month in stock market launches.
Home rental firm Airbnb was valued at just over $100 billion at the time of its market debut in the biggest U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of 2020, while food delivery company DoorDash was valued at more than four times its worth at an earlier fundraising round.
The IPOs underscored investor appetite for technology firms, with both being app-based, and analysts are predicting steady growth as travel restrictions ease and the global food delivery business continues to expand.
More than 25 brokerages initiated coverage on the two companies. Banks that worked on both firms' IPOs had been required by industry practice to refrain from initiating coverage until Monday.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), BofA and others led a 37-firm underwriting group for Airbnb's IPO, while Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan led a syndicate of 12 firms on DoorDash's offering.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) expects pandemic-driven changes in behavior to speed up the shift away from hotels to alternative accommodations and the analysts see ample opportunity for Airbnb to increase monetization in the long term.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts expect a return to 2019 bookings and revenue levels by the second half of 2021 and double-digit growth through 2025, with annual profits expected by 2022.
Airbnb's revenue fell 18% in the third quarter of 2020, but it turned a profit, helped mainly by cost cuts. 
Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analysts were similarly bullish on DoorDash.
""We think DoorDash has a shot at achieving ""super app"" status in the doorstep delivery market, with a better business model (in our view) than Neutral-rated Uber (NYSE:UBER)"" Piper Sandler analysts said.
TEMPERED EXPECTATIONS 
Analysts at BofA, however, expressed concern over Airbnb's valuation.
""We see Airbnb's valuation (versus) peers as the biggest stock concern given that Airbnb services are not new ... and competitors Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) and VRBO have solid positions in their ""home"" markets,"" the analysts said.
BofA also said DoorDash's premium multiples are warranted given its greater scale and share gains, but warned of slowing growth pressuring valuation in 2021.
Brokerages not involved in the IPOs had earlier downgraded the stocks, based on their valuations, with Citron Research saying that DoorDash's IPO ""was the most ridiculous IPO of 2020"".

Shares of Airbnb were down 3.1% on the Nasdaq, while DoorDash's stock was down 2.45% on the New York Stock Exchange.

Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is also looking at moving some asset management staff there.
Virtu also opened an office in Short Hills, New Jersey, this year and has expanded in Austin, Texas, Bloomberg reported.
In June, Cifu said he was rethinking Virtu's Manhattan office space after around 35% of the company's employees said they would be happy to work from home. Virtu has offices in cities including Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Paris.

Investing.com -- Electric-car battery developer Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)'s shares plunged as much as 40% on Monday, the largest drop in its short life.
QuantumScape, for those who don't know, was until now an almost $50 billion market cap company after shares had surged more than 250% since its Nov. 27 merger with a blank-check company. That valuation put it above the likes of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) and within range of General Motors (NYSE:GM), for comparison.
The firm is backed by Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Bill Gates, among others. The billionaire Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder earlier this year said in a blog post that QuantumScape's technology -- solid-state batteries -- are a key making EVs a ""realistic option for every car owner.""
There wasn't much in the way of news explaining the drop, save for a post on Seeking Alpha from Brian Morin, who identifies himself as the chief executive officer of apparent rival Soteria Battery Innovation Group. He notes that while QuantumScape's science is ""very good,"" their batteries are unproven and will likely never achieve the performance they claim.
Only one analyst covers the stock, according to Dow Jones, and Bernstein's Mark Newman has a price target of $28 on the stock.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",'Clean shift' as euro share trading exits London for EU,"By Huw Jones and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - The biggest shift in European share trading in two decades was proceeding smoothly on Monday, on the first day of business since Britain left the European Union's single market. 
While a Brexit trade deal agreed last month set rules for industries such as fishing and agriculture, it did not cover Britain's much larger finance sector, meaning London's automatic access to EU financial markets came to an end on Dec. 31.
That has meant the bulk of trading in euro-denominated shares has had to switch from London to the EU, as the bloc seeks to reduce its reliance on a finance centre outside its borders. 
Many London-based businesses had prepared for the new conditions by setting up units in the EU, and Monday put those new arrangements to the test. 
Trading on Cboe Europe and London Stock Exchange's Turquoise units in Amsterdam, and on Aquis Exchange's new Paris platform, grew steadily with no glitches reported.
Data from Cboe, Europe's biggest cross-border share trading platform, showed that two hours after the open, 60% of all of its activity was at its Amsterdam unit.
""All our systems are operating normally, and as expected the majority of activity in EEA-symbols (mainly EU listed shares) is now taking place on our Dutch venue, with activity across all our market segments,"" Cboe Europe president David Howson said.
Cboe traded 5.1 billion euros in shares on Monday, the bulk in Amsterdam.
Aquis reported a ""clean shift"" in euro share trading from its London base to its new Paris unit, with the French capital now the location for most of the group's business.
Aquis traded 1.9 billion euros of shares on Monday, mostly in Paris.
Trading on Turquoise was more evenly split, with 525 million euros in Amsterdam and 361 million euros in London.
No European trading of note had taken place on the three EU hubs until Monday. 
Trading in non-EU listed shares remains in London. 
""I don't think there has been any impact from this switch,"" said Keith Temperton, equity sales trader at Forte Securities. ""It has been planned for years."" 
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the EU's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) had no comment.
FRANKFURT CALLING
Banks and other financial market participants in the EU are also required to trade swaps, a type of derivatives contract, on platforms inside the bloc and stop using venues in London, the world's biggest centre for trading swaps.
In a last minute intervention on Dec. 24 before markets shut until Monday, the FCA said it would allow UK market participants to trade swaps on EU venues until the end of March to avoid disruption in markets.
Traders said that on Dec. 24 the spread between the 10-year interest rate swap on Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex in Frankfurt and LSE's LCH swaps clearing unit in London widened.
This signified that it was more expensive to use Eurex Clearing than LCH. A trader said that normally there is little or no spread between the two clearing houses. 
Eurex, which is offering customers incentives to attract euro clearing from London, said the spread had widened to 0.4 basis points on Dec. 24, but has since eased to 0.3 basis points. 
Christoph Rieger, head of rates and credit research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt, said there was no big disruption in initial trading on Monday.

ESMA on Monday cancelled its authorisation for four trade repositories in London used for reporting derivatives trades, in a further sign of the British capital being locked out of EU markets.

Investing.com --   C3 Ai Inc  (NYSE:AI) dropped 10% on Monday after analyst ratings on the newly public company came in mixed. 
Wedbush to Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) give it a buy,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Keybanc see a hold, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says sell, StreetInsider reported.
The AI software provider went public in early December, jumping as much as 174% on its first day of trading, Business Insider reported.
The company was founded by a former Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) executive, Tom Siebel, and raised $651 million in its IPO.  
Morgan Stanley set a $100 price target, saying that C3.ai's ""compelling growth opportunity ahead"" is already priced into the stock, The Street reported.
JMP Securities, however, set a price target of $167 and a buy-equivalent rating. 
""We view C3 as an excellent opportunity for long-term durable growth and capital appreciation for a number of reasons,"" Street Insider reported analyst Patrick Walravens. He cited Siebel's leadership and experience, the focus on artificial intelligence projects in the commercial industrial sector with the potential to return significant economic value and a set of partnerships that should supplement C3’s go-to-market capabilities over time, with companies like Baker Hughes, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), among other reasons, StreetInsider reported.
Last week, a Motley Fool article noted that while C3.ai has plenty of potential and room to grow, the stock is too expensive at 85 times last year's sales. Even if revenue doubles, it would still be more expensive than Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), which trades at roughly 30 times next year's sales."

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and PSA said on Monday that investors had given their blessing to a $52 billion merger to create the world's fourth largest automaker, and shares in the new company, named Stellantis, would start trading in two weeks.
With annual production of around 8 million vehicles worldwide and revenues of more than 165 billion euros ($203 billion), the newly-formed firm is expected to play a key role in the auto industry's jump into the new era of electrification.
Stellantis will have 14 brands, from FCA's Fiat, Maserati and U.S.-focused Jeep, Dodge and Ram to PSA's traditionally Europe-focused Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Citroen, Opel and DS. 
FCA and PSA said they expected to complete their tie-up on Jan. 16, ahead of an earlier indication which aimed for a closing within the first quarter of this year.
Stellantis shares will start trading in Milan and Paris on Jan. 18, and in New York the following day, the two automakers said in a joint statement. 
At two separate extraordinary shareholder meetings, held virtually earlier on Monday due to the coronavirus pandemic, investors in each group backed the merger with approval rates above 99% of the votes cast.
""We are ready for this merger,"" PSA Chief Executive and Stellantis future CEO Carlos Tavares said.
Tavares will have to revive the carmaker's fortunes in China, rationalise a sprawling empire and address massive overcapacity, as well as focus like its rivals on creating cleaner cars.
FCA Chairman John Elkann, the future chairman of Stellantis, said the new automaker would ""play a leading role as the next decade redefines mobility"".
And FCA CEO Mike Manley - who will head Stellantis' key north American operations - said 40% of the expected synergies form the merger - projected at more than 5 billion euros, will come from convergence of platforms and powertrains and from optimising R&D investments.
Manley said 35% of synergies would be driven by savings on purchases, while another 7% would come from savings on sales operations and general expenses.
The remainder of the synergies are expected from the optimization of other functions including logistics, supply chain, quality and after-market operations, he added.
FCA said in a separate statement it would pay its shareholders a planned 2.9 billion euro special dividend as soon as possible after merger completion.
PSA and FCA have pledged not to close any plants.

Shares rose 7% to their highest in about three years.
Analyst Matthew Boss maintained an overweight rating on the Victoria's Secret parent, while nudging the price target to $54 from $53, according to TheFly. 
L Brands has more than doubled over the past 12 months despite the coronavirus pandemic that has seen retailers closed across the country for months at a time. While malls may not be open, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) are still delivering and the demand for scented candles and soaps is driving up revenue for its Bath & Body Works segment. The company's also seeing its efforts at cost-cutting pay off. 
Last month, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upped its price target on the stock to $44 from $40, maintaining its buy-equivalent rating. 
The lingerie purveyor reported revenue for the most recent quarter of $3.06 billion, trouncing the expected $2.66 billion. Profit also surprised, by a lot, coming in at $1.13 a share versus the estimated 13 cents.
Last year, L Brands said it would cut 850 corporate jobs, or 15% of its workforce, contributing to an expected $400 million in annualized cost reductions. About 250 Victoria’s Secret stores were set to close in 2020.

Investing.com --  Flir Systems (NASDAQ:FLIR) jumped 22% after Teledyne said it would acquire the thermal imaging camera and sensor company for about $8 billion in cash and stock. 
FLIR stockholders will receive $28 per share in cash and 0.0718 shares of Teledyne common stock for each FLIR share, which implies a total purchase price of $56 per FLIR share based on Teledyne’s 5-day volume weighted average price as of Dec. 31. The transaction reflects a 40% premium for FLIR stockholders based on FLIR’s 30-day volume weighted average price as of Dec. 31. 
Teledyne expects the acquisition to immediately add to GAAP earnings in the first full calendar year following the acquisition.
Teledyne, which is up 16% over the past 12 months, dropped almost 4% on the news. Revenue for the buyer has dropped over the past three quarters, though profit has beat in the past two reporting periods. 
Flir missed revenue estimates in its more recent quarterly report, but beat for profit, coming in at 64 cents versus the expected 55 cents, according to data compiled by Investing.com. 
In addition to the purchase, Teledyne also announced that it expects to report fourth quarter sales of about $800 million, versus $749 million in the previous quarter. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.16 to $3.19, a record for any quarterly period and compared with the prior outlook of $2.56 to $2.86.
“Our technologies and products are uniquely complementary with minimal overlap, having imaging sensors based on different semiconductor technologies for different wavelengths,” said Teledyne Executive Chairman Robert Mehrabian in a statement. “Together with FLIR and an optimized capital structure, I am confident we shall continue delivering superior returns to our stockholders.”
The transaction, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, is expected to close in the middle of 2021.

1128,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens Mixed as Virus, Georgia Runoffs Weigh on Mood; Dow Down 40 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the new year in mixed fashion, quickly reversing after making fresh record highs at the opening against a backdrop of political uncertainty and the likelihood of another holiday-driven surge in Covid-19 cases.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40 points, or 0.1%, at 30,566 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite also edged down 0.1% after initially clinging on to its gains. 
The market was unsettled by the prospect of the two runoff elections for Georgia's Senate seats, which could tip control of the upper chamber to the Democrats and usher in a more radical fiscal policy agenda from the new administration. President Donald Trump put pressure on Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger to overturn the election result in his state at the weekend in an hour-long call that seemed engineered to undermine the Republican candidates in both races, by deterring Trump supporters from turning out. 
The Republican Party needs to win only one of the two runoffs on Tuesday to keep control of the Senate for another two years – assuming that Senate Leader Mitch McConnell can keep unity among a party that seems increasingly divided over Trump’s attempts to cling to power.
Stocks have started the new year pricing in a rapid and vigorous recovery from the pandemic in 2021, but optimists are facing some headwinds from the near-term deterioration in the public health situation, which saw fresh records for hospital admissions due to Covid-19 over the holiday period. The spread of the disease is likely to have been accelerated by the broad refusal of Americans to change their plans for the holidays: the Transportation Security Administration registered more passengers on Sunday that on any day since the pandemic erupted last March. There's also a growing fear that the rollout of vaccinations won't be fast enough to stop the need for further lockdowns in the first and second quarters.
Among the early movers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 4.6% after the company said it all-but met its target of 500,000 deliveries last year, a feat that bolstered the faith of investors in the company's ability to scale up rapidly.  ADRs in Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), two of its biggest competitors in China, also rose 7.1% and 6.8%, respectively, as investors latched on to the big rise in Tesla's Chinese sales. 
At the other end of the spectrum, Quantumscape (NYSE:QS) stock fell over 35%, rewinding most of a massive runup around the holiday on speculation that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may want its solid-state batteries for the electric vehicle project it's developing itself.
M&A activity also made itself felt in early trading: FLIR Systems  (NASDAQ:FLIR) stock rose 20% after agreeing to be bought by Teledyne, while MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) stock fell 3.7% on fears that the company might end up paying too much for U.K.-based bookmaker Entain (OTC:GMVHY), whose technology powers its BetMGM operations. Entain on Monday said it had rejected an 11% stock-based bid that valued it at $11 billion and would have left its shareholders owning 41% of the enlarged MGM Resorts group."

1130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 09:27AM ET</span>",Valuation Caution Returns as Emerging Markets Face 2021 Reality,"(Bloomberg) -- Rarely, if ever, can a year have started with price levels in emerging markets looking so divorced from the fundamental backdrop.
Rising Covid-19 case numbers and uneven rates of recovery in the biggest of the developing economies underscore a nagging concern that this will be about as good as it gets for stocks, bonds and currencies. The relative strength index on MSCI Inc’s emerging-market equities gauge is above 70, suggesting the market is in overbought territory. The average yield on local-currency debt is less than 20 basis points above the all-time low of 3.46% reached in May.
Even though the virus is likely to hold back growth next year, a blended price-to-earnings ratio of emerging-market stocks based on analyst estimates for the next 12 months is currently at 15.4, a record high in data compiled by Bloomberg starting in 2005.
The fact remains though that with central-bank stimulus efforts and vaccine roll-outs providing comfort, most investors are confident the rally has further to run. Emerging-market economies will post an average fourth-quarter growth rate of 2.2%, according to a Bloomberg survey, though many see the efficacy of inoculation programs as a key driver for sentiment. The World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report on Tuesday is set to provide further clues on the pace of recovery.
“Markets are naturally forward-looking, so we have seen a strong rally despite the dark winter with restrictions still in place in many countries,” said Trieu Pham, a strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in London. “We remain constructive going in early 2021, with hopes that we turn a page on the Covid-19 issue and with major central banks remaining dovish.”

Developing-nation stocks ended 2020 at the highest level in 13 years while currencies edged closer to their 2018 record. Local-currency bonds had their best quarter in more than a decade, with investors staring down more than $17 trillion of negative-yielding debt worldwide.
That’s not to say there aren’t enough events to keep traders on their toes this week. Markets could face headwinds after the New York Stock Exchange said it will delist China’s three biggest telecom companies to comply with a U.S. executive order. Chinese oil majors, including CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd., may be next in line for delisting in the U.S., according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
The Georgia Senate runoffs on Tuesday may also affect sentiment toward risk assets, with the outcome set to decide control of the U.S. Senate and influence the ability of President-elect Joe Biden to advance his legislative agenda. Elsewhere, the Gulf Cooperation Council summit on the same day is seen as a possible step in resolving a crisis that erupted mid-2017 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed trade, travel and diplomatic ties with Qatar.
Among a slew of economic data due this week, Turkey’s year-end inflation rate was in focus on Monday as it leaves Governor Naci Agbal with little choice but to keep access to credit tight well into 2021.

China's highest-profile entrepreneur has not appeared in a public setting since a late October forum in Shanghai where he blasted China's regulatory system in a speech that put him on a collision course with officials, resulting in the suspension of a $37 billion IPO of Alibaba's Ant Group fintech arm. 
The Financial Times reported on Friday that Ma was replaced as a judge in the final episode in November of a game show for entrepreneurs called Africa's Business Heroes. 
An Alibaba spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday that the change was due to a scheduling conflict, declining further comment.
While news coverage of Ma's absence from public view triggered speculation on Twitter, which is blocked in China, it was not a significant trending topic on social media in mainland China, where sensitive topics are subject to censorship.
Chinese regulators have zeroed in on Ma's businesses since his October speech including launching an antitrust probe into Alibaba and ordering Ant to shake up its lending and other consumer finance businesses including the creation of a separate holding company to meet capital requirements.
""I think he's been told to lay low,"" said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based tech consultancy BDA China. ""This is a pretty unique situation, more linked to the sheer scale of Ant and the sensitivities over financial regulation,"" he said.
Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares fell 2.15% on Monday.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",Hedge funds bet on recovery in 2021,"By Maiya Keidan and Rod Nickel
TORONTO (Reuters) - Some global hedge fund investors are going into 2021 optimistic about a speedy snap-back from the economic challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic.
Hedge funds, which use leverage and employ more aggressive, often riskier strategies than other investors, believe many previously undesirable sectors, ranging from energy to retail, will rebound in 2021.
Accounting for roughly $3 trillion in assets, hedge funds showed resilience in 2020, with many outperforming the market, according to investors.
""We think 2021 is going to be a really positive year for the markets,"" said Jason Donville, president and CEO at Toronto-based hedge fund Donville Kent Asset Management. He forecasts an explosion of pent-up demand for travel and leisure producing a period of ""super growth.""
""I think it will take a little while for the vaccines to roll out and then somewhere around March, April, May, you're going to get a confluence of the vaccines getting to a certain critical mass... and infection rates dropping.""
For 2020 as a whole, the S&P 500 unofficially rose 16.26%, a stunning rally from a bear market that kicked off when the pandemic spread rapidly earlier in the year. 
""What I would say about 2021 is it looks like it's going to be a year of recovery,"" said Robert Sears, chief investment officer at UK-based Capital Generation Partners, which invests in hedge funds globally. ""That's the consensus view.""
The gainers in 2020 included the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector, up more than 42% as the sector benefited from the abrupt acceleration of online trends. On the other hand, the S&P 500 Hotels Restaurants and Leisure eeked out a gain of 1.4%.In the past quarter, however, leisure stocks have rebounded as vaccine rollouts have accelerated hopes of recovery. 
""I think macro conditions are going to continue to be quite volatile, so macro should have a good year,"" said Sears, referring to funds that invest according to macroeconomic trends.
He added that funds that specialize in currencies and commodities should do well.
Jack McIntyre, a portfolio manager at $62 billion U.S. firm Brandywine Global, which runs a macro hedge fund strategy, said there will be ""less uncertainty and more certainty"" in the new year.
Financials are a sector that has been challenged by coronavirus and could be supported by a recovery, said Philippe Ferreira at Paris-based fund of hedge fund Lyxor Asset Management, adding that the sector typically performs better in the initial stage of a recovery.
""Managers are easing the short bias toward financials because we are entering a recovery,"" said Ferreira, whose firm invests in hedge funds globally.
The S&P Financial Index fell around 4.3% in 2020 despite rebounding in the fourth quarter.
""On the macro side, managers say that with rates so low, they are diversifying fixed income with inflation and especially on the U.S. side and gold,"" said Ferreira.
North American energy is another beaten-down sector popular with hedge funds, market participants said. The Canadian Energy Sector Index lost 37.8% over the entirety of 2020 while a comparable index for the U.S. fell 37.3%.
""Anything in energy... all of that is a COVID recovery play to the extent the demand for fuel goes up, people start going back to the office more,"" said one Canadian hedge fund manager.
""We're adding the names like AltaGas (TSX:ALA), Pembina and Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources and we've been a buyer since post-the U.S. election.""
AltaGas stock plummeted 60% in March and is down 5.1% for the year through Dec. 31. Shares in Pembina and Canadian Natural Gas fell 61.3% and 27.3%, respectively, over 2020.
""I would say that energy consumption is going to make a very healthy recovery and probably continue on an above-historical year-on-year level,"" said Jay Tatum, portfolio manager at New York-based metals-focused Valent Asset Management. He added that oil was only one source of energy that would see growth.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, continuing last year’s positive momentum as investors look to the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to promote a broad economic recovery. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 176 points, or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 22 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 66 points, or 0.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 cash indices closed last week at record highs, having posted gains on five of the last six trading days, boosted in part by unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus. The Nasdaq Composite has traded higher on four of the last five days, and lies just below its record high.
Aside from stimulus, progress on the rollout of the various Covid-19 vaccines is generating optimism that a global economic recovery may be just around the corner. 
The U.K. started the rollout of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University, earlier Monday, while the U.S. government is considering giving some people half the dose of  Moderna  's  (NASDAQ:MRNA) drug in order to speed vaccinations, a federal official said on Sunday.
Also of interest are Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia, with control of the Senate at stake. If Republicans win at least one seat, they will maintain a slim majority. If Democrats win both, the chamber would be split 50-50 and the tie-breaking vote would go to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
President Donald Trump raised the political temperature after he was recorded over the weekend pressuring Georgia's top election official to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his defeat in the state. 
In the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in focus after the electric car manufacturer posted strong delivery numbers late in 2020, pushing it very close to making its ambitious 500,000 target for the year. 
The economic data slate is relatively light Monday, with December’s final Markit manufacturing PMI reading due at 09:45 AM ET (1445 GMT). In Europe, activity in the sector increased at its fastest pace since mid-2018, suggesting it was less hard hit by the pandemic than earlier in the year.
Oil prices climbed on expectations that a group of the world’s top producers will agree to continue to curb output next month at a meeting later in the day. OPEC and associated producers including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, decided at a meeting last month to raise output by just 500,000 barrels per day in January, still more than 7 million barrels a day below peak levels. Prices were also supported by Iran restarting uranium enrichment and seizing a South Korean tanker in the Persian Gulf.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $48.91 a barrel, at levels last seen in February 2020, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $52.45, up to March levels.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 2.2% to $1,931.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 1.3% higher at 1.2289.

LONDON (Reuters) -World stock markets hit record highs on Monday, the first trading day of the new year, as investors hoped the rollout of vaccines would ultimately lift a global economy decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Chinese yuan surged nearly 1% against the dollar, while the greenback plumbed its lowest levels against a basket of peer currencies since April 2018. Bitcoin took a 10% dive, falling below $30,000 after a blistering 800% rally since mid-March last year.
By 1126 GMT, European stock indexes were all higher, with Britain's FTSE 100 gaining 2.76%, Germany's DAX up 1.3%, Spain's IBEX up 1.36% and Italy's FTSE MIB rising 1%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was on course for its best day since Nov. 9, up 1.6%. (EU)
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were up 0.6%, after also touching a record high. (N)
MSCI's All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, hit a record high and was up 0.6% on the day.
""The year kicks off as 2020 ended, an everything rally with the double V dichotomy (virus vs. vaccine) seeing the hopes that either things get worse and stimulus ramps up or things get better and, well, things get better so long as there’s no hint of liquidity withdrawal and a taper tantrum,"" a trader said.
Asian stock markets also gained, although Japan's Nikkei 225 index shed early gains, falling 0.4% after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed the government was considering a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures as the coronavirus spreads.
Despite the optimism over vaccines, investors are still sounding caution over the path of the virus, which continues to spread amidst the discovery of a new strain.
""The virus retains the upper hand for a while longer,"" said Karl Steiner, chief quantitative strategist at SEB, noting that vaccinations have had an uneven start, characterized by vaccine shortages, vaccine resistance and delays.
Britain began vaccinating its population with the COVID-19 shot developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) on Monday.
With the lag between a full vaccine rollout and a global economic recovery, investors will count on central banks to keep money cheap.
""We continue to believe that equities have further room to rise in 2021 as monetary and fiscal stimulus measures provide a tailwind, and we anticipate significant earnings growth as the global economy recovers,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting are due on Wednesday and should offer more detail on discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year.
EYES ON DATA
The data calendar includes a raft of manufacturing surveys across the globe, which will show how industry is coping with the spread of the coronavirus, and the closely watched ISM surveys of U.S. factories and services.
Chinese factory activity continued to accelerate in December, though the PMI missed forecasts.
Japanese manufacturing stabilised for the first time in two years in December, while Taiwan picked up.
Friday sees the U.S. December payroll report where median forecasts are for only a modest increase of 100,000 jobs.
Analysts as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are tipping a fall of 50,000 in jobs, which would be a shock to market hopes of a speedy recovery.
""A number of incoming indicators on activity point to slower momentum as the economy closes out the year, including data on labour markets where initial claims rose during the December survey period,"" said economist Michael Gapen in a note.
Such a drop would add pressure on the Fed to ease further, another burden for the dollar which is already buckling under the weight of the massive U.S. budget and trade deficits.
In currencies, the euro pushed back up to $1.2294, having run into profit-taking late last week when it reached the highest since early 2018 at $1.2309. It gained almost 9% over 2020.
The dollar slipped to 102.80 yen. Sterling firmed to $1.3690, levels last seen in mid-2018.
The decline in the dollar has been a support for gold, leaving the metal 1.3% firmer at $1,931 an ounce.

Oil prices extended their rise after a couple of months of solid gains, with Brent crossing $53 a barrel. [O/R] U.S. crude added 1% to $49 a barrel.

European Union rules state that EU airlines must be owned and controlled by EU nationals or else lose their licences. EasyJet has held an Austrian operating licence since 2017 to retain its EU flying rights despite Britain leaving the EU. 
But the airline is currently 52.65% owned by non-EU shareholders, meaning it must make changes to meet EU rules following the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. 
By restricting voting rights, easyJet (LON:EZJ) and competitors such as British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), Wizz Air and Ryanair all hope to overcome the Brexit ownership headache.
However, concerns persist that the compliance efforts may be unsustainable or open to legal challenge by competitors.
The post-Brexit aviation pact includes no flexibility on the treatment of UK shareholders but does acknowledge ""potential benefits of the continued liberalisation of ownership and control"", with a pledge to review the rules over the next year.
EasyJet said on Monday that investors from outside the EU would be restricted to controlling 49.5% of its shares, and as such it was sending out notices to shareholders holding more than 3% of shares to suspend some of their voting rights. 
""The voting rights suspension is being applied on a 'last in, first out' basis such that the shares most recently acquired by relevant persons will have voting rights suspended first,"" easyJet said in a statement.

The investor register will also be kept under review, easyJet said, saying that if non-EU ownership remains over the 49.5% maximum for a sustained period it could start to force those shareholders to sell their shares to EU nationals.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>",Ladbrokes owner says MGM's $11 billion takeover bet undervalues company,"By Tanishaa Nadkar
(Reuters) -  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) owner Entain said on Monday that an $11 billion takeover approach from U.S. casino operator MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) significantly undervalued its business, as companies move to capitalise on an expected boom in U.S. sports betting. 
The United States is widely viewed as the next big growth market following a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on sports betting. U.S. companies have sought partnerships to tap European expertise, including Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment's 2.9 billion pound deal for Britain's William Hill.
MGM and Britain's Entain, formerly known as GVC, have had a joint venture since 2018, when they set up an online betting platform in the United States.
MGM's proposed offer of 1,383 pence per Entain share implies a deal value of 8.09 billion pounds ($11.08 billion), according to Reuters calculations, representing a 22% premium to Entain's last close.
Entain shares jumped as much as 28% to an all-time high of 1,455 pence, leading gainers on the UK blue-chip index. 
A deal would raise questions over the future of UK high street betting shops after Caesars said it could sell off William Hill's non-U.S. operations. However, an Entain spokesman told Reuters there was no detail on that yet.
""Entain is a far more global and more integrated operation – operating online gaming sites around the world as well as a high street estate. That makes folding the non-US operations into MGM or spinning them off separately a far greater challenge,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett said.
U.S. PROSPECTS
Entain said it received multiple proposals from MGM, with the latest one being MGM's offer of 0.6 of its shares for each Entain share. Under the proposal, Entain shareholders will own about 41.5% of the enlarged MGM.
MGM's proposal is backed by billionaire mogul Barry Diller's IAC group, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the proposal on Sunday. It follows an earlier all-cash proposal worth about $10 billion that was also rejected, it said.
Davy Research analysts also said the proposal undervalued Entain's operations, including its prospects in the United States, adding that MGM's flexibility and ability to improve its offer will be key.
Entain has itself expanded rapidly through a series of acquisitions and owns the bwin, Coral and Eurobet brands. It has asked MGM for more information on the strategic rationale for a combination.
""It would be no surprise if the predator were to put a bigger wad down on the table,"" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
Las Vegas-based MGM has indicated that a limited partial cash alternative would also be made available to Entain shareholders, the company said.
MGM did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside usual working hours.

1139,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 05:48AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Entain Shareholders Should Know When to Walk Away,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The new year has started with a variation on what’s now an old theme – a U.S. casino operator trying to buy a U.K. bookmaker, desperate to build up its capability in online gambling.
The new spin is that the British-based company is driving a harder bargain. Entain  (OTC:GMVHY), the owner of  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and online sports betting site Bwin, on Monday rebuffed an all-share offer from MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) that would have valued the company at $11 billion - 22% more than its year-end closing price - and given its shareholders 41% of the combined group. For comparison, Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) only had to shell out around a quarter of its market value when it bought William Hill in a similar deal in September.
Entain said on Monday it “has informed MGMRI that it believes that the proposal significantly undervalues the Company and its prospects.”
Clearly, a platform that allows gamblers to scratch their itch whenever they feel like it, even when socially distanced or locked down, has a lot going for it in the time of Corona.
Just as clearly, online sports betting has a better long-term growth trajectory than the brick-and-mortar casinos that are MGM’s stock-in-trade. Even in a generally stagnant European economy, online gambling is growing at a clip of around 10% a year, according to figures from the European Betting and Gaming Association. Much faster growth in likely in the U.S., where a more conservative regulatory environment means the industry is still immature.
The market is betting that Entain has the better hand. By mid-morning in London on Monday, Entain’s stock had settled into a range 3%-4% above the 1,383 pence price implicit in MGM’s latest offer, suggesting that a higher bid is expected.
However, MGM also has good cards of its own that will stop management from diluting its own shareholders too far. It’s already the distributor of Entain’s technology in the U.S., where the two have been joint venture partners since 2018.  That partnership already covers Nevada, New Jersey and Indiana and is set to cover 20 states by the end of this year. That will inhibit any search for a counterbidder, should Entain’s management try to turn this into an auction. Such concerns were one reason that William Hill ultimately went to its existing JV partner than to a rival bid from private equity last year.
Moreover, Entain still has a U.K. tax investigation into suspected improper dealings by a former Turkish subsidiary hanging over it, while the outlook for its Ladbrokes and Coral betting shops in the U.K. is still far from rosy. There may be no need to run from the table, but shareholders in a company that had scored four straight annual losses while building up its technology of the future should realize that this is as good a time as any to walk away."

Ma hasn’t been seen in public since Chinese regulators torpedoed Ant’s $35 billion IPO, then tightened fintech regulations and launched an antitrust probe into  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. -- all in a span of days. The Financial Times on Friday reported that the showrunners of the Shark Tank-like “Africa’s Business Heroes” replaced him as a judge in a November telecast and removed his photo from the show’s website, around the same time Ma delivered his now-infamous rebuke of the “pawnshop” mentalities of government overseers.
The flamboyant Ma -- long a fixture on the international conference circuit -- all but vanished from public view thereafter. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. An Alibaba spokesperson said Ma couldn’t attend due to scheduling conflicts, declining to comment specifically on the executive’s whereabouts.
Ma may have his hands full dealing with escalating scrutiny. The crackdown on Ma’s companies has set in motion a string of regulatory decrees that threaten to reshape the landscape for China’s online operators. Regulators are now studying plans to force Ant to divest equity investments in some financial companies, curbing the company’s influence over the sector, a person familiar with the matter has said.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",China telco shares hit by NYSE delisting announcement,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shares in China's three biggest telecoms companies fell as much as 5% in Hong Kong on Monday, the first trading session since the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it would delist the firms in a move China branded unwise and oppressive.
By the close of trade, the shares had mostly recovered. 
The NYSE said on Thursday it would delist China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd following the U.S. government's move in November to block investment in 31 firms it says are owned or controlled by China's military.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry, said the U.S. move was ""unwise"", oppressive, and reflected how ""random, arbitrary and uncertain"" U.S. rules can be.
""China is firmly opposed to the United States politicisation of the trade issue, the abuse of the state's power and stretching of the concept of national security to suppress Chinese companies,"" she told a regular news briefing on Monday.
The American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) listed by the three companies have a combined market value of under 20 billion yuan ($3.07 billion), or 2.2% of the firms' equity, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has said.
The delisting could put short term selling pressure on the stocks as the ADR shareholders may convert their holdings into Hong Kong shares before selling them. The stocks' potential removal from indexes such as MSCI and FTSE could also lead to selling by index funds, said Citi analyst Michelle Fang. 
""However, Chinese telcos' operations are mainly domestic focused and their sound fundamentals along with recovery trends and positive cash flows will not be affected by the delisting,"" she said.
After tumbling more than 4.5% to their lowest since July 2007, China Mobile shares closed down 0.79% at HK$43.85. China Telecom closed 2.79% lower, while China Unicom ended up 0.45%, versus a 0.89% rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
All three firms said they had not received a delisting notification from the NYSE.
Citic Securities analysts played down the impact of the delisting decision.
""The three firms on average only have 1.5% of their shares listed in the U.S. and the rest in Hong Kong, have ample liquidity, and haven't done any fundraising in the U.S. for 20 years. Having shares listed in the U.S. will only pose more risk for them,"" they said in a research note. 
Washington has hardened its stance against China in recent weeks. In December, it added dozens of Chinese firms to a trade blacklist, accusing Beijing of using them to harness civilian technology for military purposes.
Hua said China would take any necessary measures to safeguard the legal rights of Chinese firms.
""In recent years it's been quite normal to see Chinese firms delist in the U.S. or have secondary listings in Hong Kong,"" the Citic analysts wrote. ""With the delisting, the three telcos will get a chance to have their shares re-evaluated and reduce financial disclosure cost.""

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",Aviation reinsurance rates rise by up to 250% - report,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) -Aviation reinsurance rates rose by up to 250% at the key Jan. 1 renewal date, broker Willis Re said in a report on Monday, with the market still reeling from the impact of Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes two years ago.
The 737 MAX resumed commercial flights in the United States last week, following a 20-month safety ban after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people.
Insurers and reinsurers face claims from the crashes relating to hull and product liability that could amount to more than $2 billion, a large sum in a relatively small insurance sector, Willis Re International chair James Vickers told Reuters.
Aviation underwriters are also suffering from lower premiums due to worldwide lockdowns and travel bans, as insurance contracts are often negotiated based on the amount of time planes spend in the air.
Reinsurers, who share the burden of large risks with insurers in return for part of the premium, are also seeing rate rises in other sectors after years of falls.
Property and casualty reinsurance premiums are up by 25-30% for the riskiest areas of business, the report showed.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said the report showed a reinsurance hard market - in which premium rates are rising - was ""underway"", highlighting gains in U.S. property, global casualty and specialty lines such as trade credit and political risk, as well as aviation.
But rates are not rising as much as reinsurers had hoped, despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Insurers have themselves benefited from higher rates this year as well as lower claims in areas such as motor, giving them a strong hand in contract negotiations, Vickers said.
""Reinsurers were feeling quite bullish and feeling, 'this is our moment',"" Vickers said, adding that they had nevertheless ""achieved at least rate stability and some rate increases"".

Vickers said the biggest disagreements between insurers and reinsurers had been about cover for cyber attacks and communicable diseases such as COVID-19. Reinsurers are largely excluding these risks from policy wordings, he said.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed strongly higher Monday, with investors banking on the rollout of vaccines to help stimulate economic growth in a region hit hard by the Covid-19 virus.
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1% and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.7%. 
Britain became Monday the first country to roll out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University, a cheaper and more easily stored alternative to the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech  (NASDAQ:BNTX), which is already in use. 
This is another step forward in the global response to the pandemic, hopefully shortening the time before some form of herd immunity can be achieved and economies across the globe can reopen.
At the same time, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that he may have to impose tighter restrictions as Covid-19 cases soar in his country, while Germany is likely to extend its national restrictions beyond Jan. 10 to curb infection rates that are still running high.
It’s not only in Europe where coronavirus problems exist. Cases remain very high in the U.S., and in Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed the government was considering a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures.
Still, there was some good news Monday, as the Caixin/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index for December came in at 53.0. Although below November’s 54.9, this reading indicated the Chinese manufacturing sector is still expanding.
The equivalent Spanish December manufacturing PMI release came in at 51.0, above November’s 49.8, and a number of European countries are set to follow suit later Monday. 
In corporate news, shares in Entain (VIE:GVC), the parent of U.K. bookmakers  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) and Coral, soared 27% after the company rebuffed a bid from MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International over the weekend, saying it ""significantly undervalues"" the company. 
The corporate sector is otherwise largely quiet as the new year starts, but investors will be keeping a wary eye on Tuesday’s runoff elections in Georgia for two Senate seats that will determine whether the Republican Party keeps control of this branch of the U.S. government.
Oil prices climbed on expectations that a group of the world’s top producers will agree to continue to curb output next month at a meeting later in the day amid worries about demand growth as the Covid-19 pandemic rages.
OPEC and associated producers including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, decided at a meeting last month to raise output by just 500,000 barrels per day in January, still more than 7 million barrels a day below peak levels.
U.S. crude futures traded 2% higher at $49.50 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $52.95.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>",A 2021 vision: what every fund manager is buying (or selling),"By Marc Jones and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Dump the dollar! Buy emerging markets! Stay sustainable! These are among the consensus trades investment banks and asset managers reckon will dominate financial markets in 2021. 
Vaccines will - hopefully - make 2021 the year of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has upended some sectors and reinforced the dominance of others. 
Here are five trades the world's biggest investment houses seem to agree on: 
1/ THE MIGHTY (DOLLAR) FALLING
COVID-19 ended a decade of dollar strength, and expectations are for 2021 to bring more greenback pitfalls.
BofA's December investor survey showed 'shorting' the dollar was the second most crowded trade. Another gauge - U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data - shows $30 billion in net dollar shorts, swinging from last December's $17 billion net long. 
The reasoning, says Peter Fitzgerald, chief investment officer for multi-asset and macro at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, is that no central bank can ""out-dove the Fed"". 
In other words, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates near 0%, it kicked away the dollar's yield advantage over peers. And it still has room to ease policy.
President Donald Trump's imminent exit should also reduce trade and political tensions, which were dollar-supportive.
How much and for how long will the dollar fall? Analysts polled by Reuters predict weakness to endure until mid-2021, capped by COVID-19 uncertainty. 
But asset manager PIMCO notes dollar declines are fastest after deep recessions, with five instances of 8%-10% annual depreciations recorded between 2003 and 2018.
Vaccines and rebounding economies will ""hasten the dollar's fall from grace"", PIMCO predicted.
(Graphic: Unloved dollar - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpyjoekvg/Pasted%20image%201609349318840.png)
2/ RE-EMERGING MARKETS
With developing economies seen benefiting from recovering global trade, tourism and commodities, a weaker dollar and a more predictable White House,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s message is: ""Gotta Buy EM All!"" 
It's recommending currencies from China, Mexico, Brazil, South Africa and Russia, alongside bonds from Ukraine and Mexican oil firm Pemex. Rival banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) are also backing EM for 2021, with the BofA survey showing the sector the main favourite, or 'overweight'.
Debt in emerging market currencies will net investors 6.2% next year, more than the S&P500, BofA expects.
The sentiment swing towards a sector that's languished for a decade is driven of course by hopes of a China-led growth recovery but also the lure of higher emerging market interest rates, given 0% or negative yields across richer countries. 
EM currencies also have 25% of undervaluation to recoup, asset manager Pictet estimates.
(Graphic: Emerging markets ready to rise? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpejybwvr/Pasted%20image%201609343265541.png)
Institute of International Finance (IIF) data shows investors shovelling money into EM assets at the fastest rate in nearly a decade.
But some remain wary. Higher Treasury yields could spark a 2013-style ""taper tantrum"", Citi suggested. Investment-grade credit ratings are at risk in some countries such as Romania or Mexico, while more debt defaults are likely in weaker nations.
(Graphic: Emerging hopes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnqmyqvl/Pasted%20image%201609346306035.png)
3/ (CENTRAL) BANKING ON IT 
Underpinning most bets is the view that the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and People's Bank of China will keep the cheap money flowing.
Central banks worldwide spent $1.3 billion an hour since March on asset purchases, BofA calculates. There were also 190 rate cuts in 2020 year - roughly four every five trading days.
But with global GDP seen expanding 5.4% next year - the most since 1973 - it might be hard to justify pushing the pedal further to the metal, especially if inflation creeps higher. 
And not much policy room is left anyway. JPMorgan estimates that over 80% of sovereign bonds from richer nations pay negative yields after factoring in inflation. Many investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are now underweight the sector.
Still, the Big Five's asset purchases should total $3 trillion, Pictet strategist Steve Donze predicts, down from this year's $8 trillion but enough to keep bond yields extremely low.
A note of caution from JPMorgan - consensus forecasts in the past 10-15 years have correctly called the direction of Treasury yields only 40% of the time. 
(Graphic: Central bank balance sheets swell - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdarebpo/Pasted%20image%201607093853415.png)
4/ ESG - HERE FOR GOOD
The assets of investment funds adhering to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles doubled this past year to over $1.3 trillion, and the IIF predicts the pace will accelerate in 2021, especially if U.S. President-elect Joe Biden pursues a greener agenda
Concerns about pollution, climate change and labour rights are the main drivers. But the IIF also points out 80% of ""sustainable"" equity indices outperformed non-ESG peers during the pandemic-linked selloff, while renewable energy has been the runaway outperformer since then.
BlackRock describes ESG as ""the tectonic shift transforming investing"", forecasting ""persistent flows into sustainable assets in the long transition to a less carbon-intensive world.""
Two-thirds of ESG fund assets are in equities, but sustainable debt has grown 20% in 2020 to more than $620 billion. Governments are stepping up green debt issuance while central banks are eyeing more sustainable bond-buying and reserve strategies 
(Graphic: Electric (vehicle) dreams - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjqjjjvr/Pasted%20image%201608312246439.png)
5/ BIDEN TIME ON TECH
Many of the above investment strategies are premised on a very different approach to trade and geopolitics under Biden. 
He has vowed the United States will be ""ready to lead"" again on the global stage, but BofA cautions that China, North Korea or Iran may look to test him early on with ""provocative actions"". 
In some areas - big data, 5G, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, robotics, and cybersecurity - Biden's policies might be just as combative as Trump's. That may speed up the move towards what's dubbed 'splinternet', with dual or multiple tech systems. 
Tech and e-commerce companies account for almost a quarter of U.S. corporate profits, while tech comprises 40% of MSCI's emerging equity index. So watch this space.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 01:11AM ET</span>",Explainer: How investors view the Georgia U.S. Senate runoff,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors have been weighing a major political unknown since the November election that could ripple through asset prices: control of the Senate.
A flip to Democrat control could put more pressure on the dollar and spark Treasury debt yields higher, while Republicans keeping control could fuel equities, various analysts said. 
But while investors see some risks in how Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia go between incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, there should be at least some relief at long-awaited clarity over the balance of power in Congress.
WHAT IS AT STAKE? 
If Republicans win at least one Senate seat, they will maintain a slim majority. If Democrats sweep the twin runoffs, the chamber would be split 50-50 and the tie-breaking vote would go to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, giving President-elect Joe Biden's party full sway over Congress.
Betting market PredictIt https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4366/Which-party-will-control-the-Senate-after-2020-election gives Republicans a 60% chance of retaining the Senate majority as of Friday.
A unified government would present Biden with enhanced ability to reshape the world's largest economy, from rewriting the tax code to boosting stimulus and infrastructure spending.
Biden has in the past proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, as well as spending $2 trillion on infrastructure.
Some investors are weighing the potential of more stimulus ahead if Democrats take the Georgia seats. A $892 billion relief package was passed by Congress last month, which Biden has called a ""downpayment"" on a bigger stimulus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declined to schedule a swift vote on increasing COVID-19 relief checks from $600 to $2,000.
Another round would be made more difficult if Republicans retain control of the Senate - although even if Democrats win the Georgia seats they could still struggle to pass spending legislation.
NAIL BITING? MAYBE A BIT 
While markets typically hate uncertainty, risk appetite has been strong since the Nov. 3 election despite the unanswered question surrounding the Senate. The S&P 500 logged a gain of about 11%. 
Investors in the U.S. stock market are pricing an uptick in volatility around the runoff results, according to the CBOE Volatility Index, the stock market's fear gauge, and options activity, analysts said. 
""S&P 500 options are pricing in a lot more volatility over the next month than markets have experienced over the previous month,"" Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy said in a note, citing the Georgia Senate runoff as a possible catalyst.
REPUBLICAN VICTORY
Republicans winning both seats would be positive for stocks and limit the need for investors to tweak portfolios, some analysts said.
Any policy changes the Biden administration tries to bring would have to garner bipartisan support and necessarily be more moderate.
Even with just one victory, the Republicans could hang on to control of the Senate and preempt the need for big changes to asset allocations, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
Political gridlock will likely prevent any substantial fiscal measures, helping keep Treasury yields in check.
For the battered U.S. dollar, it could mean less government spending which threatens to weigh on the greenback, and less risk of tax hikes that some see as limiting growth, analysts said. Still, analysts think the dollar is heading lower whatever the outcome.
DEMOCRATIC SWEEP
Democrats nabbing both seats has the most potential for market upheaval - but analysts are not all in agreement about exactly how.
A blue wave would spur a big reshuffling of positions, due to increased regulatory risks for banks, technology companies and the energy sector, Moya said.
The prospect of higher corporate taxes is also viewed as negative for stock prices.
""I think you could see some aggressive selling, at least by traders, if there is that blue wave,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Still, a Georgia sweep would only give the Democrats a slim Senate margin, meaning Democratic proposals such as on tax may be watered down, analysts have said.
Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, conversely thinks it would be positive for equities, since it could signal a larger fiscal package.
Chris Woods at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said Democrats taking the Senate would mean ""an ever greater convergence of loose fiscal and monetary policy"" which would have negative implications for U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. 
In Treasuries, the longer-dated end of the yield curve could rise further if the Treasury Department has to issue more new debt, driving prices down and yields up.
For the dollar, the prospect of increased government spending could lead to further weakness. 

""The dollar is weakening in any scenario but it will get weaker faster under a Dem sweep,"" Purves said, citing higher deficits and the potential for ""more sluggish growth because of higher taxes down the road.""

Icahn had a 15.5% stake in Herbalife as of Sept. 30. The latest deal is expected to close by Jan. 7, after which Icahn Enterprises will hold about 8 million of Herbalife's shares, representing a stake of about 6%, the statement added.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that in recent days Icahn had sold about 10% of his stake back to the multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements.
Icahn's remaining stake is worth about $400 million, according to WSJ https://on.wsj.com/3b4a4UR.
Icahn began buying Herbalife shares in 2013 while extolling the company and had since been its largest shareholder.
In 2013, Herbalife and Icahn Enterprises entered into a support agreement that allowed Icahn Enterprises to have five board seats for as long as it held at least 14 million Herbalife shares.
With Icahn's stake now falling below the threshold of 14 million shares, the support agreement has been terminated and the activist investor's board representatives have stepped down, Herbalife said on Sunday..
Icahn said that the time for activism at Herbalife ""has passed"". 
""At the time (when he started investing in Herbalife), I believed the company was in need of an activist and that certainly turned out to be correct"", Icahn said on Sunday. 
""The time for activism has passed as the company has grown, and I don't typically invest billions of dollars in companies where our role as activist is not needed,"" he added.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, with the possible imposition of a state of emergency in Japan capping gains from 2020’s record rally.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.63% by 10:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT), after Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would consider declaring a fresh state of emergency in the Tokyo area to stem record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the country over the past few days.
The government will finalize the extent of the emergency declaration shortly, Suga told a news conference earlier in the day. He also said he will ask parliament to amend an act on virus management when it convenes later in the month.
South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 2.36%. South Korea has also seen the number of daily cases exceed more than 1,000 for four days, and in response will expand a ban on private gatherings larger than four people to the whole country as well as extending unprecedented social distancing rules in greater Seoul.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.41% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.92%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.79% and the Shenzhen Component rose 1.88%. The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 53 for December, lower than both the 54.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 54.9 reading.
Meanwhile, Chinese oil majors could be next in line for delisting in U.S. stock exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange said during the previous week that China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941),  China Telecom Corp Ltd  (NYSE:CHA) and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd (NYSE:CHU) would all be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, with delisting proceedings already initiated.
Although global shares began 2021 at rich valuations, amid hopes that a widespread distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, central bank support and government support will lead to economic recovery, the ever-increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases globally and the fact that much of the optimism has been priced in, saw some investors paint a cautiously optimistic picture.
“COVID-19 cases and vaccine distribution will remain the key focus for investors for now. Without the wide distribution of vaccines, the paths of COVID-19 and the economy are locked together, given the impact on social mobility and economic curtailment. This link will be broken as immunity levels rise into the middle of the year, but until then the economic path will be bumpy over the first quarter,” JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management global market strategist Kerry Craig told Bloomberg.
The number of COVID-19 cases globally has exceeded 85 million as of Jan. 4, with over 20.6 million cases in the U.S. alone, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Also on investors’ minds is the Jan. 5 runoff election in the state of Georgia for two Senate seats that will determine which party will control the Senate.
If the incumbent Republican candidates win either or both seats, they will retain their slim majority and hamper President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda.
However, a Democrat victory, which has not happened in the state for 20 years, could see more stimulus measures.
“If Democrats win both races, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving the party unified control of the White House and Congress,” CBA analysts said in a note.
“This would raise the likelihood a material U.S. infrastructure spending package gets fast tracked through Congress,” the note added.
The Federal Reserve will also release the minutes from its December meeting on Wednesday. The minutes are expected to offer more detail on the discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying in 2021."
1153,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 03, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>",China Oil Majors May Face U.S. Delisting After Telcos Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese oil majors may be next in line for delisting in the U.S. after the New York Stock Exchange said last week it would remove the Asian nation’s three biggest telecom companies.
China’s largest offshore oil producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd. could be most at risk as it’s on the Pentagon’s list of companies it says are owned or controlled by Chinese military, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung. PetroChina Co. Ltd. and China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) and Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), may also be under threat as the energy sector is crucial to China’s military, he said.
“More Chinese companies could get delisted in the U.S. and the oil majors could come as the next wave,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. At the same time, the impact of removing the telecom firms is probably minimal as they were thinly-traded in the U.S. and they haven’t raised much funds there, he said.
The NYSE said it would delist the telecom operators to comply with a U.S. executive order imposing restrictions on companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military. China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd., China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp Ltd. and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) Hong Kong Ltd. would all be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and proceedings to delist them have started, the exchange said.
In separate statements Monday, each company said it “regrets” the NYSE’s actions, and said the decision might affect the prices and trading volume of the companies’ shares. All three companies said they hadn’t received any notification from the NYSE about the delisting.
Safeguarding Interests
China Unicom and China Mobile said they’re reviewing ways to protect the companies’ “lawful rights.” China Telecom said it’s considering “corresponding options” to “safeguard the legitimate interests of the company.”

China’s Ministry of Commerce responded on Saturday, saying the country would take necessary action to protect the rights of Chinese companies and it hoped the two countries could work together to create a fair and predictable environment for businesses and investors.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said Sunday that given their small amount of U.S.-traded shares, the impact on the telecommunications companies would be limited and that they are well-positioned to handle any fallout from the delisting.
China Says NYSE Delisting of Its Telco Giants Has Limited Impact
“The recent move by some political forces in the U.S. to continuously and groundlessly suppress foreign companies listed on the U.S. markets, even at the cost of undermining its own position in the global capital markets, has demonstrated that U.S. rules and institutions can become arbitrary, reckless and unpredictable,” the CSRC said in a statement on its website.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices. The order prohibited U.S. investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.
China’s Foreign Ministry later accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. Chinese officials have also threatened to respond to previous Trump administration actions with their own blacklist of U.S. companies.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>","Analysis-For Peugeot and FCA, completing their merger is just the start","By Gilles Guillaume, Giulio Piovaccari and Nick Carey
PARIS/MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - When Carlos Tavares takes the wheel of a combined PSA and Fiat Chrysler this year he will quickly need to revive the carmaker's fortunes in China, rationalise a sprawling global empire and address massive overcapacity.
The former rally driver has proved his mettle by turning around France's biggest carmaker but will have his work cut out once it merges with its Italian-American rival to create Stellantis - the world's fourth biggest automaker.
Shareholders in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and PSA Group are expected to approve the deal on Monday, paving the way for the $52 billion transaction to be completed by the end of March. 
Once up and running, Stellantis will have 14 car brands under one roof, from FCA's Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati cars to PSA's Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Citroen, Opel and DS. 
It will be ahead of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Hyundai Motor-Kia Motors and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) in global sales rankings but still trail Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM).
Like all global automakers, Stellantis will be spending billions of dollars in the coming years to transform its vehicle range for an electric era but Tavares also has other pressing issues to tackle.
Stellantis is getting pummelled in China, the world's biggest car market, by international and local rivals alike and Tavares himself has acknowledged that's not tenable.
Both PSA and FCA operate at just 8% of their capacity in the Asia-Pacific region, according to consultancy LMC. Most of that capacity is in China, a market of 21 million cars a year, and analysts said the merger is the best chance for a turnaround.
""On their own, each group might not be able to afford a reboot in China,"" said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) investment bank.
Tavares has been careful not to discuss details of his plans for overhauling the Fiat Chrysler side of Stellantis. But he has been blunt about the problems Peugeot has in China and has pledged that Stellantis will mount a comeback.
""No global car company can afford not to be in the largest car market in the world,"" he said at the Reuters Automotive Summit teleconference in November..
TOO MUCH CAPACITY?
It's not just China where Stellantis has a capacity problem. 
Stellantis could shut down factories around the world with a combined capacity sufficient to build Ford's entire annual output - and still boost production with its remaining plants, according to LMC estimates. 
While Stellantis has pledged not to close any factories, its network could build as many as 7 million more vehicles than it currently sells, according to LMC.
Both companies ran at less than half their capacity during pandemic-stricken 2020, but even in a boom year such as 2016, LMC data show the combined group would have had overcapacity of nearly 4 million vehicles. 
Neither company would comment on LMC's figures. PSA and FCA have said Stellantis can cut its combined annual costs by 5 billion euros without any plant closures. 
Nevertheless, analysts say overcapacity could force some to shut, with factories outside the company's home countries - such as Opel's Ellesmere Port plant in England or Fiat's Kragujevac plant in Serbia - more at risk.
""PSA and FCA will profess that Stellantis will be global and not French or Italian but their governments will remind them they have a nationality,"" said Houchois at Jefferies. 
THE BRANDS
Stellantis will have rivers of cash to fund restructuring and the development of electric vehicles thanks to FCA sales of high-margin Jeep sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and Ram pick-up trucks to U.S. consumers.
But shareholders will also be counting on Tavares to rationalise the company's many other brands and ensure they are profitable - as he did with Opel after PSA bought the struggling German brand from General Motors in 2017.
Some Stellantis brands such as Jeep are robust global icons while Fiat and Peugeot have faithful followers but others, like Lancia and Chrysler, are only marginal, regional names.
""He has always proved able to value all the brands in his portfolio, unlike other managers have done in the past,"" said Marco Santino, a partner at Oliver Wyman covering the automotive and manufacturing industries.
At the other end of the scale, FCA's SUV and truck business is a major profit centre, so Tavares is likely to leave it alone and drop plans to reintroduce PSA brands to U.S. consumers.
""That plan is dead,"" a source at PSA said.
Other brands face an uncertain future. High-end Maserati sports cars have performed poorly in recent years, but the brand has potential as global demand for luxury models grows. 
But Fiat Chrysler's Lancia brand sold just 34,000 vehicles in the European Union in the first three quarters of 2020.
Managing such a large portfolio could prove a tricky balancing act, according to Justin Cox, director of global production at LMC, because some of the brands are very similar to each other and could eat into each other’s sales.
“They will have to work to avoid cannibalization,” he said.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2021 04:25PM ET</span>","U.S. may cut some Moderna vaccine doses in half to speed rollout, official says","By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering giving some people half the dose of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine in order to speed vaccinations, a federal official said on Sunday.
Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, the federal vaccine program, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that officials were in talks with Moderna and the Food and Drug Administration about the idea. Moderna's vaccine requires two injections.
""We know that for the Moderna vaccine, giving half of the dose to people between the ages of 18 and 55, two doses, half the dose, which means exactly achieving the objective of immunizing double the number of people with the doses we have,"" Slaoui said.
""We know it induces identical immune response"" to the full dose, he added.
Moderna and the FDA could not immediately be reached for comment.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had administered 4,225,756 first doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Saturday morning and distributed 13,071,925 doses.
The U.S. has also approved a vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which like Moderna's requires two shots. Vaccinations have fallen far short of early targets, as officials had hoped to have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of the 2020.
Slaoui said he was optimistic vaccinations would continue to accelerate. He rejected the suggestion that officials should prioritize giving more people a single shot, rather than holding back doses for the second shot, saying that cutting Moderna vaccine doses in half was ""a more responsible approach that would be based on facts and data.""
Slaoui said it would likely not be known until late spring whether vaccinated people can still spread the disease to others.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2021 12:52AM ET</span>",Column: Six Social Security fixes that should be on Biden’s agenda next year,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden will be plenty busy battling the pandemic when he takes office next month, and Social Security will likely not be on top of his agenda. But nudging higher reforms for Social Security, our most important retirement program, would be a very smart move.
The role of this safety net has never been more important as the country attempts to dig out from the COVID-19 disaster. Here are six Social Security moves the new president and Congress should make.
ADDRESS SOLVENCY
Social Security’s long-term solvency already was eroding before the pandemic, and that has accelerated a bit due to the economic downturn and accompanying slump in revenue from the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) - better known as the payroll tax. Social Security’s actuary now projects that the combined retirement and disability trust funds will be “exhausted” in 2034 - a term referencing the point when reserve funds will be gone. That is one year earlier than the last projection by Social Security’s trustees, before the pandemic began.
At the point of exhaustion, Social Security would have sufficient income from current tax payments to meet roughly 80% of promised benefits. And the exhaustion date could come sooner, depending on the length and depth of the recession.
As a candidate, Biden issued a detailed plan for Social Security that addresses the solvency problem by adding a new tier of FICA contributions for high earners. Currently, workers and employers split a 12.4% FICA tax, levied on income up to $137,700 (In 2021, the cap will be adjusted for inflation to $142,800). Biden would add a new tax at the same rate on incomes over $400,000. 
Biden stayed away from any broad-based FICA tax hike, which would allow lawmakers to avoid political flak for raising taxes on people with less-than-stratospheric incomes - but his plan extends solvency only until 2040. It would be good to go further, but that would probably need a new source of revenue - for example, a tax on Wall Street or fossil fuels. That seems sensible but unlikely to me. 
IMPROVE BENEFIT ADEQUACY
The economic devastation wrought by COVID-19 makes expansion of Social Security benefits more critical than ever. Biden has proposed a series of moderate expansions that should be passed into law. They include crediting caregivers in their benefits for time spent out of the workforce - a change that would especially benefit women, who already face a substantial retirement gender gap https://nyti.ms/3mk50h5. He also would expand benefits for widows and seniors who had collected payments for 20 years. 
Biden also favors shifting to a more generous yardstick for determining Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustment.
REOPEN FIELD OFFICES - SAFELY
The Social Security Administration’s vast network of field offices has been closed since March due to the pandemic, with most staff operating virtually. As the pandemic recedes, it will be critical to reopen the offices safely from a health perspective, with a priority on offices that serve lower-income workers who are less likely to interact with the agency online.
Reopening could present opportunities for modernization of the offices. “You could really transform the offices to make them green from an environmental perspective and safe,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group that recently published a set of transition recommendations https:// for the new administration. 
REVERSE TIGHTENING OF DISABILITY RULES
The new administration should move quickly to reverse -wherever possible - steps the Trump administration has taken through rulemaking to make it tougher to file for, and receive, Social Security disability benefits. That is especially wrongheaded as evidence grows that many COVID-19 victims will suffer long-term effects from the disease https://reut.rs/2KadgmR that will leave them unable to work and in need of Social Security income. 
FIX THE COVID 'NOTCH'
Pandemic-driven job loss has created a technical glitch that threatens unwarranted benefit cuts for workers who turn 60 this year. 
Benefits are based on each worker’s earnings history, indexed to reflect growth in the aggregate of all national wages. But aggregate wages will fall substantially this year due to job loss in the pandemic - an unusual situation that the Social Security system is not built to accommodate. The indexing is done in the year you turn 60, which is why this age group would suffer a singular hit. Social Security’s actuaries estimated earlier this year that someone expecting an initial benefit of $2,000 per month next year would receive roughly $119 less as a result of the “notch.”
The most sensible fix also is simple. Congress should put a floor underneath the system’s indexing of earnings - similar to the hold-harmless provision for cost-of-living adjustments - to ensure that the aggregate wage calculation cannot decrease benefits.
FIX THE FICA MESS
President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum https://reut.rs/2KtBGay in August ordering the deferral of FICA taxes through year-end as an economic stimulus measure. This was an ineffective idea from the start, since it provided tax relief to employed people, not those who have lost jobs and need disaster relief. And most employers wanted nothing to do with it, since it created a liability that would have to be repaid later through a temporary doubling of tax liabilities for workers and employers. 
Lacking federal guidance, very few private-sector employers implemented the plan - but it was enforced by the federal government. That means federal workers will see a sudden bump in their taxes starting in January.
Biden could reduce the impact with an executive order that spreads out the repayments over a longer period of time.
A much broader set of retirement policy reform also awaits action. But Social Security was designed to meet moments like this one. The opportunity to put the program to good use should not be wasted.

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2021 12:51AM ET</span>",'Stay-at-home' trade still has legs in '21: top mutual fund managers,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The so-called ""stay-at-home"" trade will not end next year even if the pandemic is defeated, according to managers of the top-performing U.S. mutual fund managers of 2020. They are continuing to bet on those stocks. 
Funds that went early into stocks such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and telemedicine company Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc saw their returns soar this year as more aspects of everyday life went online. Yet the announcements of successful coronavirus vaccines by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in early November have helped broaden the market rally to financial, energy and leisure stocks that would benefit from an economic rebound. That has pushed the return of the S&P 500 Value index up 5% since then, slightly ahead of the 4.1% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index. 
""It's likely that we could see a temporarily cyclical rotation as the vaccine rolls out in mass,"" said Anthony Zackery, a portfolio manger at Zevenbergen Capital Investments. Two of the funds that Zackery helps manage - the Zevenbergen Genea and the Zevenbergen Growth - gained more than 130% since the start of the year through Dec. 18, putting both within the top 10 best-performing U.S. actively managed equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar. The benchmark S&P 500, by comparison, is up 14.8% over the same time. 
GRAPHIC: The Best Actively-Managed U.S. Stock Funds of 2020 https://graphics.reuters.com/FUNDS-YEAREND/oakpejxqlvr/chart.png
Yet Zackery cautioned that he thinks a value trade will be short-lived. ""We don't think a vaccine and reopening of the economy will stop the inevitable adoption of telemedicine, ecommerce and some of the other secular trends we're watching,"" he said.
Zackery said his fund has found ""fertile ground"" and added some of the recent growth-focused companies that have gone public in the last few months despite their high valuations. 
""Even companies like Snowflake or Airbnb or DoorDash may have high market caps compared with industry comparables, but they are bringing in sales and revenue, unlike the companies of the dot-com era,"" he said. 
With $21.3 trillion in assets, the U.S. mutual fund industry is the largest in the world and one of the prime ways through which Americans save for retirement. Overall, U.S. households hold 89% of all assets held in mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, making them one of the best proxies for retail investor returns. 
Gary Robinson, a portfolio manager at Baillie Gifford whose Baillie Gifford US Equity Growth fund has returned 133.7% since the start of the year through Dec. 18, said he remains focused on e-commerce and telemedicine stocks that have rallied this year and secular growth companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Among new additions to the portfolio this year were cloud communications platform company Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) Inc, which has rallied 271% for the year to date, and insurance company Lemonade Inc, which is up 53% since it went public in July.
""Even after you've seen relatively fast growth, you've still got a lot of room to go,"" he said. 
Michael Baron, a portfolio manager at Baron Capital whose Baron Partners fund is up 145.6% since the start of the year, said he sees no reason to change the fund's strategy of mixing high-growth companies in with financials and real estate companies. 
""There's a light at the end of the tunnel but we're not making dramatic changes to the portfolio post-COVID,"" he said. 
Among the fund's holdings are hotel operator Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp, which Baron expects to post higher margins in 2021 after it took steps to rein in costs such as laying off 1,300 people in May, and home-listing site Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) Inc, whose shares have jumped 206% year to date. 

""We just don't think we are going back to the old ways of doing business,"" Baron said.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>",U.S. approves NYSE listing plan to cut out Wall Street middlemen,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies can raise capital on the New York Stock Exchange through direct listings, without losing gains if their stock pops or forking out hefty fees to Wall Street banks, which typically underwrite such capital raisings, the U.S. securities regulator said on Tuesday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the NYSE's ""direct"" listing plan threatens to overhaul the U.S. initial public offering market, by allowing aspiring public companies to sell shares directly to investors.
Investment banks have for decades organized IPOs, marketed them to institutions and supported the stock via their trading desks.
The change, following months of industry haggling, will help reduce what critics call excessive underwriter fees, a major barrier to companies looking to go public. It is especially important to technology companies and start-ups, both of which would stand to gain greatly from the new SEC ruling. 
""This is a game changer for our capital markets, leveling the playing field for everyday investors and providing companies with another path to go public at a moment when they are seeking just this type of innovation,"" NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in a statement.
Lev Bagramian, an advocate of the Washington-based Better Markets, said ""while many have falsely blamed certain pro-investor regulations as too costly for companies that are considering going public, the real cost has been the average 7% - or higher for smaller issuers - that issuers pay to big Wall Street firms to underwrite the IPO.""
The new form of direct listings has the potential to ""democratize the IPO process"" when done in a responsible way that maintains strong investor protections, he added.
Some investor groups, however, warned it could diminish their protections, because banks perform due diligence on the companies.
""The lack of a traditional underwriter means investors will lose a key protection: a gatekeeper incented to ensure that the disclosures around an initial listing are accurate and not misleading,” said SEC Democratic Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Allison Lee, who voted against the approval of NYSE’s rule.
The SEC said it found the NYSE proposal will ""facilitate the orderly distribution and trading of shares, as well as foster competition.""
The plan was designed to ""prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest,"" it added.
The commission had previously allowed direct listings for companies that did not raise capital in the process. 
In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) was the first major company to go public via that route. Direct listings had also been limited to companies wanting to give early investors or management the opportunity to cash out by selling stock.
Peter Thiel-backed Palantir Technologies and Asana are some of the high-profile, cash-rich private start-ups to choose the direct listing route this year.
Under the NYSE plan, issuers can sell shares directly on the exchange in an auction, which would increase opportunities for more investors to purchase shares at the initial offering price, rather than having to wait to buy in the aftermarket.
That could make direct listings more common, since most companies go public to raise capital.
What's more, under the NYSE plan, new shares will get priority over secondary ones. This will give companies a better chance of reaching their fundraising goals.
NYSE rival Nasdaq Inc has a filed a similar direct listing proposal with the SEC.

""It was not a quick process to get this change through the SEC, which put a lot of effort into balancing the rights of investors versus the desire of more companies to have direct listing as an option,"" said Michael Hermsen, a Chicago-based partner at law firm Mayer Brown.

As part of its global turnaround plan, which is reversing a rapid expansion led by the ousted former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) will cut its distribution channels in thirty countries, mainly in East Europe.

The report didn't provide details of the scale of the outsourcing. Calls to Nissan's public relations office went unanswered on Friday, a public holiday in Japan.
The Japanese motor company is currently moving its operations away from Europe and shifting its focus to China, the United States, and Japan.
Nissan, which expects to post a record operating loss of 340 billion yen ($3.25 billion) in the year to March 31, is cutting production capacity and model numbers by a fifth and aims to slash operating expenses by 300 billion yen over three years.

The company's three-way alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motor was plunged into uncertainty in 2018, when Ghosn was arrested on financial misconduct charges, which he denies. He later fled Japan while being monitored by law enforcement and awaiting trial at his residence.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will focus on developing its core portfolio of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and their electric version, a senior executive said on Friday after the company ended joint venture talks with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Anish Shah, the deputy managing director, said Mahindra will focus mainly on large SUVs for its core India market in the short term and move to electric in the medium term, as it charts a new strategy for its automotive business.
""We are going back to our core,"" Shah, who will take over as managing director from April, told Reuters.
""We are going to look ahead at how we can accelerate our investment in electric and really start moving to the new age. We clearly hold the ambition to be a global brand and there again the electric journey is an important one,"" Shah said.
Mahindra's high-end electric vehicle Pininfarina Battista is a starting point, Shah said, adding that the automaker would look at developing more electric platforms in India to build SUVs for the local and export markets. 
Mahindra and Ford late on Thursday called off their automotive joint venture due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted them to reassess their capital allocation priorities.
The two companies had plans to jointly develop vehicles for manufacture in India for local sales and export to dozens of emerging markets under the Ford badge.
However, Mahindra was not convinced the venture would generate returns needed to justify the higher investment it would have to make in a post-pandemic world.
Shah told reporters Mahindra had initially planned to invest about 30 billion rupees ($410.68 million) in the venture, half of which would have been equity.
Now, Mahindra plans to invest the money in electric vehicles, he said, adding it is open to collaborating with Ford in the future, including in EVs.
The review is part of a broader restructuring at Mahindra under which the company is exiting several loss-making businesses, including its South Korean unit Ssangyong Motor, to focus on profits and cash flow.
Mahindra said on Friday it is close to agreeing a deal with a potential investor for its majority stake in Ssangyong, which has been placed in receivership. Its total investment in the SUV-maker is $264 million and the extent of the write-off would depend on what deal is agreed, Shah said.
The automaker last year also pulled the plug on its U.S. electric scooter unit GenZe and aviation business GippsAero. Its other global subsidiaries include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) Motorcycles. 

Mahindra sold close to 190,000 passenger vehicles in India in the last fiscal year ended March 31, giving it close to 7% share of the market, industry data shows.

The move https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2020/NYSE-to-Commence-Delisting-Proceedings-in-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-to-Comply-with-Executive-Order-13959/default.aspx by the NYSE, which will limit U.S. investor access, follows global index providers MSCI Inc, S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell and Nasdaq deleting various Chinese companies from their indexes.
It's ""a modest step, but at least an awakening to national security and human rights-related risk”, said Roger Robinson, a former White House official who supports curbing Chinese access to U.S. investors.
NYSE said that the issuers, China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corporation Limited , China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Limited (HK:0941) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) (Hong Kong) Limited , were no longer suitable for listing as the order prohibits any transactions in securities ""designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of any Communist Chinese military company, by any United States person.""

The order sought to give teeth to a 1999 law that mandated that the Department of Defense compile a list of Chinese military companies. The Pentagon, which only complied with the mandate this year, has so far designated 35 companies, including oil company CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd and China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.
China has condemned that ban, and fund managers have said it could benefit non-U.S. investors able to pick up the stocks.
NYSE said that it would suspend trading in the stocks on either Jan. 7 or Jan. 11. The issuers have a right to a review of the decision. Each of the telecoms companies named by the NYSE also has a listing in Hong Kong. 
China Telecom is also under fire from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which said earlier in December that it had begun the process of revoking the company's authorization to operate in the United States.
The companies could not be reached for comment on a public holiday in China. 
Ties between Washington and Beijing have grown increasingly antagonistic over the past year as the world's top two economies sparred over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong and rising tensions in the South China Sea. 

Separately, President Donald Trump signed a law last month that would kick Chinese companies off U.S. stock exchanges unless they adhere to American auditing standards. Market participants said this would intensify a rush by U.S.-listed Chinese firms to seek back up listings in Hong Kong.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>","SolarWinds hackers accessed Microsoft source code, the company says","By Raphael Satter and Joseph Menn
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The hacking group behind the SolarWinds compromise was able to break into  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and access some of its source code, Microsoft said on Thursday, something experts said sent a worrying signal about the spies' ambition.
Source code - the underlying set of instructions that run a piece of software or operating system - is typically among a technology company's most closely guarded secrets and Microsoft has historically been particularly careful about protecting it. 
It is not clear how much or what parts of Microsoft's source code repositories the hackers were able to access, but the disclosure suggests that the hackers who used software company SolarWinds as a springboard to break into sensitive U.S. government networks also had an interest in discovering the inner workings of Microsoft products as well.
Microsoft had already disclosed that like other firms it found malicious versions of SolarWinds' software inside its network, but the source code disclosure - made in a blog post - is new. After Reuters reported it was breached two weeks ago, Microsoft said it had not ""found any evidence of access to production services.""
Three people briefed on the matter said Microsoft had known for days that the source code had been accessed. A Microsoft spokesman said security employees had been working ""around the clock"" and that ""when there is actionable information to share, they have published and shared it.""
The SolarWinds hack is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed, compromising at least half-a-dozen federal agencies and potentially thousands of companies and other institutions. U.S. and private sector investigators have spent the holidays combing through logs to try to understand whether their data has been stolen or modified.
Modifying source code - which Microsoft said the hackers did not do - could have potentially disastrous consequences given the ubiquity of Microsoft products, which include the Office productivity suite and the Windows operating system. But experts said that even just being able to review the code could offer hackers insight that might help them subvert Microsoft products or services.
""The source code is the architectural blueprint of how the software is built,"" said Andrew Fife of Israel-based Cycode, a source code protection company. 
""If you have the blueprint, it's far easier to engineer attacks.""
Matt Tait, an independent cybersecurity researcher, agreed that the source code could be used as a roadmap to help hack Microsoft products, but he also cautioned that elements of the company's source code were already widely shared - for example with foreign governments. He said he doubted that Microsoft had made the common mistake of leaving cryptographic keys or passwords in the code. 
""It's not going to affect the security of their customers, at least not substantially,"" Tait said.
Microsoft noted that it allows broad internal access to its code, and former employees agreed that it is more open than other companies.
In its blog post, Microsoft said it had found no evidence of access ""to production services or customer data."" 
""The investigation, which is ongoing, has also found no indications that our systems were used to attack others,"" it said.
Reuters reported a week ago that Microsoft-authorized resellers were hacked and their access to productivity programs inside targets leveraged in attempts to read email. Microsoft acknowledged some vendor access was misused but has not said how many resellers or customers may have been breached.
There was no response to requests for comment from the FBI, which is investigating the hacking campaign, or from the Department of Homeland Security's Cybsersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
U.S. officials have attributed the SolarWinds hacking campaign to Russia, an allegation the Kremlin denies. 
Both Tait and Ronen Slavin, Cycode's chief technology officer, said a key unanswered question was which source code repositories were accessed. Microsoft has a huge range of products, from widely used Windows to lesser known software such as social networking app Yammer and the design app Sway.
Slavin said he was worried by the possibility that the SolarWinds hackers were poring over Microsoft's source code as prelude to a much more ambitious offensive.

""To me the biggest question is, 'Was this recon for the next big operation?'"" he said.

But the slide only lasted until March 23, when the S&P bottomed. It went on to surpass its February high on Aug. 18, marking the start of a new bull market. The 23 trading days of a bear market were the fewest ever. 
The S&P closed 2020 on Thursday at a record high, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with annual gains of 16.3% and 7.2%, respectively. The Nasdaq's 43.6% year-on-year gain was the biggest for the tech-heavy index since 2009.

Along with $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus by the U.S. government to buttress a flagging economy, a major reason for the rebound in stocks in March were the monetary stimulus measures supplied by the Federal Reserve, which announced an array of program to backstop the economy on March 23.
The Fed moves kept Treasury yields low, making stocks more attractive to investors.

As stocks continued to recover and vaccine developments grew more promising, investors began to rotate toward companies that historically outperform as an economy moves out of recession, namely small caps, and to cyclical sectors such as energy, materials, industrials and financials, in the latter part of the year. 
With a large portion of cyclical names comprising ""value"" stocks, the group began to close the gap in what had long been a period of underperformance to ""growth"" names. The value style never fully re-established dominance, but the momentum behind the technology stocks that led the rally was enough to leave growth with the better performance this year.

But even with the push higher late in the year, the energy sector wound up as the worst performer by a large margin in 2020, while tech and consumer discretionary led the way higher.

All in all, uncertainty and fear related to the pandemic made for the S&P 500's most volatile year in over a decade, with the index surging or slumping 2% or more in over 40 sessions.

As for individual stock performance, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped the line to the top spot when it was added to the S&P 500 index on Dec. 21. It gained 743% on the year. 
The impact of the coronavirus was evident, with stocks that benefited from the ""stay-at-home"" environment such as online marketplace Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) rallying roughly 300% while travel names took the brunt of the damage, with cruise ship operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) and Norwegian Cruise among the worst performers.

The rise of low-cost, easy-to-use trading apps unleashed a flood of retail investor money into stocks and helped fuel a watershed year for new stock offerings. Retail investors have accounted for as much as 25% of the stock market's activity this year, up from 10% of the market in 2019, according to brokerage Citadel Securities.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","Wall Street closes out wild pandemic year with Dow, S&P at records","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended a tumultuous year with the Dow and S&P 500 at records, as the three major U.S. equity indexes notched solid-to-spectacular yearly gains despite an economy upended by the COVID-19 virus as investors looked to a post-pandemic world. 
In a year that marked the end of the longest bull market on record as pandemic-induced government lockdowns battered the global economy, equities stormed back, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 66% from its March 23 low, resulting in the shortest bear market in history.
The gains, which sent the Dow and S&P to record highs to close out the year and the Nasdaq to a record earlier this week, were fueled in part by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus put in place to buttress the economy reeling from the coronavirus fallout, as well as progress on a vaccine. 
For the year, the S&P 500 gained 16.3%, the Dow 7.2% and the Nasdaq 43.6%, which marked the biggest yearly gain for the tech-heavy index since 2009. 
""For broad indexes, this is a bullish year despite the craziness in the real world,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of research and trading at Harvest Volatility Management.
""It feels very much to me like investors have decided the world has changed forever, the coronavirus pandemic was the catalyst and now investors have decided who the winners are and who the losers are and are moving forward."" 
Still, data on Thursday was a reminder the economy still has a lengthy recovery ahead as weekly initial jobless claims, while declining for a second straight week to 787,000, remained well above the peak of the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
Tech and consumer discretionary were the best performing sectors on the year, while energy, a laggard for the past decade, was once again the weakest of the 11 major S&P sectors on the year en route to its worst yearly performance ever. 
Mega-cap companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) helped lift the broad S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, as well as gains in names that have benefited from the ""stay-at-home"" environment, such as online retailer ETSY Inc and digital payment platform PayPal.
Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) added to the benchmark S&P index on December 21, rose an astounding 743% on the year. 
For the session the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.92 points, or 0.65%, to 30,606.48, the S&P 500 gained 24.03 points, or 0.64%, to 3,756.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.28 points, or 0.14%, to 12,888.28.
All three major indexes gained ground, with the Dow and S&P 500 picking up steam in the session's final minutes to secure record highs.
Near-term expectations of bigger stimulus checks dimmed after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a quick vote on Wednesday to back President Donald Trump's call to increase COVID-19 relief checks to $2,000 from $600.
Risk assets were able to build on the rally off the March low, adding to gains in November following a U.S. election that investors viewed as likely to result in political gridlock and optimism around vaccines approvals grew, but the momentum stalled on worries over fresh fiscal stimulus and a new, highly infectious COVID-19 variant spreading globally.
All eyes are on two U.S. Senate races in Georgia next week that will determine control of the chamber and influence Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's ability to enact his agenda.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.27 billion shares, compared with the 10.81 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 131 new highs and 21 new lows.

(Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it was calling off its automotive joint venture with India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd due to the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (https://ford.to/2X2V6Gg)
The companies said in separate statements that the decision was driven by changes in the global economy over the last 15 months, causing both to reassess their capital allocation priorities.
""The global economy and business environment are not the same as October last year,"" Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said.
The deadline to finalize a joint venture between the companies was Dec. 31, and both made the decision to end the agreement rather than close a deal or extend the timetable to do so, Reid said.
In October 2019, Ford and Mahindra said they would form a joint venture in India in a move to cut costs for developing and producing vehicles for emerging markets. The companies said at the time they expected to launch three new utility vehicles, starting with a midsize SUV, and also jointly develop electric vehicles for emerging markets.
Asked if those vehicles were now canceled, Reid said, ""At this point, there's nothing to talk about other than the joint venture isn't going to happen."" Ford said its independent operations in India will continue.
Pressure to pursue mergers or alliances in the auto industry has grown as the costs of developing electric and self-driving vehicles drives companies to preserve funds for those efforts. France's PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV expect to close their $38 billion merger in the first quarter of 2021.
Ford executives have repeatedly touted a company strategy that includes partnerships, including with Mahindra, as a way to increase efficiencies and reduce costs on its path to achieve 8% global operating profit margins. Reid said that strategy would continue, when asked whether Ford would look to partner with another automaker in southeast Asia.
Mahindra said in its statement that the decision will not have any impact on its product plan, and that it is accelerating efforts to develop electric SUVs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's drone delivery unit Wing criticized Trump administration rules issued this week mandating broadcast-based remote identification of drones, saying they should be revised to allow for internet-based tracking.
On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued rules that will allow small drones to fly over people and at night in the United States and mandate remote identification technology for nearly all drones.
The rules eliminate requirements that drones, known formally as unmanned aerial vehicles, be connected to the internet to transmit location data but requires them to broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast.
""This approach creates barriers to compliance and will have unintended negative privacy impacts for businesses and consumers,"" Wing said Thursday in a blog post, adding ""an observer tracking a drone can infer sensitive information about specific users, including where they visit, spend time, and live and where customers receive packages from and when.""
Wing added that ""American communities would not accept this type of surveillance of their deliveries or taxi trips on the road. They should not accept it in the sky.""
Wing called on the FAA to expand ways operators can comply with ID requirements.
The FAA said Thursday it received and addressed ""more than 50,000 public comments on the proposed remote-identification rule, which will further the safe integration of drones into the national airspace system.""
The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems Internationalsaid Remote ID will function as ""a digital license plate fordrones.""
Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to begin producing drones with Remote ID, and operators will have an additional year to provide Remote ID.
Wing argues internet-based tracking ""allows a drone to be identified as it flies over without necessarily sharing that drone's complete flight path or flight history.""

Chinese dronemaker SZ DJI Technology Co said this week it ""has long supported the FAA’s Remote ID initiative because it will enhance drone accountability, safety and security... We are reviewing the final rule to understand how DJI can take steps towards complying with the FAA’s upcoming requirements.""

Investing.com – The Dow ended the pandemic-fueled year at a record high Thursday, as bullish sentiment on Wall Street continued on the final day of trade, with analysts touting more of the same in 2021.   
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.65%, or 196 points, ending the year up more than 15%. The S&P 500 was up 0.26%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.14%. 
""In 2020, stock investors experienced the final stage of the longest bull market in history, the shortest bear market on record, and a tremendous rally marking the beginning of a new bull market … While we don't expect 2021 to be as eventful as 2020, we do expect the equity market to continue trending higher,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
The positive end to the final day of trade on Wall Street was led by a rise in financials, with Willis Towers Watson PLC (NASDAQ:WLTW),  MSCI Inc  (NYSE:MSCI) and Aon (NYSE:AON) among the biggest gainers.
Energy, which is down about 35% for the year, gave up some of its gains from a day earlier as oil prices turned lower on worries of further restrictions as the new strain of the coronavirus continues to stoke concerns about the outlook for oil demand.
""Because the variants spread more rapidly, they could lead to more cases and put even more strain on our already heavily burdened health-care systems,"" Dr. Henry Walke, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Covid incident manager, said on Wednesday.
The ongoing rise in cases didn’t show up in the latest weekly jobless claims report, but analysts expect the impact to appear in next week's nonfarm payrolls report for December.  
The number of Americans filing for unemployment insurance unexpectedly fell by 19,000 to 787,000, compared with economists' forecasts for a rise to 835,000.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Drugmakers to hike prices for 2021 as pandemic, political pressure put revenues at risk","By Michael Erman and Carl O'Donnell
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA, and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc plan to raise U.S. prices on more than 300 drugs in the United States on Jan. 1, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.
The hikes come as drugmakers are reeling from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced doctor visits and demand for some drugs. They are also fighting new drug price cutting rules from the Trump administration, which would reduce the industry's profitability. 
The companies kept their price increases at 10% or below, and the largest drug companies to raise prices so far, Pfizer and Sanofi, kept nearly all of their increases 5% or less, 3 Axis said. 3 Axis is a consulting firm that works with pharmacists groups, health plans and foundation on drug pricing and supply chain issues.
GSK did raise prices on two vaccines - shingles vaccine Shingrix and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine Pediarix - by 7% and 8.6%, respectively, 3 Axis said. 
Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc hiked prices on 15 drugs, including Austedo, which treats rare neurological disorders, and asthma steroid Qvar, which together grossed more than $650 million in sales in 2019 and saw price hikes of between 5% and 6%. Teva hiked prices for some drugs, including muscle relaxant Amrix and narcolepsy treatment Nuvigil, as much as 9.4%. 
More price hikes are expected to be announced on Friday and in early January.
In 2020, drugmakers raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5 percent, on average, according to 3 Axis. Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected.
The increases come as pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer are playing hero by developing vaccines for COVID-19 in record time. The hikes could help make up for lost revenue as doctors visits and new prescriptions plummeted during the global lockdown.
Pfizer plans to raise prices on more than 60 drugs by between 0.5 % and 5%. Those include roughly 5% increases on some of its top sellers like rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz and cancer drugs Ibrance and Inlyta.
Pfizer said it had adjusted the list prices of its drugs by around 1.3% across all products in its portfolio, in line with inflation. 
""This modest increase is necessary to support investments that allow us to continue to discover new medicines and deliver those breakthroughs to the patients who need them,"" spokeswoman Amy Rose said in a statement, pointing in particular to the COVID-19 vaccine the company developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
It said that its net prices, which back out rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts, have actually fallen for the last 3 years.
France's Sanofi plans to increase prices on a number of vaccines 5 percent or less and will announce more price increases later in January, spokesperson Ashleigh Koss said.
None of the company's price increases will be above the expected growth rate of U.S. health spending of 5.1 percent, she said.
Slashing U.S. prescription drug prices - which are among the highest in the world - was a focus of U.S. President Donald Trump, after making it a core pledge of his 2016 campaign. He issued several executive orders in late 2020 meant to cut prices, but their impact could be limited by legal challenges and other problems.
A federal judge earlier this month blocked a last-minute Trump administration rule aimed at lowering drug prices that was set to be implemented at the beginning of the year. It was challenged by drug industry groups including PhRMA, the nation’s leading pharmaceutical trade group.

President-elect Biden has also vowed to reduce drug costs and to allow Medicare, a U.S. government health insurance program, to negotiate drug prices. He has support from Congressional Democrats to pass such legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office has said could cost the industry more than $300 billion by 2029.

Battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Aeromexico filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court in June, and is trying to secure a second tranche of financing.
In a statement, the ASPA said the majority of its pilots had in a vote rejected the plan put forward by the union as an alternative to Aeromexico's own proposal, but that it would keep exploring other options to aid restructuring efforts.
The airline earlier this year had up to $1 billion in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing approved, and received an initial $100 million payment in September. 
Earlier this week, Aeromexico wrapped up negotiations with two of the four industry unions it needs to reach agreement with to access a second tranche of DIP funding.

The company in November requested permission from a U.S. bankruptcy court to dismiss 1,830 employees, including 855 unionized workers.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled this week that former Viacom shareholders may pursue a lawsuit accusing Shari Redstone of engineering a ""patently unfair"" merger that created ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc so she could become a media magnate like her late father, Sumner Redstone.
Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court said it was reasonable to infer from the plaintiffs' claims that the December 2019 merger was ""not entirely fair,"" and that Redstone used it ""to consolidate her control of Viacom and CBS at the expense of the Viacom minority stockholders.""
Shari Redstone's National Amusements Inc had controlled about 80% of the voting power of both Viacom and CBS, despite owning about 10% of the respective shares.
Viacom shareholders, led by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension fund, accused Redstone of relentlessly pursuing a merger to advance her interests, including by replacing ""subversive"" directors with friends and relatives to get her way.
In his 76-page decision, Slights let the shareholders pursue breach of fiduciary duty claims against Redstone, National Amusements and Viacom directors who negotiated the merger.
He dismissed the same claim against ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish, finding no evidence of wrongdoing and saying it appeared Bakish ""deliberately chose not to flaunt his power as chief executive.""
ViacomCBS' businesses include CBS television, CBS News, Showtime, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount movie studio. Redstone is the New York-based company's non-executive chairman.
Slights' decision is dated Tuesday. Lawyers for the defendants and the shareholders did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment.
ViacomCBS is not a defendant. A related lawsuit by former CBS shareholders against Redstone, National Amusements and former CBS directors is pending in the Delaware court.
The ViacomCBS merger followed unsuccessful merger attempts in 2016 and 2018. Sumner Redstone had split the companies at the beginning of 2006. He died on Aug. 11 at age 97.

The case is In re Viacom Inc Stockholders Litigation, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 2019-0948.

(Reuters) - Blank-check firms - popularly known as SPACs - emerged as the most popular investment vehicles and the primary driving force behind a record year for initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2020, even as overall dealmaking activity tumbled to a three-year low. 
SPACs are shell companies that raise funds in an IPO with the aim of buying a private company, with the acquired company becoming public after the merger.
Once confined to the backwaters of Wall Street dealmaking, a SPAC, or a special purpose acquisition company, accounted for nearly half of the overall amount raised through new listings as investors mostly bet on new tech stocks after the Federal Reserve shored up the economy with a stimulus package in May.

The next 18 months could be even better for companies looking to go public through blank-check deals, according to bankers who have worked on SPAC deals this year, even as high-profile investors such as Bill Ackman and Chamath Palihapitiya doubled down on the SPAC gold rush. 
Major blank check mergers this year included United Wholesale Mortgage's $16-billion deal with Gores Holdings IV Inc and the merger of asset managers Owl Rock Capital (NYSE:ORCC) Group and Dyal Capital Partners with blank-check firm Altimar Acquisition Corp.

The average Day-1 pops for new listings also touched a record, with 2020 accounting for at least 14 of the 30 IPOs with the biggest first-day-close gains of the last 15 years, according to data from Dealogic, which has tracked IPO data since 1995. 
Nineteen IPOs saw shares more than double in value on their first day of trading, the most since 2014, when there were six.
Companies that went public through SPAC deals also posted healthy gains, and investment bankers and capital markets lawyers said it would encourage more startups and private firms to consider the IPO alternative. 
(Graphic: Top SPAC gainers - https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACS-2020/xegvbbwgwvq/SPACsNivedita.jpeg)
The breakneck pace for IPOs has evoked memories of the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century, with concerns the exuberance could lead to frothy valuations.
Companies have raised about $167.63 billion in the United States in 2020, according to Dealogic data. In comparison, companies raised $108 billion in 1999, which previously held the record for capital raised through new issues. 
At least nine companies raised over $1 billion in their IPOs this year, with several Silicon Valley unicorns including Airbnb, DoorDash, Palantir Technologies Inc and Snowflake Inc having blockbuster debuts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Daimler AG's North American truck unit on Thursday agreed to a $30 million U.S. civil penalty to resolve an investigation of delayed recalls, the second time since late 2019 the German automaker has agreed to settle a probe by U.S. auto safety regulators.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Trucks North America failed to recall vehicles in a timely fashion and comply with reporting requirements after the agency opened a probe in April 2018 of about 464,000 vehicles.
As part of the settlement, Daimler Trucks agreed to develop and implement an advanced data analytics program to enhance its ability to detect and to investigate potential safety defects as part of a two-year consent order that can be extended by NHTSA for one additional year.
Daimler Trucks must pay $10 million upfront and spend an additional $5 million on projects to enhance safety. The agreement includes a $15 million deferred penalty that can become payable if Daimler does not comply with the consent order.
Daimler Trucks said it is focused on ""building safe, efficient and reliable commercial vehicles.... In this case, though there are no known accidents or injuries associated with any of the voluntary recalls.
""We appreciate the opportunity to summarily resolve this matter,"" it added.
Daimler Trucks agreed to meet with NHTSA on at least a monthly basis as part of the settlement.
""It’s critical that manufacturers appropriately recognize the urgency of their safety recall responsibilities and provide timely and candid information to the agency about all safety issues,"" NHTSA Deputy Administrator James Owens said.

In December 2019, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz USA unit agreed to a $20 million civil penalty over its handling of U.S. vehicle recalls after NHTSA said it failed to notify owners in a timely fashion in some recalls, did not submit all reports and did not launch at least two recalls in a timely fashion.

Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) got a new Street-high price target after Wedbush said it sees a strong holiday season for iPhones and AirPods.
Wedbush reiterated a buy-equivalent rating with a price target of $160 per share and a bull-case scenario of $200, according to StreetInsider.
Analyst Daniel Ives said his bull case scenario for iPhone sales has already been well-exceeded.
""In mid-December we had this in the 80 million range with a stretch goal in the mid 80 million range and heading into late October we were anticipating 75 million units as the line in the sand and roughly three months ago this number was in the 65 million to 70 million range,"" he wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""This is roughly a 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts.""
Sales for a new iPhone edition like this haven't been seen since 2014 with the iPhone 6, Ives said. 
Ives has high hopes for the phone. While Street consensus for iPhone sales in 2021 is 217 million devices, Ives sees the very optimistic possibility of exceeding 240 million to 250 million units. That compares to Apple's 2015 record of 231 million handsets. 
China, in particular, is expected to continue seeing strong demand, with about 20% of upgrades from the region.
“While services growth remains the key to the Apple re-rating story over the past six months, the hearts and lungs of the Apple growth story are built around iPhone installed base upgrades,"" Ives wrote.  
Still, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) may be a better bet. Baird bumped Alphabet's price target to $2,000 from $1,725 and maintained a buy-equivalent rating, StreetInsider reported. 
""A comparison of Apple's valuation with Alphabet suggests the latter may be undervalued against a worthy 'mature tech' comparable,"" Colin Sebastian wrote in a note, StreetInsider reported. ""Specifically, we use implied valuation multiples for Apple's hardware and services businesses, discounted meaningfully to account for Apple's walled garden, and apply those to Alphabet segments. Separately, based on positive Q4 checks, easing comps, benefits to Search in a privacy-first environment, and expected rebound in Travel and Local verticals post-pandemic, we are increasing our estimates.""

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Fewer companies caught the deal bug in the year of the pandemic,"By Joshua Franklin and Pamela Barbaglia
(Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity fell to a three-year low in 2020, as companies grappled with the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as dealmaking came roaring back in the second half.
The value of M&A globally dropped 5% year-on-year to $3.6 trillion, the lowest since 2017, according to a preliminary tally from financial data provider Refinitiv. There were 48,226 deals announced, compared with 50,113 deals last year.
Technology, healthcare and financial services deals led the recovery after M&A activity plunged in the second quarter on concerns about global economic prospects. A stock market rally and access to cheap financing gave chief executives confidence to pursue transformative transactions again.
""The biggest story has to be the enormous rebound we have experienced. Talk about dog years, we went through a three-to-five year cycle in just six months,"" said Cary Kochman,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s global co-head of M&A.
Eight of the year's 10 biggest transactions were announced in the second half of the year. They included financial data provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc's $44 billion purchase of IHS Markit Ltd, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's $39 billion acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ALXN), and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM)'s $27.7 billion deal for workplace messaging app Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc.
Dealmakers see the recovery picking up steam in 2021, with companies, private equity firms and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) all eyeing acquisitions.
""The world is still a volatile place but the foundations are in place for one of the largest M&A years to date,"" said Stephan Feldgoise, global co-head of M&A at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
M&A volume in the United States was down 23% at $1.4 trillion, accounting for close to 40% of global dealmaking. Europe took second spot with $989 billion in M&A activity, up 35%, while the Asia-Pacific region came third with $872 billion, up 15%. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's administration is expected to adopt less protectionist policies and be less hostile to cross-border deals, including from China, some dealmakers said.
""The change in U.S. administration may make people outside the U.S. feel more comfortable about investing in the United States,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of M&A at law firm Simpson Thacher.
In Britain, Europe's most active M&A market, dealmakers shrugged off concerns over Brexit, with $302 billion in deals, up 50% year on year. 
""Brexit does present risks but London will continue to enjoy many underlying advantages. Dealmakers trust the British judicial system and takeover regime and there are deep networks of lawyers, accountants and advisers that are not immediately replicable elsewhere,"" said Alex Thomas, managing director for M&A in Europe at RBC Capital Markets.
The key focus at the start of the year will be the U.S. Senate runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia that will determine which party controls that chamber of Congress, and the fate of much of Biden's agenda, including proposed tax hikes.
""Whatever the Georgia Senate election result is, increased certainty is a helpful catalyst for M&A,"" said Marco Caggiano, co-head of North America M&A at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) 
MORE LEVERAGED BUYOUTS 
Private equity firms capitalized on the plentiful financing available and stepped up leveraged buyouts, with their deals up 20% at $570 billion. 
""They have a substantial amount of money to be deployed but they are also ready to prune some portfolio assets, especially those that have benefited from the crisis and are ripe for an exit,"" said Berthold Fuerst, co-head of investment banking coverage and advisory in EMEA at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
The strong stock market rally has also emboldened activist hedge funds, which are increasingly teaming up with buyout firms.
""Until the end of the summer, there was simply no willingness by existing investors to back an activist campaign. Activism is coming back, as some funds want to use the market rebound to build new positions,"" said JPMorgan's global co-head of M&A Dirk Albersmeier.
Bankers are predicting another active year for SPACs, which were one of 2020's most popular investment vehicles. SPACs are shell companies that raise money through IPOs with the aim of buying a private firm.
More than 200 SPACs raised over $78 billion this year, more than six times the previous record year. With SPACs typically buying companies around five times the size of their IPO, there could be some $300 billion of M&A in 2021 and 2022 by SPACs, according to a Goldman Sachs report.

""The comfort level and understanding of what it means to combine with a SPAC...is something that is driving many companies to consider a SPAC merger,"" said Kevin Brunner, co-head of U.S. M&A at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Coronavirus-spurred growth in the technology sector will help drive M&A activity in the Asia Pacific next year, bankers and lawyers predict, with the potential easing of Sino-U.S. tensions likely to revive Chinese outbound investment.
Deals involving Asia Pacific firms totalled $1.2 trillion in 2020, up 12% from 2019. Seven of the year's 10 largest transactions were announced in the third quarter, which in total accounted for 40% of the year's deals by value.
High technology and telecommunications companies surged to a 23% share of deal value, up from 14% last year, while retail and consumer products and services firms also reported growth.
""COVID has dramatically accelerated digitalization, e-commerce and fintech,"" said Jung Min, co-head of merger and acquisitions (M&A) at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Asia, excluding Japan.
""Companies that have benefited are now suddenly much larger in size and financial scale, creating significantly more potential to make strategic investments,"" he said. ""Industry disruption, change and transformation will continue and drive the larger transactions.""
In the latest such move, Qatar's telecoms company Ooredoo and Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings are exploring a deal to merge their units in Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country.
Samson Lo, UBS' head of Asia M&A, said the outlook for China outbound deals was positive, despite persistent regulatory pushback from many countries. ""There continues to be appetite for good quality assets in Europe,"" he said.
In a report published this month, law firm Allen & Overy flagged the potential return of Chinese healthcare sector investors to the U.S. market for the first time in many months on easing trade tensions.
Antagonism between Washington and Beijing over the past year under outgoing President Donald Trump has hampered deals. Investors say the incoming Biden administration may not mean an instant thaw in relations, but will likely provide a more predictable policy approach. 
Dealmakers are also counting on a steady pipeline of cross-border deals involving Asian companies' strategic investments as well as divestments of multinational companies in the region.
""We expect cross-border activity to be a prominent feature, although it’s unlikely to be China outbound driven like in years past,"" said Richard Wong,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Asia Pacific head of M&A. ""We expect it to feature Asian sellers of overseas assets ... or highly selective strategic acquisitions overseas.""
China and Japan led Asia's M&A growth in 2020, against a 5.5% decline globally. China, the world's second largest economy, recovered strongly from the earliest coronavirus outbreak with a 28% increase in deals from 2019. 
Japan contributed half of the region's mega deals worth $5 billion or more, including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (OTC:NPPXF) Corp's $40 billion tender offer for NTT Docomo (OTC:DCMYY). 
Private equity-backed deals in the region reached a record high of $129 billion, up 51% year-on-year.
Despite the deal bonanza, M&A fees dropped to a five-year low of $4.2 billion as fewer transactions were completed this year compared to 2019, Refinitiv data showed.
Dealmakers have also cautioned that China's latest anti-trust crackdown on its tech companies could be deterrents in future M&A.

Morgan Stanley topped the region's league table for announced M&A deals in 2020, followed by Goldman Sachs and CICC.

(Reuters) - Emergency corporate fundraising and a clamour for tech stock market listings pushed equity capital market volumes to over $1 trillion in 2020 and fees for investment bankers in the sector to a record high, data showed. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the world, companies turned to their shareholders in droves to get the funding needed to get through a bruising global recession. 
Combined with demand for new growth-oriented companies -- particularly tech -- in an era of record low interest rates, that was responsible for a record-shattering year in stock market fundraising, bankers and analysts said. 
Global equity capital markets (ECM) activity rocketed by 55% to a record $1.1 trillion in 2020, data from Refinitiv showed. (Graphic: Global ECM volumes hit $1 trillion for the first time - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ECM/WRAP/qmyvmqydavr/chart.png)

The year was characterised by companies spanning from airlines to retail and hospitality scrambling for funds to weather the pandemic or to repay emergency government loans. 
Airlines operators such as Lufthansa and British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) led the way, tapping markets for billions of dollars to navigate a severe crunch in the sector. 
But as the year progressed and as unprecedented central bank action supercharged markets, a slew of initial public offerings hit the market, pushing IPO volumes in the United States to a 13-year high of $80.23 billion, the Refinitiv data showed. 
These were characterised by unprecedented first-day pops, with the likes of Airbnb and Warren Buffet-backed Snowflake doubling in value on their market debuts,. 
""In a world of incredibly low interest rates, any company able to demonstrate growth in future cash flows is going to be rated highly. Sectors such as healthcare, fintech and tech are a huge part of this,"" said James Fleming, Citi’s global co-head of equity capital markets. 
Fleming expects the trend of tech IPOs to continue into the first half of 2021, while equity raises for balance-sheet purposes are also likely to continue into the new year with many sectors yet to fully recover from the COVID-19 crisis.
While the United States has been at the forefront of the IPO boom, the trend is likely to spread to Europe in 2021. 
For graphic of Global ECM fees: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopabzdjva/global-ecm-fees-hit-all-time-high-in-2020.png
Overall, bankers made $28.7 billion from ECM fees, the biggest yearly pot ever. IPO fees also hit a 13-year high of $10 billion, the data show. 
Those figures rise to $32.5 billion and $13.8 billion respectively when including the listing of so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), though the fees on such deals are only payable in full if the vehicle ends up acquiring a company.
Issuance in 2021 could be supported by a continued surge in mergers and acquisition activity.
""In Europe, we will see much more M&A-related equity financing in 2021 across a broad range of sectors, as opposed to just balance sheet repair situations,"" said James Palmer, head of EMEA ECM at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The cancellation of Ant Group's planned $37 billion listing -- in what would have been the largest IPO in history -- was the one fly in the ointment. It raised the threat of regulatory hurdles for tech firms, particularly those with operations in China.
But with more positive news around vaccine rollouts emerging across the world, investors are also expecting to see the flow of IPOs continue unabated. 
Companies that were satisfied with private funding rounds in the past are now coming to the public market to take advantage of buoyant stock market valuations. 

""There is a pendulum shift that's ongoing,"" said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management. ""As long as valuations stay high, there is an incentive for private equity to go to market.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Thursday as lockdowns and rising COVID-19 cases overshadowed the optimism around the rollout of vaccines in the New Year, while the dollar fell to a two-and-a-half-year low. 
Trading volumes were thin, with many traders away on New Year's Eve and major European markets closed. Where markets were open, they failed to follow their Asian peers higher.
UK's FTSE 100 fell 1.7% and France's CAC 40 0.4%. U.S. stock futures were 0.15% lower, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street.
The MSCI World Index was down on the day as gains in Asia gave way to the losses in Europe. The index is headed for a near 14% rise in 2020 after surging more than 60% from its March lows.
Despite a stimulus-charged rebound since the pandemic-induced market slump in March, most European markets have underperformed the United States and Asia, where a series of record highs have been reached.
The pan-European STOXX 600, which was closed on Thursday, recorded a 3.8% drop in 2020 as a rapid surge in coronavirus cases and worries about Brexit curbed improving sentiment.
Still, despite the rising COVID-19 cases and increasing unemployment, investors were betting the rollout of vaccines in 2021 will unleash an economic rebound spurred by plentiful fiscal and monetary cash.
""We still see growth slowing around the turn of the year and the recovery will still face headwinds in the coming quarters, but 2021 is shaping up to be better still than our already strong global outlook—led by a stronger U.S.,"" JP Morgan economists said in a research note.
Among the biggest developments in markets in 2020 has been the dramatic drop in the dollar. On Thursday, it hit its lowest since April 2018 and is now down 7.2% against a basket of currencies, its worst annual performance since 2017.
The dollar's weakness, driven by bets that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates very low, has helped rival currencies.
The euro has been a big beneficiary and is up 10% in 2020 and was above $1.23 on Thursday.
ASIAN GAINS
Asian stock gains were led by Chinese blue chips after the announcement of a trade deal with the European Union.
Official data released Thursday also showed activity in China's service and factory sector expanding in December. 
Markets barely flickered at the news that China had approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for general public use. 
Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong, said the limited impact on the yuan and Chinese equities showed markets had become immune to this sort of news. 
""For the market to react more strongly in 2021, large-scale (vaccine) rollouts with positive outcomes are needed,"" he said. 
Bitcoin's rally paused, rising 0.3% to just under $29,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency has almost quadrupled in value this year amid heightened interest from bigger investors. 
Oil prices retreated as swelling year-on-year supply led some traders to view any economic recovery ahead to be gradual rather than swift.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude shed 0.48% to trade at $48.17 a barrel, far below about $62 at the start of 2020, and Brent was trading down 0.54%, at $51.35. [O/R]

Gold was little changed at $1,892 an ounce. It has risen 24% this year, its best showing since 2010, as investors looked to safe havens, protection against inflation and as the dollar wilted. Treasuries were little changed, with benchmark U.S. 10-year yields at 0.9264% and two-year yields at 0.123%.

(Reuters) -European stocks retreated on Thursday as investors squared positions on the last trading day of the year, while tighter coronavirus restrictions in Britain and a move by the United States to raise tariffs on some EU products dampened sentiment.
Trading volumes were thin, with many traders away on New Year's Eve and major European bourses closed.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index recorded a 3.8% drop in 2020 - lagging its Asian and Wall Street peers that traded near record highs - as a rapid surge in coronavirus cases and concerns about a chaotic Brexit weighed on the continent's markets.
Still, the index remains only 7% below its record high after rallying about 50% from March lows, while hopes of more stimulus, the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and a Brexit trade deal sealed last week raised bets of a stronger recovery in 2021.
""Vaccines will inspire a global recovery, central banks will leave rates a zero even if inflation rises to fund exploding government deficits everywhere,"" Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda wrote in a note. 
""The search for yield in a zero percent world flooded with unlimited free money for the world's central banks, means the K-shaped recovery, asset price inflation scenario seems a certainty.""
In light trading, UK's FTSE 100 fell 1.7% and France's CAC 40 dropped 0.4%. Both markets will close early on Thursday.
The FTSE 100 - on course for its worst year since the 2008 financial crisis - suffered a bigger blow as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered millions more people to live under the strictest COVID-19 restrictions to counter a new virus variant. (L)
The German DAX ended 2020 with a 3.5% gain - just below all-time highs - helped by strong demand for technology stocks and better growth prospects major trading partner China. 
Lender-heavy Italy's FTSE MIB was down 5.4% for the year, while Spain's IBEX - among the worst performers in the region - was on course for yearly losses of more than 15%. 
The tourism-reliant economy was hit by pandemic restrictions, while a consolidation in Spain's banking sector - that brought the number of banks to 10, down from 55 prior to the 2008 economic crisis - failed to impress investors.
France's Airbus,  Safran  (PA:SAF) and liquor makers  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) and Remy Cointreau fell more than 1% after the U.S. government said it would raise tariffs on EU products including aircraft components and wines from France and Germany.
The move was the latest twist in a 16-year battle over aircraft subsidies between Washington and Brussels.
French insurer Axa slipped 0.7% as it agreed to sell its businesses in Greece to Italian competitor Generali (MI:GASI) for 165 million euros ($202.9 million).

1200,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 04:26AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's top court puts media tycoon Jimmy Lai back in custody,"By Katherine Cheng
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong's top court ordered media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the most high-profile person to be charged under the city's national security law, back into custody on Thursday, saying a judge may have erred in a decision to release him on bail.
The Court of Final Appeal's ruling comes a week after Lai, one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists who is accused of colluding with foreign forces, was released on HK$10 million ($1.3 million) bail along with extensive restrictions that included barring him from using social media.
Lai, 73, was in court. He was not immediately available for comment after the ruling but is due back in court on Feb. 1 for another appeal hearing regarding his bail, the court said.
Beijing imposed the national security legislation on the former British colony in June after months of pro-democracy protests.
Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and it erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city - charges that authorities in Hong Kong and China reject. 
Lai, a critic of Beijing who had been a frequent visitor to Washington, is widely believed to be a target of the new legislation.
Prosecutors have accused Lai of breaching the security law over statements he made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which they allege he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
In the earlier bail ruling, a High Court judge said Lai's remarks appeared to be ""comments and criticisms"" rather than a request for interference.
But on Thursday, the judges questioned that earlier assessment.
""We consider it reasonably arguable in the present case that the learned judge may have erred,"" the judges said in their ruling, referring to Article 42 of the security law. 
The article stipulates that ""no bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security"".
Outgoing Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, Andrew Cheung, who replaces Ma as the city's most senior judge in January, and Roberto Ribeiro presided over the hearing. 
In an editorial published on Dec. 27, the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said Lai was ""extremely dangerous"" and an ""insurgent"" and urged the Hong Kong judiciary to ""make the right decision"" in the bail appeal.
Five people from Hong Kong's Law Society, which has more than 10,000 registered members, expressed ""grave"" concern over the comments and called on Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng to take action to defend the judiciary against ""unwarranted"" accusations by state-controlled media.
Lai stepped down earlier this week as chairman of Next Digital, which publishes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, a popular tabloid newspaper known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong. 
The security law, which has drawn strong condemnation from Western governments and rights groups, punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.

Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>","Apple removes 39,000 game apps from China store to meet deadline","By Pei Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) removed 39,000 game apps on its China store Thursday, the biggest removal ever in a single day, as it set year-end as deadline for all game publishers to obtain a licence.
The takedowns come amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by Chinese authorities.
Including the 39,000 games, Apple removed more than 46,000 apps in total from its store on Thursday. Games affected by the sweep included Ubisoft title Assassin's Creed Identity and NBA 2K20, according to research firm Qimai.
Qimai also said only 74 of the top 1,500 paid games on Apple store survived the purge.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple initially gave game publishers an end-of-June deadline to submit a government-issued licence number enabling users to make in-app purchases in the world's biggest games market.
Apple later extended the deadline to Dec. 31. 
China's Android app stores have long complied with regulations on licences. It is not clear why Apple is enforcing them more strictly this year.
Analysts said the move was no surprise as Apple continues to close loopholes to fall in line with China's content regulators, and would not directly affect Apple's bottom line as much as previous removals.

""However, this major pivot to only accepting paid games that have a game licence, coupled with China's extremely low number of foreign game licences approved this year, will probably lead more game developers to switch to an ad-supported model for their Chinese versions,"" said Todd Kuhns, marketing manager for AppInChina, a firm that helps overseas companies distribute their apps.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chinese regulators probe Ant Group's equity investments - sources,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese regulators are reviewing equity investments held by Ant Group Co Ltd in dozens of companies, three people with knowledge of the matter said, intensifying a crackdown on billionaire Jack Ma's financial technology empire.
Regulators are considering whether to instruct Ant to divest some of its investments, mainly in technology and fintech start-ups, if they violate any rules such as creating unfair competition in the market, one of the three sources said.
Any enforced divestments would deprive the group of potentially lucrative investments, compounding existing regulatory pressure to revamp its business structure and put up more capital for its key consumer lending business.
Divestments would also significantly scale back Ant's influence over the country's fast-growing fintech industry, where it has sought synergies with its existing businesses via several investments in recent years. 
China has been cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour in the country's booming internet sector. Regulators last week announced an antitrust investigation into Ant's sister firm  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ordered Ant to shake up its lending and other consumer finance operations. 
A spokesman for Ant Group declined to comment after Reuters emailed the company questions about the regulatory probe. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which two of the sources said was leading the probe, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Regulators are looking into investments made by Ant over the past few years, the rationale behind such deals and their synergies, two of the three sources said. All three people declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Regulators want Ant, whose businesses include payment processing, consumer lending and insurance products distribution, to divest some of its investments unless they are indispensable to its business, according to one of the sources.
Ant has already started to tap prospective buyers including private equity firms for its holdings in more than a dozen of portfolio firms, including domestic bike-sharing start-up Hellobike, another of the sources said.
Hellobike declined to comment. 
A fourth person with knowledge of the matter said Ant had not yet received any guidance from regulators about disposing its equity investments.
Chinese regulators have set about reining in Ma's financial and e-commerce empires since he publicly criticised the country's regulatory system in October for stifling innovation. That set off a chain of events that ultimately torpedoed Ant's $37 billion IPO, which would have been the world's largest, in November. 
ANT UNDER PRESSURE
Ant traces its beginnings to Alipay, which was launched in 2004 as a payment service, and is 33% owned by Alibaba. 
The fintech titan founded and controlled by Ma has made a total of 81 equity investments, including in a Chinese state bank and an Indian digital payment processor, worth $21.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
More than half its investments - 55 deals worth $17.4 billion - have been made at home, including the Postal Savings Bank Of China, the country's biggest bank by number of branches, and top ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing.
Ant is considering folding most of its financial businesses, including consumer lending, into a holding company that would be tightly regulated like traditional financial firms, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
Reuters reported in early December that Ant was considering selling its 30% stake in Indian digital payment processor Paytm amid tensions between the two Asian neighbors and a toughening competitive landscape.

Paytm and Ant had at that time said the information was incorrect. Ant referred Reuters to its previous statement while Paytm did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>","Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors bullish on stocks, hoping for a brighter 2021","By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are closing 2020 on a strong note, and many investors are betting the party will continue after a tumultuous year that marked both the end of the longest bull market and the shortest-lived bear market ever.
Risks abound, including a resurgent coronavirus pandemic, concerns about the speed of rollout of vaccines and a high-stakes Jan. 5 U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia for the balance of power in Congress. Still, many investors are looking past these threats.
""We are going to continue to see a push higher,"" said Commonwealth Financial Network's head of portfolio management, Peter Essele, who sees stocks in the early stages of a multi-year bull run.
The options market is pricing in more volatility in January than December, likely due to the Georgia elections. If Republicans win at least one Senate seat, they will maintain a slim majority. If Democrats sweep the dual runoffs, the chamber would be split 50-50 and the tiebreaking vote would go to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, giving President-elect Joe Biden's party full sway over Congress. That raises the possibility of tax-reform proposals that many investors fear would hurt stock prices.
Still, most investors are not looking for a sharp pullback next year. BofA Global Research's December fund manager survey was the most bullish.
The roll out of coronavirus vaccines has emboldened investors, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve's expressed readiness to keep policy accommodative, strategists said.
Indeed, the U.S. stock market's rally over the last two months may have taken even bulls by surprise. A late November poll found strategists expected the S&P 500 to end 2021 at 3,900, which would be another annual rise after the index rose about 15.5% percent this year to 3,732.
In prior bull markets, when the S&P 500 takes out its previous bull market high, the index has experienced a median gain of 38% over the span of 26 months before topping out, according Bespoke Investment Group data.
Some investors fret that the COVID recovery may already be priced in and valuations may be stretched. The 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is currently about 22, well above its long-term average of 15.
Still, investors see several parts of the market, including financials, leisure and hospitality stocks and energy with potential to rally.
""The market, overall, does not seem overbought,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel. 
BROADER RALLY
Investors looking for a continued rally are optimistic of a rebound in corporate earnings. 
""Earnings are going to be used as a confirmation of current pricing,"" Essele said.
S&P 500 company earnings are forecast to increase about 23% in 2021 compared with 2020.
For much of this year increased market concentration has been a nagging worry for investors, with top five S&P 500 constituents generating 127% of the index’s return during the first nine months of the year, according to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s calculations.
Technology’s weight in the S&P 500 currently stands at 28%, up more than 10 percentage points from its historical average since 1990, according to Bespoke.
""What we saw in November and December is that the market already started broadening out ... beyond the tech stocks, the mega stocks,"" said John Praveen, portfolio manager at QMA, a PGIM company, pointing to a strong showing by value stocks, shares of small caps and non-U.S. stocks.
The golden run by some high-flying growth names could still continue, investors said.
""Do not count out those growth companies with dominant and emerging business models that can continue to meet or exceed lofty shareholder expectations,"" said Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. fundamental active equity for BlackRock in a note.
With vaccines being deployed investors are looking at ""the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Praveen, who expects this year's laggard stocks and sectors to join the rally in 2021.

""Think of it as your car firing on all cylinders... it's a much broader, healthier rally,"" Praveen said.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Mexico's Santos Laguna sue Disney over broadcast rights,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican soccer club Santos Laguna are suing U.S.-based global entertainment giant Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS), alleging millions of dollars in damages due to contractual violations stemming from Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox last year.
The club filed suit in a California court this week, claiming Disney violated the terms of a five-year agreement signed in 2017 that set out lucrative broadcast rights for their home games, plus other promotional services.
They argue the violations could leave the club without a viable broadcast partner to televise their games.
Santos Laguna assert the original deal they signed with what was then known as FSLA Holdings, formerly a unit of Fox, was worth some $106 million, covering broadcast rights of games both in Mexico and internationally beginning in the 2019/2020 season.
But after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox, Disney agreed to divest itself from FSLA, now known as TFCF Holdings. 
The lawsuit alleges that in a related deal with Mexican regulators, Disney agreed that sports broadcaster ESPN, which is majority owned by Disney, would not try to buy up its competitor to ease regulatory approval for the acquisition in Mexico.
In Mexico, ESPN and Fox Sports channels are the two major broadcasters for professional soccer games.
""We believe the claims are utterly without merit and will defend against them vigorously,"" a Disney spokesman said.
With the future of TFCF in limbo, Santos say they will likely be denied license fees and other promotional considerations that they believe they are entitled to under the original contract.
That required FSLA to pay Santos at least $72.5 million for the right to broadcast home games, plus a marketing and promotion plan worth $33 million, the lawsuit said.

Santos Laguna are based in the northern city of Torreon.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, ending a roller-coaster 2020 by staying at record highs after a third COVID-19 vaccine received regulatory approval.
The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on Wednesday approved AZD1222 for emergency supply and active immunization of individuals 18 years or older. The vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and the University of Oxford, is the second jab to be approved in the U.K. after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE's (F:22UAy) vaccine BNT162b2 was approved earlier in the month.
 Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA-1273 vaccine also received U.S. FDA approval on Dec. 18.
Meanwhile, the new B177 strain of the COVID-19 virus first seen in southeastern England in September continues to spread worldwide. In the U.S., California reported its first strain and there is a possible second case in Colorado. In Asia, two people in Singapore could possibly be infected with the strain.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.25% by 9:55 PM ET (2:55 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.35%. Chinese factory activity grew at a slower pace, with data released earlier in the day showing December’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 51.9, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure.
The data also showed December’s non-manufacturing PMI at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.25% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.82%.
Japanese and Korean markets were closed ahead of the new year.
Global shares and other risk assets have seen sky-high valuations in 2020 over hopes that a vaccine rollout will stem the spread of COVID-19 and put global economies on the road to recovery in 2021, alongside unprecedented levels of stimulus rolled out globally.
“Investors continue to weigh stimulus hopes against negative pandemic developments,” Tom Essaye, “The Sevens Report” newsletter founder, said in a note.
“Markets have aggressively priced in a lot of positive resolution to these events (and more) in 2021,” the note added.
U.S. weekly jobless claims data is due to be released later in the day.
However, some investors are ending the year with a warning that there could be much less room for further appreciation in 2021, given the records seen in 2020.
“We’d say 80% of all the baseline good news expected in 2021 is already incorporated,” DataTrek Research analysts said in a note.
The noted added that some “real surprises” would be needed next year for the U.S. stock market to rise another 10%."

The settlement adds 1.2 billion reais onto the company's initial provisions of 7.9 billion reais established in the third quarter of 2020 related to the lawsuits, according to a Braskem securities filing on Wednesday.
A federal study found that Braskem's salt mines were the cause of cracks that destabilized homes, although Braskem had previously said that the study is flawed. The damages have affected more than 9,000 homes and some 17,000 residents must be relocated.
In March, Reuters reported that seven state and federal prosecutors said Braskem's early estimates of the costs for compensating and relocating residents was too low.

Braskem has stopped operations of its salt mines in Maceio, in the northeastern coastal state of Alagoas. In November, the company estimated that it would cost a further 3 billion reais to close the mines due to regulatory requirements.

(Reuters) -Energy, Wall Street's worst performing industry in 2020, could see its fortunes improve in the new year after its price action surfaced a technical buy signal on the charts on Wednesday. 
The bullish development in S&P 500 energy sector is called a ""golden cross,"" which is conventionally defined by technical analysts as the 50-day moving price average rising above the 200-day moving average. On Wednesday, the index closed up 1.6%, its 50-day average rose to 266.26, eclipsing the 200-day average at 266.21.
It is up 5.1% in December. But it remains on track for its biggest yearly collapse on record and is the worst performing of the 11 S&P 500 industry sectors, owing to the global economic contraction during the coronavirus pandemic that crushed demand for oil, natural gas and fuels like gasoline. 
Energy is down almost 37% year to date with one trading session left in 2020. The best performing sector is Information Technology, up 42.3%. The benchmark S&P 500 index is up 3% for December and 15.5% for the year.
""Golden crosses may be considered bullish technical patterns in theory, but in practice, they don't always play out that way,"" Paul Hickey at Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note on Wednesday. 
Bespoke showed that of the 11 golden crosses for the energy sector since 1990, one-week and one-month performances were positive more than half the time after they occurred. However, the performance was negative six of 11 times over three months and six months. 
Oil and oilfield services shares have been boosted by higher oil and gas prices and re-kindling of oilfield activity. Crude prices have more than doubled from spring lows, spurring companies to bring back production that was shut earlier in the year and complete wells that were not hooked up to pipelines.
A Dallas Fed survey of energy executives released this week found 49% of them expected their companies to increase spending on oil and gas exploration and production next year. An index of activity in the bank’s Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana territory went positive this month for the first time in a year. 
“We are optimistic that we will have a weaning of excess oil supply, and more importantly, suppliers of oil and gas, and that will lead to a slightly higher sustainable price,” one energy executive said. The same survey of 146 energy firm executives found more than half expect publicly-traded, independent E&P companies to decline to between 37 and 48 companies, from the current about 60 firms.
The selloff in energy this year accelerated the erosion of the industry's relative share of the overall stock market, which has been in decline for a decade.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",No half measures and mind the gap: UK nod for AstraZeneca vaccine raises more questions,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) -British health officials greenlighted the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford COVID-19 shot on Wednesday but also rebuffed one of their central claims: that a half-dose followed by a standard dose offered more protection against infection.
The reassessment of the best dosing regimen for the vaccine was an unexpected move by Britain’s medicines regulator based on its own analysis of as-yet-unpublished data and it raised fresh questions about the efficacy of a vaccine which has yet to be approved in other countries.
Though cheaper and easier to distribute than rival shots, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has been plagued with uncertainty about its most effective dosage ever since data published last month showed a half-dose followed by a full dose had a 90% success rate while two full shots were 62% effective.
Oxford researchers said that the more successful outcome was an “intriguing result” that merited further testing.
A Reuters investigation, however, found that the existence of the low-dose/standard-dose arm was the result of a potency miscalculation by Oxford researchers, casting doubt on the robustness of the result.
Munir Pirmohamed, chair of a British advisory group on COVID-19 vaccines, validated those doubts on Wednesday saying the 90% efficacy rate did not hold up under analysis.
Instead, Pirmohamed said a higher success rate may be due to a longer gap between the administration of the first and second shots.
""The low dose/standard dose regimen, although it has been quoted to have an efficacy of 90%, this is confounded by the fact that the interval between the first and second dose was quite long,"" Pirmohamed told a news conference. 
""And we feel that that result may be related to that interval, rather than the dose itself,"" he said.
The UK's COVID-19 vaccine chair, Wei Shen Lim, said a single dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine was around 70% effective from 21 days until a second dose was given.
Pirmohamed said that leaving the three month gap rather than a one month gap between doses could lift the success rate of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine to 80%.
After British health officials disclosed the new details about the efficacy of the vaccine, an AstraZeneca spokesman said: ""It is for the regulators to authorise how the vaccine should be used.""
""Factors they will have taken into account include the comparable immunogenic response after two doses with either regimen, as is the protection against severe disease (100%),"" he said.
""We believe we have got the best vaccination strategy approved by the MHRA.""
A 'WINNING FORMULA'
Faced with a record surge in infections driven by a highly contagious variant of the virus, Britain is prioritising getting a first dose of a vaccine to as many people as possible over giving second doses. Delaying the distribution of second shots would help stretch the supply.
Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended an interval of between 4-12 weeks between doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and also updated its guidance for a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot saying it could be administered within 12 weeks, rather than the 21 days originally recommended.
Hundreds of thousands of Britons have already received their first dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine after the UK was the first country to approve its rollout, with second doses due from this week.
Pfizer sounded cautious on the prospect of shifting the schedule of its second dose, noting it had not been evaluated on different dosing schedules.
""There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days,"" it said in a statement, adding that the implementation of alternative schedules should be closely monitored.
""While decisions on alternative dosing regimens reside with health authorities, Pfizer believes it is critical... to ensure each recipient is afforded the maximum possible protection, which means immunisation with two doses of the vaccine.""
AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot was quoted in Britain's Sunday Times newspaper saying that his firm had a ""winning formula"" to rival the efficacy rates of around 95% shown by vaccines developed by Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). He said he could not say more pending publication of new data.
Speaking to Sky News, Oxford vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said there had been transparency in the process.
""The MHRA have said that they will be publishing their assessment report. There are different groups within the trial, we've had different intervals between the doses, and different dose levels as you say, and that makes the analysis somewhat complicated,"" she said.
""The MHRA has done their own analysis, and they're very confident to now licence the vaccine for emergency use.""
Oxford did not respond to a request for comment following the MHRA briefing.
Regulators in other countries have taken a more cautious approach than Britain and the different efficacy rates cited by the MHRA as well as its new recommendations on the timing of second doses prompted scientists to call for the details underpinning its approval to be released.
""More needs to be known because many points about these decisions remain unclear. MHRA and JCVI promised to provide more information urgently,"" said Saad Shakir, Director of the Drug Safety Research Unit near Southampton.
Jeremy Farrar, director of health research foundation Wellcome, said a new trial might be needed to give clearer data on the best timing of a second dose.
""We will also need to continue tracking and improving our understanding of how long the protection lasts and whether they can prevent transmission,"" he said. 

""This would be best achieved by a randomised trial on the timing of the second dose.""

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",Japan awarded more than 100 contracts over 10 years to Dentsu-linked non-profit groups,"By Ju-min Park, Sakura Murakami, Mari Saito and Antoni Slodkowski
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government has awarded more than 100 contracts over the last decade to two non-profit groups set up by Dentsu Inc, according to a Reuters analysis of government data, in arrangements that some opposition lawmakers say obscured the role of the advertising giant in winning public funds.
The contracts, which ranged from administering tourism-promotion projects to distributing coronavirus relief funds, were worth at least $1.6 billion, according to  public disclosures by  government ministries and data provided by those ministries to Japan’s parliament, seen by Reuters, which has not previously been reported.
Dentsu Inc received at least $1.2 billion of that amount as a subcontractor to the two non-profit groups, according to government records, and many of the contracts were awarded in non-competitive bids. 
Tokyo-based Dentsu has close ties to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. It is part of Dentsu Group Inc, one of Japan’s most influential companies.
Dentsu’s use of non-profit groups to win public contracts first came to light in May, when local media reported that the advertising company had used one of the two non-profits, called Service Design Engineering Council, to win a government contract worth $700 million to distribute more than $20  billion  in state aid to businesses hit financially by the new coronavirus.
Opposition lawmakers have protested against the government’s award of the coronavirus aid contract to the non-profit.    
At issue is whether Dentsu used non-profit groups to prevent scrutiny of its involvement in lucrative government contracts and whether the additional layer of bureaucracy caused by subcontracting work to Dentsu was a waste of taxpayers’ money.
In response to Reuters’ questions, Dentsu said it was a “co-founding member” of the two non-profits. It declined to comment on the number or value of contracts the non-profits won.  
A Dentsu spokesman said the non-profit group Dentsu used to win the coronavirus aid contract was the most appropriate way to bid for the project under rules established by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), which awarded the contract. Dentsu said it could not bid for the project directly because its accounting department determined its balance sheet would be adversely impacted. 
Officials representing METI, which awarded the vast majority of the contracts won by the two non-profits, said in response to Reuters’ questions there was no problem giving projects to non-profits as long as the bidding process was legitimate. In response to the outcry over the coronavirus relief contract, METI conducted a review of its procurement practices. On Friday the ministry announced reforms, including steps to make its dealings with bidders more transparent. 
Dentsu halted new bids on METI projects while the review was being conducted. On Monday, following METI’s announcement of its reforms, Dentsu told Reuters it will adhere to new standards set forward in the ministry's review.
Hidekazu Takakura, a deputy director-general overseeing strategy at METI, said the contracting structure  Dentsu  employed did not break ministry rules.    
“They said they wanted to do it this way with the people they have relationships with, so we didn’t really question it at the time,” Takakura said.
Hiroshi Arikawa, a former official at Japan's Board of Audit, an independent body that reviews government spending, said the Dentsu arrangement  meant an additional layer of cost for taxpayers. He said the structure also shielded  Dentsu  from the board’s inspections as the company was not a direct recipient of the contract but a subcontractor.
Suga’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
SOLE BIDDER     
Dentsu  stepped up its involvement in Japanese government contracts a decade ago, after the global financial crisis, as it looked to expand its public sector business and offset slow growth in its traditional advertising and media businesses, according to a former Dentsu official.
Rules introduced by Japan in 2006 allowed non-profits to be established by as few as two people with minimal disclosure. These entities could then bid for government contracts.
Once a Dentsu-affiliated non-profit won a contract, it then subcontracted work to Dentsu in the majority of cases, public government records show.
Dentsu co-founded Service Design in 2016. Since then, the organisation has been the sole bidder on eight of the 14 projects it was awarded, according to METI, winning contracts worth at least $812 million in total. 
Service Design’s first project was to set up a programme designed to establish Michelin-like ratings for hospitality businesses such as restaurants and hotels in Japan ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Service Design handed management of the programme to Dentsu, which held meetings at its own headquarters and dispatched Dentsu employees to run the scheme, five people involved told Reuters.    
In response to Reuters’ questions, Dentsu and Service Design said Dentsu was cooperating on the tourism project as part of the non-profit and Service Design led the project. Service Design said it would ""take appropriate measures"" following METI’s review of its procurement practices, without giving further details. 
Alongside Service Design, Dentsu also won contracts through a second non-profit group called the Sustainable Open Innovation Initiative (SII), which is run by Satoshi Tanaka, a former Dentsu employee. It shares its Tokyo office building with one of the ad agency’s subsidiaries. 
According to government procurement records, SII has received at least $837 million for administering 89  government contracts  since 2011. It was the sole bidder for most of those, according to data provided to lawmakers by METI officials, seen by Reuters. SII outsourced about three quarters of the work for the contracts awarded by METI, with the bulk of that work going to  Dentsu, according to ministry data from 2015 onwards.   
In an email to Reuters, SII’s Tanaka declined to comment on the value of contracts SII won and how much of the work was subcontracted to Dentsu.
METI advises companies it awards contracts to not to outsource more than half of the work to third parties, in order to encourage transparency and efficiency in government procurement, but it allows exceptions in the case of large-scale projects or ones that need technical support.

Opposition lawmakers have called on Japan's Board of Audit to investigate how the two non-profits subcontracted work to Dentsu. The board will not rule on whether it will take up that request before the end of the fiscal year on March 31, its spokesman said. The board’s investigations often take more than a year, ending in recommendations for government entities on how to improve their practices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks closed higher on Wednesday, with the Dow Industrials nudging up to a record, as investors looked towards an improving economic outlook in 2021 on the back of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and hopes for even more fiscal support.
Near-term expectations of bigger stimulus checks dimmed after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a quick vote to back President Donald Trump's call to increase COVID-19 relief checks to $2,000 from $600 already signed into law. McConnell introduced a bill that tied the increased $2,000 stimulus checks with the removal of protections for social media companies and a study on election security. 
""Something's better than nothing but there's a lot of politics involved. The market is anticipating something, whether $600 or $2,000 part of that is baked into the cake,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. 
""The markets are saying 'what have you done for me lately?' and people are going to be focusing on what's going to happen if we see more and more restrictions due to the pandemic."" 
Investors are also eyeing the Georgia run-off election on January 5, which could lead to Democratic control of the Senate, and upend the market view of political gridlock. 
Optimism over vaccine rollouts was boosted after Britain approved the emergency use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University's COVID-19 vaccine, which will start being administered on Monday.
But that was tempered somewhat by the first known U.S. case of a highly infectious coronavirus variant discovered in Britain that was now detected in Colorado.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.89 points, or 0.24%, to 30,409.56, the S&P 500 gained 5 points, or 0.13%, to 3,732.04 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.78 points, or 0.15%, to 12,870.00. The last few weeks of the year have seen a shift towards undervalued stocks that historically are the first to benefit from an economic recovery, with sectors such as banking, energy and materials outpacing their peers.
Heavyweight technology shares, the most sought-after this year, weakened as investors rushed towards cyclical stocks. 
Trading volumes were subdued and are expected to be low as the year draws to close. 
The S&P 500 index is up 15.5% on the year, after trillions of dollar in fiscal and monetary stimulus and progress in developing vaccines helped the benchmark index bounce back nearly 67% from its March 23 closing low.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which was the first among Wall Street's main indexes to turn positive for the year, is also set for its best yearly performance since 2009, with majority of gains led by FAANG stocks - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Despite the modest gains, eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with energy and materials the best performing. 
Shares of payments network processor Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) rose 2.56% after Stephens hiked its price target on the stock on hopes of improving cross-border sentiment.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.57 billion shares, compared with the 10.93 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Sizzling hot: Solar stocks set to end pandemic year at record highs,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - Solar stocks dazzled in 2020 and looked set to wrap up a year ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic with triple-digit gains amid a shift in focus to 'clean energy' as the outbreak decimated the global oil industry.
Giving the rally a leg up was Joe Biden's victory in the November U.S. presidential election, along with the coronavirus aid and funding bill that extended solar tax credits by two years. 
The credits have helped reduce the cost of solar projects, and the extension pushed shares of solar equipment makers Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) Inc, ReneSola Ltd and  Canadian Solar  (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Inc, among others, to record or multi-year highs.
Years of disappointing shareholder returns by the oil and gas industry, this year's pandemic and the clean energy push have encouraged investors to move their money out of traditional industries and into renewables, said Josh Sherman, partner at consultancy firm Opportune LLP.

The coming years could be even better for the U.S. solar industry, and industry research firm IBISWorld estimates total revenue could cross $19.4 billion in 2026, more than double this year's $8.23 billion.
Top solar trade group Solar Energy Industries Association and energy research firm Wood Mackenzie forecast U.S. solar installations will surge 43% this year, just shy of a pre-pandemic forecast, highlighting the industry's quicker-than-expected recovery from a virus-related slowdown.

Stocks are expected to extend their rally too, and Sherman said investor appetite will only increase next year as the solar industry ramps up infrastructure.
Underscoring the trends, leading brokerage J.P. Morgan hiked its price targets across the board for renewable companies on Dec. 23, bumping its target on solar equipment maker Solaredge Technologies Inc to $371 from $315.

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher on Wednesday as gains in energy and industrial sectors helped overshadow a setback on Capitol Hill to increase direct payments included in the stimulus bill to $2,000.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",S&P dividend payments to investors hit record in 2020 despite virus hit,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Dividend payments to investors in the S&P 500 rose to a new record in 2020, despite the challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic, according to research from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Dividends payments rose 0.7% to $58.28 per share from the previous record set in 2019, according to S&P Global.
A record dividend payment in the first quarter of 2020, and a stronger-than-expected payment in the fourth quarter led to record payouts to investors, the ninth straight annual record, according to research from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analysts for S&P and Dow Jones indices. 
While the S&P 500 index hit its lowest since 2016 in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. stock index has since reached record highs.
For 2021, Silverblatt currently sees dividend payments setting its 10th consecutive record year, up 4.2% over 2020, he said. But for the recent addition of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to the S&P 500, which does not pay a dividend on its common stock, the increase would have been 5.9% without Tesla, he said.
With cash earning next to nothing, given U.S. interest rates, and Treasury yields near record lows, robust dividends is another factor boosting the allure of stocks for yield-starved investors.
The coronavirus pandemic jeopardized corporate dividend programs earlier this year as companies looking to preserve cash and fortify their finances, suspended or slashed dividends.
The strong recovery in the latter part of the year has helped correct the situation to a large extent.
""The good news is that S&P 500 dividend cuts peaked in May and have since stabilized,"" Tony DiSpirito, head of U.S. fundamental active equity at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) wrote in a recent report.

""We expect dividend growth to resume in 2021 as vaccine distribution and greater clarity in general give company managements the confidence to release excess cash in the form of dividends and buybacks,"" he said.

Soltau, who joined the struggling retailer about two years ago, will leave the company on Dec. 31.
Simon's chief investment officer, Stanley Shashoua, would be appointed Penney's interim CEO. The retailer said its new owners would establish a temporary office of the CEO to include key members of Penney's current leadership team.
Penney said earlier this month its retail and operating assets would exit Chapter 11 as two of its biggest landlords, Simon and Brookfield, had acquired nearly all such assets.

The iconic department store had filed for bankruptcy in May after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to temporarily close its then nearly 850 stores.

Investing.com -- AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) tumbled 5.5% after filing to sell up to 50 million shares as theaters remain ghosts of their former selves.
Shares are down 50% this year as communities shut down in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, meaning no popcorn and big screens for most of the world for most of the year. Rival Cinemark, on the other hand, rose 2%.
AMC, the largest theater chain in the U.S., is adding to the 200 million shares sold earlier this month, raising $104 million as of Dec. 28, at an average price per share of $2.81.
The movie chain is still at risk of going bankrupt. It doesn't help that all 2021 theatrical releases from Warner Bros. are going to be available on HBOMax simultaneously. 
AMC previously said it had funds to remain in business until early 2021, but would need at least $750 million to make it through the year.    
Bankruptcy may not be the worst option. 
“The easy answer is that if they declare bankruptcy, it is likely to be a reorganization rather than a liquidation,” CNBC reported Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter as saying. “In bankruptcy, they can wipe out their lease obligations and renew those leases that make sense, so arguably they can lower their overall operating expense.”

Watch for new Supreme owner VFC Corp. and Calvin Klein parent PVH (NYSE:PVH), in particular, are “poised for a significant recovery in 2021.”
VFC, up 1.3%, completed its acquisition of the red hot Supreme brand yesterday. PVH is up 2.4%.
Drbul rated both companies buy and bumped PVH's price target to $110 from $100. 
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) also got a buy rating and a $165 price target, calling it its best idea for 2021. It should benefit from  “favorable secular tailwinds,” and its market share should “grow materially from here as digital scales further.”

At a virtual special stockholder meeting, more than 99% of votes cast were in favor of the deal. 
Billionaire Bernard Arnault-led LVMH made the first offer late last year, but as the luxury industry slipped into a turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic the company backed out from its promise to close the deal.
LVMH also cited French political intervention to delay completing the acquisition until Jan. 6, pushing Tiffany into a legal battle in September to force LVMH to honor the deal.
Tiffany had earlier said its sales were improving, citing demand recovery in the United States ahead of the holiday season and China, one of its biggest markets. 
LVMH then renegotiated the deal price, lowering it by $425 million. The deal, now cleared by regulators, is expected to close in early 2021. 

As agreed in October, LVMH will pay $131.5 per share, down from $135 in the original deal signed late last year.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Perella Weinberg to go public via $975-million deal with Betsy Cohen's SPAC,"(Reuters) - Boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners on Wednesday agreed to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm, or a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), backed by banking entrepreneur Betsy Cohen in a deal valued at $975 million.
Cohen's FinTech Acquisition Corporation IV, which had raised $230 million in September through an initial public offering (IPO), will acquire Perella Weinberg in a deal that includes a commitment of $125 million from investors such as Fidelity Management and Wellington Management.
The merged entity will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol 'PWP', the companies said in a statement. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2021, pending approvals.
Perella Weinberg has been part of some of the biggest deals in the United States in the past few years, including the $3.2-billion buyout of SodaStream by PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and American International Group (NYSE:AIG)'s $5.56 billion acquisition of reinsurer Validus Holdings.
The investment bank was founded by veteran Wall Street bankers Joseph Perella, Peter Weinberg and Terry Meguid in 2006. Separately, Perella Weinberg had said it was planning an IPO of its blank-check firm PWP Forward Acquisition Corp I, which will be led by Stacia Schlosser Ryan.
SPACs raise funds in an IPO with the aim of buying a private company and have become immensely popular investment vehicles this year. The acquired company then becomes public as result of the merger and it is an alternative to the traditional IPO process.
At least 208 SPACs have raised more than $70 billion so far this year, according to SPAC Research.
Besides Cohen, the founder of Jefferson Bank and Bancorp Inc, other prominent businesswomen such as Joanna Coles too have taken their SPACs public.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened modestly higher on Wednesday, shrugging off any disappointment felt at the U.S. Senate's refusal to fast-track a vote on raising the direct payments to households provided for by the latest stimulus bill.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to timetable a vote on increasing the payments to $2,000 from $600 on Tuesday, defying President Donald Trump. He later reintroduced the proposal in a separate bill but tied it to conditions that have no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

On a light day for economic and corporate news flow, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index posted a surprising increase for December, while nationwide pending home sales fell for the third month in a row in November - by 2.6% rather than the 0.2% drop expected - in a fresh sign that the red hot housing market is cooling off a little. 
Among early movers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 1.0%, giving up some of its gains on Tuesday after the announcement that activist investor Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) had taken a stake in the chipmaker. Third Point wants Intel to consider splitting its design and manufacturing operations and possibly sell some assets. The company has missed out on the tech rally since spring, due to the loss of key contracts with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and a delay to production of its new generation of chips.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs rose 1.0% after the U.K.'s health authorities approved its Covid-19 vaccine for distribution. It's the first regulatory approval for a vaccine that accounts for over a third of advance sales to public health buyers across the world to date. AstraZeneca is unlikely to make much money on the drug in the near term, having agreed to sell it 'at cost' while the pandemic lasts. There is some doubt over when the company can declare an end to that phase.

(Reuters) -European stocks inched higher on Wednesday as UK's approval of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine, bets of more U.S. fiscal aid and large-scale vaccination efforts spurred hopes of a strong recovery in the global economy next year.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.2% to hover near a 10-month high hit in the previous session.

The deal marks an acceleration of the sector's consolidation after the approval of a merger between state-owned Bankia and Caixabank earlier this month.
The wider banking index rose 0.8% but is among the worst performing sectors this year alongside energy, as mounting bad loans due to the impact of the pandemic and record low interest rates hammered the appeal for the sector.

Travel and leisure stocks rose 0.9% as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines across the continent took the edge off a surge in infection rates that is driving many countries to consider extending lockdowns.

1230,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Analysis-Intel has few good options as investor demands break-up,"By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb wants  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to consider splitting its huge chip manufacturing operations from its chip design and development business, but analysts say doing so could weaken both businesses unless the firm can form a joint venture.
For more than 50 years, Intel has operated on the idea that both designing and manufacturing its own semiconductors produce the best results.
It has stuck to that even as most of the global industry has moved to a model where U.S. companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc design chips that are then built by specialized chip manufacturers in Asia, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
But Intel has failed to stay at the cutting edge of manufacturing technology in recent years, allowing rivals including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc - both of whom outsource chipmaking - to gain share in key markets such as PCs and data center chips.
Intel also famously missed the mobile revolution, opening the door for chips based on designs from Arm Ltd to dominate the smartphone market. And now, customers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have started designing their own chips, to be manufactured by TSMC or other foundries.
Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan says he wants Intel's design teams to be more flexible about where their chips are made and expects to announce a decision next month on whether the company will outsource some of its 2023 products.
But with shares down nearly 20% this year, Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC is demanding more dramatic measures. It sent a letter to Intel's board asking it to retain an investment adviser to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device manufacturer.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Third Point has amassed a $1 billion stake in Intel and wants it to consider separating chip design and manufacturing. That could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to sources.
But spinning off Intel's manufacturing operations into a separate company ""doesn't fix anything,"" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.
Chip factories are only profitable when run at full capacity. Intel has tried to attract outside clients before with little success. And though rival chip factories are struggling to meet demand this year, chip designers must commit to a factory 18 to 24 months ahead of production, meaning it would take the new company time to win new clients.
In the interim, it would likely remain dependent on Intel's design operations for business - at precisely the time when Intel is considering moving more of its manufacturing away to outside firms.
On the other hand, if Intel's design teams signed a manufacturing deal with former plants, that agreement could stop Intel's design operations from competing against rivals that use more advanced production.
AMD signed such an agreement with its former factories when it spun them off in the mid-2000s, which at times prevented it from pursuing advanced technologies as fast as rivals such as Nvidia did.
And selling off Intel's factories outright to one of the only two other companies capable of making advanced processor chips - TSMC or Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd - could also prove difficult, analysts said.
That's because chip-making requires configuring and programming extremely expensive tools to perform thousands of steps in complex manufacturing process. Retrofitting an Intel factory to replicate, for example, a TSMC chipmaking process would be costly and time consuming.
Intel is ""likely to get 20 to 30 cents on the dollar of what they invested, making it a nonstarter,"" said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research. For TSMC, buying Intel's fabs ""is almost like trying to take apart one of those big Lego projects that your kids got at Christmas and putting it back together again after the kids threw away the manual.""
A joint venture involving collaboration with TSMC or Samsung (KS:005930) is likely the most viable option, said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at The Linley Group.

But any such move would be a permanent fork in the road for Intel's manufacturing strategy. The company makes more than 800,000 wafers a month at its 15 factories, according to a February report from IC Insights. That is smaller than Samsung and TSMC's respective 2.9 million and 2.5 million but still enough volume to require a huge investment from a partner over many years.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Samsung leader Jay Y. Lee vows change in graft trial's final hearing,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee told a Seoul court on Wednesday he would ""make a new Samsung (KS:005930)"" in the final hearing of a trial that will decide whether he returns to jail for alleged bribery. 
The heir of one of South Korea's most powerful families was convicted of bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye and jailed for five years in 2017. 
That sentence was reduced and suspended on appeal and he served just one year in jail before being freed in 2018. 
A subsequent Supreme Court ruling sent the matter back to the Seoul High Court, which must now decide on a new sentence. The decision is scheduled for Jan. 18. 
""Samsung has been running without looking back but I missed something vital. Although it became Korea's leading company, the importance of its social role, responsibility and public trust was overlooked,"" Lee said reading a statement in court, dressed in a dark suit and grey tie. 
""Now Samsung will be different. I'll be the first to change... No matter what happens, I will never do anything to pursue my personal interests. I will raise the value of the company and focus on social contributions, fix what the court has pointed out as the harms of chaebol,"" he said.
South Korea’s big family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, are credited with helping raise the country out of poverty following the Korean War but have been criticised for wielding too much power preserved in part through elaborate internal cross-shareholdings.
Lee shed tears when talking about the memory of his deceased father, saying he wanted to do his filial duty by making ""a new Samsung"" that is sustainable and has ""a thorough compliance system that can resist undue outside pressure"". 
While not the only legal challenge Lee is dealing with - he is also on trial for alleged fraud and stock price manipulation - the bribery case is the biggest immediate threat to his leadership of Samsung Electronics.
Lee, 52, has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since his father Lee Kun-hee was hospitalised in 2014. The elder Lee passed away in October but his role as chairman has yet to be filled.
A return to jail could see the younger Lee sidelined from major decisions at the smartphone-to-semiconductor giant, at a time when the family needs to raise funds to pay a hefty inheritance tax bill and potentially juggle equity stakes in key affiliates to shore up its control.
How much more jail time Lee serves, if any, will partly depend on the court's evaluation of the work of an independent compliance committee set up by Samsung earlier this year. 
The committee, headed by a former Supreme Court judge, was established in January to monitor wrongdoing by executives. 
Prosecutors sought a nine-year jail term for Lee, saying that defendants, including Lee, ""did not show passive resistance"" to former President Park's unlawful demands. 
Lee's lawyers said Lee had gained nothing in this case while the country's former president violated corporate freedom and property rights by abusing her ""imperial status and authority"".
Under South Korean law, a jail term of three years or less can be suspended; for longer sentences, the person must serve out the term barring a presidential pardon.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",IPOs paid out big for U.S. investors in 2020,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Wall Street investors with access to newly listed stocks at their exclusive IPO prices reaped huge returns in 2020, while retail investors who generally miss out on the best prices still made tidy gains.
Shares of companies that went public via IPOs or direct listings this year on average have surged 75%, with corporations that have yet to report a profit jumping more than twice as much as those with positive bottom lines, according to a Reuters analysis.
It is a stunning result in a year that saw stocks plunge when the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spread in the spring and communities across the country went into lockdown, then turn around and scale fresh highs. In addition, companies seeking to list shares have been embraced on expectations they will benefit from low interest rates, eventual economic recovery and a rollout of vaccines.
The analysis includes about 200 companies that held IPOs in the United States this year, and a handful of direct listings from companies such as Asana and Palantir Technologies. About 70% of the companies listing their shares this year are not run profitably, according to Refinitiv data and company filings.
Underwriters reserve most of the new shares in red-hot IPOs for top institutional investors, mostly cutting out small investors who can buy shares only once they start trading.
A non-professional investor who bought into all of 2020's public listings at the closing price of each stock's first day of trade would be up about 28% for the year, less than half the return of an investor who bought in at each IPO price. That is better than the S&P 500's 15% gain so far in 2020, but far short of the over 40% gain that buying a Nasdaq index fund at the start of the year would have provided.
Brokerage Citadel Securities has said that retail investors have accounted for as much as 25% of stock market activity in 2020.
(Graphic: Institutional investors win big in 2020 IPOs - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/IPOS/xegpbbebypq/chart.png)
The large gap between average returns based on IPO prices and returns based on closing prices of the first day of trading underscores the advantages enjoyed by institutional investors on Wall Street. 
Airbnb, 2020's most hotly anticipated stock market debutant, is up 121% from the IPO price in its Dec. 10 listing. But based on Airbnb's closing price on its first day on the market, the stock is up just 4%.
(Graphic: Institutional investors dominate in 2020 IPOs - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/IPOS/xklpyjlmzvg/chart.png)
The median IPO return, which reduces the influence of the most extreme winners and losers, so far in 2020 is 51%, shrinking to a more modest 13% based on closing prices after the first trading days.

Chinese online retailer Wunong Net Technology was this year's strongest-performing U.S. IPO stock, up almost 700% since its listing on Dec. 15, according to Refinitiv data. Investors buying Wunong Net at the close of its first trading day would be up about 230%.

The executive order, signed by President Donald Trump on November 12, triggered a rush by FTSE Russell, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices to remove U.S.-blacklisted Chinese companies from their indexes to keep their clients compliant, but the scope of the sanctions was seen as vague.
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday published guidance clarifying that the executive order, released in November, would apply to investors in exchange-traded funds and index funds as well as subsidiaries of Chinese companies designated as owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
FTSE Russell, which has announced the exclusion of nine Chinese companies from its global indexes in response to the executive order, said in a statement late on Monday that it is reviewing the U.S. clarification and will make evaluation for ""potential additional exclusions"".
FTSE Russell reiterated it will publish an announcement on Jan. 4, 2021, with any additional deletions being effective from Jan. 7.
MSCI has announced the deletion of 10 securities issued by seven Chinese firms while S&P DJI said it would remove securities of 10 Chinese companies following Trump's executive order. 
MSCI had said it would also create a new and separate index series which does not reflect the changes, and will distribute the tools to clients automatically.
But on Monday, MSCI said in a statement it will now only distribute the new indexes upon request by clients, and reminded index users that they are ""responsible for ensuring compliance"" with applicable sanctions and rules. 
FTSE Russell has deleted eight U.S.-blacklisted Chinese companies from its global indexes including Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and China Railway Construction. It will remove Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) in January.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, on Monday published a so-called ""Communist Chinese Military Companies List"" that gives more precise information on the sanctioned Chinese firms and their securities.

The latest twist in the $331.5 million deal in an upscale location in the financial hub comes amid growing tension between the world's two biggest economies over a host of issues. 
The developer, which agreed in September to buy the property used to house U.S. consulate staff, said in a filing on Wednesday it received a letter from the Land Registry last week that the property is ""not an ordinary real estate property"".
According to the letter, the Chinese government has advised the Hong Kong government that if the U.S. Consulate General intends to rent, purchase or sell any real estate in Hong Kong, the U.S. government must make a written application to China at least 60 days before the deal, and the deal shall not proceed without the written consent of the Chinese government. 
""The matters as stated in the letter were exceptional and were not made known to or anticipated by (Hang Lung),"" the developer said.
It said after informing the United States, the U.S. on Tuesday contested the necessity to comply with the diplomatic obligations and did not produce the evidence as demanded. 
The group is currently evaluating and taking legal advice on the various appropriate actions, including exploring the feasibility of extending the time for deal completion.
A U.S. consulate spokesperson told Reuters additional time is needed for the buyer and seller to complete the administrative processes required for closing on the property, and the department is not at liberty to comment on the specific terms of ongoing contractual transactions.  
During the tender of the property, property consultants said many developers in mainland China and Hong Kong were hesitant to venture an offer because it was seen as politically sensitive.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cary Kochman kicked off a sale process for U.S. printing services provider  InnerWorkings  (NASDAQ:INWK) Inc just as lockdowns to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus took effect in March. 
The  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) global co-head of mergers and acquisitions, who was advising InnerWorkings on clinching a deal, had to rewrite a playbook he used for most of his 30-year career. 
There would be no on-location due diligence for perspective buyers and their lenders. Tours were carried out virtually by people walking around the company's facilities with iPads. Negotiations were done remotely. 
By July, Koch man had secured a $177 million sale of InnerWorkings. The price was equivalent to where the company traded as the March lockdowns began, and a 127% premium to its market value the day before the announcement.
His bank's investment banking revenue was up 25% year-on-year in the second and third quarters as companies took advantage of a stock market rally and cheap financing to pursue dream deals and capital raises.
While remote working has paid off handsomely, Kochman and his peers predict bankers will hit the road to meet clients again once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
""We are winning new business and beauty contests, but it is hard in this moment to replace an existing and trusted relationship,"" Kochman said. 
Reuters interviews with more than two-dozen investment bankers show that many shifts in their business brought about by the pandemic, such as remote due diligence and smaller office footprints, are here to stay even once COVID-19 vaccines have been successfully rolled out. 
But they also reveal fears among some about losing their competitive edge as they pitch digitally for business, amid concerns that younger bankers are falling behind.
""The flexibility of being able to work remotely is good, but when it is safe again, young professionals have to be in the office and travel with senior bankers. That is how they learn,"" said Robert Kindler,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s global head of mergers and acquisitions.
Deals have boomed across the board for Wall Street during the pandemic, as corporate financing remained cheap and plentiful thanks to support from the Federal Reserve. Global debt issuance is up more than 30% to $10.1 trillion year-to-date. 
Initial public offerings around the world are up 25% year-to-date, totaling $220 billion, and while mergers and acquisitions globally dropped 7% year-to-date, to $3.4 trillion, this is their fourth-strongest year of the last decade.
""We can now get to investors around the world in an IPO road show, which used to be seven to nine days on average, in five to seven days,"" said Kim Posnett, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's co-head of global investment banking services. She added that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executed two-thirds of mergers and acquisitions it advised on in 2020 ""completely virtually.""
Many administrative functions of dealmaking will continue to be carried out remotely when the pandemic subsides, bankers say. The real estate footprint of investment banks is also set to be reduced as bankers spend more time outside the office. 
""We had been thinking about taking on another floor (at our New York headquarters) as we were growing so much, from about 40 bankers to more than 100 now, but we have shelved those plans. The only people who really need to be in the office are junior bankers, as they need the training and the camaraderie,"" said PJ Solomon LP Chief Executive Marc Cooper.
IN-PERSON MEETINGS
Switching to a virtual world has also taken a toll on bankers. Some complain about spending 18-hour days on back-to-back Zoom calls and still being expected to be available in the little downtime they have left.
Many bankers are itching to wine and dine clients or spend time with them on the golf course, concerned they are falling behind as executives tap banking relationships they have on speed dial. 
Some pursued client meetings even during the pandemic.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, for example, allowed some in-person meetings between its bankers and clients this year carried out ""in a responsible way,"" said David Wah, head of the bank's newly created client advisory group, which gathers star bankers to advise on megadeals, including semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc's $35 billion acquisition of peer  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX). 
""I think people have become more accustomed to doing M&A deals virtually, but there remains a strong desire to do some meetings in person, especially aspects of a deal that relate to delicate points of negotiation and integrating cultures,"" Wah said. 
Over the summer, bankers and their clients frequented golf courses and yacht clubs outside New York, and fine restaurants with outdoor seating in the city. Some donned face shields as a sign of respect.
Left behind are young investment bankers who progressed by shadowing their seasoned colleagues on client trips and in the office. Speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the media, junior bankers at several banks expressed concerns about their career opportunities if fewer of their senior colleagues end up working in person with them in the future.
Supriya Saxena, head of financing and advisory for the Americas at UniCredit, said she focuses on one-on-one virtual meetings with her less-experienced staff to make sure they are progressing. 
""A number of them are completely by themselves so it has been trickier for them,"" Saxena said.

U.S. shares hit pause on recent record highs during the previous session after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked increasing the stimulus checks amounts from $600 to $2,000 on Tuesday.

Aeromexico filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court in June, after the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global travel industry.
The carrier was approved for up to $1 billion in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, and received an initial $100 million payment in September. 
Aeromexico said it had wrapped up negotiations with the STIA and Independencia unions, which represent airline industry workers, while it remains in talks with the ASSA and ASPA unions, which represent flight crews and pilots respectively.
It did not detail terms of the completed agreements. The airline is required to reach agreements with all four unions to access a second tranche of DIP funding. 
""The favorable outcome of the negotiations with the Independencia and STIA unions, as well as the progress with the flight attendants union ASSA, represents an extremely important milestone to have access to the next stages of DIP financing under our restructuring process,"" Aeromexico Chief Executive Andres Conesa said in a statement. 
The company in November requested permission from U.S. bankruptcy court to dismiss 1,830 employees, including 855 unionized workers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday in choppy trading after hitting record highs, as investors worried about the path of economic reopening and whether the Senate would authorize additional pandemic aid checks.
Modest gains in early trading brought stocks to an intraday record, but the advance evaporated after U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked immediate consideration of the measure calling for an increase in stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000. Final passage of the proposal would require 60 votes and the backing of a dozen Republicans. 
McConnell said the chamber would address the increased payments this week along with limits on big technology companies and election integrity.
McConnell's comment comes a day after Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the move to bump up direct payments.
""The move by Majority Leader McConnell to not endorse the $2,000 disbursements turned equity markets from green to red around midday,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta. 
""The plan that was originally signed is baked in. The question as to whether the bigger individual checks get passed is up for debate.""

Volumes are expected to be light in the holiday-shortened week, which could lead to boost volatility. The S&P 500 is up 15.4% so far this year, with just two trading days left in 2020.

The Russell 2000 small cap index was off 1.85% on the day, its biggest one-day percentage decline in a month. 
Unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, along with positive vaccine developments have helped the S&P 500 bounce back from a virus-fueled crash in March.

Investing.com – The Dow pared gains to snap a three-day winning streak Tuesday, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel blocked the Democrats' attempt to pass a bill aimed at boosting direct payments to struggling Americans.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%, or 68 points, after hitting an intraday high of 30,335.67. The S&P 500 was down 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21%. All three major average hit intraday record highs before paring gains.
McConnell blocked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's attempt to approve the bill to increase direct payments to $2,000 from $600.
Ahead of the objection, McConnel said the Senate would evaluate the prospect of boosting stimulus checks alongside other measures raised by President Donald Trump including the repeal of a law that offers protection for tech companies and concerns about election fraud.
Last week, Trump urged lawmakers to increase stimulus checks after calling the initial $600 per week payments a ""disgrace.""
The move away from record highs in the major averages was paced by a decline in energy stocks as oil prices retreated from the highs of the day amid ongoing concerns over further restrictions as the new Covid-19 variant continues to spread globally.
Technology also played a role in the general market malaise, as the Fab 5, with the exception of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), gave back some of their gains from a day earlier.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red.

Chinese tech giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) rose 6% as its tech affiliate Ant Group is considering setting up a financial holding company to be regulated more like a bank, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX resumed passenger flights in the United States for the first time on Tuesday after a 20-month safety ban was lifted last month.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Flight 718 landed at New York's LaGuardia Airport around 1:08 p.m after departing Miami about two-and-a-half hours earlier. A CNBC reporter said the wife of the flight captain and the first officer's mother were both onboard the almost 1,200-mile flight.
American and planemaker Boeing have sought to reassure the public over the plane's safety after it was cleared by U.S. regulators in November to resume flights.
A Reuters/IPSOS poll shows that more than half of passengers are wary of taking the jet when reminded of two fatal crashes that led to the grounding.
""This aircraft is ready to go,"" American President Robert Isom said at a media briefing in Miami before the flight. The airline is confident in the safety of the 737 MAX, he added. 
The MAX was grounded in March 2019 for 20 months after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. The grounding was lifted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last month after Boeing agreed to software upgrades and new safeguards on a key flight control system linked to both fatal crashes.
American's first flight between Miami and LaGuardia follows flight control updates, maintenance work, fresh pilot training and town hall meetings with flight crews to walk them through Boeing's changes and address concerns.
American is the third carrier globally to resume flights following Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes and Grupo Aeromexico earlier this month. Between those two airlines, the updated 737 MAX has flown about 250 commercial flights, according to Cirium, the aviation data firm.
American Airlines currently has 31 737 MAX aircraft after taking delivery of seven more jets since the FAA lifted its safety ban, including one on Monday and plans to gradually reintroduces the plane to its fleet.
The MAX's return comes at a time when COVID-19 has thrust the industry into its worst crisis, with airlines parking hundreds of jets as demand hovers around 30% of 2019 levels.
When the 737 MAX was grounded, U.S. airlines canceled flights because they lacked aircraft to meet demand, adding to Boeing's financial liability.
Now airlines are deferring jet deliveries and do not expect a robust rebound until COVID-19 vaccines are widely available.
Relatives of 737 MAX crash victims oppose its return.
""I call on anyone looking to book a flight in the future to understand when they buy their ticket what type of airplane will be used so they can make an informed decision for themselves and their loved ones,"" said Yalena Lopez-Lewis, whose husband Antoine Lewis died on the Ethiopian Airlines crash.

Hearst Television did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
On January 1, FIOS customers in select markets may be unable to watch their favorite programming, including local news, major live sporting events and other notable entertainment, if the impasse continues.

If the two companies do not reach an agreement, Hearst Television may themselves choose to remove channels from Fios TV, Verizon said.

(Reuters) - Nonprofit group the Ad Council and public health coalition COVID Collaborative launched an education campaign on Tuesday for doctors and nurses to boost public confidence in the new coronavirus vaccines as they roll out across the United States.
The campaign, to give healthcare providers information to share with patients who may be skeptical of the vaccine, is a first step in the council's push to create national public service announcements encouraging COVID vaccinations.
A video series produced in collaboration with at least 12 medical associations, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, addresses topics such as safety, availability and administration of the vaccine.
""I'm urging healthcare professionals to please get vaccinated,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the beginning of each video. ""It's equally important as healthcare providers to show confidence in the vaccines so that other people will follow suit and get vaccinated.""
The Ad Council and COVID Collaborative will begin launching vaccine public service announcements to the general public in January across television, websites and social media.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's coronavirus vaccine became the second to receive U.S. authorization this month after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The vaccines are being distributed to healthcare workers, with older people in long-term care facilities next in line.
In a Reuters poll released this month, 61% of Americans said they would be interested in taking the COVID-19 vaccine, down 4 points from May. A vaccination rate of about 75% is needed to achieve herd immunity, health experts have said.

1248,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Jobless Benefits Won’t Lapse After Delay, Labor Department Says","(Bloomberg) -- Unemployed people claiming federal benefits won’t see a one-week gap in their payments, despite the delay in President Donald Trump signing the program extension into law, according to the Department of Labor.
States are implementing the provisions as quickly as possible, and the Labor Department doesn’t anticipate that claimants will miss a week of benefits due to the timing of the new law’s enactment, a spokesman for the Department said in a statement Tuesday.
Trump signed a bipartisan stimulus and government funding bill, which included an 11-week extension of unemployment benefits, into law on Sunday, a day after benefits expired. That prompted concern that jobless Americans would lose out on benefits for the last week of December. Trump held off signing the bill for several days as he demanded bigger stimulus payments for individuals and action on two unrelated issues involving election security and removing a liability shield for technology companies.
The pandemic relief law provides a $300-a-week payment for jobless individuals and extends benefits for self-employed and gig workers through mid-March. The $300 federal payments are on top of benefits that state unemployment offices provide. The state benefits vary by income and jurisdiction, but the average state payment was $378 a week, according to Labor Department data.
The measure largely extends programs with few changes, meaning that existing guidance will continue to apply, making it easier for the states to implement, the Labor Department spokesman said.
“Millions of jobless workers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that they will not lose a week’s worth of income,” Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. “Now, Donald Trump’s needless delay in signing the relief bill still means unnecessary administrative headaches and late payments, but workers will not lose income.”
About 14 million Americans have been receiving benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs extended in the law.
The uninterrupted jobless benefits could help bolster the economy that has struggled as consumer spending has been falling and unemployment claims remain at elevated levels.
Consumer spending, which accounts for a majority of the economy, dropped 0.4% in November -- the first decline since April, according to Commerce Department data. Personal income decreased 1.1%, reflecting the winding down of several pandemic aid programs.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","Ant weighs financial holding company to placate regulators, sources say","By Julie Zhu and Cheng Leng
(Reuters) -Ant Group Co Ltd is considering folding most of its online financial businesses, including consumer lending, into a holding company that would be regulated like traditional financial firms, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The regulators, mainly the central bank, want Ant to fold its wealth management and insurance distribution businesses as well as minority-owned MYbank online lender into a financial holding company, one of the sources told Reuters.
It was not clear if Ant's payments business Alipay, which was launched in 2004 and is second-biggest revenue generator for the group after consumer lending, would also come under the holding company structure.
Ant declined to comment. 
Beijing is also seeking to potentially take a larger stake in billionaire Jack Ma's businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified Chinese officials and government advisers.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Ant did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the report, which provided no details on which of the businesses the government is eyeing.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, said in a statement to Reuters that Ant is drafting a plan to set up a financial holding firm, and that the company should ensure that all its financial operations are placed under regulatory supervision.
Ant controls a range of financial institutions, including securities and insurance firms, and should set up a holding firm according to law, the central bank said on Tuesday.
The proposed changes to the Chinese fintech giant's businesses are yet not final and subject to revision, said the sources, who sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Chinese regulators abruptly halted Ant's $37 billion initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which was set to be the world's largest, last month.
Since then, regulators have set about reining in Ma's financial and e-commerce empire after he publicly criticised China's regulatory system in October for stifling innovation.
On Sunday, the central bank said it had asked Ant, whose businesses include payment processing, consumer lending and insurance products distribution, to shake up its lending and other consumer finance operations. [anL1N2J702J]
The move, if finalised, would slash the valuation of the revamped Ant, which was to be valued at $315 billion on market debut mainly due to its structure as a technology vendor to financial institutions rather than as a financial firm itself.
A spinoff from Alibaba, Ant in recent years presented itself as a technology company, which helped it to benefit from the far richer valuations the market affords to tech firms than to financial institutions. 
Bloomberg News on Tuesday said Ant was planning to move into the holding company any unit that would require a financial licence, pending regulatory approval.
In September, the PBOC issued rules to regulate financial holding companies so as to avert systematic risks to China's vast financial sector. These steps included a capital threshold for such licences.
One source said Ant's financial holding firm should be regulated accordingly, but expected lots of discussion between Ant and regulators over which businesses would be placed into the holding firm.
In its IPO prospectus filed in August, Ant said it would use newly set up unit Zhejiang Finance Credit Network Technology Co to apply for a financial holding licence, without disclosing which of its financial businesses would be folded into that.
After years of largely hands-off treatment of domestic internet finance platforms, Beijing has adopted a slew of rules in recent months to sharpen oversight of the booming sector.

China's banking and insurance regulator on Tuesday warned consumers to guard against borrowing spurred by internet finance platforms that hide the real costs of such debt.

A motion by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to approve a stimulus checks bill that passed the House on Monday was blocked by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The bill cleared the House on a 275 to 134 vote Monday.
Just before Schumer made his motion, McConnell said the Senate will address three of Trump’s complaints: the amount of the stimulus payments, as well as unrelated concerns about election fraud and a law that shields technology companies from liability for user content.
“This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus,” McConnell said, without explaining when or if a vote will happen.
Trump on Tuesday, in a series of tweets, again demanded that the stimulus payments should be scaled up by the Senate.
“$2000 for our great people, not $600! They have suffered enough from the China Virus!!!” he said.
Despite the push by Trump, spending $464 billion on higher stimulus checks is not popular among Republicans who are increasingly focused on the burgeoning national debt. Only 44 Republicans joined 231 Democrats on Monday to pass a bill increasing the payments to $2,000. In the Senate just a handful of Republicans are now publicly on board, including Florida’s Marco Rubio and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.
The GOP tension comes at a crucial time for Republicans who are fighting to maintain control of the Senate in a pair of Georgia runoff elections on Jan. 5. On Tuesday, both GOP incumbents in the races, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler also came out in favor of the $2,000 checks.

The investment comes as a boost to emerging Europe's largest economy, which is hoping a switch to electric vehicles can help its auto sector catch up with regional rivals including the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

The plant in Poland's industrial southern region of Silesia is one of the company's largest and currently employs around 2,500 people.
Fiat Chrysler confirmed that new hybrid and electric Jeep, Fiat and Alfa Romeo models would be built in Tychy. 
It said the aim was to start mass production of the first of the three new passenger car models for the group's brands in the second half of 2022.

(Reuters) -China's Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group Co Ltd said on Tuesday it had signed a deal to supply battery-grade lithium hydroxide to U.S. electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for the next five years.
Yahua, which is based in southwest China's Sichuan province, put the total value of the contract, signed by its wholly-owned subsidiary Yaan Lithium, at $630-$880 million over 2021-25, a Shenzhen Stock Exchange filing showed.
Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said that value translated into a total lithium hydroxide procurement amount of 63,000-88,000 tonnes, or 12,600-17,600 tonnes per annum.
In May this year, Yahua put a 20,000 tonnes per year lithium hydroxide plant in Yaan city into operation, more than doubling its previous capacity, even as prices languished at multi-year lows amid oversupply and a knock to lithium demand brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Tesla, which started delivering the first vehicles from its gigafactory in Shanghai in December last year, already sources lithium - an ingredient in EV batteries - from China's Ganfeng Lithium, one of the world's biggest producers of the commodity.
The Yahu deal underscores Tesla's ""huge demand"" for battery-grade lithium hydroxide, ""particularly in view of the ramp-up of Model Y production"" in Shanghai, the Daiwa analysts wrote in a note. 
""We expect Ganfeng will continue to be the major if not largest lithium hydroxide supplier of Tesla on the back of this strong demand.""
Tesla last month secured permission to start selling the Model Y sports utility vehicle in China.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares rose for the fourth straight day on Tuesday and oil followed suit as hopes of fresh U.S. stimulus teed up a strong end to the year for riskier assets and had the dollar eyeing two-and-a-half-year lows.
The MSCI World Index was up 0.4% at 1203 GMT, while U.S. stock futures pointed to a similar move at the open on Wall Street, tracking broad-based gains in Europe and overnight in Asia.
Across Europe, Britain's blue-chip shares led regional markets higher on their first day of trading since the Christmas Eve agreement of a trade deal with the European Union.
The FTSE 100 rose 2.1%, on course for its fourth straight day of gains, led by companies in a range of sectors likely to benefit from the deal, including Intertek and  Diageo  (LON:DGE).
""Multinationals, who are the likeliest beneficiaries of frictionless, tariff-free trade, and overseas currency earners are generally leading the charge in the FTSE 100,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Propping up the London market were banks and other financial services.
""This suggests that nerves remain over what deal will be struck in 2021 when it comes to financial services and indeed services overall.""
Also among the gainers was drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) buoyed by news its COVID-19 vaccine is set to be granted emergency use approval within a few days by the UK government.
The launch of the European Union's vaccination programme, hoping to end the widespread lockdowns that have stalled economies across the bloc, saw that positive sentiment shared with the continent, where beaten-down travel and leisure stocks rose 2.3%.
The global stock gains and likely higher U.S. stock market open remain underpinned by hopes a $2.3 trillion stimulus package signed into law by President Trump on Sunday will be approved by the Senate.
The package covers $1.4 trillion in spending to fund government agencies and $892 billion in COVID-19 relief, including $2,000 relief cheques to help cushion the economic impact of the pandemic.
The prospect of higher demand helped boost oil prices with Brent crude futures and U.S. West Texas Intermediate both up around 1.2%.
Demand for riskier assets weakened the U.S. dollar, which is often seen as a safe-haven asset. It was down 0.2% against a basket of currencies and eyeing the 18-month low hit in November.
Shorting the dollar has been a popular trade. Calculations by Reuters based on data released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday suggested that trend would persist. Short positions on the dollar swelled in the week ended Dec. 21 to $26.6 billion, the highest in three months.
Among other currencies, sterling rose 0.4% against the dollar, reversing two days of losses, while the euro climbed for the third day in a row, up 0.3%, also buoyed in part by talk of an EU-China trade pact.
Yields on European government debt edged lower, with blue-chip 10-year German bond yields at 0.57% and riskier Italian, Spanish and Portuguese yields also lower.

A sluggish dollar bolstered gold prices, which rose 0.4%. [GOL/]

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at new record highs for a second straight day on Tuesday, as hopes for a boost to the already-agreed fiscal stimulus package dovetailed with the urge to do some ""window-dressing"" of year-end balance sheets.
By 9: 35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 131 points, or 0.4% at 30,535 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were also both up 0.4%. All three had posted their highest ever closes already on Monday, supported by confidence that the stimulus package would put a floor under household spending - the biggest part of the U.S. economy - for the next few months.
It still isn't clear whether the Senate will vote on a motion passed by the House of Representatives on Monday increasing the direct payments to most U.S. households to $2,000 from $600, as originally foreseen. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has said that if the Senate doesn't make time for a vote, he will filibuster a vote on the Defense Spending bill that is needed in order to override President Trump's veto on that piece of legislation. However, Republican Senators have consistently refused to back anything higher than a $600 payment.
Among the conspicuous early movers were AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs, which rose 1.9% as various reports suggested that U.K. health regulators could approve its Covid-19 vaccine for use as early as today.
Approval from any advanced economy is likely to accelerate the rollout of a vaccine that is substantially cheaper than many of its rivals, even though there are doubts that it is as effective as the drugs developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  , which were approved earlier in the month.
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock, which has been under pressure for most of the time since its drug was approved for emergency use by U.S. regulators, fell another 9.7% in early trading.
Elsewhere, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) stock ground out a new 52-week high, although it wasn't obvious that the announcement of a new $2.5 billion investment in Poland to build electric and hybrid vehicles was responsible for the move.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock rose 11% after analysts at Goldman Sachs reportedly raised their 12-month price target to $70. Even after the opening move, that's some 30% above the current price."

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Big tech bets and cryptocurrencies power 2020's top U.S. funds,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Outsized bets on large U.S. technology companies and emerging cryptocurrencies fueled the year's top-performing U.S. mutual fund and exchange-traded funds as the coronavirus pandemic upended global markets, while funds that bet on oil and gas companies fell nearly 100%, according to data from fund-tracker Morningstar.
The year was a challenge like few others for the $21.3 trillion mutual fund and $4.4 trillion ETF industry. U.S. stocks plunged in March before staging a more than 60% comeback, while bond yields hung near record lows for much of the year after unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to backstop the financial markets and keep interest rates low. 
Overall, those who played risk assets were rewarded. The year's best fund, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which holds ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, soared 333.7% for the year through Dec. 9, according to Morningstar. 
The fund's gains came during a retail-investor led rally in cryptocurrencies that pushed total assets invested in crypto funds to a record $15 billion, up from $2.57 billion at the end of 2019, according to digital asset manager CoinShares.
Tech was another clear winner from the pandemic as people moved from offices to work-from-home and conducted business by video call while ordering goods online. The Bank of Montreal MicroSectors FANG+ 3X Leveraged ETN and the Bank of Montreal MicroSectors FANG+ 2X Leveraged ETN - both of which use leverage to invest in so-called FANG technology stocks such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) - posted returns of 301.9% and 201.9% respectively, making them the second- and third-best performing funds for the year through Dec. 9. 
Among actively managed funds that do not use leverage, the ARK Innovation ETF posted the best overall returns with a gain of 143.8%, followed by a 141.4% gain in the American Beacon ARK Transformational Innovation fund and a 139.7% gain in the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Institutional Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) fund. 
Nearly all of the top 10 performing U.S. stock funds run concentrated portfolios that hold less than 50 stocks and in some cases have more than 10% of their assets in the shares of a single company, according to Morningstar. 
Those big bets helped pay off during a broad market rally that has pushed several asset classes near all-time highs and brought the S&P 500 up more than 65% since the lows it hit in mid-March when much of the U.S. economy shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
""When fund management swings for the fences with big bets on a handful of growth names they will hit home runs, but they might also strike out,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. 
The worst-performing funds, meanwhile, were those that took a long bet on oil and gas stocks which plummeted this year from a collapse in demand which briefly turned oil futures negative in April for the first time in history. 
The Direxion Daily S&P Oil&Gas E&P 2X ETF fell 97.3% for the year, followed by the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bear 2X ETF, which tumbled 95.5% for the year. 
Among actively managed equity funds, the Highland Small Cap Equity fund posted the year's worst return with a 51.1% decline. 
The year's top-performing intermediate core bond fund, meanwhile, was the American Funds Strategic Bond fund with a 17.7% gain. The fund has roughly 43% of its portfolio in Treasuries, double the weight if its benchmark index, according to Morningstar. Its performance was roughly 18 percentage points ahead of the year's worst performer in the category, the Putnam Mortgage Securities A fund, which has roughly half of its portfolio in cash and less than 1% of its assets in Treasuries.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Stock-picking hedge funds land investors double-digit gains in 2020,"By Maiya Keidan
(Reuters) - The average hedge fund underperformed the wider stock market in 2020 but saw less volatility while stock-picking funds got a lift from technology and stay-at-home shares in a year beset by a pandemic and uncertainty around the U.S. election. 
Hedge funds, which aim to protect assets in market downturns and have faced criticism for many years for high fees and lacklustre returns, in 2020 showed a divergence in performance.
The average hedge fund made 7.3% in the first 11 months of the year. That underperformed an index tracking the S&P 500, which would have made 14% over the same time frame, according to data from Hedge Fund Research (HFR).
Investors said the performance was still solid given that many of the hedge funds in their portfolios had produced double-digit returns or otherwise preserved assets during the March rut when fears about coronavirus wiped $5 trillion from U.S. stocks.
""Hedge funds broadly managed the year up to March really well - certainly much better than 2008 as a comparison - and they have ended in positive territory,"" said Robert Sears, chief investment officer at Capital Generation Partners.
The standouts were long-short hedge funds, which proved to have the top-performing strategy. So-called 'long-short' hedge funds, which take bets on stocks rising and falling, raked in gains of 12% over the period, according to recent data from HFR. While that underperformed the broader market, a number of individual firms blasted past that number with high returns. 
    “On average, hedge funds have done quite well,"" said Cedric Fontanille, director and head of investment mandates at investment manager Unigestion. ""Long-short equity benefited from the strong momentum of their tech exposure. They had quite a bit at the beginning of the year and maintained it.""
Many hedge funds were heavily invested in stocks that benefited from consumers and workers staying at home during the pandemic, including  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
UK-based Marshall Wace was among the hedge funds to hold a position in Zoom, U.S. filings compiled by Symmetric.io showed. It made 9.4% in its $20 billion strategy for the year to start of December, said a source with knowledge of the firm.
Among the long-short hedge funds to generate double-digit returns were RiverPark Advisors' $391 million fund, which gained 41.2% through Oct. 31 while Wellington Management's $1.37 billion financials-focused fund gained 21.2% to Nov. 30, according to data gathered by HSBC and seen by Reuters. 
Britain's Odey Asset Management made 37.3% through Nov. 30 in its long-short fund managed by James Hanbury while Sandler Capital Management's $2 billion equities fund made 10.8% between the start of the year and Dec. 4, sources close to the firms told Reuters.
Hedge fund peers that bet on mergers and acquisitions made 5.4% over the same period while strategies that invest based on macroeconomic trends made 1.4%, the data showed.
While macro hedge funds generated lower gains on average, according to the HFR data, investors said the strategies in their portfolios had outperformed the market.
""A lot of the old guard performers did well again and most macro managers have ended with a good year,"" said Sears at Capital Generation Partners.
""Even the ones that didn't do quite so well earlier in the year have done well in the later year rally.""
Billionaire Alan Howard’s hedge fund firm made 24% in 2020 to Nov 30 in its $4.3 billion macro master strategy, a source close to the firm told Reuters.
Paul Tudor Jones's macro Global Fund made 11.9% through Nov. 30, the HSBC data showed. 
All of the hedge funds declined to comment on their performance or did not respond to requests for comment.

1264,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Europe Urged to Keep Firebreaks Banks Blame for Blocking Mergers,"(Bloomberg) -- A European Central Bank push to make it easier for the region’s chronically unprofitable banks to merge is facing opposition from some national regulators, with one top official warning it could backfire and damage the integration of the financial system.
Proposals by ECB supervisory board chair Andrea Enria to give banks more freedom to source funds in one country and lend them in another could generate costs for taxpayers if lenders run into trouble after the money moves, said Tom Dechaene, a director at Belgium’s central bank.
“Banking union is essential, but we can’t put the cart before the horse,” Dechaene, who is also a member of Enria’s supervisory board, said in an interview last week. “Many of the proposals floated especially by bank CEOs would do that.”
The comments underscore the divisions within the ECB on the question of whether and how the regulator should facilitate banking consolidation as the industry struggles to earn a profit. Bankers say national rules fortified after the financial crisis to limit the movement of funds across borders are making deals unfeasible, but politicians are still locked in a stalemate over key issues such as a common deposit insurance that are needed for a banking union.
“We have to distinguish between normal times when cooperation works well and the question of what happens in crises,” said Dechaene, who used to advise companies on deals at Morgan Grenfell, the U.K. merchant bank acquired by Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) in 1990. “The reality is that when things go badly, it’s each country for itself.”
European regulators are still scarred by the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks sought to withdraw money from foreign subsidiaries to shore up their operations at home. Banking supervision has improved since the ECB took on direct oversight of big lenders in 2014, but Europe’s financial architecture still isn’t complete, said Dechaene.
If the ECB now allows lenders to move liquid funds freely, it will expose countries to the risk that banks move the cash and leave national deposit insurance systems to pick up the tab in a crisis, said Dechaene. That “put option” is especially valuable to lenders with investment banking activities at the parent level, he said.
While Dechaene didn’t name any banks, firms such as France’s BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA and Italy’s UniCredit SpA already have large foreign units and run sizable investment banking operations. BNP has a big business in Belgium, and UniCredit runs one of Germany’s largest lenders.
Local requirements trap about 200 billion euros ($244 billion) of high-quality liquidity in subsidiaries of big banks, Enria said in a blog post in October titled “Fostering the cross-border integration of banking groups in the banking union.”
“It’s not a supervisor’s business to foster deals,” said Dechaene. He also pushed back against a suggestion by Enria that national regulators could be assuaged if banks pledge to assist foreign units should their health deteriorate.
Bankers could delay their duties in a crisis while shareholders might also sue to protect the interests of the parent company, he said.
“Things move fast in banking and a delay of a few days or weeks could be catastrophic for a subsidiary,” said Dechaene.
Europe needs to make progress on joint guarantees for deposits as well as ensuring banks’ national units have sufficient loss-absorbing debt before watchdogs can lift restrictions on moving liquidity, he said. Still, banks should focus on improving their digital technology rather than simply bulking up, said Dechaene.
“If you set aside the consultants and M&A bankers, most people would say that the scale benefits dwindle at some point,” he said. “Investment bankers are the last constituency I am worried about.”

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>",Trump administration bolsters order barring U.S. investment in Chinese firms,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration on Monday strengthened an executive order barring U.S. investors from buying securities of alleged Chinese military-controlled companies, following disagreement among U.S. agencies about how tough to make the directive.
The Treasury Department published guidance clarifying that the executive order, released in November, would apply to investors in exchange-traded funds and index funds as well as subsidiaries of Chinese companies designated as owned or controlled by the Chinese military. 
The ""frequently asked questions"" release, posted on the Treasury website on Monday, came after Reuters and other news outlets reported that a debate was raging within the Trump administration over the guidance. The State Department and the Department of Defense had pushed back against a bid by Treasury Department to water down the executive order, a source said. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the announcement ""ensures U.S. capital does not contribute to the development and modernization of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) military, intelligence, and security services.""
""This should allay concerns that U.S. investors might unknowingly support (Chinese military-controlled companies) via direct, indirect, or other passive investments,"" he added.
The Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that China is firmly opposed to the ""smearing of China's military-civilian integration strategy.""
""Politicizing economy and trade, abusing the power of the state, stretching the concept of national security, such actions go against the principles of market competition and international trade that the United States has always prided itself with,"" the foreign ministry's spokesperson's office told Reuters.
Specifically, some media outlets reported that Treasury was seeking to exclude Chinese companies' subsidiaries from the scope of the White House directive, which bars new purchases of securities of 35 Chinese companies that Washington alleges are backed by the Chinese military, starting in November 2021. 
The guidance released on Monday specifies that the prohibitions apply to ""any subsidiary of a Communist Chinese military company, after such subsidiary is publicly listed by Treasury."" It added that the agency ""intends to list"" publicly traded entities that are 50% or more owned by a Chinese military company or controlled by one.
""Treasury's published FAQ represents a clear victory for the U.S. security community in its determined effort to preserve strong capital markets sanctions associated with [the executive order] — the first of their kind,” said Roger Robinson, a former White House official who supports curbing Chinese access to U.S. investors. 
The November executive order sought to give teeth to a 1999 law that mandated that the Department of Defense compile a list of Chinese military companies. The Pentagon, which only complied with the mandate this year, has so far designated 35 companies, including oil company CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd and China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. 

Since the November order, index providers have already begun shedding some of the designated companies from their indexes.

(Reuters) -European stocks extended their year-end rally on Tuesday as a Brexit trade deal, hopes of an expanded U.S. stimulus package and euro zone's marathon COVID-19 vaccination campaign brightened prospects for global growth in 2021. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.2%, rising for a fifth straight session and scaling a new 10-month high. 
UK stocks outperformed, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 jumping 2.6% in its first day of trading after the sealing of a Brexit trade agreement between Britain and the European Union on Thursday.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) rose 4.7% on news that the British government is expected to approve COVID-19 vaccine shots for emergency use within a few days. UK market gains were largely broad based.
The pound firmed slightly, with investors worried that the bare-bones nature of the deal leaves Britain far more detached from the EU than was thought likely in 2016.
The German DAX rose 0.5% and extended a record run after Wall Street rallied to all-time highs on hopes that a long-awaited U.S. pandemic relief package would be expanded. The U.S. House of Representatives voted to meet President Donald Trump's demand for $2,000 COVID-19 relief checks on Monday, sending the measure onto the Republican-controlled Senate. ""This is but a resumption of the pandemic bull market, where cheer is stimulated by policy stimulus,"" Mizuho analysts wrote in a note. 
Software group SAP rose 2.2% to provide the biggest boost to the DAX after its unit, Qualtrics International Inc, filed for a U.S. initial public offering.
Travel and leisure stocks rose the most among sectors, with TUI AG, Lufthansa and British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) rising between 3.3% and 10.4%.

The EU vaccination drive kicked off at the weekend, with health workers and residents of care homes across the bloc among the first to get the shots from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)

Instead of a raise in base salary, each unionised worker would receive a one-time bonus of 150% of their monthly base pay, as well as an incentive worth 1.20 million won ($1,095) and a gift card worth 1.30 million won, the official said. 
Kia also offered to restore a 25-minute overtime pay system which was scrapped in 2017, but it rejected proposals to raise the retirement age by five years to 65. 
Union members had voted in favour of the preliminary labour deal, the union official told Reuters. The vote came after union negotiators reached a tentative agreement with Kia Motors last week. 
The union said in a statement that about 58.6% of members approved the salary agreement, while about 42.3% rejected the terms. 
The two sides have had 16 rounds of negotiations since August and workers have staged several partial strikes since Nov. 25, costing the automaker about 30,000 vehicles in lost production, according to analysts' estimates. 
In September, Kia's bigger affiliate Hyundai Motor Co and its South Korean union approved a tentative wage deal, marking a second consecutive year without a strike.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Tech's reign over U.S. stock market to be tested in 2021,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are weighing how big to go on U.S. technology stocks in the coming year, as pricier valuations, regulatory risks and a revival of the market’s beaten-down names threaten to dim their allure. 
A surge in technology and internet-related shares helped lift U.S. indexes to record highs this year. Gains in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) alone accounted for more than half of the S&P 500’s 16.6% total return as of Dec. 16, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
Tech took a back seat in recent weeks, as hopes of a vaccine-led economic recovery fueled a rally in energy, financials, small caps and other less-loved parts of the market. The Russell 1000 value index climbed 10% since breakthrough vaccine data was announced in early November, compared to a 4% gain in the Russell growth index, which is broadly populated by tech stocks.
Though it is unclear how long the change in market leadership will last, the shift highlights a dilemma that has confronted investors throughout the last decade. Limiting tech exposure has mostly been a losing bet for years and the coronavirus pandemic accelerated trends that stand to benefit the group.
But valuations near 16-year highs are raising concerns about the sector's vulnerability, especially if a U.S. economic reopening creates a sustainable trade in value stocks.
""I think that people are going to stick with their tech exposure but I don’t think there is going to be a lot of fresh money put into tech in the new year,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.
The technology sector along with shares of big tech-related companies -- Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- account for about 37% of the market-cap weighted S&P 500, giving them outsized influence on the index's gyrations and investors' portfolios. Fund managers polled by BofA Global Research named ""long tech"" as the market's most crowded trade for the eighth straight month. 
And while tech, which trades at 26 times forward earnings estimates, is one of the few sectors expected to post profit growth in 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, earnings are projected to grow by 14.2% next year, slower than the 23.2% clip seen for S&P 500 companies overall on a potential bounce in growth.
“We continue to believe that this value rotation we started to see over the last few weeks does have legs into 2021 as well,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
Efforts by U.S. and European regulators to curtail the market dominance of companies such as Alphabet and Facebook are another pressure point for the industry. 
But plenty of investors are happy to retain holdings in businesses that have proven durable amid slow economic growth, trade conflicts and the global pandemic. Indeed, spikes in uncertainty have tended to send investors into tech stocks in recent months. 
""There are very few sectors where you can get as predictable ... growth as you can from technology,"" said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer of the Adams Funds, whose diversified equity fund's top holdings are Microsoft, Apple and Amazon.
Assets in the Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, this month hit their highest amount on record, Lipper data showed.
Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, expects the economy to return to slower growth rates after recovering in 2021.
""That suggests you want to own companies (that have) high organic growth rates and can compound cash flow better than others,"" Arone said. 
Even some strategists who like other stocks aren't straying far from tech. BMO Capital Markets cut tech to ""market weight"" for 2021 but urged investors to maintain positions rather than sell. 

""I don’t think we are just going to move away from tech,"" said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. ""These businesses have become integral parts of our lives.""

The plan to restrict British shareholders was approved by the airline last year, subject to the terms of a final agreement on Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, which was agreed last week. 
""Restricted Share Notices will be issued to the registered holder(s) of each Restricted Share in due course, specifying that the holder(s) of such shares shall not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company,"" Ryanair said in a statement. 
""These resolutions will remain in place until the Board of the Company determines that the ownership and control of the Company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the Company's subsidiaries,"" the statement said. 
UK nationals, like all other non-EU nationals, will not be permitted to acquire ordinary shares, the statement said. 
Ryanair last February said that while the airline was 55% EU-owned, Britain-based shareholders at the time controlled around 20% of its stock. 

Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said at the time he expected half of those to re-domicile to the EU if Britain chose to make a sharp break with the EU.

1272,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 01:54AM ET</span>",Brexit Deal Offers Scant Solace to City of London Under Threat,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade deal that both sides of the English Channel say reflects a new era of cooperation is essentially a sideshow for the City of London, which is still awaiting its own seal of approval from the European Union.
EU officials must rule separately that British financial regulations and oversight are strong enough to create a level playing field. Without that, a steady leakage of business -- already underway in some areas -- may become a daily reality for the U.K.’s finance industry.
Boris Johnson has already said in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph that, when it comes to financial services, the treaty “perhaps does not go as far as we would like.” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said that discussions with Brussels over access for financial services will continue.
While there’s been progress in preventing Brexit from upending financial markets in the short term, there’s little consensus on the ultimate nature of the U.K. finance industry’s relationship with the EU, just days before it loses much of its longstanding access to the bloc.
“The dangerous bit is that you are seeing people moving assets, moving trading books to other locations,” Howard Davies, chairman of NatWest Group Plc, said in a Bloomberg Television interview this month. “The risk is that as that happens, then the staff follow over time.”
The hope among British bankers, regulators and politicians is that the trade deal helps unlock a separate agreement for finance. The industry is a key pillar of the U.K. economy, employing more than 1 million people and accounting for more than a tenth of all tax revenue.
‘Clear-Eyed’
“While a deal is welcome, financial and related professional services are clear-eyed about the need for both sides to continue to develop the relationship in services,” said Miles Celic, chief executive officer of TheCityUK, representing Britain’s finance hub.
Likewise, bankers in Europe are eager for clarity. The Association for Financial Markets in Europe, one of the region’s biggest industry lobby groups, called for an agreement on “equivalence” decisions which would smooth cross-border financial market access.
“We hope that this lays the foundation for further cooperation on financial services,” said Adam Farkas, AFME’s CEO. “It is important that the EU and the U.K. now urgently put in place outstanding equivalence decisions to mitigate disruption at the end of the transition period and ensure a smooth adaptation to the new relationship.”
Still, even the most optimistic financiers concede that the status quo, with London as the financial hub for an entire continent, is unlikely to hold.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has vowed “all will change” in the City of London’s relationship with the EU. And in a sign of what’s to come, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau warned Europe’s banks in October to prepare for a longer term shift away from using London clearinghouses, which underpin the multi-trillion dollar derivatives markets.
‘Fundamental Question’
It goes “back to this core and fundamental question of where Europe wants to have its center of financial activity,” Mairead McGuinness, European commissioner for financial services, told Euronews in December. “It certainly will not, in the long term, continue to be the City of London.”
With Britain suffering its worst recession in more than three centuries, it can ill afford damage to the finance sector that paid about 75 billion pounds ($100 billion) in tax in 2018.
Despite that, financial services garnered little of the attention bestowed on fishing in the trade talks, even though every fisherman in the U.K. could fit in the City of London’s latest office tower.
“Nothing against fishermen, and I eat a lot of fish, but nonetheless the financial sector is a larger share of the economy than the fishing sector and yet we hear nothing,” Davies said in an October interview.
Companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have recently started to shift more business to the bloc. The moves, which for JPMorgan included 200 billion euros ($230 billion) in assets and 200 staff, are just the “first wave”, Dorothee Blessing, the head of the firm’s Frankfurt unit, said in September.
Non-German lenders are in the process of moving 397 billion euros of holdings to Germany, taking their combined balance sheet there to 675 billion euros at the end of the year, the Bundesbank said in a presentation to reporters at the start of November. The European Central Bank has said banks have agreed to ultimately move a total of 1.3 trillion euros of assets to the euro area.
Elsewhere, more than half of stock trading in London is in shares of European companies and may migrate to EU venues. Last month, The 300-year-old  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc joined other trading venues in opening a platform in the EU because of the absence of a deal for finance.
For now, London has hardly been hollowed out and it holds formidable advantages that will take years, if not decades, to erode. Plenty see an opportunity for the City of London, whose global stature is testament to its long history of adaptation.
“London will reinvent itself to remain a hub,” said Ali Jamal, founder of wealth manager Azura, which has an office in Mayfair and manages about $3 billion. “No city in Europe can compete with London on three factors: language, legal system and infrastructure.”
Get Going
Still, it has been hard preparing for a future that is both murky and very complex. The government arranged a webinar for finance firms in October, with a pre-recorded speech and slides on topics such as accounting, emblazoned with the branding “U.K.’s new start, let’s get going,” according to one attendee who asked not to be named. The content was too general to be useful, the person said.
The trade deal offers some certainty to the broader economy, which will indirectly help the banks. “Reaching a trade deal is important for our corporate clients as they will want to avoid the impacts of tariffs on cross border trade in goods,” said James Bardrick, head of the U.K. at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
And the deal may also help unlock what Bardrick and his peers want most: an EU declaration that U.K. regulations are robust, known as equivalence. This ruling would enable business to continue largely as usual -- but it’s in the hands of the EU, which can also withdraw equivalence at short notice.
Over the long haul, much will depend on the course of political horse-trading for finance and what regulators and supervisors expect, according to Citigroup’s Bardrick. “We and the rest of the industry may need to evolve our plans and staffing levels to serve our clients in Europe effectively,” he said.
It’s that lingering uncertainty that is set to define the City of London’s future even as the U.K. begins to negotiate trade accords in earnest.
“Four years ago a nation decided to shoot itself in the foot and see if it could run a race,” said Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of finance consultancy Z/Yen, who was elected sheriff of the City of London in 2019. “Brexit is an unnecessary distraction. Nobody has shown me a single advantage economically in any shape or form.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF)' display unit said on Tuesday it will extend production of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels for TVs and monitors, as more people sought home entertainment during the coronavirus pandemic.
Samsung (KS:005930) Display's decision to extend LCD production in South Korea for an unspecified period of time overrides its announcement in March that it would end all production by the end of the year to focus on more advanced technology.
Samsung Display said the length of the extension would depend on profitability considerations and market conditions. It had said in late October that it was considering a ""short-term"" extension.
Local media outlet IT Chosun reported earlier on Tuesday that production would be extended by a year at the request of Samsung Electronics' set manufacturing division, citing unnamed tech industry sources. 
A spokeswoman for Samsung Display declined to comment on the IT Chosun report.
The stay-at-home trend sparked by the coronavirus pandemic led to a 30% quarter-on-quarter spike in global panel demand in the third quarter of the year amid more TV and notebook demand, according to technology research firm TrendForce.
However, the firm added that the influx of more production capacities from Chinese LCD makers was likely to worsen a supply glut next year. 

Samsung had produced LCD panels in both South Korea and China, but it earlier this year sold a majority stake in its Suzhou LCD production unit to TCL Technology Group Corp's China Star Optoelectronics Technology unit.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with the potential expansion of the latest U.S. stimulus measures continuing to increase investor risk appetites.
The House of Representatives voted to increase the amounts on the stimulus checks to qualified Americans from $600 to $2,000. The Senate will also vote on the increase, with investors watching to see whether it will be passed there as well.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.62% by 10:15 PM ET (3:15 AM GMT), hitting a 29-year high.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.19% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.38%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.91%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.19% while the Shenzhen Component was edged up 0.14%.
Congress' passage of the stimulus measures, and the addition of President Donald Trump’s signature on the $2.3 trillion pandemic bill on Sunday, saw U.S. shares climb to record highs during the previous sessions as investor hopes for an economic recovery increased.
The European Union and the U.K.’s sealing of a post-Brexit trade deal before the Christmas holidays also boosted sentiment.
“With the Brexit deal … and the U.S. stimulus deal now in the rear-view mirror, there is a sense of relief that we have avoided the respective worst-case scenarios,” Axi chief global market strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
Global shares have also hit record levels in December, even as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise globally. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also upgraded its first-quarter U.S. economic growth forecast thanks to the stimulus measures.
“Where we are right now in the equity market is somewhat of a sweet spot. We’ve got stimulus, likely more on the way. You’ve got great comps on earnings going into next year with respect to equities, and you have a pent-up demand situation as the economy both in the U.S. and globally comes out of COVID-19,” Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds president and portfolio manager Michael Cuggino told Bloomberg.
The U.S. will also release pending home sales and goods trade balance data on Wednesday.
However, the fight against COVID-19 continues as two new, more infectious strains of the virus continues to spread. Indonesia has imposed a temporary ban on all foreigners from entering the country, and Taiwan increased the quarantine period for flight crews to seven days.

Alibaba and its three largest rivals -- Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., food delivery giant Meituan and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. -- have shed nearly $200 billion in Hong Kong over the two sessions since Thursday when regulators revealed an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices at Ma’s signature company. That marked the formal start of the Communist Party’s crackdown on not just Alibaba but also, potentially, the wider and increasingly influential tech sphere.
“It is very hard to predict the outcome of the Chinese government’s ongoing investigation into Alibaba and other large consumer internet platforms,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note. He cut his price target on Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares to $285 from $325, citing “uncertainty around government oversight and potential for direct regulatory action in the coming year.”
The company’s American depositary receipts fluctuated before closing Monday largely unchanged, after a historic 13% slide the previous session. Volume surged to several times the 12-month daily average, reflecting doubt over what’s going to happen next. JD.com fell 3.4% and Tencent declined 3.5%. The day’s Hong Kong trading was also fierce: Alibaba fell 8% Monday, shedding $270 billion of value since its October peak, while Tencent and Meituan both tumbled more than 6%.
KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote that this “significant” pullback had created an attractive buying opportunity, adding that it doesn’t anticipate a meaningfully different competitive landscape for the company.
On Sunday, China’s central bank ordered Ma’s other online titan -- Ant Group Co. -- to return to its roots as a payments service and overhaul adjacent businesses from insurance to money management, spurring talk of an eventual breakup.
Once hailed as the standard-bearers of China’s economic and technological ascendancy, Alibaba and its compatriots now face increasing pressure from regulators worried about the speed with which they’re amassing clout in sensitive arenas such as media and education and gaining influence over the daily lives of hundreds of millions. That concern crystallized in November, when regulators torpedoed Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering before unveiling draft rules enshrining sweeping powers to clamp down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from e-commerce to social media.
“The Chinese government is putting more pressure or wants to have more control on the tech firms,” Jackson Wong, asset management director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd., said by phone. “There is still very big selling pressure on firms like Alibaba, Tencent or Meituan. These companies have been growing at a pace deemed by Beijing as too fast and have scales that are too big.”
It’s unclear what concessions regulators may try to wring from Alibaba. Under the existing Antitrust Law -- now undergoing revisions to include the internet industry for the first time -- Beijing can fine violators up to 10% of their revenue. In Alibaba’s case, that could mean a levy of as much as $7.8 billion.
China’s e-commerce leader on Monday raised a proposed stock repurchase program by $4 billion to $10 billion, effective for two years through the end of 2022. But the buyback program was overwhelmed by fears that the steps taken against Ant are just the tip of the iceberg. While the central bank stopped short of calling for a breakup, the financial services giant now needs to present specific measures and a timetable for overhauling its business.

The State Administration for Market Regulation dispatched officials to Alibaba’s Hangzhou headquarters last Thursday and the on-site investigation was completed on the day, according to local news reports. The People’s Daily -- the Communist Party mouthpiece -- ran a commentary over the weekend warning Alibaba’s peers to take the antitrust investigation into Alibaba as a chance to lift their own awareness of fair competition.
Ma, the flamboyant co-founder of Alibaba and Ant, has all but vanished from public view since Ant’s IPO got derailed last month. As of early December, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said.
Ma isn’t on the verge of a personal downfall, those familiar with the situation have said. His very public rebuke is instead a warning Beijing has lost patience with the outsize power of its technology moguls, increasingly perceived as a threat to the political and financial stability President Xi Jinping prizes most.
Investors remain divided over the extent to which Beijing will go after Alibaba and its compatriots as Beijing prepares to roll out the new anti-monopoly regulations. The country’s leaders have said little about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they decided to act now.
Some analysts predict there’s a crackdown coming, but a targeted one. They point to language in the regulations that suggests a heavy focus on online commerce, from forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two” to algorithm-based prices favoring new users. The regulations specifically warn against predatory pricing -- selling below cost -- to weed out rivals.
“As this latest investigation occurs at a time when China is ready to take action against monopolistic practices, we think SAMR might want to use BABA’s case as a precedent to send a message to the rest of the industry that the authority is determined this time to address the” pricing issue, Nomura analysts wrote in a note Monday.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",FAA to reform new airplane safety approvals after 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Monday it would reform how it certifies new airplanes in line with legislation passed by Congress after two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
Lawmakers approved sweeping reforms in legislation signed into law Sunday by U.S. President Donald Trump that boosts FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requires disclosure of critical safety information and provide new whistleblower protections.
The FAA said in a statement it ""will work to implement the changes as directed by Congress. The FAA is committed to continuous advancement of aviation safety and improving our organization, processes, and culture.""
Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said in an opinion piece Monday the law ""will take steps to protect against manufacturers placing undue pressure on employees during the certification process.""
Wicker added the law ""should help restore the safety culture in the FAA.""
An FAA survey released in August found some safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
The FAA lifted the 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX last month. The MAX is set to resume U.S. commercial passenger flights Tuesday, when American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) begins flying the MAX on a Miami to New York flight.
The legislation requires an independent review of Boeing’s safety culture.
Boeing, which faces an ongoing criminal investigation into the MAX, has not commented on the new law.
The FAA must report to Congress on implementation of recommendations issued after the 737 MAX crashes.
""You can't legislate cultural change, but we're darn sure going to try to increase the safety goals,"" Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said in an interview.
The law repeals rules allowing FAA employees to receive bonuses or other financial incentive based on meeting manufacturer-driven certification schedules or quotas.
""We're not going to pay people at the FAA to move planes faster,"" Cantwell said. ""This is about getting safety right.""
The law authorizes civil penalties against aviation manufacturer supervisors who interfere with employees acting on behalf of the FAA, authorizes new resources for FAA to add key technical staff and requires it to review pilot-training.
The United States has not had a fatal U.S. passenger airline crash since February 2009 and only one fatality due to a U.S. passenger airline accident in that period. The FAA credited the decline in fatalities in part ""because the FAA established robust information-sharing programs throughout the aviation industry that encouraged openness.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, with each of Wall Street's main indexes closing at record levels as President Donald Trump's signing of a long-awaited $2.3 trillion pandemic aid bill increased optimism for an economic recovery.
In a sudden reversal late on Sunday, Trump backed down from his threat to block the hard-fought bill, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown.
""It's a positive tone to the U.S. market and part of that is the signing of stimulus package by Trump, which appeared to be in doubt but is finally been accomplished,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""We still have a follow-on to the Christmas rally and the favorable market we've had for a while here,"" he added. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 207.58 points, or 0.69%, to 30,407.45, the S&P 500 gained 32.34 points, or 0.87%, to 3,735.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 94.69 points, or 0.74%, to 12,899.42.
Stocks battered by coronavirus lockdowns, such as airlines and cruise lines, advanced. The S&P 1500 airlines index gained as carriers are set to receive $15 billion in addition payroll assistance under the new government aid.
Cruise operators  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd each rose by at least 3%
On a sector basis, gains were led by communication services, consumer discretionary and tech as each climbed more than 1%. 
After a sharp recovery from a coronavirus crash in March, the S&P 500 is on track to rise more than 15% this year on the back of a loose monetary policy and a COVID-19 vaccine program that has raised hopes the economic environment will improve.
Despite the generally favorable conditions for equities, worries over a resurgence in coronavirus cases, upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia and stretched valuations could become headwinds. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P is currently about 22.2, well above its long-term average of 15.3. 
Trading volumes are expected to be thin in the final week of the year that has historically been a seasonally strong period for equities. 
Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Monday will put to vote a proposal for higher pandemic relief payments for Americans, although it appears unlikely to gain traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Adding to a global appetite for risk, Britain and the European Union clinched a lean post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday, while a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive in Europe was launched over the weekend.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc advanced after a report that the electric-car maker will start operations in India early next year.

Investing.com – The Dow closed at an all-time high on Monday, as President Donald Trump signed off on the $900 billion stimulus bill, averting a government shutdown and giving the economic recovery a much-needed boost.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68%, or 204 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.87%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.74%. All three major averages closed at record highs.
Trump had threatened to delay signing the relief package after demanding that Congress amend the bill to boost direct payments to $2,000 from $600 a week to support unemployed Americans.
""I am signing this bill to restore unemployment benefits, stop evictions, provide rental assistance, add money for PPP, return our airline workers back to work, add substantially more money for vaccine distribution, and much more,"" Trump said.
The House on Monday will vote on a bill to boost direct payments to $2,000, but even if it passes, many expect the proposal will not be successful in the GOP-controlled Senate. 
The stimulus package is expected to cushion the hit to the economic recovery from restrictions across the country amid efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
""And the reason I’m concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year’s, surge, and, as I have described it, as a surge upon a surge, because, if you look at the slope, the incline of cases that we have experienced as we have gone into the late fall and soon-to-be-early winter, it is really quite troubling,"" top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr Anthorny Fauci said Sunday on CNN.
As well as stimulus efforts, progress on further Covid-19 vaccines boosted sentiment on risk assets.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine is expected to get the regulatory nod from UK health authorities later this week, while  Novavax 's (NASDAQ:NVAX) vaccine candidate got late-stage clinical trials underway in the U.S. and Mexico.
Travel-related sectors were boosted by the positive stimulus and vaccine news, with airlines, cruise lines, and casino stocks higher.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rose 2%,  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) was up 3%, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) climbed 4%
Tech also powered ahead as the Fab 5 stocks continued to rack up gains.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded higher,  with the latter up 3%.

U.S. equities followed the example of their European counterparts with a broad rally, and communications services and consumer discretionary stocks were leading the charge.
But crude prices slumped as weak demand and a potential increase in production offset the effects of the fiscal aid package.
President Donald Trump reversed course on Sunday by signing a $2.3 trillion stimulus and spending package into law, heading off a potential government shutdown and setting the stage for congressional Democrats to push for more robust direct payments of $2,000 to millions of Americans.

""If you look to year-end, it will be a fairly light trading week but we seem poised to end the year on a high note.""
While Wall Street still faces some uncertainties, Sandven sees conditions remaining favorable as we enter 2021.
""Medical progress for COVID-19 continues to evolve and that will unfold at a more accelerated rate now as you get into the new year,"" Sandven added. ""And importantly, the macro environment is favorable for stocks.""

(Reuters) - European shares marked their strongest close in 10 months on Monday, with German shares hitting a record high as relief over long-awaited U.S. coronavirus relief, a Brexit trade deal and a vaccine programme lifted spirits in thin holiday trade.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday signed into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and government spending bill, causing some optimism over near-term economic prospects.
The launch of a cross-border European vaccination programme on Sunday also fuelled hopes of a pandemic-free second half in 2021 and of a strong economic rebound.
Britain and the European Union signed a Brexit trade deal late on Thursday, preserving several trade provisions for both sides and limiting the scale of disruption resulting from the divorce.

Automobile makers were among the top boosts to the German index, given that the country is a major supplier of autos to the UK. The striking of a trade deal appeared have cleared several regulatory doubts over the future of the EU-UK auto supply chain.

Huge amounts of stimulus and vaccine optimism have seen the STOXX 600 recover nearly 43% from its March lows, though it is on course to end the year about 4% lower due to a severely damaging second wave of coronavirus infections. 
Among other European bourses, France's CAC 40 index and Spain's IBEX ended 1.2% and 0.5% higher, respectively.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Monday said it was finalizing the first-ever proposed standards regulating greenhouse gas emissions from airplanes.
The EPA said its new requirements for airplanes used in commercial aviation and for large business jets would align the United States with international standards.
In 2016, the U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed on global airplane emissions standards aimed at makers of small and large planes, including Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, which both have backed the standards. 
The final rule ""is vital for protecting the environment and supporting the sustainable growth of commercial aviation and the United States economy,"" Boeing said on Monday in a statement.
Critics say the agency should have required tougher emissions rules.
Environmental Defense Fund international counsel Annie Petsonk said in a statement the EPA's ""do-nothing rule is totally inadequate in light of the climate crisis. It’s incumbent on the incoming Biden-Harris administration to move swiftly to tighten this standard."" 
The EPA said in July the proposed requirements would apply to new-type designs as of January 2020 and to in-production airplanes or those with amended type certificates starting in 2028.
The EPA said Monday it anticipates nearly all affected airplanes to be compliant by the effective dates. The EPA said it expects ""airplanes that are non-compliant will either be modified and re-certificated as compliant, will likely go out of production before the production compliance date of January 1, 2028, or will seek exemptions.""
As a result ""EPA is not projecting emission reductions associated with these GHG (greenhouse gas) regulations."" It also does not project the rule ""will cause manufacturers to make technical improvements to their airplanes that would not have occurred"" otherwise.
In October, a group of 11 states led by California and the District of Columbia urged the EPA to strengthen the first-ever standards.
The 11 states and the District of Columbia said the EPA proposal would ""lag existing technology by more than 10 years and would result in no GHG reductions at all compared to business-as-usual.""
The airplanes covered by the proposed rule accounted for 10% of all U.S. transportation greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of total U.S. emissions. They have been the largest source of transportation greenhouse gas emissions not subject to rules. The new rules do not apply to military airplanes and take effect when formally published in the coming days.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in July the proposal was based on ""where the technology is today ... You can't really set the standard that can't be met.""
The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it expects to publish a proposed rule next year incorporating the EPA's emissions standard, including testing requirements and exemption procedures it will apply when certifying new airplanes.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Swiss hand over remaining $150 million to U.S. from massive Ponzi scheme,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will return $150 million from blocked Swiss bank accounts by the end of the year to the United States to be given to victims of convicted Ponzi scheme con artist Robert Allen Stanford, the Federal Ministry of Justice said on Monday.
Stanford, a former Texas financier known primarily by his middle name, was convicted of fraud by a Houston jury in 2012 in what prosecutors called a $7.2 billion fraud that lasted two decades and which was eclipsed in size only by the Ponzi scheme run by Bernie Madoff. 
About $50 million had previously been returned, the justice ministry said. 
In October, the Swiss criminal court had rejected appeals against the seizure of the assets, paving the way for the remaining $150 million to be returned by the end of December, the ministry said.
Stanford, now serving a 110-year prison term, had stashed millions from his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank at the Swiss arm of French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), which he tapped regularly to fund a fleet of private jets and a 100-foot yacht, according to U.S. District Court filings from 2012.
""The release (of the blocked funds) became possible after the American financier Allen Stanford's fraud conviction became permanent,"" the Swiss justice ministry said in a statement on Monday.
According to a 2012 sentencing memorandum, U.S. federal prosecutors said Stanford was a ""ruthless predator"" who routed $116 million in ... proceeds ""through a Swiss slush fund he controlled at Societe Generale"".
Societe Generale spent years fighting allegations that it had not adequately upheld its anti-money laundering obligations in accepting Stanford's money, Swiss court filings show.

A bank spokesman contacted by Reuters declined to comment on Monday.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Analysis: New direct listings won't spell the death of IPOs,"By Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of capital raisings through direct listings will be seized on by some startups, yet most companies will still opt for initial public offerings (IPOs), capital market insiders say. 
The financial regulator greenlighted the New York Stock Exchange's request last week to allow companies to raise money in stock market debuts through direct listings, without using underwriters as is customary with IPOs.
The move was celebrated by Silicon Valley investors, who complain that investment bankers often do a poor job of assessing demand for their IPOs despite charging hefty fees. They point to the offerings this month of home rental firm Airbnb Inc and food delivery app DoorDash Inc, whose shares rallied 92% and 142%, respectively, on their first day of trading and raised concerns that they left money on the table in their IPOs.
Bankers say the pop is caused by the limited number of shares available for trading after an IPO, creating a large gap between the price Wall Street's elite pay to buy into the offering and what stock market investors pay to purchase the shares once they start trading. 
Direct listings will not pose such a problem, because stock market investors are allowed to buy shares directly issued by the companies on the first day of trading.
""I'm thrilled to see the SEC taking a progressive approach to the topic. Everybody would like to find more equilibrium between the listing price and the price where it trades, and a bit more fairness around lockups,"" said Jeff Richards, a partner at GGV Capital. 
Still, direct listings present a trade-off that will continue to make IPOs attractive to many companies, capital market experts say. While underwriters give companies certainty of how much they will approximately raise ahead of their IPO, companies that pursue capital raises through direct listings will not know how much they have raised until their shares start trading. 
""The SEC move is an added benefit, but I think many companies will still continue to choose an IPO; they will need the underwriters and their introductions to institutional investors,"" said Anna Pinedo, co-head of law firm Mayer Brown's global capital markets practice. 
TWEAKS IN UNDERWRITING
IPOs have been on a tear this year, as companies rode the stock market rally that followed the coronavirus-induced slump. They totaled $220 billion globally, up 25% year-to-date.
Direct listings that do not let companies raise money were already allowed by the SEC, though few companies have opted for them. The most high-profile examples of direct listings this year were those of data analytics company Palantir Technologies and workplace software maker Asana Inc.
One reason many companies may stick with IPOs is that mature private companies tend to generate less buzz among investors than red-hot startups, so their chances of an outsized first-day trading pop are slimmer, capital market experts say.
Companies also like being able to pick their investor base during their underwriting, allocating more shares to long-term investors, such as mutual funds.
""I think the majority of companies will still undergo the traditional IPO process, but with potential innovation in the structure,"" said Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s Neil Kell, chairman of equity capital markets. ""The ability of the management team to choose a specific shareholder base at day one is still invaluable.""
Recent tweaks to the IPO process deployed by companies such as DoorDash involved using a ""hybrid auction"" during the underwriting, in which investors are asked to specify exactly how much they are willing to pay for the stakes they seek. Yet this was not enough to eliminate huge first-day trading pops, often fueled by retail investors trading on apps such as Robinhood.
Another tweak involves the ability of insiders to sell stock. While IPOs typically come with lock-ups preventing existing shareholders from cashing out after the initial stock sale, some companies, such as Airbnb, have negotiated exceptions for their employees. 
""Largely because of the challenge of the direct listing structure, we are seeing real innovations in IPO practice,"" said Greg Rodgers, a capital markets partner at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.
BANKER FEES
A big driver behind the push for direct listings is suspicion among some venture capital investors of investment bankers, whom they view as pushing chummy deals to allocate the most shares in an IPO to their top clients. 
While companies that use direct listings do not have to pay underwriting fees, they still have to turn to investment bankers for advice on how much they could be worth and how to market their offerings. Bankers will also advise on capital raisings as the new direct listings are rolled out. 
While this fee pool will be smaller than in IPOs, it will also be shared by fewer banks, so any one bank could still be paid handsomely for an offering.
For example, music streaming service  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT), which went public in 2019 through a direct listing, spent $35 million on advisory fees to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Allen & Company. 

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also participated in the IPOs of business software firm Snowflake Inc and Airbnb this year, which paid their underwriters $122 million and $74 million, respectively, but had to share these fees with a much bigger group of banks.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened at record highs on Monday after President Donald Trump dropped his objections to signing into law the $900 billion stimulus package passed last week by Congress.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 170 points, or 0.6%, at 30,370 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.7%. 
There remains a slim possibility of the stimulus package being augmented over the next two days. The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is set to vote on a proposal by Trump to increase the direct payments to households foreseen in the bill to $2,000 from $600. The Republican-led Senate, which reconvenes on Tuesday, has so far not endorsed anything higher than what's in the bill. However, some Senators may wish to avoid any negative publicity from blocking the suggestion with barely a week to go until runoffs for two key Senate seats in Georgia, which will determine control of the upper chamber for the next two years.
Airline stocks were among the most visible winners from Trump's change of heart, which unlocked some $15 billion in extra aid for the industry: American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 3.5%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock all rose by between 1.4% and 1.6%.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs shrugged off the latest piece of negative news surrounding the company, rising 0.5% despite the central bank of China ordering big changes to the operating model of its financial services arm Ant Group. Alibaba's ADRs had fallen by over 13% on Thursday after Chinese antitrust regulators launched an investigation into suspected abusive practices by the e-commerce giant.  The People's Bank of China on Monday published a statement on its website that paved the way to curtailing its operations in wealth management and consumer credit and ""rectify"" irregularities in its insurance arm - the three divisions that make most of Ant Group's profit.
Elsewhere, the market shrugged off news from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) that it had completed the acquisition of ShopRunner, a move that should bolster its own Internet presence. FedEx stock was down by 0.4%. 
A more conspicuous underperformer was Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), which fell over 4% to its lowest since early September against a backdrop of expectations that the rollout of vaccines will allow a return to normal life in 2021 and slow, if not reverse, the trend to virtual communications.  Another stock losing its froth was  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which fell 3.7% to a one-month low.  While Moderna's vaccine has now been approved for emergency use in the U.S., its commercial potential may yet be limited by the availability of cheaper alternatives worldwide. U.K. regulators are expected to approve the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine this week, while a vaccine developed by China's Sinopharm is also progressing through the regulatory approvals process worldwide.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","U.S. fliers less familiar with Boeing 737 MAX crashes two years on, but wary when reminded: Reuters/Ipsos poll","By Chris Kahn and Tracy Rucinski
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - With the passage of time, Americans are less familiar with two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes, but if they are made aware of those disasters, more than half say they would probably avoid the aircraft, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. 
The poll results, released on Dec. 28, a day before the 737 MAX resumes commercial flights in the United States, found that 39% of adults were familiar with the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 versus about half in a previous poll.
Of those respondents, 73% correctly identified Boeing as the maker of the aircraft involved in the crashes, down from 82% who said the same in the poll that ran in May 2019.
However, when respondents were told about the aircraft's safety issues 57% said they were not likely to fly in a Boeing 737 MAX, while 37% say they would be likely to fly in it once it has been in the air for six months or more. 
""We continue to work closely with global regulators and our customers to support the safe return of the fleet to service around the world,"" a Boeing spokesman said in response to the poll. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration lifted a 20-month safety ban on Nov. 18 after approving design changes by Boeing to address systems that played a role in both crashes, which killed a total of 346 people. All airlines must complete the mandated safety changes and new pilot training before taking passengers.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is set to relaunch passenger flights on Tuesday between Miami and New York and plans to gradually reintroduce its 737 MAX fleet.
The airline said it would re-book customers who do not feel comfortable about the aircraft.
""No one has to go on the MAX if they don't want to, but if you want to, it's there,"" American's Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said at a 737 MAX media event on Dec. 2.
PANDEMIC TRAVEL
Boeing's 737 MAX is making its comeback at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has thrust the industry into its worst crisis, with airlines parking hundreds of jets as demand hovers around 30% of levels in 2019.
When the 737 MAX was grounded, U.S. airlines had to cancel flights because they lacked the aircraft to meet demand, adding to Boeing's financial liability.
Now airlines are deferring jet deliveries and do not expect a robust rebound until COVID-19 vaccines are widely available.
The poll suggests that airline travel will recover pre-pandemic rates once the health crisis subsides and that travelers still consider ticket prices the most important factor when choosing a flight, followed by airlines' measures to protect them from the spread of the coronavirus. 
When buying a plane ticket, 41% said ticket price was most important and 24% said COVID-19 safety measures such as whether airlines are blocking middle seats.
Only 3% said the aircraft model was most important.
When asked how they planned to travel ""when the coronavirus pandemic ends,"" 10% said they would travel for personal reasons at least once a month by plane and 34% said they would travel at least once a year, similar to their reported travel habits before the pandemic.
The poll showed similar trends for work travel, a driver of airline revenues - 7% said they would fly at least once a month, while 17% said they expected to travel at least a few times per year. 
The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points. 
Of the other U.S. carriers that owned the 737 MAX before its grounding, United Airlines plans to fly the jet again in February and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) - the world's largest 737 MAX operator - in the second quarter of 2021.

Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, Brazil's largest airline, became the first carrier to restart 737 MAX flights this month, followed by Grupo Aeromexico.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>","Delivery Hero gets $4 billion Woowa deal approval, must sell S.Korean unit","By Joyce Lee and Alexander Hübner
SEOUL/MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany's Delivery Hero will sell South Korean food delivery app Yogiyo as part of the conditions for regulatory approval of its $4 billion takeover of top South Korean food delivery app owner Woowa Brothers. 
The sale clears a major hurdle for Delivery Hero in gaining the dominant position in the world's third-largest online food delivery market, as competition heats up amid accelerated demand triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Delivery Hero agreed last year to buy Woowa in a buyout that throws it a lifeline in an intensely competitive market.
Shares in Delivery Hero rose 3.6% after its statement accepting the decision, and adding in a regulatory filing that it expected to close the deal in the first quarter of next year.
""We are deeply saddened by the required condition to divest Delivery Hero's subsidiary,"" Chief Executive and co-founder Niklas Östberg said in the statement, while welcoming the regulatory approval. 
""We... will work hard to ensure that this transition is as smooth as possible for all impacted employees."" 
On Monday, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) had said it would approve the takeover on condition that Delivery Hero sold its entire stake in No. 2 food delivery app Yogiyo within six months, with the possibility of an extension. 
The sale would ease concerns that diners would end up paying more under the current deal, while allowing the synergy that Delivery Hero cited as the reason for the acquisition, said KFTC chief Joh Sung-wook.
""Delivery Hero said the purpose of this deal is to combine its logistics technology and Woowa's marketing ability, and I think this is sufficiently possible,"" she told a briefing. 
KFTC said the combined market share of the entity resulting from the takeover, if the unit was not sold, would have been 97% of food delivery transactions by July.
Even without Yogiyo, Woowa's No.1 app had about 15.8 million monthly active users by November, or 82% of all food delivery apps' monthly active users in South Korea, says mobile big data platform IGAWorks. 
South Korea ranks third in the food delivery market after China and the United States, Euromonitor data showed, and is expected to grow 40% this year to about $15.4 billion. 
Highlighting the growing market competition is the rapid spread in the Seoul region of Coupang Eats, a rival service by SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Coupang launched in April 2019.
In November it ranked third in terms of monthly active users after Woowa's app and Yogiyo, according to IGAWorks. 

Seoul analysts declined to comment on Yogiyo's exact valuation, but estimated it in the billions of dollars, adding that there may be few domestic potential buyers with pockets deep enough and willing to take on the market's No. 1 player.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Big tech bets and cryptocurrencies power 2020's top U.S. funds,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Outsized bets on large U.S. technology companies and emerging cryptocurrencies fueled the year's top-performing U.S. mutual fund and exchange-traded funds as the coronavirus pandemic upended global markets, while funds that bet on oil and gas companies fell nearly 100%, according to data from fund-tracker Morningstar.
The year was a challenge like few others for the $21.3 trillion mutual fund and $4.4 trillion ETF industry. U.S. stocks plunged in March before staging a more than 60% comeback, while bond yields hung near record lows for much of the year after unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to backstop the financial markets and keep interest rates low. 
Overall, those who played risk assets were rewarded. The year's best fund, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, which holds ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, soared 333.7% for the year through Dec. 9, according to Morningstar. 
The fund's gains came during a retail-investor led rally in cryptocurrencies that pushed total assets invested in crypto funds to a record $15 billion, up from $2.57 billion at the end of 2019, according to digital asset manager CoinShares.
Tech was another clear winner from the pandemic as people moved from offices to work-from-home and conducted business by video call while ordering goods online. The Bank of Montreal MicroSectors FANG+ 3X Leveraged ETN and the Bank of Montreal MicroSectors FANG+ 2X Leveraged ETN - both of which use leverage to invest in so-called FANG technology stocks such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) - posted returns of 301.9% and 201.9% respectively, making them the second- and third-best performing funds for the year through Dec. 9. 
Among actively managed funds that do not use leverage, the ARK Innovation ETF posted the best overall returns with a gain of 143.8%, followed by a 141.4% gain in the American Beacon ARK Transformational Innovation fund and a 139.7% gain in the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Institutional Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) fund. 
Nearly all of the top 10 performing U.S. stock funds run concentrated portfolios that hold less than 50 stocks and in some cases have more than 10% of their assets in the shares of a single company, according to Morningstar. 
Those big bets helped pay off during a broad market rally that has pushed several asset classes near all-time highs and brought the S&P 500 up more than 65% since the lows it hit in mid-March when much of the U.S. economy shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
""When fund management swings for the fences with big bets on a handful of growth names they will hit home runs, but they might also strike out,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. 
The worst-performing funds, meanwhile, were those that took a long bet on oil and gas stocks which plummeted this year from a collapse in demand which briefly turned oil futures negative in April for the first time in history. 
The Direxion Daily S&P Oil&Gas E&P 2X ETF fell 97.3% for the year, followed by the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bear 2X ETF, which tumbled 95.5% for the year. 
Among actively managed equity funds, the Highland Small Cap Equity fund posted the year's worst return with a 51.1% decline. 
The year's top-performing intermediate core bond fund, meanwhile, was the American Funds Strategic Bond fund with a 17.7% gain. The fund has roughly 43% of its portfolio in Treasuries, double the weight if its benchmark index, according to Morningstar. Its performance was roughly 18 percentage points ahead of the year's worst performer in the category, the Putnam Mortgage Securities A fund, which has roughly half of its portfolio in cash and less than 1% of its assets in Treasuries.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",SABIC seeks Clariant chairman's ouster in post-Christmas coup,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Clariant's biggest shareholder, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, on Monday re-ignited a battle over the Swiss chemicals maker's future by seeking a 12-year board member term limit that would force Chairman Hariolf Kottmann's ouster.
SABIC, which owns 31.5% of Clariant, asked for the new term limit, including for the chairperson, to be added to the agenda of the annual general meeting of shareholders scheduled for April 7. 
Aramco-controlled SABIC also proposed a special dividend distribution of 2 Swiss francs per share, Clariant said in a statement, which would total roughly 670 million francs ($753 million). 
That could drain the company's coffers that new CEO Conrad Keijzer might otherwise use to bulk up via acquisitions that he has said are a priority. 
Kottmann, who became CEO and joined Clariant's board in 2008, has been at odds with SABIC since a proposed joint venture between the two companies collapsed in 2019 over disagreements over the price of the Saudi Arabian company's assets. 
The sudden departure of Ernesto Ochiello, a longtime SABIC executive who quit as Clariant CEO in July 2019 after less than a year in the job, further signalled differences between Kottmann and his top shareholder. 
Ochiello returned to SABIC after leaving Clariant.
A Clariant spokesman said the Swiss company and SABIC continued to have a ""professional relationship"", and the Saudi company remained an important customer. 
He said Clariant's board would discuss SABIC's proposals at an upcoming meeting.
Clariant, which is selling its pigments unit and cutting 1,000 jobs amid plans to dispose of divisions that make up two-thirds of annual sales, confirmed adoption of the term limits at the shareholders meeting would force Kottmann out, though other board members have several years before they would be affected.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Alibaba's $10 billion buyback plan fails to halt stock slide as regulatory concerns mount,"By Yilei Sun and Julie Zhu
BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares slumped 9% to their lowest since June on Monday, as the firm's upsized $10 billion buyback programme failed to ease concerns about a regulatory crackdown on co-founder Jack Ma's e-commerce and financial empire.
A sharp sell-off over two sessions has knocked almost $116 billion off the tech giant's Hong Kong-listed shares.
The downward spiral intensified when Chinese regulators announced on Thursday the launch of an antitrust investigation into Alibaba and said they would summon its Ant Group affiliate to meet. Alibaba's U.S. shares sank more than 15% during the day.
""The antitrust investigation into Alibaba has yet to specify the penalties, which is worrying investors a lot,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer of Beijing Yunyi Asset, adding a probe outcome could ""greatly change"" the company valuations.
Putting investors more on edge was news over the weekend that China's central bank had asked Ant to shake up its lending and other consumer finance operations.
These developments are part of a crackdown on monopolistic behaviour in China's booming internet space in general, but Ma's business empire in particular after he publicly criticized the regulatory system for stifling innovation.
Last month, Chinese regulators abruptly suspended Ant's blockbuster $37 billion initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which was on track to be the world's largest, just two days before its planned debut.
""The new regulations are hurting big internet platforms, so you see Tencent and other tech companies are also seeing their share prices going down,"" said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based tech analyst. 
""Alibaba now is the target of the regulators so the reaction is stronger.""
Regulators have warned Alibaba about the so-called ""choosing one from two"" practice under which merchants are forced to sign exclusive cooperation pacts preventing them from offering products on rival platforms.
The State Administration for Market Regulation said on Thursday that it had launched a probe into the practice.
The gloom due to the regulatory crackdown overshadowed Alibaba's decision, announced on Sunday, to raise its share repurchase programme to $10 billion from $6 billion, effective for a two-year period through the end of 2022.
Alibaba shares could trade lower in the near term due to the ""regulatory overhang"", Nomura said in a note on Monday.
But the cheaper value will be attractive for long-term investors, Nomura added as it kept a ""buy"" rating on Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock and retained a target price of $361. The stock closed at $222 on Thursday.

The announcement came more than a month after Chinese regulators abruptly suspended Ant's blockbuster $37 billion initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and only days after the country's antitrust authorities said they had launched a probe into Ma's e-commerce conglomerate  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
Chinese regulators and Communist Party officials have set about reining in Ma's sprawling financial empire after he publicly criticized the country's regulatory system in October for stifling innovation.
Regulators have urged Ant to rectify financial regulatory violations, including in its credit, insurance and wealth management businesses, and overhaul its credit rating business to protect personal information, People's Bank of China (PBOC) Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng said on Sunday.
Pan's comments stopped short of calling for a breakup of Ant, yet pointed to a significant operational restructuring. Ant should set up a separate holding company to ensure capital adequacy and regulatory compliance, Pan said.
Ant should also be fully licensed to operate its personal credit business, and be more transparent about its third-party payment transactions and not engage in unfair competition, Pan added.
Ant said in a statement it would establish a ""rectification"" working group and fully implement regulatory requirements.
Ma was advised by the Chinese government to stay in the country, Bloomberg News has reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Ma could not be reached for comment. 
Pan said Ant representatives met on Saturday with officials from the PBOC and other Chinese banking, securities and foreign exchange regulators.
During the meeting, regulators pointed out Ant's issues including its poor corporate governance, defiance of regulatory demands, illegal regulatory arbitrage, the use of its market advantage to squeeze out competitors, and harming consumers' legal interests, according to Pan.
Ant traces its beginnings to Alipay, which was launched in 2004 as a payment service, and is 33% owned by Alibaba. Its Alipay app dominates digital payments in China, with more than 730 million monthly users. The Hangzhou-based company also built an empire connecting China's borrowers and lenders, securing short-term loans within minutes. It was poised to be valued at more than $300 billion in its stock market debut.
Last month, China issued draft rules aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet firms, and the Politburo this month vowed to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts in 2021 and rein in ""disorderly capital expansion.""
China also warned internet giants this month to brace for increased scrutiny, as it slapped fines and announced probes into mergers involving Alibaba and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Monday morning after U.S. President Donald Trump added his signature to the latest stimulus measures.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.30% by 10:39 PM ET (3:39 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.43%.
 Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) shares in Hong Kong fell after the Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd ADR (NYSE:BABA) fell 13.34%, the most ever, over concerns about the State Administration for Market Regulation’s investigation into alleged monopolistic practices during the previous week. Alibaba boosted its share buyback program to $10 billion earlier in the day, after affiliate Ant Group Co. was ordered by regulators to return to its roots as a provider of payments services.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.10%
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.59% and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.82%. In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.33%.
After tweeting, “Good news on COVID Relief Bill. Information to follow,” Trump approved a combined $2.3 trillion COVID-19 relief and government funding package. His approval of the package come after its passage in both the House of Representatives and the Senate during the previous week.
Trump’s signature on the bill averted further delays to the latest stimulus measure becoming law, bolstering some of the investor optimism that drove global shares to record levels in December.
The stimulus “could be supportive of the market, supportive of the U.S. economy,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG strategist Suresh Tantia told Bloomberg.
“Next year all the building blocks are there for markets to continue this rally,” Tantia added.
Trump had threatened to withhold his signature earlier as he demanded that stimulus checks be raised from $600 to $2,000. Congress will vote on the increased amount later in the day.
“It is positive for markets that we no longer have a chaos over stimulus, considering there was a chance of a partial government shutdown,” Sumimoto Mitsui DS Asset Management chief strategist Masahiro Ichikawa told Reuters.
“But on the other hand, markets have talked about that stimulus for a long time and I would say most of it has been already priced in,” Ichikawa added.
Across the Atlantic, the U.K. and the European Union (EU) also reached a post-Brexit trade deal before the Christmas holidays, just ahead of the year-end deadline.
Despite the optimism, the number of global COVID-19 cases continues to increase, surpassing 80.7 million as of Dec. 28, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More countries have implemented tighter curbs to fight the new, more infectious B.1.1.7 strain of COVID-19, and a second mutant strain of the virus, possibly originating from South Africa, has also been discovered.
Meanwhile, the EU began a continent-wide vaccination campaign less than a week after approving BNT162b2, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy)."

Alibaba’s stock is down roughly 30% from its 2020 peak, battered by deepening scrutiny of the giant Chinese internet sector and alleged monopolistic practices at the crown jewel of billionaire Jack Ma’s internet empire. On Sunday, Chinese regulators ordered Ma’s other online titan, Ant Group Co., to return to its roots as a provider of payments services, threatening to throttle growth in its most lucrative businesses of consumer loans and wealth management.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>",Next up for retailers: A big wave of gift returns,"By Nivedita Balu, Melissa Fares and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As shoppers tuck their final Christmas presents under the tree, U.S. retailers are bracing for a record-setting flood of returns of online gifts bought during the deadly surge in coronavirus cases. 
To make the process more efficient, retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) let shoppers drop unwanted gifts at FedEx (NYSE:FDX) or  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) drop-off sites. 
Others, including Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), are offering curbside returns for the first time as efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 have shuttered stores or reduced the number of customers allowed inside.
Returns are set to swell this year. Shoppers seeking to avoid contagion shifted from stores to online - where return rates are historically higher. Retailers also are under pressure to make the process as seamless as possible for the shoppers they want to retain as longtime customers as well as for UPS and FedEx, which are inundated with packages. 
Even some shopping malls are moving to make returns easier for their tenants. Mall of America and Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) have both partnered with Narvar, a returns management provider, to eliminate the need for shoppers to print return labels for packages they drop off. 
The National Retail Federation expects 2020 holiday sales to jump as much as 5.2% from last year to $766.7 billion. Roughly 13% of merchandise, or about $101 billion worth of goods, sold during the 2020 holiday season will be returned, the trade group said. 
Optoro, which helps retailers sort, resell and dispose of returned merchandise, puts the number even higher. It predicts that 2020 U.S. holiday returns will hit $115 billion between Thanksgiving and end of January. That is up 15% from the 2019 prediction issued by the firm, which counts UPS and home furnishing retailer IKEA among its investors. 
The in-store apparel return rate is 5-8%, while online runs around 30%, said Rob Zomok, president of global operations at Inmar Intelligence, which processes roughly 600 million retail and e-commerce returns annually. 
""That math has created a significant increase in returns,” said Zomok, who added that apparel returns are at a record high. 
""When your shopping is 100% online, you're probably ordering a couple extra (items) with the intent of returning,” said Sriram Sridhar, chief executive of LateShipment.com, which helps clients track packages. 
""We expect every retailer to face around 50% more returns than they have faced in the years past during the holiday season,"" Sridhar said.
What's more, retailers also quarantine or sanitize products after they are returned to ensure they are free from the virus. 
""This is not the typical way returns are processed,"" said Paula Rosenblum, managing partner at retail research firm RSR Research. Kohl’s, which collects Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) returns and sends them in bulk back to e-tailer, has extended its own deadline for premium electronics. 
It joins a swath of retailers, including Walmart, Macy’s and Amazon, who are giving shoppers more time to return purchases - a move that could make it harder to resell seasonal merchandise. Getting those products turned around for resale is vital - particularly for fast-fashion retailers who sell trendy apparel, Inmar's Zomok said.

""The window is going to be short,"" Zomok said.

Shortly after the take-off, the pilots received an ""engine indication"" and ""decided to shut down one engine,"" an Air Canada spokesman said. 
""The aircraft then diverted to Tucson, where it landed normally and remains."" The incident took place on Dec. 22. 
The crew received a left engine hydraulic low pressure indication and declared a PAN PAN emergency before diverting the flight, Belgian aviation news website Aviation24.be https://www.aviation24.be/airlines/air-canada/boeing-737-8-max-suffers-left-hand-engine-failure-on-return-to-service-flight reported.
""Modern aircraft are designed to operate with one engine and our crews train for such operations"", the Air Canada statement added. 
In a response to a Reuters request for comment, a Boeing spokeswoman referred to Air Canada for information on the incident and did not provide any additional comment.
Boeing and operators are bracing for heightened scrutiny as the MAX returns from a 20 month safety grounding, but safety experts say such glitches are common and usually go unnoticed.
The 'MAX was grounded following two crashes linked in part to flawed cockpit software. The engines were not implicated.

The United States lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on the 737 MAX last month, with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration outlining details of the software, system and training upgrades Boeing and airlines must complete before carrying passengers.

The exchange also said it will start new stock indexes in April 2022 when it will reorganise its market structure, now made up of the massive main board and three smaller sections. 
The move came amid criticism that the exchange is allowing many companies with limited growth prospects and weak governance standards to remain listed on the main board, which many argue is holding back gains in the Topix index.
The TSE said it will start reducing the weight of small caps shares in Topix from 2022.
The exchange has said it will re-organise the bourse into three sections - tentatively called prime market, standard market and growth market respectively - in April 2022.
The prime market will have a slightly stricter listing criteria than the current main board but analysts expect a large part of almost 2,200 firms currently listed there will move to the prime market.
The TSE said it plans to introduce new stock indexes and abolish some indexes, including TSE Mothers Index and the second-section index, to reflect the upcoming reclassification.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over a resurgent coronavirus pandemic and upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia are clouding the outlook for what has historically been a seasonally strong period for equities. 
Stocks have tended to perform well in the last five trading days of December, and the first two of January, a phenomenon known as the Santa Claus rally which has lifted equities in 55 out of 74 years since 1945, according to CFRA Research. This year, the period starts on Dec. 24. 
The average Santa Claus rally has boosted the S&P 500 by 1.3% since 1969, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. Overall, a year with a Santa Claus rally is followed by an annual 9.7% average gain in the S&P 500 the following year, compared with a 9% average gain in the S&P 500 in all years, according to CFRA Research. 
But despite the S&P’s rally in the quarter and its year-to-date gain of around 14%, a Santa Claus rally this year is far from a given, investors said. 
Concerns over a new variant of the coronavirus and weak economic readings have weighed on stocks in recent days, with the S&P 500 down 0.7% since hitting record highs on Dec. 17 as some investors lock in gains. 
U.S. consumer confidence dropped for a second straight month in December, data showed on Tuesday, reflecting a coronavirus wave that has spurred renewed business restrictions despite a vaccine rollout.
Just further ahead are a pair of U.S. Senate races on Jan. 5 that could tip control of the chamber to Democrats, potentially opening the way for lawmakers to move ahead on some of President-elect Joe Biden's proposals that investors have viewed as market-unfriendly, including raising taxes and rolling back Trump-era deregulation. 
""The market is on autopilot right now as we head toward the year-end, but in the near-term we are vulnerable as we get closer to Georgia election runoffs,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""If it looks like we will get two Democrats ... could be enough to cause investors to rethink how bullish they want to be."" 
More than 1.1 million Georgians have already cast their ballots for the Jan. 5 contests, a level of participation that is on pace to rival the November presidential contest in which Biden, a Democrat, won the state's 16 Electoral College votes by a razor-thin margin en route to defeating Republican President Donald Trump. 
Should Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff prevail in the runoff, the U.S. Senate will be split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, leaving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote. 
Overall, the broad stock market has been focused on the stimulus deal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/after-months-of-inaction-u-s-congress-approves-892-billion-covid-19-relief-package-idUSKBN28V176 passed by Congress on Monday and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines rather than increasing political risk, said Craig Johnson, technical market strategist at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR). 
""We believe these catalysts have largely been discounted into the market’s record-high rally,"" he said. ""The risk of uncertainty over how quickly they translate into meaningful economic improvement remains uncomfortably high,"" he added, though he maintained a 2021 year-end price target for the S&P 500 of 4,225, roughly 14% above the current price of the index. 
This year's rally in the S&P 500 has pushed its forward price to earnings valuation to 23.1, near its highest level in history on the back of extensive government stimulus programs and unprecedented monetary support from the Federal Reserve. 
Those backstops have left the market priced for perfection, giving it little more room to run without another catalyst, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
""We're a bit overdone for a pullback in the short term and investors are looking ahead to a couple of races that could mean a significant change in personal and corporate tax rates,"" he said. 

If it appears that the Democratic candidates are set to win both of Georgia's Senate seats, ""things could turn really sour even though the long-term outlook looks pretty good,"" Frederick added.

TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management said on Friday it has asked Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp to convene an extraordinary shareholders meeting over the firm's investment strategy, the second call for an EGM in a week by major Toshiba investors.
Farallon, which owns a stake of more than 5% in Toshiba, joins top shareholder Effissimo Capital Management, which has a 9.91% stake, in calling for an emergency meeting.
Farallon said Toshiba should seek shareholder approval over what it said is a change in investment strategies.
Toshiba's recently announced plan to use approximately one trillion yen ($9.66 billion) for large-scale mergers and acquisitions is in marked contrast to the strategy that ""focused on a disciplined capital policy and targeted growth through organic expansion and small-scale, programmatic M&A,"" the fund said in a statement.
It also pointed to Toshiba's poor M&A track record, saying the company has recorded a total of about 1.8 trillion yen ($17.4 billion) of impairment losses in the past 20 years resulting from ""heedless growth investments.""
A Toshiba spokeswoman said the company is aware of the fund's announcement and will make a regulatory filing once it officially receives the request. 
Effissimo's call for an EGM is about launching a team of legal experts to investigate the firm's annual general meeting (AGM), at which it said the voting rights of several shareholders were compromised.
Reuters reported a Japanese government adviser told the Harvard University endowment fund that its vote at Toshiba's AGM could be subject to a regulatory probe should it vote against the firm's management.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",China launches antitrust probe into tech giant Alibaba,"By Julie Zhu, Kane Wu and Cheng Leng
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -China has launched an antitrust investigation into  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and will summon the tech giant's Ant Group affiliate to meet in coming days, regulators said on Thursday, in the latest blow for Jack Ma's e-commerce and fintech empire.
The probe is part of an accelerating crackdown on anticompetitive behaviour in China's booming internet space, and the latest setback for Ma, the 56-year-old former school teacher who founded Alibaba and became China's most famous entrepreneur.
It follows China's dramatic suspension last month of Ant's planned $37 billion initial public offering, which had been on track to be the world's largest, just two days before its shares were due to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
In a strongly worded editorial, the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily said if ""monopoly is tolerated, and companies are allowed to expand in a disorderly and barbarian manner, the industry won't develop in a healthy, and sustainable way.""
Shares in Alibaba fell nearly 9% in Hong Kong, their lowest since July, while rivals Meituan and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com both fell more than 2%.
Alibaba's U.S. stock tumbled 13% in its largest one-day drop since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.
Regulators have warned Alibaba about the so-called ""choosing one from two"" practice under which merchants are required to sign exclusive cooperation pacts preventing them from offering products on rival platforms.
The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Thursday that it had launched a probe into the practice. 
Financial regulators will also meet with Alibaba's Ant Group fintech arm in coming days, according to a separate statement by the People's Bank of China on Thursday, casting another cloud over a potential revival of the share sale.
The meeting would ""guide Ant Group to implement financial supervision, fair competition and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers,"" the statement said. 
Ant said it had received a notice from regulators and would ""comply with all regulatory requirements."" Alibaba said it would cooperate with the investigation and that its operations remained normal.
Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital Group in Hong Kong, an Ant investor, said global markets would watch to see whether the moves were ""politically motivated"" and whether regulators targeted private but not state monopolies.
""It would be a tragedy if the antitrust law should be seen as 'targeting' successful private tech companies only,"" he said.
ONE FROM TWO
Ma has kept out of the public eye since a late October forum in Shanghai where he blasted China's regulatory system, accusing it of stifling innovation in a speech that stung officials and set off a chain of events that led to the shelving of Ant's IPO.
The practice of requiring a merchant to sell exclusively on one platform, which Alibaba had defended in the past, has long been a source of friction.
In a lawsuit last year, home appliance manufacturer Galanz accused Alibaba of penalising it for refusing to stop selling goods on rival platform  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD). The case was resolved. In an ongoing case, JD.com accused Alibaba's Tmall of restricting vendors from trading with it by signing exclusive deals.
BRACE FOR SCRUTINY
After years of largely hands-off treatment of e-commerce, Beijing has made its antitrust intentions clear.
Last month, it issued draft rules aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet firms, and the Politburo this month vowed to strengthen anti-monopoly efforts in 2021 and rein in ""disorderly capital expansion.""
China also warned internet giants this month to brace for increased scrutiny, as it slapped fines and announced probes into mergers involving Alibaba and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).
Liu Xu, a researcher at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University and a long-time advocate for antitrust enforcement, said he expected other tech platforms to face scrutiny.
""Chinese internet firms had enjoyed unprecedented growth with light regulation for years,"" a regulatory source said, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter. 
""The latest regulatory moves against them have sent out a clear message that the golden time for many of them has ended and there's no company in China that can be too big to fail.""

Regulators have also become uncomfortable with parts of Ant's sprawling empire, chiefly its credit business that contributed close to 40% of first-half revenue. Days before Ant's planned listing, regulators told Ma and two top executives that its online lending business would face tighter scrutiny, sources told Reuters.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",EU trade deal brings little progress for UK's giant financial sector,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union cannot decide yet on granting Britain access to the bloc's financial market, even though London and Brussels have agreed a trade deal, a European Commission official said on Thursday.
While the landmark trade deal agreed on Thursday set rules for industries such as fishing and agriculture, it did not cover Britain’s much larger and influential finance sector.
There were hopes the trade deal would pave the way for more access to the EU for Britain's finance industry, but the EU indicated it was in no rush to grant it.
Brussels has only granted financial market access, known as ""equivalence"", for two financial activities from Jan. 1, when Britain will have left the EU's single market.
The Bank of England has said there could be disruption in markets if no further access is allowed.
Just minutes after Britain and the EU hailed their agreement on trade, the bloc's executive said it wanted a ""series of further clarifications"" on how Britain will diverge from EU rules after Dec. 31.
""For these reasons, the Commission cannot finalise its assessment of the UK's equivalence in the 28 areas (under discussion) and thus will not take decisions at this point in time. The assessments will therefore continue,"" the official said.
The City of London finance hub secured no special treatment, leaving it on a par with arch rival New York 3,500 miles away as the EU seeks to reduce reliance on UK financial services.
The trade deal refers to financial services in the same way as the bloc's other trade agreements, the official said.
Both sides will discuss how they can move forward on equivalence, stopping short of any commitment to grant access, Britain said.
The two sides will also aim to agree by March 2021 a memorandum of understanding on regulatory cooperation in financial services. Countries such as Canada and the United States already have such cooperation.
""There's some good language about equivalence for financial services, perhaps not as much as we would have liked, but it is nonetheless going to enable our dynamic City of London get on an prosper, as never before,"" said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Britain was unable to replicate its trade deal with Japan that streamlines financial market access paperwork and avoids heavy conditions on data handling.
""We hope it (the trade deal) can lay the foundations for a collaborative future partnership as independent partners,"" said City of London leader Catherine McGuinness.
Simon Morris, a financial services partner at law firm CMS, said Britain was probably still aiming for a separate agreement covering financial services.
Luxembourg for Finance said the trade deal should make Brussels more amenable to granting equivalence beyond the 18 months for derivatives clearing, and six months for settling Irish securities agreed so far.
Without an extension to derivatives trading, New York is poised to pick up business from London next month.
Britain's finance ministry, which had no immediate comment, has said changes to rules will not lower standards. Banks and trading platforms in Britain have opened hubs in the EU to avoid disruption to customers.

""The City now needs to take its future in its own hands,"" said Daniel Pinto, founder and CEO of Stanhope Capital Group.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 ended higher at the close of a shortened session on Thursday as investors headed into the long Christmas weekend with hopes that an imminent stimulus agreement, a Brexit deal, and the ongoing vaccine rollout will spell brighter days in the coming year.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in positive territory.
For the holiday-shortened week, the S&P 500 edged lower, the Dow eked out a nominal gain and the Nasdaq advanced.
While stocks tend to perform well in the closing days of December, a phenomenon known as the Santa Claus rally, the resurgent pandemic and upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia have clouded the outlook this year.
The U.S. House of Representatives blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to change a $2.3 trillion coronavirus relief and government spending package after Trump insisted on $2,000 direct payments to Americans.
The move cast doubt as to whether the package passed by Congress on Monday would be signed into law and raised the threat of a partial government shutdown.
""If (stimulus) doesn't get passed in some form or another it could mean severe consequences for the unemployed,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 
Britain reached a trade deal with the European Union after months of negotiations, just days before leaving one of the world's largest trading blocs.
""(The Brexit deal) might be acting as a buffer for the market in the sense that it's counteracting the negativity of the stimulus bill being stalled,"" Cardillo added. 
More than one million Americans have now been vaccinated against COVID-19 even as the pandemic continues to rage in the United States and political leaders moved to guard against a more contagious variant of the disease sweeping across Britain.

Ten Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, led by real estate. Energy was the lone loser. 
Shares of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group dropped 13.3% on news that China had launched an investigation into the company as part of its antitrust crackdown.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc said it was moving forward with plans to recall furloughed workers, even as forthcoming payroll protections, part of the stimulus package, was called into doubt. Its shares dipped 1.4%

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Analysis: Brexit trade deal sparks relief but UK market will bear scars,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's trade agreement with the European Union removes a 4-1/2-year old fear of crashing out of the bloc without trading arrangements in place, but it will take UK financial markets years to lose their Brexit-inflicted scars.
The ""no-deal Brexit"" risk has weighed on Britain's growth and investment prospects since June 2016, when citizens voted to sever ties with the country's biggest financial services customer that accounts for $1 trillion of bilateral commerce a year.
So Thursday's deal, seven days before the deadline, is an undoubted relief. Analysts are urging clients to snap up undervalued UK stocks, the worst performing of any major market since 2016 and many say they been buying sterling, which is near 2-1/2-year highs above $1.36..
But those hoping the deal will allow British assets to catch up with high-flying overseas markets may be disappointed.
The bare-bones nature of the deal leaves Britain far more detached from the EU than was thought likely in 2016. Further negotiations are inevitable in 2021 to flesh out the agreement. 
It all means the discount that has dogged UK assets since 2016 will not vanish soon.
""Brexit does mean that the UK will likely lose some of its sheen,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. 
While the news could lend some traction to British markets it would not protect the economy from long-term scarring, inflicted by a combination of Brexit and COVID-19, she said. 
""Being excluded from the world's largest single market area will see jobs, people, and capital flows trickle away from the UK, in search of destinations which instead embrace globalisation,"" Shah added.
Ilustrating the discount, UK stocks have underperformed since 2016 and lagged the global recovery since March that has sent rival indexes to record highs.
GRAPHIC: World stock indexes since Brexit vote - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/ygdvzjjayvw/Pasted%20image%201608813691856.png 
The British currency remains around 20% below its long-term fair value. Few expect it to recover fully in the near term.
The underperformance is largely driven by foreign investors dumping UK assets. Financial data provider eVestment estimates European and U.S.-domiciled investors have pulled more money than they have added into UK stocks almost every quarter between the referendum and the third 2020 quarter. 
And because the size of the UK market has shrunk as a percentage of the global index, to 4% from 10% pre-referendum, foreign investors no longer need to hold as many UK stocks, said Caroline Simmons, CIO, UK, at UBS Global Wealth Management, 
British equities may perform well against a backdrop where other markets look expensive - Simmons says UK shares trade at a 30% discount relative to global markets against a typical 10% discount. 
But she does not expect them to recover fully.
""As for the Brexit discount, I do think some of it goes away but will it completely disappear? The drag on cumulative UK GDP as a result of Brexit is still sizeable,"" she said. 
GRAPHIC: Sterling's Brexit discount - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplqqkevb/brexit%20sterling%20valuations.PNG 
COVID-19 COMPOUNDS BREXIT
As further shadow on the outlook, Britain's economy, already weakened by Brexit uncertainty, has suffered the worst damage of any major country from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the second-quarter of 2020 witnessing the worst recession in 300 years. 
That has forced the government to lift its borrowing to a peacetime record.
Economic recovery is complicated by weak ""bricks-and-mortar"" foreign direct investment. The net value of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the United Kingdom dropped to 49.3 billion pounds in 2018, a quarter of 2016 levels, official data shows.
This year will have seen 30%-45% fewer FDI projects than 2019, consultancy EY estimates, mostly because of the pandemic.
Hinesh Patel, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said the Brexit deal ""could unblock the backlog of international investment that has been waiting for some sort of outcome before institutions begin investing in UK plc once again."" 
Others are less optimistic and say the watered-down ties with Brussels will inflict lasting damage.
""There's a bit of short term versus long term story here,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) head of cross asset strategy Andrew Sheets said, speaking before the deal announcement. 

Removing the no-deal risk will raise average asset prices, Sheets said, but said: ""It doesn't fix the underlying economic challenges...You are facing a negative shock to services which are a large majority of the UK economy.""

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Cybersecurity providers including FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) could not prevent a huge network breach disclosed this month by numerous U.S. agencies and companies, yet their shares are soaring for a second straight week. 
The months-long penetration exposed weaknesses in security tools as well as network management programs, most notably SolarWinds Corp's Orion software widely used to oversee networks.
Recalls and scandals affecting products such as automobiles, food and toys tend to hurt shares across an industry, as investors brace for broad declines in consumer confidence and sales, according to two experts who have studied such scenarios.
But the spillover from the cybersecurity scare has been different. Wall Street is betting that governments and businesses - having invested years in moving to digital infrastructure - will only accelerate purchases of the latest IT tools. 
""What's the alternative?"" said Venkatesh Shankar, marketing professor at Texas A&M University.
Airbag recalls or Listeria outbreaks tend to affect shares within a narrow supply chain, from restaurants and auto dealers down to parts and ingredients suppliers, he said.
But ""the magnitude of this breach is not just within the software industry,"" he said, noting SolarWinds' customers span countless industries.
Kartik Kalaignanam, a University of South Carolina marketing professor, said traders are expecting organizations will bolster their defenses even if it means purchasing services from companies that were hacked.
""Although one could argue each one of them has some sort of flaw in their system, there's a feeling there's going to be more spending happening, and the market will be pushed up overall,"" Kalaignanam said.
A BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares fund of cybersecurity stocks surged nearly 10% last week and rose another 3.5% this week entering Thursday. FireEye rose this week to a 5-year high, Microsoft topped a 90-day peak and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), which said it blocked intrusions related to SolarWinds, jumped to an all-time record.
Mark Cash, who analyzes stocks for research firm Morningstar, said the SolarWinds breach ""will certainly benefit"" security companies. Once called in to repair defenses, they inevitably get a contract to stick around, Cash said.

Shankar and Kalaignanam said they expect industry shares to stay elevated for about six months to a year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce on Thursday tweeted congratulations to her Republican counterpart at the agency Elad Roisman, who would serve as the acting agency head after Jay Clayton announced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-clayton-idUSKBN28X2G0 he was stepping down on Wednesday.
""Congratulations, Chairman Roisman!, I look forward to your leadership of the SEC.""
Roisman, the SEC and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Roisman, who has been a commissioner since 2018, would run the agency which oversees public companies, brokers, Wall Street banks, and investment funds, until President-elect Joe Biden announces a new chair after his administration takes over on January 20.
Clayton, a former Wall Street lawyer, was appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017. His departure leaves the SEC, which is led by political appointees who vote on rules and other key issues, tied at two Republican and two Democratic commissioners. That makes it unlikely Roisman will be able to bring any substantial or contentious rulemakings to a vote while he is caretaker.
Democratic SEC commissioner Allison Lee and former Democratic commissioners Kara Stein and Rob Jackson are contenders to replace Clayton, Reuters has previously reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-clayton/sec-chief-clayton-to-call-it-quits-at-the-end-of-2020-idUSKBN27W1IQ. 
Gary Gensler, an ex-chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is also a contender, as is Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan whom Trump fired in 2017.
Roisman is a former SEC and U.S. Senate lawyer. As commissioner, he has led a campaign to overhaul shareholder voting rules with the backing of congressional Republicans. 
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democrats, investor groups and powerful unions have opposed the changes, saying they muzzle investors and will make it harder to push corporations on climate change and social issues. Analysts expect Biden will to try to reverse them.
A formal White House decision to appoint Roisman as acting chair would break with protocol. Typically, the longer-serving party commissioner, in this case Peirce, steps up. 

Peirce is an ultra conservative who has often broken ranks with her fellow Republicans on enforcement issues and cryptocurrency oversight.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Bluff and brinksmanship: How Britain got a Brexit trade deal done,"By John Chalmers, Elizabeth Piper and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - As trade talks with the United Kingdom ground to deadlock on Dec. 9, one European Union official summed up the mood in Brussels, writing in a memo: ""The Brits ... are taking us for a ride, we must remain firm.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had just met for dinner in the Berlaymont building, the headquarters of the 27-nation EU's executive in Brussels, and failed to resolve blockages on fisheries and competition policy.
Even though those differences and many others were resolved on Thursday with a deal to avert a 'cliff-edge' rupture to a $900 billion trade relationship, the pattern of mutual mistrust highlighted by the memo, seen by Reuters, remains.
That mistrust is likely to bedevil future relations as the UK and the EU address a huge slate of unfinished business ranging from trade in services to cooperation on criminal matters and security.
""Unfortunately, trust is not something that will come overnight,"" said a senior EU diplomat based in Brussels. 
The economic consequences of Britain's acrimonious break from its historic European allies will be painfully evident - but the geostrategic implications will arguably be even greater.
For one of Europe's main military and economic powers to shun the EU as the bloc tries to become a coherent counterweight to Russian and Chinese assertiveness will diminish Europe's transatlantic community with the United States and Canada.
Britain formally left the EU last January, 47 years after joining and 3-1/2 years after its 'Brexit' referendum, but then entered a transition period during which rules on commerce and travel were frozen until the end of 2020.
EU officials and diplomats described the talks to put a post-transition trade deal in place by Jan. 1, 2021, as an exhausting exercise of bluff and brinksmanship.
On the EU side, the 27 member states remained united under their chief negotiator, Frenchman Michel Barnier, an unflinching defender of their single market of 450 million consumers.
The British side was harder to gauge because it sometimes sought to exploit differences between member states and often appeared to be guided by the vagaries of domestic politics, the EU officials said.
Yet to mass-circulation newspapers at home and Brexit ideologues in his government, Johnson's tough line with Brussels on competition rules and access to UK waters for EU fishing boats was applauded as a much-needed assertion of sovereignty.
A BAD FIT?
Britain has always been ambivalent about the project to unite and rebuild Europe from the ashes of World War Two. 
    It joined, belatedly, in 1973, but its economic liberalism jarred with much of continental Europe, and it never joined the single currency, the euro, or the Schengen zone of passport-free travel.
    British euroscepticism was fanned for decades by much of its press, whose members - including Johnson, a Daily Telegraph correspondent in Brussels in 1989-94 - panned the federalist ambitions of 'eurocrats' and lampooned the EU's regulatory zeal.
Johnson once poked fun in an opinion column at rules that, according to him, forbade the recycling of a teabag or children under eight blowing up balloons.
For many Britons, Brexit has an intellectual rationale: that the United Kingdom should cut loose from the stagnating economies of the EU and compete with a project they are convinced is destined to fail. 
Yet Britain's uneasy relationship with the EU has been controversial at home, too.
Margaret Thatcher's aggression towards Brussels led to a Conservative party coup that ended her premiership in 1990. The 2016 Brexit referendum gamble made by one of her successors, David Cameron, led to his departure and, with voters split 52-48%, polarised British society.
On the other side of the Channel, many have long thought that Britain is simply a poor fit. 
    French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle twice vetoed its attempts to join what was then the European Economic Community in the 1960s. Five decades later, President Emmanuel Macron pressed for a swift British exit after the referendum, worried that eurosceptic sentiment could seep across the continent.
Britain's boldest step during the trade talks came last summer, when an inner circle around Johnson met to figure a way out of the deadlock. Their solution: trigger a crisis.
    In the words of one source close to the group, they decided to ""put a gun on the table"" by drafting legislation that would explicitly override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement, the divorce treaty that the UK had already signed with the EU.
Several British officials told Reuters the Internal Market Bill had been a shock tactic to counter what they saw as EU efforts to prevent Britain winning back its ""sovereignty"" before its final exit from the bloc's orbit on Jan. 31.
But the move made Brussels all the more determined to make sure it could enforce a trade deal.
    Von der Leyen spelled it out: ""Trust is good, but law is better ... And crucially, in light of recent experience, a strong governance system is essential to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done.""
    The strategists behind the gambit included some, sources said, who felt that Britain had been humiliated in earlier talks and were determined not to let that happen again.
    Britain's tabloid press was indignant in 2019 when Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May - another Conservative prime minister to fall victim to the struggle over Europe - had to sit outside a summit meeting room for hours while, as the Sun newspaper put it, ""EU leaders gorged on langoustine and duckling"".
    
A PIECE OF CAKE
At a summit in Salzburg a year earlier, the chairman, Donald Tusk, posted a picture on Instagram of himself at a cake stand alongside May with the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.""
    The jibe referred to a plan proposed by May for the Withdrawal Agreement that the EU had publicly trashed as cherry-picking the benefits of membership - and to Johnson's belief that Britain could do just that, ""have its cake and eat it"". 
    ""The cake business certainly had an impact,"" a British source said. Some saw it as tasteless, because May is diabetic. 
    A source involved in the divorce talks last year said that, when the delegations broke for refreshments, they would often sit on opposite sides of the room, glaring at each other in silence.
Rancour over Britain's Internal Market Bill set the tone for negotiation as the end-year deadline loomed.
A spat broke out on Twitter between British negotiator David Frost and the usually smooth Barnier. Both sides dug in on fishing rights, ways to settle future disputes, and ""level playing-field"" rules to guarantee fair competition, including state aid to companies.
    Britain declared in October that it was breaking off negotiations entirely. But a week later, they resumed, after Brussels acknowledged both sides needed to compromise - a signal that London hailed as evidence that its strategy had worked.
Johnson's dinner on Dec. 9 with von der Leyen and the two chief negotiators - ironically including turbot, a flatfish found in British waters - threw up a sharp contrast between the two sides as photographs taken beforehand went viral.
On one side stood the Commission's elegantly dressed German president and French negotiator; on the other, Johnson in an ill-fitting suit with his trademark tousled hair, and his negotiator wearing a tie that had been tied too short.
A UK source said Johnson had gone in with proposals and ""genuinely trying to find a route to a solution"", but had been stonewalled and left with a sense that ""things were very gloomy"".
Another source close to the talks said Johnson's affability had failed to charm the more formal von der Leyen.
""I don't believe either would normally invite the other to a dinner party,"" the source said. ""Chalk and cheese.""
The EU memo sent after the dinner said London appeared to be trying to squeeze out concessions by declaring that it was prepared to leave on Jan. 1 without a deal.
It took another two weeks of negotiations, stretching into evenings and over weekends, to find an agreement.
   One EU diplomat close to the negotiations said the past 4-1/2 years had been a ""tiresome melodrama"" that had dented goodwill and sapped enthusiasm for any further talks. 

    ""The divorce was meant to be amicable. But our estranged spouse went mad and that didn't go smoothly,"" he said. ""One way or another, we are still going to be stuck together. Loveless.""

Investing.com --   Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) slumped 14% after China said it is investigating the company for anticompetitive practices. 
The online giant hit a record in October, rallying some 50% since the start of the year, as people hunkered down at home to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Shares are down 30% since the all-time high.
Alibaba, built by billionaire Jack Ma, said it will cooperate with regulators. This isn't the first time Ma's businesses have attracted the attention of regulators.Ma's Ant Financial is also in the hot seat and set to meet with four Chinese financial regulatory agencies, the New York Times reported. That comes a month after Ant Financial had been set for a $37 billion initial public offering, the largest ever. But Shanghai Stock Exchange regulators abruptly suspended the offering, citing major issues with the group that ""may fail to meet information disclosure requirements,"" NPR reported last month.  
People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, endorsed the inquiry into Alibaba, the New York Times reported.
“This is an important step in strengthening antimonopoly oversight in the internet sphere,” the article said. “This will be beneficial to regulating an orderly sector and promoting the long-term healthy development of platforms.”     
Alibaba's results have surpassed expectations for the past seven quarters. In its most recent quarterly report, the ecommerce company published earnings per share of $18 on sales of $155 billion. In comparison, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), in its most recent quarterly report, declared earnings per share of $12.37 on sales of $96 billion.

 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) dropped 11% after China initiated an antitrust investigation into the e-commerce giant.
The S&P 500 and the Dow ended higher on Wednesday as investors pivoted to cyclical stocks that stand to benefit most during a recovery, encouraged by Covid-19 vaccine rollouts and the long-awaited passing of the coronavirus relief bill. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed lower.
Britain and the EU appear to be finally reaching a Brexit trade deal, years later and just ahead of the deadline, although fish remain a sticking point.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Wednesday vetoed a bipartisan defense policy bill and raised the prospect that the U.S. could face a government shutdown during a pandemic.

After months of wrangling, and amid warnings of no deal, Britain and the European Union were on the cusp of striking a narrow trade agreement, sources in London and Brussels said, swerving away from an acrimonious split five years after the Brexit referendum.
Talks could still have ""some hours to run"", a UK source said on Thursday, adding that the two sides were still haggling over the EU's right to fish in British waters.
""Everyone's very curious to see what ultimately will be decided on,"" said Bert Colijn, senior economist, eurozone at ING, adding that the big theme was if tariffs were off the table - seen as crucial to limiting the impact on European exporters. 
""If you look at it in the very long run... finding a deal at the 11th hour is going to be positive from a growth potential side for the UK economy, and therefore, ultimately... to stocks.""
Banks jumped 0.7% with Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) up 4.0% and 1.8%, respectively. 
Irish stocks closed down 0.3% with Flutter Entertainment falling 2.2%, making the travel and leisure sector the biggest decliner in Europe.
France's CAC 40 closed down 0.1%, while Spain's lender-heavy index climbed half a percent. 
Stock markets in Germany, Italy and Switzerland were closed for the Christmas holidays. 
Unprecedented amounts of stimulus, and lately vaccine optimism, have seen the STOXX 600 rise close to 50% from its March lows, though it still remains about 9% below this year's pre-pandemic high and is on course to end the year about 5% lower.

Banks and oil stocks have weighed the most on worries about the economic toll of the pandemic, while technology stocks have led the recovery among major sectors as they emerged winners amid the work-from-home trend.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks rallied and the British pound gained on Thursday as Britain and the European Union closed in on a free trade deal and investors wagered on a global economic recovery. 
Britain and the EU were hammering out the final details of a narrow post-Brexit trade deal on Thursday with an announcement expected soon, adding to an optimistic mood in the final trading session before the Christmas break.
While a last-minute deal has long been expected, finally removing the possibility of a no-deal outcome 4-1/2 years after Britain voted to leave the trading bloc will come as a relief to markets.
The FTSE 100's initial gains fizzled but the more domestically-focused British mid-cap FTSE 250 index hit its highest levels since February, and UK small caps a record level.
The STOXX 50 added 0.1% while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose 0.15% after gains in Asia.
The Brexit trade deal adds to an end-of-year bullish mood in markets, where investors have looked beyond a spike in new COVID-19 cases globally and rising unemployment to the hope that vaccines and more fiscal spending will help spur an economic recovery in 2021. 
High on record sums of central bank stimulus, investors have pushed stock markets to new peaks.
Mizuho analysts dubbed it the ""mistletoe effect"", whereby anticipation of a trade accord meant that ""despite being subject to the approval of PM Johnson and EU governments the outline deal was enough"" to stoke a rally in markets. 
Sterling added another 0.6% to $1.3586, close to its highest level in two years. Still, analysts say the pound's 5% rally since early November means much of the Brexit relief has been priced in to the currency.
""What was billed as an oven ready deal has taken a nearly a year to defrost, but the fact it now seems so much more palatable for both sides is providing some much needed Christmas cheer for investors,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
THE BRIGHT SIDE
The dollar edged 0.1% lower while the euro held around $1.22.
Wall Street ended mostly higher on Wednesday and futures pointed to a stronger open later on Thursday.
A raft of mixed U.S. economic data this week has showed lower jobless claims and an uptick in new orders for durable goods, but also a pullback in consumer spending, falling personal income and fading sentiment as the holiday shopping season nears its end amid a resurgent COVID-19 pandemic.
Investors appear undeterred from buying stocks and are looking on the bright side. 
They also largely shrugged off comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that a nearly $900 billion stimulus bill, agreed upon after months of wrangling in Congress, was ""a disgrace"" that he might not sign.
""While the pandemic meant lost lives and lost jobs in 2020, a successful vaccine rollout during 2021 is set to be a game changer: governments will gradually lift mobility restrictions and societies will return to most pre-pandemic habits,"" asset manager Candriam told clients.
""The swift recovery during the third quarter in the Western hemisphere and the ongoing expansion in Asia, where a second infection wave has mostly been avoided, serve as a template for the near future.""
Oil prices fell but remained above $50 a barrel in light holiday trade as a drop in U.S. stockpiles spurred demand hopes.
Brent crude futures reversed earlier gains and were last down 38 cents to $50.81 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 41 cents to $47.71 per barrel.[O/R]

Gold prices rose marginally, supported by the weaker dollar.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Pandemic prompts Wall Street to look south for Florida's life and work benefits,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - A bevy of Wall Street executives, bankers and fund managers are abandoning New York for Florida, embracing the Sunshine State over metropolitan New York as the coronavirus pandemic has eliminated many benefits of working from a global financial hub.
Since legions of finance industry employees began working from home in March, Florida's warm weather, low taxes, affordable space and quick, easy flights back to New York, when needed, have elevated its status.
About 30 major financial firms are ""kicking the tires"" in South Florida, said Kelly Smallridge, who runs an economic development agency in Palm Beach County. A handful of them are serious about shifting staff there, she said.
Companies including Elliott Management, Citadel and Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co are among the latest to say they will open satellite offices there or allow their moneymakers to be based in Florida, executives have said. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is also looking at moving some asset management staff there, people familiar with the matter said.
In the past, Wall Street executives dismissed the idea of locating in Florida because of concerns about schools, culture and networking opportunities. 
Much of that has been eliminated as remote working and learning have taken over New York, while restaurants, museums and other venues remain all but closed because of lockdown measures to prevent the virus from spreading.
That has made Florida's laid-back lifestyle and business-friendly practices more attractive, bankers and investment professionals said.
Florida is part of a broader trend, with big financial companies moving staff from expensive cities like New York and San Francisco to lower-cost hubs in U.S. states like Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.
For many New Yorkers, Florida seems closer culturally and physically than other states. It is in the same time zone and has more Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expatriates than one might find in Salt Lake City or Nashville, sources said.
Year-round open-air dining is another plus, along with the absence of state income tax. Houses and apartments generally cost less, and commercial rents are about half the Manhattan price in places like Palm Beach County.
""I absolutely love it here and am trying to get some friends to move down here,"" said Kevin Couper, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, who moved to South Florida six months ago. ""People are able to live their lives down here.""
Couper's view reflects what many of his fellow executives on Wall Street are saying: If they cannot be in Manhattan's skyscraper offices and enjoy theater, concerts and restaurants, they would rather be close to the beach.
RISE IN NUMBER OF PATIENTS
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has prioritized the state's economy over strict coronavirus protections. In September, he declared Florida open for business, barring local governments from limiting capacity at restaurants even as many other states restricted indoor dining.
Florida is one of 13 states without a mask mandate. 
Florida's coronavirus hospitalizations have increased 32% to 5,634 people on Wednesday from 4,280 on Dec. 1, according to a Reuters tally. That's the fifth-highest in the country, behind California, Texas, New York and Pennsylvania.
DeSantis supporters argue that his approach has saved jobs and helped Florida businesses. 
Couper and others said they take the pandemic seriously, but that people should be allowed to make their own choices about wearing masks and dining out.
Hedge fund Elliott Management, which oversees $41 billion, says it plans to open a West Palm Beach office next year. Its co-chief executive, Jonathan Pollock, has worked from Florida during the pandemic.
Citadel, the hedge fund, expects to open a Miami office next year. Founder Ken Griffin, a Florida native, put the state to the test when he moved some traders from Citadel Securities, his separate electronic trading business, from New York and Chicago to the Four Seasons hotel in Palm Beach.
Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc also plans to open an office for hundreds of back-office technology staff near Miami, it said.
Goldman Sachs's asset management arm has been looking at South Florida, sources said. The bank has no specific plans to announce, but is looking to place more jobs in ""high-value"" locations throughout the country, a spokesman said.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) have long had offices in Jacksonville, while many hedge funds have based around Miami or Palm Beach for years.
Although Moelis does not plan to open an office in Florida, CEO Ken Moelis told Bloomberg TV he was happy to have top dealmakers work from there if they prefer it.

""The pandemic has essentially taken five years of a slow process and accelerated it,"" said Alan Johnson, who works with financial CEOs as head of consulting firm Johnson Associates. ""Companies realize that you don't need to be in Midtown Manhattan, and employees are okay with that.""

Tokyo-listed Honda Motor Co Ltd had to stop output at its British factory earlier this month because of transport-related delays that caused a shortage of parts. It resumed production about a week later.
The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded issues that were already plaguing carmakers ahead of Brexit, with the looming end to the transition period widely expected to cause delays at ports regardless of the outcome of talks on a trade deal. 
Jaguar Land Rover halted production at its British factories for a week in November last year to mitigate any potential impact from a no-deal Brexit ahead of the then Oct. 31 deadline.

Investing.com – China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) began an investigation into  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s (HK:9988) alleged monopolistic practices and summoned affiliate Ant Group Co. to a high-level meeting over financial regulation.
Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slumped 8.13% to HK$228.20 ($29.43) by 11:21 PM ET (4:21 AM GMT).
The move comes after Alibaba pulled the plug on a $37 billion initial public offering, tipped to be the world’s largest, planned for Ant just days before shares were due to begin trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong. It also decreased the chances of Ant reviving the listing in 2021.
A SAMR online statement said that it had launched a probe into the practice but did not provide further details. However, the twin pillars of the empire built by billionaire Jack Ma face are facing escalated scrutiny. Ant said that it will study and comply with all requirements in a statement on its official WeChat account.
Ma has kept a low profile since Ant pulled the plug on its listing. However, he was advised by the government to stay in the country as of early December.
Regulators had previously warned e-commerce giant Alibaba about the so-called “choosing one from two” practice under which merchants are required to sign exclusive cooperation pacts preventing them from offering products on rival platforms.
Investors remain divided over the extent to which regulators will go after Alibaba and other tech companies such as Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) as the government introduces a slew of new anti-monopoly regulations. Although few details have been released about the harshness of the new regulations, the draft rules released in November indicate an unusually wide berth for the government to rein in tech entrepreneurs such as Ma.
“It’s clearly an escalation of coordinated efforts to rein in Jack Ma’s empire, which symbolized China’s new ‘too-big-to-fail’ entities. Chinese authorities want to see a smaller, less dominant and more compliant firm,” Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute researcher Dong Ximiao told Bloomberg.
Investors speculate that the regulations could lead to a range of scenarios, including monetary fines and a break-up of industry leaders.
A separate joint task force, led by the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a financial system regulator, alongside various departments of the central bank and other regulators has reportedly been formed to oversee Ant. The force will be in regular contact with Ant to collect data and other materials, study its restructuring and draft other regulations for the fintech industry.
“China has streamlined a lot of the bureaucracy, so it’s easier for the different regulatory bodies to work together now … of all the regulatory hurdles, this is the biggest by a long shot,” China Skinny managing director Mark Tanner told Bloomberg."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, with the prospect of a Brexit deal giving markets a pre-Christmas boost.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.53% by 9:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.86%. The country has signed deals with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Janssen to import COVID-19 vaccines to cover up to 16 million people as it continues to deal with a third wave of COVID-19 cases, Prime Minister Chung Sye Kyun said on Thursday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.43%
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.22%. The new B.1.1.7 strain of the COVID-19 virus could already be in the city, with two students returning from the U.K. suspected to be infected with the strain. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed tougher restrictions across England as the B.1.1.7 strain continues to spread across the country.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.17% while the Shenzhen Component inched up 0.08%. The State Administration for Market Regulation said on Thursday that it will launch an investigation into  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) for suspected monopolistic behaviour and will summon the company’s Ant Group to meet in the coming days.
Although a formal announcement of the Brexit deal between the U.K. and the European Union has yet to be released, hopes that an economic rupture on Jan. 1 could be avoided gave shares a boost.
“The framework for a Brexit trade deal gave investors the green light to start buying everything in Europe,” OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya told Reuters.
The news from Europe helped overshadow threats from U.S. President Donald Trump that he would not sign off on the COVID-19 relief bill passed by Congress earlier in the week. Although House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to echo Trump’s call for larger individual stimulus checks than offered in the bill, whether the House of Representatives would succeed in passing this additional measure during a pro forma session later in the day remains to be seen.
However, Trump’s comments that the bill was “a disgrace” that he might not sign did not seem to have much impact in the market.
On the data front, jobless claims for the past week fell to 803,000 from the previous week’s 892,000 claims and the 885,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. However, core durable goods orders grew 0.4% month-on-month in November, down from the 0.5% growth in forecasts and the 1.9% growth seen in October amid ever-increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases.
“Risk-on sentiment is guiding markets so far today and it appears to be weighted more toward possible optimism toward a Brexit deal and the cherry-picked parts of U.S. releases, rather than Trump’s reckless antics over signing the stimulus and funding bill,” Scotiabank head of capital markets economics Derek Holt told Reuters.
Other investors were more cautious, with a little over a week remaining until 2021.
“Right now we have a lot of animal spirits surging into year-end … as constructive as I am on markets in the broader term, I do expect there will be a hangover of sorts to process this over-extension sometime later this winter,” Tallbacken Capital Advisors founder and CEO Michael Purves told Bloomberg."

Once hailed as drivers of economic prosperity and symbols of the country’s technological prowess, Jack Ma’s Alibaba and rivals like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. face increasing pressure from regulators after amassing hundreds of millions of users and gaining influence over almost every aspect of daily life in China.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",U.S. extends protection for Citgo from PDVSA creditors through July,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday extended a measure barring transactions related to Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela's 2020 bond until July 2021, amid heavy U.S. sanctions on the South American country.
The move effectively bars PDVSA creditors from seizing shares in the parent company of U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, a PDVSA subsidiary, which were used as collateral for the bond - for the next seven months.
A previous measure was set to expire on Jan. 19, the day before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is set to be sworn in. 
President Donald Trump's administration in early 2019 sanctioned PDVSA, the lifeblood of Venezuela's economy, as part of its effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro, who dozens of Western nations accuse of corruption, human rights violations, and rigging his 2018 re-election. 
Those sanctions, together with Washington's recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, paved the way for the opposition to take control of Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner with a capacity of some 769,000 barrels per day. 
Citgo declined to comment on the extension of protection against creditors. 
U.S. officials have argued that allowing creditors to control the company would represent a setback for Guaido and U.S. policy.

Maduro has accused the opposition of ""stealing"" Citgo, and argues that Washington is seeking to oust him in a coup in order to control the OPEC nation's vast oil reserves.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -American Airlines said on Wednesday it is moving forward with plans to bring back furloughed workers and give them paychecks by Dec. 24, even after President Donald Trump threatened to veto a coronavirus relief bill.
Trump’s threat on Tuesday to veto the $892 billion coronavirus relief bill approved by Congress this week, which includes $15 billion for airlines to bring back furloughed workers and pay them through March, left millions of Americans in limbo.
""While this is an unexpected development, we are moving forward with recall plans and furloughed team members will receive funds in their accounts on Christmas Eve as planned,"" a spokeswoman for American said.
Nearly 8,000 American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) flight attendants have already received recall letters, the company said, and similar letters are going out in phases to other employees across the company.
The letters, sent by email and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), ask flight attendants to either accept the recall or resign by Jan. 4.
By Tuesday afternoon, around half had already accepted, and only one had resigned, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
American furloughed nearly 19,000 employees after a first federal payroll support package for airlines expired in October.
United Airlines, which furloughed around 13,000 of its employees, has also pledged to recall them if Washington approves fresh aid. 

It did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Investing.com - The Dow gave up some gains into the close but ended higher Wednesday as energy and financials climbed even as President Donald Trump's demands that Congress amend the stimulus bill threatened delays.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.38%, or 114 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.07% while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.29%.
Trump said the $900 billion virus relief package was a ""disgrace,"" demanding that it be amended to reflect higher direct payments to individuals of $2,000 rather than the current $600 proposal. The president also took issue with funds to support countries abroad.
While the bill is veto proof – after securing the required two-thirds majority of the votes in both the chambers of Congress – the demands from Trump risk a delay to stimulus getting rolled out next week.
In another political twist, though somewhat expected, Trump vetoed the $740 billion defense bill. Congress is expected to vote on the bill again to override the veto.
Trump has previously threatened to block the bill as it did not include a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from lawsuits over the content posted on their platforms. 
The unexpected setback for stimulus comes as 803,000 people filed for weekly unemployment insurance, above estimates of 880,000, but claims are expected to remain above 800,000 amid ongoing restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19.
""The trends will become clearer over the next few weeks, but for now it seems like the most likely that claims will hover between 800K and 900K until there is either a natural leveling-off in the transmission of COVID or there is wider distribution of the vaccine,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The uptick in cases comes as the vaccine distribution program continues to gather pace, with one million vaccinated in the US so far, the Center for Disease Control.  
Value stocks – those that are linked to the performance of the economy – like financials and energy rose, with latter getting a boost from higher oil prices.
Oil prices rose 2% as weekly inventory data showed crude and product inventories fell in the week ended Dec. 18, easing worries about weaker fuel demand.  
A jump in Treasury paved the way for banking stocks to add to gains so far this week, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) leading to the upside.
Industrials, meanwhile, were supported by rising travel-related stocks as airlines racked up gains.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rose 2%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were up more than 3%.

In other news, Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) plunged 10% after the company said it had terminated its partnership with Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) to jointly develop electric garbage trucks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday asked for public comment on broker-dealer custody of digital assets and how the broker-dealers should be regulated when holding these products and recommending them to investors, the agency said in a statement.
The move, which the agency says will help inform future regulatory action in this market, comes after a July 2019 notice of guidance the SEC issued mandating firms comply with the customer protection rule, which requires broker-dealers to safeguard both the cash and securities of their customers. It does not currently address digital assets.
The SEC hopes to receive insight into the ""evolving standards and best practices"" regarding the custody of digital assets.
The investment advice industry had long been demanding clarity, particularly after the agency published https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sec-brokers/u-s-sec-issues-compliance-focus-areas-for-brokers-before-new-rules-take-effect-idUSKBN21P34S details about the expected scope and content for compliance with its new Regulation Best Interest, a 2020 rule that requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to disclose potential conflicts of interest before recommending financial products that benefit them. 
On Wednesday, the agency staff also issued a statement in addition to its request for comment that offered relief from enforcement actions for up to five years to broker-dealer firms that have ""obtained and maintained physical possession or control of customer fully paid and excess margin digital asset securities.""
Eligible broker-dealer firms must also limit their business to digital asset securities, isolate and mitigate risk in holding these transactions and disclose the risk to customers.
""The Commission is cognizant of both investor protection and potential capital-formation innovations that could result from digital asset securities,"" the agency said.

(Reuters) -The families of victims killed in two crashes by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX want U.S. regulators to rescind approval for the planes to fly again, following a Senate report that raised concerns about the re-approval process. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted its 20-month safety ban of the 737 MAX on Nov. 18 after green-lighting design changes by Boeing to address issues involved in two fatal crashes in Indonesia in late 2018 and in Ethiopia in early 2019.
But a lengthy Senate Commerce Committee report released on Friday found that Boeing officials ""inappropriately coached"" FAA test pilots during its recertification efforts.
""The Committee found wrongful and potentially unlawful behavior that must be investigated to determine whether the MAX recertification process was tainted,"" families of Ethiopian crash victims said in the Dec. 22 letter to the FAA and Department of Transportation that was reviewed by Reuters.
Asked for comment, the FAA said it had worked closely with other international regulators to conduct ""a thorough and deliberate review"" of the 737 MAX.
""We are confident that the safety issues that played a role in the tragic accidents involving Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners,"" a spokesman said.
Boeing declined to comment. When the Senate report was released on Dec. 18, Boeing said it takes ""seriously the committee’s findings and will continue to review the report in full.""
""With the first U.S. flight of the 737 MAX set to occur within days, we call for the plane to be immediately grounded based upon the new revelations,"" the families wrote.
A total of 346 people died in the two crashes.

American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is set to fly the plane on Dec. 29 for the first time in the United States with commercial passengers since the plane's global grounding in March 2019.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors have ramped up demands for operational fixes, refreshed boards and sales of lackluster businesses in the last few months of 2020, a rush that will continue into the new year, bankers, investors and others said.
Investors like Paul Singer's Elliott Management and William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management paused earlier in the year when the coronavirus pandemic first disrupted supply chains, displaced workforces and made it harder to conduct due diligence.
But in the last quarter of 2020, activist hedge funds have targeted 41 companies, nearly doubling campaigns from the third quarter, data from investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd show.
""The fourth quarter snapback is definitely happening,"" said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard, adding, ""Activism is coming back full steam and the first quarter of 2021 is going to be very busy.""
The recent rollout of coronavirus vaccines and a strong stock market recovery have emboldened rabble-rousing investors to take on new targets.
A stronger performance among individual activists may also be fueling the pace: they are up, on average, 6.7% through November, after a 27% drop in the first quarter, according to Hedge Fund Research. That compares with a 14% gain for the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 index this year.
""There is certainly money out there for activism,"" said Ken Squire, who runs research firm 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist Fund, which is up 18% through the middle of December.
In recent weeks, new investment firm Engine No. 1 took on  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Elliott nominated directors at Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), Starboard Value settled for seats at ON Semiconductor Corp and Sachem Head Capital Management won seats at  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN) Inc.
The 41 campaigns launched so far in the fourth quarter compare to 46 in the same period last year, and 24 in the prior quarter, according to Lazard data. Year-to-date, activity is down roughly 20%.
After a year of wild and unexpected business conditions, activists are almost certainly going to target companies where they see benefits to cost-cutting, spinoffs, mergers or better corporate governance, sources said.
""No one is going to give companies a free pass because of COVID,"" said Scott Winter, managing director at Innisfree M&A, who tallies shareholder votes on hotly contested corporate matters.

DETROIT (Reuters) -A U.S. regulator ruled on Wednesday that Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd's new design for its Roxor off-road utility vehicle did not infringe the intellectual property rights of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Jeep brand, six months after barring the sale of older models.
The International Trade Commission (ITC) said the post-2020 Roxor model did not violate the ""trade dress"" of FCA's Jeep Wrangler SUV, accepting an administrative law judge's October recommendation that design changes made by Mahindra meant an earlier cease-and-desist order should not apply to newer models. 
""The ruling validates Mahindra’s redesign of the highly popular Roxor off-road vehicle,"" Mahindra said in a statement. ""Mahindra is now permitted to manufacture and distribute the redesigned 2021 Roxor."" 
FCA said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling.
Trade dress consists of the unique characteristics that make a product stand apart and is generally accepted as identified with that product by the public. For example, FCA sees the Jeep Wrangler's boxy body shape, front grille and round headlights as distinct to the brand.
In June, the ITC ruled Mahindra infringed on the intellectual property rights of FCA's 2019-model Jeep brand and barred the sale of vehicles in question. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting the sale or import of the vehicles and parts, as well as a cease and desist order to Mahindra and its North American unit.
Mahindra had said the 2020 model was refreshed and changed to avoid the issue, but the commission did not decide at that time whether the newer model and subsequent versions infringed Jeep's trade dress. 

The Roxor is assembled in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit.

The agreement will help support advanced development and large-scale manufacturing of the company's investigational therapeutic MK-7110 to treat hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said.
The funding allows for development of MK-7110, including completing activities required to request emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and for delivery of the doses by June 30, 2021.
Merck has built out its portfolio of COVID-19 treatments through a series of deals in recent months, including the acquisition of drugmaker Themis and a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.
The company in November agreed to buy OncoImmune in a $425 million deal that gave it control of MK-7110, a promising first-in-class fusion protein and immune modulator. Immune modulators have the potential to minimize the damaging effects of an overactive immune response to COVID-19. 
Interim data from September showed that the therapy, which is administered as an injection, increased the likelihood of symptom improvement in serious COVID-19 cases and also reduced the risk of respiratory failure and death. 
The doses will be made available to the American public at no cost, the agency said. 
The United States has authorized two vaccine for emergency use this month and more than 600,000 Americans had received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, but the need for treatments for those hospitalized remain high. 
Merck is also working on two potential vaccines that are still in early stages of development. It is also collaborating with Ridgeback in developing an antiviral treatment called molnupiravir.

The company's shares rose nearly 1% to $80 on Wednesday.

Investing.com --  Fubotv Inc (NYSE:FUBO) is whipsawing investors, jumping 130% in the week through yesterday, only to slide 9% today.
The streaming service had been riding high as the head of the company insinuated live sports partnership deals may be on the table, only to tumble after BMO Capital knocked the company to a hold-equivalent from outperform.
Analyst Daniel Salmon bumped his target to $50 from $33, and cited recent outperformance for the ratings downgrade.
""We raise our valuation and target again owing to higher streaming comp set valuation and expanded distribution opportunities (e.g. partnership with Hisense and VIDAA) that add upside tension to subscriber estimates,"" Salmon said in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""Our new target implies downside to shares, however this is more a reflection of recent volatility than an incrementally negative view. With that said, we think secular tailwinds and recent execution are reflected at these levels.""
Shares had jumped more than 430% to a 2020 record as cord-cutters turn to new alternatives for their viewing pleasure.  
FuboTV, founded in 2015, is mainly focused on providing live sports including NFL, MLB and NBA games. It streams 90% of nationwide football games; 100% of the NHL and 88% of MLB. FuboTV also has more regional sports networks in its base package than any other live TV streaming platform.
Third quarter numbers reported last month exceeded the company's own expectations. Paid subscribers rose 58% in the third quarter from a year earlier to 455,000. Revenue per user also increased in that time by 14% to $67.70.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Analysis-Supply squeeze won't ease on global stocks and bonds in 2021,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - An unrelenting squeeze on the supply of global shares and sovereign bonds shows little sign of easing next year, with companies and central banks predicted to be big buyers of these securities in direct competition with investors.
The supply mismatch could help to sustain the decade-long bull run in global equities and also keep bond yields at very low levels.
A string of high-profile intial public offerings, as well as emergency secondary listings, this year raised almost $1 trillion in new equity, Dealogic data shows.
Yet this flood of new equity issues did not end the supply squeeze on stocks as mergers and private equity deals continued to suck shares out of the market
On bonds meanwhile, government borrowing is at record levels, but much of it is heading straight into central bank bond-buying programmes. Central banks now hold around half the sovereign bonds in Britain, the euro zone and Japan.
Many policymakers have recently topped up asset-purchase schemes, so that the crowding-out of private investors from public bond markets looks set to continue. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimates the net equity demand/supply mismatch next year around $1.1 trillion. 
He expects demand for shares to increase by $600 billion from this year, while supply drops by $500 billion as buybacks and private equity-led leveraged buyouts recover further. (LBO).
(Graphic: Global leveraged buyout volumes - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-BONDS/STOCKS/yzdvxjjdovx/chart.png)
Buybacks, often blamed for draining equity supply, were constrained this year by regulators and by companies' own capital needs. U.S July-September buybacks were some 42% below year-ago levels, S&P Dow Jones Indices data shows. 
But following a recent go-ahead from the Federal Reserve, several big U.S. banks have announced 2021 buybacks. 
Vaccines, a consumer spending rebound and low interest rates could ""trigger higher enterprise spending. This should lead to an increase in buybacks,"" S&P/DJI analyst Howard Silverblatt said of the outlook for 2021.
(Graphic: U.S. shares buybacks (by quarter) - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-BONDS/STOCKS/xlbpgmmnzpq/chart.png)
WHAT ABOUT DEMAND? 
Also, the ranks of equity buyers are being swollen by record numbers of private investors who are taking advantage of abundant stimulus-fuelled liquidity to trade equities via apps such as Robinhood. 
These players, who often help to drive wild first-day gains in newly-listed shares, accounted for a quarter of stock market activity this year, versus 10% in 2019, brokerage Citadel Securities estimates.
""Positive equity returns and sheer market momentum are pulling in more and more people,"" Saxo Bank head of equity strategy Peter Garnry said, noting his bank's direct client numbers had surged this year to record highs.
(Graphic: Global volumes of IPOs and secondary issuance - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-STOCKS/YEAREND/yzdvxjjyovx/chart.png)
UPLIFT?
Opinions vary on how much uplift these factors offer to markets. Panigirtzoglou said the last time there was such a large demand/supply gap in 2018, world stocks rose 25%.
But Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management, sees COVID-19 vaccines, economic recovery and central bank liquidity as bigger drivers for equity markets, describing supply/demand picture as ""a marginal positive.""
He also expects the IPO rush to continue into 2021 as private equity owners cash in on buoyant markets.
The scarcity premium may be felt more keenly in sovereign bonds.
(Graphic: G4 central bank balance sheets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjqqompr/Pasted%20image%201608729290852.png)
Monetary authorities in the euro zone, Sweden, Australia and Britain all recently upped bond buying, while the U.S. Federal Reserve, which so far owns a smaller share of its bond market than peers, may also increase purchases in coming months.
(Graphic: Fed's share of Treasury market - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkqlywpm/Pasted%20image%201608654106327.png)
Citi analysts said this means that the volume of bonds available to investors across major developed economies will not grow at all next year. 
In the euro zone specifically, Citi reckons, private holdings of euro-denominated debt will shrink by around 750 billion euros next year, accelerating from this year's 460 billion-euro drop.
Florian Späte, senior bond strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, expects net euro zone debt supply at minus 90 billion euros in 2021, slightly above this year's minus 125 billion euros. 
""From a pure supply perspective, this is one reason why yields will stay very, very low,"" he said. 
Finally, for those pinning hopes on corporate debt, JPMorgan predicts net bond supply from high-grade U.S. companies will plunge 50% next year from 2020 levels. 
A research report from ABN Amro also said European companies may use cash to repay debt rather than borrow more.

1350,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 11:28AM ET</span>",Nikola's Only Order Up in Smoke as Sour Year Ends Worse,"By Christiana Sciaudone
Investing.com --  It's been a tough year for one of the brightest prospects on the market. Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) is down 9% Wednesday after saying its collaboration with Republic Services (NYSE:RSG) is kaput. 
The news comes following accusations of fraud raised by short-seller Hindenburg and the subsequent resignation of founder and once-chairman Trevor Milton. Just days before those accusations in September, General Motors (NYSE:GM) had announced a deal to take a $2 billion, 11% stake in Nikola. That has since been nixed and plans to build a truck together, the Badger, were scrubbed. GM now has a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to supply fuel-cell technology to Nikola, according to CNBC.
The goal of Nikola's collaboration with Republic was to design and build a refuse truck based on a zero-emissions battery-electric drive platform and body. The companies decided it would take longer than expected to develop, and unexpected costs arose.  
“This was the right decision for both companies given the resources and investments required,” said Nikola Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell. “Nikola remains laser-focused on delivering on our battery-electric and fuel-cell electric commercial truck programs, and the energy infrastructure to support them.”
The Republic order put a well-known name to what has otherwise been a vague number of 14,000 ""reservations"" touted by the company, all of which are subject to cancellation -- as Wednesday's news showed.
Nikola expects to begin delivery of Tre battery-electric semi-trucks in the U.S. in 2021, when it should also break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station. The company’s fuel-cell-electric semi-trucks will be produced in Coolidge, Arizona, beginning in 2023.
Nikola went public in June through a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, and jumped to a record of almost $80. It is now trading around $15.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>","Logistics firms reap ""vaccine economy"" benefits as EU gears up for roll-out","By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Joern Schneemann thought he would be helping manage logistics for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics this year. Then, the COVID-19 crisis intervened, pushing the event back to 2021. 
Instead, the head of Swiss logistics company Kuehne + Nagel's European Expo & Events unit has been setting up vaccination centres in convention and sporting venues in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia state, the nation's most-populous with 18 million residents.
Schneemann's pandemic pivot illustrates how logistics firms like Kuehne + Nagel, Germany's Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) DHL, Denmark's DSV Panalpina and Spain's Grupo Logista have turned COVID-19 disruption into opportunity, grabbing a share of the burgeoning ""vaccine economy"" while managing record demand in traditional businesses. 
""Because of the pandemic, things turned out quite differently than we had planned,"" Schneemann told Reuters from his German offices. ""And it turned out well.""
Neither North Rhine-Westphalia, which kicks off its vaccination programme in nursing homes on Sunday in line with the rest of Germany, nor Kuehne + Nagel disclosed the contract's value. 
The company, which has secured other, undisclosed government contracts, will manage the rollout of millions of vaccines including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech's, which won European approval on Monday. 
It must coordinate deliveries to halls filled with refrigerated containers that can handle the vaccine's minus 70 degrees Celsius storage requirement at 53 sites around the state. 
Europe is due to get 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by Dec. 31, with Germany expecting up to 4 million doses through January, enough to inoculate 2 million people with the two-shot treatment.
""The temperature will also be electronically monitored and recorded during transport,"" said Axel Birkenkaemper, a spokesman for North Rhine-Westphalia's health ministry.
Rival Deutsche Post DHL has secured similar contracts in Lower Saxony and Baden-Wuerttemberg states to store and deliver part of the first tranche of the 300 million potential doses Germany has ordered.
""It's more urgent and complex, certainly,"" said John Pearson, chief executive officer of DHL Express. ""But we're accustomed to handling these kind of deliveries. We do this everyday.""
In general, the shippers have survived the pandemic in good shape after online sales soared during lockdowns. 
Kuehne + Nagel's third-quarter profit easily beat expectations, DSV called market conditions ""better than anticipated"", and Deutsche Post DHL, which is also delivering COVID-19 vaccines to Israel, is benefiting from a fresh surge in ecommerce in the run up to Christmas.
VACCINE VOLUMES
Billions of doses are needed to inoculate the world over the next 12-24 months but COVID-19 shots will still make up only a fraction of global shippers' volumes in 2021. 
And they are optimistic about the ability of logistics networks to handle the load, despite major challenges like the Antarctic chilling demands of Pfizer/BioNTech's shot, deliveries of which are also underway in the United States, Britain, Switzerland and parts of the Middle East.
Geneva-based global trucking organisation the International Road Transport Union (IRU) estimates 8 billion vaccine doses could be moved by fewer than 100,000 truck transports, or less than 0.00001% of the annual total. 
""We don't foresee problems,"" IRU spokesman John Kidd said. ""Road already carries over 80% of all goods transported overland, including...volumes of food and medicine to retail outlets."" 
Still, delivery of COVID-19 vaccines may yet give a boost to airlines where passenger numbers have collapsed, as they augment cargo fleets or re-purpose idled passenger jets.
While shippers like U.S.-based FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS that can move smaller volumes quickly may have an advantage during the 70-million-dose rollout projected in 2020 for vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), DSV Panalpina is counting on deliveries accelerating next year.
""DSV will only become active in the distribution around April, when mass roll-out starts,"" the Copenhagen-based shipper said. 
Pfizer and Moderna predict 1.8 billion-plus doses come 2021, with other vaccine developers hoping to add to that if their candidates get approved, as expected.
""MILK RUNS"" 
Kuehne + Nagel's distribution is based in Liege, Belgium, where it is readying its European vaccines hub.
From here, shots will be trucked to Europe or loaded onto cargo planes, or ""freighters"", at nearby airports for long-haul journeys to places like Africa which will get vaccines under humanitarian programmes. 
""We can send a freighter out and hit four or five of those countries in milk run-type fashion back into Liege,"" said Rob Coyle, Kuehne + Nagel's pharmaceuticals logistics business head.
For 11 billion vaccine doses, Coyle estimates 5,000-6,500 trucks or roughly 1,000 large freighters would be needed. While some types of transport will get busy, shippers can manage volumes as vaccines roll out, Coyle said.

""Other industries, aerospace, automotive, they've got less volumes,"" Coyle said. ""We're already having conversations with air carriers, to pull some of their airplanes out, if we need (to).""

Investing.com --  Disney's streaming service will be a boon for the company, according to two analysts.Shares are up 2.2% on Wednesday after comments from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Rosenblatt, who also raised their price targets on the stock.
Wells Fargo reiterated an overweight rating and raised its price target on Disney to $201 from $182 following its investor day two weeks ago, saying it expects the business to produce future margins akin to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s, CNBC reported. Netflix boasts a profit margin of 12% and an operating margin of 17%. That compares to Disney's -4.4% and 6.7%, respectively.
Earlier this month, the company revealed more than 100 new movies and shows for its streaming service, including those connected to franchises like Star Wars, Marvel, FX and National Geographic.  
""We’d say short/medium-term catalysts are about the streaming ramp, and how Parks performs once capacity begins to normalize in H2 FY21,” the firm said in a note, according to CNBC. Disney's parks around the world have been shuttered for much of 2020 on government attempts to stem the spread of the coronavirus, leading to a dip in revenue in that segment, as well as layoffs. The Parks, Experiences and Products segment of the company saw sales drop 61% for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a year earlier. That compares with an 11% increase in Media Networks, and a 41% jump in Direct-to-Consumer and International.
Rosenblatt Securities raised its price target to a Street-high view of $210 from $155 on a ""wave of new, original content coming to Disney+,"" according to Bloomberg. Netflix has much higher subscriber numbers and streaming revenue, but Disney is poised to narrow the gap over the coming years. 
On Tuesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the price target on Disney to $200 from $175 and reiterated a buy-equivalent rating, according to StreetInsider. The shares currently trade around $173.94.

The issue of nuclear power is controversial among EU countries because such investments could put sensitive infrastructure under Chinese control.
""China wants to invest in European nuclear power plants and use Chinese technology in this area,"" WirtschaftsWoche cited EU sources as saying.
During the negotiations, China had indicated to its European counterparts that it viewed its own technology in this field as more advanced, the report said.
Several EU member states reject nuclear energy or have decided to withdraw from the technology within the next few years.
The EU and China aim to reach an investment accord by the end of the year that would grant European companies greater access to the Chinese market, according to German and EU officials.
The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment would put most EU companies on an equal footing in China, potentially a big step in repairing Sino-European ties after the coronavirus outbreak in China and Beijing's crackdown on dissent in the former British colony of Hong Kong.
The deal could complicate transatlantic relations with the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden.
Jake Sullivan, the designated National Security Adviser in Biden's team, tweeted earlier this week that Washington would welcome early consultations with its European partners on ""our common concerns about China's economic practices"".
China fears being isolated from the West as the United States steps up its trade war with Beijing and Brussels has taken steps to monitor Chinese investment in strategic European sectors more closely.

Other big sticking points in sealing the investment pact relate to sustainable development and human rights issues such as forced labour in China, according to Western diplomats.

LONDON (Reuters) - British supplies of some fresh food, mainly fruit and vegetables, are at risk of running out until a backlog of trucks at the port of Dover (NYSE:DOV) is cleared and links with France return to normal, the UK retail industry said on Wednesday.
A partial blockade by France to try to contain a new highly infectious coronavirus variant has left thousands of trucks stranded in Dover, Britain's main gateway to Europe, in the run-up to Christmas.
Paris and London agreed late on Tuesday that drivers carrying a negative COVID-19 test result could board ferries for Calais.
A British minister said the military would start testing drivers, but that it would take time to clear the backlog, hammering Britain's most important trade route for food days before it leaves the European Union's orbit.
""It is good news for consumers as the French borders have now reopened, however it is essential that lorries get moving across the border as quickly as possible,"" said Andrew Opie, director of food & sustainability at the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents more than 170 major retailers including the big supermarkets.
""Until the backlog is cleared and supply chains return to normal, we anticipate issues with the availability of some fresh goods,"" he said.
The BRC and Britain's two biggest supermarket groups, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, have been warning since Monday that gaps will start to appear on store shelves unless transport ties with mainland Europe were quickly restored.
The main products seen at risk are lettuce, salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli, citrus fruit, raspberries and strawberries.
Supermarket groups have said they have plenty of supplies for the Christmas holiday but are concerned about availability next week, particularly if no free trade deal with the EU is secured by Jan. 1.
They are facing record Christmas demand because of COVID-19 restrictions on the hospitality industry and on travel and there are fears of panic buying.

However, they have said customer behaviour has in the main been rational so far with shoppers supplementing their normal Christmas purchases with one or two extra items, such as pasta and toilet roll.
Despite this, Tesco has reintroduced some customer buying limits on toilet roll, hand wash, rice and eggs.
It already had limits on flour, dried pasta, baby wipes and anti-bacterial wipes.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government will pay  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) nearly $2 billion for 100 million additional doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to bolster its supply as the country grapples with a nationwide spike in infections.
Under the new agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30 and the rest no later than July 31, the company said on Wednesday, bringing the total number of doses to 200 million for a total price of about $4 billion.
The purchase price amounts to $19.50 per shot and is slightly higher than the $18.90 per dose that Reuters has reported the European Union has agreed to pay. The shot has been authorized for use in EU and the United States. 
The U.S. deal comes after growing concern that the government had not done enough to secure doses of one of the two authorized vaccines, made more pressing amid a COVID-19 surge that has left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick.
Pfizer's two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, is being rolled out across the United States after the shot won emergency use authorization earlier this month. The country has also authorized a vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Pfizer and the government have said that they had been negotiating the terms of the agreement, with the company indicating it was trying to work out how to deliver the doses in the second quarter. 
Pfizer and BioNTech have said they expect to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, but executives at the German biotech have said they were trying to boost manufacturing. Governments around the world are scrambling to get enough supplies of the vaccine to tame the pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people globally and crushed economies.
""This new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021,"" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.
""Securing more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio.""
Pfizer said last week it may need the U.S. government to help it secure some components needed to make the vaccine. While the company halved its 2020 production target due to manufacturing issues, it said last week its manufacturing is running smoothly now. 
The government also has the option to acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of the vaccine.
More than 600,000 Americans have received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials. Americans in ""essential"" jobs and those over 75 will likely start to receive vaccines in January while general population vaccinations will start in a few months.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Wednesday as trading quietened down ahead of the holiday period, unruffled by data pointing to a weakening of the economy under pressure from the latest wave of the pandemic.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 184 points, or 0.6%, at 30,200 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported that initial jobless claims had stayed above 800,000 for the third straight week last week, despite falling some 10% from the previous week, when they hit their highest since early September. In addition, personal incomes fell 1.1% last month, more than expected, and durable goods orders grew at their slowest rate in seven months.
Among early movers,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock gave up another 4.7%, falling to a three-week low as the exuberance surrounding its vaccine wore off. The company is still valued at just under $50 billion, despite having sales of less than $250 million.  
Profit-taking also plagued  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, which fell 5.7% to its lowest since early November with no obvious triggers. Some froth also came off C3 Ai (NYSE:AI)stock, which has nearly doubled since listing last week. It fell 7.6%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock turned marginally positive after opening lower, with investors not reading too much into Tesla founder Elon Musk's claim that CEO Tim Cook once rebuffed an overture to sell Tesla to Apple. Quantumscape  (NYSE:QS) stock, which had spiked on Tuesday on speculation that its solid-state batteries may figure in Apple's plans for driverless electric vehicles, largely retraced their move, falling 14.8%.
Elsewhere, U.K. ADRs were broadly positive after reports citing U.K. officials as saying that the country has effectively agreed the outlines of a free trade deal with the European Union, averting the risk of a disorderly rupture at the end of the year when the post-Brexit transition arrangements lapse. The EU has not confirmed any deal yet.
The news was also enough to send crude oil prices 1.3% higher, with Brent futures trading at $50.73 a barrel ahead of the release of the Energy Information Administration's weekly inventories report due later.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","Twenty years ago Nissan squeezed suppliers, now it needs their help","By Tim Kelly and Maki Shiraki
Tokyo (Reuters) - When Carlos Ghosn arrived at Nissan (OTC:NSANY) in 1999, suppliers took the brunt of cost-cutting that helped revive the automaker. Two decades later, his successors are trying for another turnaround without the ability to pressure parts makers.
Nissan Motor Corp, like rivals, has been hit as the pandemic sapped global demand. But Japan's No.3 automaker has another problem: an ageing line-up out of step with changing tastes, including growing appetite for sport utility vehicles in the United States and luxury brands in China.
Ghosn's relentless pursuit of chasing volume resulted in a focus on price and incentives, rather than new designs. Under Ghosn, Nissan halved its suppliers to 600 firms. Those that remained had to lower costs, but benefited from more orders as Nissan's global market share went from 4.9% to 6.6%. 
Ghosn, who also ran alliance partner  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY), was arrested in Japan two years ago on charges of financial wrongdoing, which he has denied. He has since fled to Lebanon.
In recent years Nissan has lost its way and new management is once again looking to cut costs, but can't offer increased volume to suppliers. Nissan plans to reduce production capacity and model types by a fifth to trim costs by 300 billion yen ($2.88 billion).
""Cost-cutting is a no-brainer,"" Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta told Reuters in an interview, acknowledging that suppliers may take some persuading.
""We need to have a logic to convince both internally and externally that this is why we want the rationalisation.""
Adding to the challenge is the increased ""regionalisation"" of the auto market, Gupta said. Automakers face a number of different standards and regulations around the world, forcing them to sell cars in different regional versions.
Under Ghosn, Nissan was able to use fewer suppliers and increase economies of scale for components - now it needs to use more suppliers. 
TECHNOLOGY BATTLE 
Nissan also faces an intensifying technological battle in electric vehicles and connected autonomous driving against competitors with deeper research and development pockets such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), as well as new rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
""We would appreciate an increase in sales volume, otherwise it means the development costs become a bigger burden,"" an official at one of Nissan's suppliers told Reuters.
Nissan is planning to revamp the ageing vehicle line-up, with 12 new models over the next few years. Pulling that off will mean working more closely with parts makers.
That is the main difference between Nissan's turnaround plan now and 20 years ago, Gupta said. ""The working with suppliers is a more technological partnership at a very early stage to achieve design to cost,"" he said. 
Examples of such collaboration include designing night vision rear view mirror displays with Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp and an agreement with Chinese company Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery Co to study battery development for its e-Power hybrids, a Nissan spokeswoman said.
""In their dealing with us they have become very polite and more humble,"" said an official at a second Nissan parts maker, who also asked not to be identified. 
Nissan's search for technology has already extended its traditional supplier base, including to companies that work for rival Toyota Motor Corp.
Nissan now buys around a tenth of its parts, particularly electronic components, from Toyota suppliers because they are large-volume producers and therefore cheaper, said William Nestuk, an analyst at Pelham Smithers Associates in London. 
""Nissan cannot currently fund the development of next-generation technologies without input from either the Renault (PA:RENA) side and/or from Toyota suppliers,"" Nestuk said in an email.
That competition will heap further pressure on Nissan suppliers already trying to adjust to declining output. 
""I am concerned that even if we try to work with them the business relationship won't last,"" said the official at the second supplier.

1Globe Capital, which holds about 9.5% stake in Sinovac according to Refinitiv data, was being probed for its compliance with a 13D form-filing, which applies to a person or group that acquires more than 5% of a company's shares.
The SEC two years ago found that 1Globe Capital had not disclosed shares held by its related parties.
The probe also found that the 13D form was not amended on time to include its participation in voting for an alternative slate of directors in the company, which had at that time opposed a buyout offer. 
Sinovac, whose COVID-19 vaccine candidate was shown to be effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Amazon to face U.S. union push in year ahead,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - In 2021, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised to face a renewed challenge from groups it has long countered: unions.
Energized by protests at Amazon's U.S. warehouses and a more labor-friendly administration assuming office, unions are campaigning at the world's largest online retailer to see if its warehouse or grocery workers would like to join their ranks.
A major test is expected early next year when workers at one warehouse decide whether to unionize. The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a ""yes"" vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.
Amazon, America's second-biggest private employer behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, has told workers it already offers the pay and benefits unions promise, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. Its operation in France offers a picture of what the company would avoid: strong unions there precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses this year.
The upcoming vote is for associates in Amazon's fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama; they will weigh whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The organizing committee has launched a social media campaign, shared union authorization cards and collected enough to hold the election.
This week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.
The larger the bargaining unit's size - now expected to be over 5,700 - the more votes the union needs to win.
In a statement, Amazon said, ""We don't believe this group represents the majority of our employees' views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire."" Average pay at the Bessemer facility is $15.30 per hour, and jobs come with health and retirement benefits, it said.
Precedent shows the RWDSU faces an uphill battle. Union membership has fallen to 10% of the eligible workforce in 2019 from 20% in 1983, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January.
Employees at the Alabama facility did not answer requests for an interview.
VOTE 'WOULD PASS'
Amazon workers are organizing elsewhere, too. Alexander Collias, a cashier for Amazon's subsidiary Whole Foods, said he has been participating in walkouts because the pandemic has put workers' health at risk and he claims management has brushed off others concerns.
""We’re definitely extremely pro-union,"" he said of his Whole Foods store in Portland. ""If we had a vote today, I think it would pass.""
Courtenay Brown, a process assistant at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey, said work has increased 10-fold in her building during the pandemic, and colleagues have fallen ill. So she's started circulating work-related petitions via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""We need to be able to have a voice,"" said Brown, 30, adding she was neutral about the impact a union could have at her facility.
Reuters was introduced to both Brown and Collias via pro-labor groups campaigning at Amazon. One of them was Whole Worker, a group of current and former Whole Foods staff looking to organize the grocery chain.
Its strategy is to focus outreach and actions at the half dozen Whole Foods stores, including in Portland and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where it already has secured majority staff support, said Katie Doan, one of the group's directors.
""We’d rather focus on little stores here and there who are for sure going to fully unionize, rather than fail nationally,"" said Doan, who worked for Whole Foods in California until earlier this year.
Likewise, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International have reached out to discuss unionization, hazard pay and other issues with Whole Foods staff, according to interviews and copies of the communication shared with Reuters.
Seattle-area unions are meeting with Amazon tech workers, too, their coalition leader said. One local is helping corporate whistleblowers whom Amazon fired contest their termination as a violation of U.S. labor law, according to a public record obtained by Reuters. Amazon said it supports workers' right to criticize the company, but the employees in question violated internal policies.
Labor advocates say the administration of President Joe Biden is poised to help with union efforts, making the U.S. National Labor Relations Board less beholden to corporate interests and supporting the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.
That bill passed the U.S. House in February and would add penalties for companies that hinder organizing; Senate approval is far from guaranteed. Its passage would help level the playing field for workers, said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president whose Mid-South Council is behind the Alabama union drive. 

""With a change in administration, Amazon workers are going to have a much better chance of coming together,"" he said.

Like its rivals, Lufthansa is struggling to deal with global travel restrictions and grounded fleets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
It is surviving on 9 billion euros of state aid, and Chief Executive Carsten Spohr had said earlier this month that the airline would have to lay off 1,000 pilots in the second quarter if it cannot seal a wage agreement with unions.
The agreement includes an extension of shortened working hours in 2021 under the government's Kurzarbeit scheme as well as a reduction in working hours with corresponding salary cuts and the suspension of collective pay increases, Germany's flagship carrier said in a separate statement.
""Lufthansa is ruling out layoffs of pilots for operational reasons at Lufthansa, Lufthansa Cargo, Lufthansa Aviation Training and a subgroup of Germanwings pilots until March 2022,"" the airline said.
Markus Wahl, president of the VC union, which represents Lufthansa's roughly 5,000 pilots, said: ""We are relieved that... we have succeeded in protecting the cockpit staff against compulsory layoffs at least until 31 March 2022."" 
Lufthansa has an option to extended the agreement until the end of June 2022, according to the union.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>","Global cargo logjam deepens, delaying goods bound for retailers, automakers","By Lisa Baertlein and Jonathan Saul
LOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon seller Bernie Thompson shifted half of his production out of China to reduce his business risks and still found himself in the crosshairs of logistical chaos besetting the movement of goods around the globe. 
A surge in demand for furniture, exercise equipment and other goods for shoppers sheltering at home in a worsening COVID-19 pandemic has upended normal trade flows. 
That has stranded empty cargo containers in the wrong places, spawning bottlenecks that now stretch from factories to seaports. Container ship operators ferry the majority of consumer goods, and transportation and trade sources warn that prolonged industry disruption could cause shortages and complicate the global economic recovery. Thompson, founder of Washington-based Plugable Technologies, sells work-from-home staples like laptop docking stations. He diversified sourcing to be less reliant on a single country for manufacturing and less exposed to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Things did not go as planned and now, like many other importers, he is concerned about keeping enough product in stock. ""We've moved production out of China and moved ourselves right into a disadvantage,"" said Thompson. 
His new factory in Thailand was first to suffer delays of about four weeks, in part because shipping companies routed empty containers to the top priority U.S.-China trade lane. Those logistical snags cascaded and now his remaining shipments from China - the world's No. 1 manufacturer – are postponed by as much as three weeks. And he is not alone - U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Honda Motor Co Ltd in the United Kingdom have also suffered delays. ""Everyone's trying to squeeze through this narrow opening all at once,"" said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources which supplies educational toys to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other major retailers. It can ""really screw up your plans,"" he said. Container ships have been sailing at full load since August – something that has not happened in a decade, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst with trade association BIMCO. 
Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of Germany's Hapag-Lloyd, told investors that the container line was ""deploying every available ship"". MOUNTING FRUSTRATION Frustration is building. Importers and exporters are ""upset they're not able to move their product or crop as willingly as they would like to,"" said Gene Seroka, executive director of Port of Los Angeles – the busiest U.S. seaport. ""We need to get the trade flow going to grease the engine for the whole world economy,"" said Christopher Tang, a business professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. Port staffing reductions due to COVID safety rules also play a part.

""It's a combination of strong volume and slower and less efficient operations,"" said Lars Mikael Jensen, head of network with Denmark's A.P. Moller Maersk, the world's biggest container line. ""This is the perfect storm for global container flows,” Jensen said.

The credit limit reduction is intended to promote more ""rational"" spending habits among users, Ant added in a text message to Reuters. 
It did not provide further details.
The move comes as Chinese regulators tighten their grip on financial technology companies, amid concerns that young and lower income borrowers could get into debt trouble. 
Ant, which is controlled by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) founder Jack Ma, has two credit subsidiaries, Huabei and short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei, which were used by around 500 million people in the 12 months to June 30, Ant said in its IPO prospectus. 
Last month, regulators published a consultation paper on tightening rules for micro-lending that would require them to fund at least 30% of any loan they make jointly with banks. Only 2% of the loans Ant had facilitated as of end-June were on its own balance sheet, its IPO prospectus showed.
Ant's credit businesses had loan balances of 2.1 trillion yuan ($321.25 billion) at the end of June, of which 1.7 trillion yuan was consumer credit. That compares to 8.1 trillion yuan of short-term consumer loans issued by Chinese banks.

(Reuters) - European shares gained for a second day on Wednesday, extending a recovery from a sharp sell-off at the start of the week, following a report that a Brexit trade deal could be struck later in the day.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.3% in holiday thinned trade, after a 2.3% slump on Monday. London's FTSE 100, however, lagged as the pound gained.[.L][GBP/]
A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the European Union is possible on Wednesday after progress in talks on fishing rights, political editor Robert Peston at Britain's  ITV  (LON:ITV) tweeted. 
The news, days before Britain's exit from the bloc after a transitional period, lifted British mid-caps, along with France agreeing to reopen its borders to England on Wednesday.
The detection of a new coronavirus variant had seen much of the world shut its borders to the island country, prompting warnings from supermarkets owners about food supply shortages and hammering stocks across the board on Monday. 
""What we're seeing today is very much a year-end feel to markets,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe.
""There is a lot of caution around this new COVID strain and what it means. So, I don't think we can read too much into small gains, especially when they're still partially recovering from one day's losses."" 
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) was the top boost to the STOXX 600, up 2.6% after business newspaper Handelsblatt reported that the German luxury carmaker is preparing a stock market listing of its trucks division.
Markets also tracked the latest on the U.S. stimulus deal after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to not sign the much-awaited $892 billion coronavirus relief bill. He said it should be amended to increase the amount in checks for individuals. [MKTS/GLOB]
The STOXX 600 is on course to end a tumultuous 2020 down about 6%, despite a stunning recovery from the coronavirus-fueled lows hit earlier in the year on ultra-easy monetary policy and vaccine optimism. 
Banks and energy shares, closely linked to global growth expectations, are down more than 25% so far this year, with Brexit uncertainty adding to the fall in lenders. 
Travel shares, among the worst hit at the onset of the pandemic, are set to end about 18% lower, their worst year since 2008. 
On the other hand, technology stocks, seen as winners of the work-from-home trend, are up 12%.

LONDON (Reuters) -World stocks ticked up on Wednesday, as a last-minute intervention by President Donald Trump dampened positive sentiment over a U.S. stimulus deal, while the pound rose on the possibility of a Brexit agreement.

In a video posted on Twitter, Trump said a stimulus bill, agreed after months of wrangling in Congress, was ""a disgrace"" and that he wanted to increase ""ridiculously low"" $600 checks for individuals to $2,000.
""Trump has derailed U.S. fiscal hopes, refusing to sign the $900 billion pandemic relief bill that was passed after a long-drawn stalemate between Democrats and Republicans,"" analysts at Mizuho wrote in a note to clients. 
""And so, hopes for an unambiguous ""Santa rally"" have been tragically hijacked.""
Some traders said Trump's push for higher stimulus could lead to a spending increase.
The bill could be amended if the congressional leadership wants to do so, and if they don't, Trump's choices are to sign the bill into law, veto it, or do nothing and let it become law. 
The stimulus funds are needed as the U.S. recovery stalls and hospitals struggle to cope with a nationwide spike in coronavirus infections at the same time as an even more contagious variant of the disease spreads quickly in Britain.
The possibility of a delay to such long-awaited and hard-fought spending plans sent S&P 500 futures down as far as 1% below the index's Tuesday close, but they recovered to trade 0.22% higher.
The MSCI world stock index rose 0.23%, though it was trading more than 1% below record highs struck last week. The index is eyeing gains of over 12% for 2020, as trillions of dollars in stimulus have outweighed pandemic pain this year.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan snapped three days of declines with a 0.6% rise, led by a jump in electric vehicle stocks in South Korea and China after LG Electronics announced a production deal.

WEDNESDAY DEAL?
Britain and the European Union are nearing a Dec 31 deadline for a Brexit transition period and have yet to agree on a trade deal.
 ITV  (LON:ITV)'s political editor said in a late-night tweet that separate sources had raised the possibility of the two sides striking a deal on Wednesday.
""Sterling is off its lows - there's a little twinkle of optimism around that deal,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
However, a British minister said on Wednesday that serious issues remained unresolved.
The minister also said he hoped trucks would start crossing into France again on Wednesday after Paris lifted its ban on freight coming from Britain because of the new coronavirus variant.
Sterling rose 0.4% against the dollar above $1.34 and strengthened against the euro to 90.82 pence.

(Reuters) - Polish video game maker CD Projekt SA said it sold more than 13 million copies of its Cyberpunk 2077 game through Dec. 20, below analyst forecasts, hurt in part by refunds demanded by players who complained it was littered with bugs.
A futuristic role-playing game featuring Hollywood star Keanu Reeves, Cyberpunk 2077 was widely seen as one of the biggest premieres this year. 
""This figure represents the estimated volume of retail sales across all hardware platforms (factoring in returns),"" CD Projekt said.
The company had not given sales forecasts and did not disclose how many refund requests it had received but the sales fell short of market expectations of 16.4 million, said analyst Piotr Bogusz at mBank brokerage.
""While the number ranks Cyberpunk as one of the top selling titles this year, it implies lower PC sales or higher refunds on consoles than we anticipated after launch, likely due to the various bugs and performance issue on PCs other than the high performance ones,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note.
The game, released on Dec. 10, got off to a rocky start after a backlash over technical glitches led Sony Corp (T:6758) to pull it from its PlayStation Store and Xbox maker  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) to offer refunds.
The game's troubled roll-out sent CD Projekt's shares tumbling 40% from a record touched before its release.

The shares were down 5% as of 0805 GMT on Wednesday, after opening higher.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Production and delivery challenges set up turbulent Year of the Vaccine,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - As 2020 closes, regulatory approval of COVID-19 vaccines has raised hopes the world can defeat the pandemic next year. But production and delivery challenges suggest beating the disease will be a marathon whose finish line is still far away. 
Europe on Monday followed Britain and the United States in giving a green light to a COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its partner BioNTech which, like a similar shot from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) that has U.S. emergency approval, demonstrated 95% efficacy in large trials.
The rapid approval of vaccines, just a year after the new coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China, is testament to the huge global effort made to tackle a pandemic that has killed over 1.7 million people, battered economies and upended life. 
Scientists identified promising candidates after just weeks, not the years normally needed, and millions of doses are already rolling out of factories. 
The progress comes, however, as many countries endure a bleak winter, with infections surging, a new fast-spreading variant of the virus in Britain and countries worldwide imposing new restrictions on travel and everyday life.
A third vaccine from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University has also been shown to prevent COVID-19, though questions over the level of its efficacy have left them with more work to do to win over some regulators.
Still, the progress has been breathtaking.
""It's unprecedented that you have three potential vaccines developed in a short period that are all promising,"" said Marcel Tanner, president of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences and a Swiss COVID-19 Science Task Force member. 
Inoculations have begun in Britain and the United States, with shipments also going to Canada, Israel and Mexico. EU countries have said shots will start days after Christmas, while Switzerland and Qatar authorised Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine at the weekend.
Even so, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin predicted on Tuesday the ""new normal"" would see society dealing with sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks for the next decade, with multiple vaccines helping to avoid business shutdowns and overloaded hospitals.
""This winter we will not have an impact on the infection numbers, but we must have an impact so that the next winter will be the new normal,"" Sahin said.
More than 100 other vaccine candidates are in the works, with trial data on several expected soon. 
Vaccine experts say multiple shots will be needed to provide enough doses to inoculate the world, from rich to poor. 
The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations expects up to 10 vaccines to have won approval by mid-2021, including from U.S. companies Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Germany's CureVac.
LIMITED SUPPLIES
Yet huge challenges remain, including ramping up production.
Pfizer expects to produce just 50 million shots for 2020, half its original goal, covering 25 million people with its two-dose regimen. Moderna has pledged 20 million U.S. inoculations this year, covering 10 million people.
Manufacturing will accelerate in 2021, with combined production potentially topping 1.8 billion doses. 
Other companies' trajectories are similar, but supplies won't come fast enough for a world hungry for vaccines.
""There just aren't going to be enough vaccines to go around for a long time ... maybe well into 2022,"" said Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
There have also been early hiccups related to storing and delivering Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine that must be kept at Antarctic temperatures, as well as confusion over how many doses are actually in a vial.
Allergic reactions in some UK and U.S. health care workers have also emerged.
And though trials involving tens of thousands have shown the new mRNA technology used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna appears safe, there is still plenty of hesitancy among people over actually getting shots when their number is called. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 60% of people need to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, meaning enough people are protected for the disease to stop spreading. 
Developing countries hoping to access vaccines via a global WHO-backed scheme may have to wait, as wealthier countries have reserved initial stocks.
So far, the West is focused largely on inoculating front-line medical workers and older nursing home residents, where even in limited volumes vaccines could make a difference for populations hardest hit by the virus. 
Eighty percent of the 300,000-plus U.S. COVID-19 deaths have been people over 65, the CDC has said.
""This might take care of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis even if, due to vaccine scepticism, no herd immunity is reached,"" said Christian Muenz, University of Zurich professor of viral immunobiology. 
HITS, MISSES
So far, Russia has inoculated 200,000-plus people with its home-grown Sputnik-V shot, whose developers say it is 91.4% effective. The country has also signed production deals, including with India.
In China, where one Sinovac Biotech candidate and two from China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) are in late-stage trials, health workers and border official have gotten shots, amid spending to boost production.
Sinopharm's vaccine is registered in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, with Egypt also getting deliveries, while Sinovac has deals to supply Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia.
Other Chinese vaccines, including from CanSino Biologics, are also in late-stage trials. 
However, not all vaccine projects hit the bullseye. 
 Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) delayed their candidate after it failed to protect older people.
An Australian project also flopped.

And questions still surround AstraZeneca's vaccine, whose efficacy was 62% among patients who received two full doses. 
Eric Topol, founder of California-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines would be tough acts to follow.
""We can't accept 62% when you can get 95%,"" Topol said. ""It would have been good enough if we didn't have anything else.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A coronavirus vaccine trade could emerge in Asia's capital markets in 2021 with dealmakers confident the record-breaking pace of raisings in the past year should be maintained in the new year.
Equity capital markets (ECM) deals in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, totalled $439.1 billion in 2020, the highest ever, which accounted for 41% of the world's total of$1.06 trillion according to Refinitiv data.
The contribution by the Asian region to the global total value of capital raisings was the most since 2010 which advisers attributed to some countries, led by China, emerging from the pandemic faster than the rest of the world. 
In Asia, healthcare deals recorded the strongest growth in the past year, up 148.6% in terms of money raised, and bankers believe the global roll out of the coronavirus vaccine will see the sector dominate the local capitals market again in 2021.
""There is a window of opportunity for COVID-related trades to raise money in 2021,"" said Selina Cheung, managing director of Asia ECM origination at UBS in Hong Kong.
""We expect to see more health-related and vaccine companies coming to the market in the first half.""
The pace of capital market activity throughout the year surprised dealmakers who had expected reduced activity until unprecedented liquidity from governments and central banks began flooding the global system.
Almost $7.5 trillion has been spent by global central banks in 2020 to cushion the economic impacts created by coronavirus, according to the IMF's annual report published in November.
""A lot of people did not expect this level of activity in the market but it's been very welcome and it's been a good boost to the economy as it has injected a lot of capital that has been needed,"" said Kenneth Ho, Managing Director of ECM at Haitong International.
""The market is driven by liquidity and it should remain in place for a while to come.""
Hong Kong will finish 2020 as the world's second most popular IPO venue behind the Nasdaq with 119 deals worth $31.21 billion, the Refinitiv data showed.
""We see a sizeable pool of companies that have reached a certain scale in their business where they are ready to become public, and we expect investors in 2021 will continue to be open to looking at such companies across different sectors,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s head of ECM for Asia Pacific, Johnson Chui, said in regard to Hong Kong's IPO prospects.
The $37 billion Ant Group IPO, shelved in November when China announced a new regulatory regime for fintech companies, would have propelled Hong Kong to the top of the global rankings.
Mega deals like Kuaishou Technology, which could raise up to $5 billion, and JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics which is aiming to raise up to $2 billion, according to Reuters reports, are being closed watched for the first half of the new year.

Bankers are also on the lookout for an IPO from Didi Chuxing, which is considering a Hong Kong IPO in 2021 that would value it at up to $60 billion, according to sources.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning, with gains muted after U.S. President Donald Trump said he is asking Congress to amend a COVID-19 bill passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate on Monday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.12% by 10:02 PM ET (3:02 AM GMT). The Bank of Japan released its October monetary policy meeting minutes earlier in the day, in which a member expressed concern that “deflation might take hold” if COVID-19 spreads again and pushes down economic activity, so this “possibly warranted attention” in guiding monetary policy.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.61%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.54%. The cluster of COVID-19 cases in Sydney’s Northern Beaches area grew to 97, and authorities extended the current lockdown over the Christmas holidays to curb the spread of the virus in the city.
Decisions on the lockdown in terms of New Year’s Eve celebrations and upcoming sporting events will be made after Christmas, New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched up 0.07%. China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.45% and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.72%.
Trump said on Tuesday that he may not sign the COVID-19 bill, calling it an unsuitable “disgrace.” Although he stopped short of threatening to veto the legislation, he asked to be sent a “suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID-19 relief package.”
Although Trump’s threat could delay the deployment of stimulus checks to Americans who are struggling amid the pandemic, President-elect Joe Biden said his administration will put forward another COVID-19 relief package early next year. Biden warned that the “darkest days in the battle against COVID-19 are ahead of us.”
Some investors were surprised at the reaction to the news of the bill’s passage.
“It’s interesting to note the very muted response from investors globally to the U.S. stimulus package. It doesn’t seem to be the magic bullet investors once thought it was,” CMC Markets Chief Markets Strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the new B.1.1.7 strain of the COVID-19 virus that was first recorded in the U.K. and the rollout of COVID- vaccines, continue to feature on investors’ radars.
The B.1.1.7 strain has already seen London and southeastern England put under Tier 4 lockdowns and caused travel chaos, with more than 40 countries shutting their borders to the U.K. The Philippines banned all U.K. flights from Dec. 24 earlier in the day. The U.K. government is also under pressure as it works towards reaching a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union (EU). The EU has rejected U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s latest concessions on fishing rights.
A recent global stocks rally was already looking fragile after seeing a record high during the previous week, and the recent developments have added fresh jitters.
“This is yet another catalyst to inspire people to cash out,” DailyFX strategist Ilya Spivak told Bloomberg."
1379,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>",U.S. approves NYSE listing plan to cut out Wall Street middlemen,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies can raise capital on the New York Stock Exchange through direct listings, without losing gains if their stock pops or forking out hefty fees to Wall Street banks, which typically underwrite such capital raisings, the U.S. securities regulator said on Tuesday.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of the NYSE's ""direct"" listing plan threatens to overhaul the U.S. initial public offering market, by allowing aspiring public companies to sell shares directly to investors.
Investment banks have for decades organized IPOs, marketed them to institutions and supported the stock via their trading desks.
The change, following months of industry haggling, will help reduce what critics call excessive underwriter fees, a major barrier to companies looking to go public. It is especially important to technology companies and start-ups, both of which would stand to gain greatly from the new SEC ruling. 
""This is a game changer for our capital markets, leveling the playing field for everyday investors and providing companies with another path to go public at a moment when they are seeking just this type of innovation,"" NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said in a statement.
Lev Bagramian, an advocate of the Washington-based Better Markets, said ""while many have falsely blamed certain pro-investor regulations as too costly for companies that are considering going public, the real cost has been the average 7% - or higher for smaller issuers - that issuers pay to big Wall Street firms to underwrite the IPO.""
The new form of direct listings has the potential to ""democratize the IPO process"" when done in a responsible way that maintains strong investor protections, he added.
Some investor groups, however, warned it could diminish their protections, because banks perform due diligence on the companies.
""The lack of a traditional underwriter means investors will lose a key protection: a gatekeeper incented to ensure that the disclosures around an initial listing are accurate and not misleading,” said SEC Democratic Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Allison Lee, who voted against the approval of NYSE’s rule.
The SEC said it found the NYSE proposal will ""facilitate the orderly distribution and trading of shares, as well as foster competition.""
The plan was designed to ""prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest,"" it added.
The commission had previously allowed direct listings for companies that did not raise capital in the process. 
In 2018, music streaming business  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) was the first major company to go public via that route. Direct listings had also been limited to companies wanting to give early investors or management the opportunity to cash out by selling stock.
Peter Thiel-backed Palantir Technologies and Asana are some of the high-profile, cash-rich private start-ups to choose the direct listing route this year.
Under the NYSE plan, issuers can sell shares directly on the exchange in an auction, which would increase opportunities for more investors to purchase shares at the initial offering price, rather than having to wait to buy in the aftermarket.
That could make direct listings more common, since most companies go public to raise capital.
What's more, under the NYSE plan, new shares will get priority over secondary ones. This will give companies a better chance of reaching their fundraising goals.
NYSE rival Nasdaq Inc has a filed a similar direct listing proposal with the SEC.

""It was not a quick process to get this change through the SEC, which put a lot of effort into balancing the rights of investors versus the desire of more companies to have direct listing as an option,"" said Michael Hermsen, a Chicago-based partner at law firm Mayer Brown.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>","U.S. sues Walmart saying pharmacies fueled opioid crisis, retailer rejects allegations","By David Shepardson and Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc on Tuesday, accusing the world's biggest retailer of fueling the opioid crisis in the United States, ignoring warning signs from its pharmacists and filling thousands of invalid prescriptions.
In a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the government said Walmart failed to take its gatekeeping duties as a pharmacy seriously, allegations the company rejected.
Walmart, whose shares closed down 1.2% following the news, said in a statement that the ""Justice Department’s investigation is tainted by historical ethics violations, and this lawsuit invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies.""
Walmart created a system that turned its 5,000 in-store pharmacies into a supplier of highly addictive painkillers, dating as early as June 2013, the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit marked one of the most significant actions the Justice Department has taken in response to the epidemic targeting companies accused of contributing to it.
Last month, prosecutors secured a guilty plea from Purdue related to its sales of opioids and it previously prosecuted multiple executives at the opioid maker Insys Therapeutics accused of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive drug.
Insys filed for bankruptcy last year after striking a deal with the government in which a subsidiary pled guilty to fraud charges.
The three largest drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  (NYSE:CAH) - along with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are in talks with state attorneys general to resolve the opioid lawsuits for a combined $26 billion.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and the drugmaker  Mallinckrodt  (OTC:MNKKQ) have filed for bankruptcy protection as part of their own multibillion dollar proposals to resolve the lawsuits.
The companies have denied the underlying allegations.
Walmart's ""unlawful"" actions helped ""fuel a national crisis"" and had ""disastrous consequences,"" Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, said at a press briefing.
Asked if the government was planning on bringing criminal charges, Clark said ""you should not draw any inferences about any criminal matters"" from the civil filing.
Walmart called the lawsuit a ""transparent attempt to shift blame from the (Drug Enforcement Administration) well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place.""
Acting DEA Administrator Timothy Shea said in a statement ""when pharmacies routinely fill illegitimate prescriptions, we will hold accountable anyone responsible, including Walmart. Too many lives have been lost because of oversight failures and those entrusted with responsibility turning a blind eye.""
More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed nationally by states, counties and municipalities seeking to hold drug manufacturers and distributors responsible for fueling an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018.
According to the lawsuit, Walmart ""unlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions."" The lawsuit said that ""for years, Walmart kept in place a system that it knew was failing to adequately detect and report suspicious orders.""
The government accused Walmart of violating the Controlled Substances Act. If found liable, it could face civil penalties of up to $67,627 for each unlawful prescription filled and $15,691 for each suspicious order not reported. 
Walmart said on Tuesday that ""by demanding pharmacists and pharmacies second-guess doctors, the Justice Department is putting pharmacists and pharmacies between a rock and a hard place with state health regulators who say they are already going too far in refusing to fill opioid prescriptions.""

In October, Walmart filed a lawsuit in Texas against the federal government seeking clarity on the roles and legal responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies in filling opioid prescriptions.

""He refused to take the meeting"", said Musk, CEO of electric-car maker Tesla, replying to a Twitter chain which cited a Reuters story on Apple looking to produce a passenger vehicle by 2024 with a new battery technology.
During 2017 and 2018, Tesla struggled to ramp up high volume production of the Model 3 sedan, with Musk at the time informing investors the company was mired in ""production hell"" because of problems with automated production systems at its battery factory in Reno, Nevada. 
However, Tesla overcame the problems and has since racked up a string of quarterly profits. The electric automaker became one of the most valuable companies to join the S&P 500 when it became part of the widely followed stock index on Monday.
Shares of Tesla, however, ended 6.5% lower in its S&P 500 debut, amid news of potential competition from Apple.
Apple's automotive efforts, known as Project Titan, have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch.
Central to the company's strategy for auto production is a new battery design that could ""radically"" reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle's range.
In the same Twitter chain, Musk said ""monocell"", which Apple plans to use in its design, ""is electrochemically impossible as max voltage is ~100X too low"" unless they are bonded together. 
Apple declined to comment while Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","Unilever expands deal with Burger King to launch meat-free Whopper in Latin America, China","By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc said on Wednesday it had expanded its partnership with Burger King to supply its plant-based meat patties for Whopper burgers at restaurants in Latin America, the Caribbean and China.
The product, which will be called the Plant-based Whopper on menus, is made using patties from Vegetarian Butcher, a company Unilever acquired in 2019. 
The deal is an expansion of the Dove soap to Hellmann's mayonnaise maker's partnership with the fast-food chain that started last year with the launch of the Rebel Whopper burger in Europe , Burger King's biggest ever product launch in the region. 
Burger King sells several meat-free versions of its popular Whopper burger, including one from Impossible Meats in the United States.
Unilever said the Plant-based Whopper would appear on menus in 325 Burger King outlets in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hangzhou in China, with plans to expand its rollout nationwide in the second quarter of 2021.
The burger - made from ingredients including soy, wheat, vegetable oil, herbs and onion - already launched in Mexico on Nov. 30.
Launches in other Latin American and Caribbean markets such as Costa Rica, Colombia, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Suriname, Saint Maarten and Saint Kitts have been taking place over the last couple of weeks, Unilever said.
The Plant-based Whopper is expected to be priced similarly to its beef counterpart in these markets, though prices may vary between franchises.
The move underscores Unilever's efforts to strengthen its foothold in the exploding market for plant-based food, which has seen a surge during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts predict that the alternative meat industry will become a $140 billion market over the next decade.

It also comes just weeks after the London-based consumer goods conglomerate set a 1 billion euro sales target from its plant-based meat and dairy products over the next five to seven years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 lost ground on Tuesday as concerns over a new variant of the coronavirus and disappointing economic data stole the thunder from Washington's passage of a long-awaited pandemic relief bill.
The Dow also closed lower, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) helped push the tech-heavy Nasdaq's to an all-time closing high.
Small caps advanced, with the Russell 2000 also closing at a record level.
""Today the market is catching its breath,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It's digesting the two big pieces of news we've gotten in the last 24 hours, the stimulus and the new COVID strain.""
Apple was an outlier amid a broad sell-off, gaining 2.8% and providing the biggest lift to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on news of the company's plans to roll out an electric passenger vehicle by 2024. 
Overnight, Congress passed a pandemic relief package worth $892 billion after months of a partisan tug-of-war, aimed at propping up an economic recovery faltering under the weight of restrictions aimed at containing a coronavirus resurgence.
That resurgence continues to swell, infecting 214,000 Americans every day, prompting mandatory shutdowns and pushing hospitals to capacity.
A fast-spreading new variant of the virus discovered in Britain has brought movement in and out of the UK to a halt and sent vaccine makers  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc scrambling to ensure their drugs were effective against it.
Fears of the coronavirus and optimism about an eventual economic recovery made for extreme volatility on Wall Street in 2020, with the S&P 500 logging daily gains or losses of 2% or more over 40 times in the year so far, the most in over a decade.
""This will be the first year in history when stocks were off 30% for the year at one point and finished in the green,"" Detrick said. ""It's truly an amazing round-trip and we've never seen anything like it.""
On the economic front, consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped while sales of pre-owned U.S. homes posted their first decline in six months. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200.94 points, or 0.67%, to 30,015.51, the S&P 500 lost 7.66 points, or 0.21%, to 3,687.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.40 points, or 0.51%, to 12,807.92.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, only tech and real estate ended the session in positive territory. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell 1.5%, extending its slide on its second day as a S&P 500 constituent.
Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc jumped 11.6% as brokers hiked their price targets on the stock on the heels of the company's announcement that it would buy peer Precor in a deal worth $420 million.
 Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) slid 2.8% after disappointing results from a late-stage study of an asthma drug developed in a partnership with British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 323 new highs and 11 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.02 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com - The Dow closed lower Tuesday as signs the consumer is in fragile shape during the crucial holiday period weighed on sentiment and overshadowed the approval of the $900 billion stimulus package on Capitol Hill.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.67%, or 200 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.51%.
The Conference board’s consumer confidence gauge fell to 88.6 in December from 92.9 in September, missing economists' forecast for a reading of 97.
""Confidence overall is likely to get worse before it gets better, but another round of stimulus should help to soften the blow a little bit, bridging the gap to the post-vaccine world,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
U.S. lawmakers passed a $900 billion stimulus bill that will include direct payments to Americans and small businesses, with about $8 billion of aid in support of the vaccine distribution.
President-elect Joe Biden touted further stimulus to come in the new year.  ""Congress did its job this week,"" Biden said. ""I can and I must ask them to do it again next year,"" he added. 
Optimism over the successful passage of a stimulus bill was growing in recent weeks, helping markets extend their gains into overbought territory, raising the prospect of profit taking.

""Given the small fraction of US infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,"" The Centers for Disease Control said Tuesday.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) were down more than 2%.  
In technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the biggest gainers on the day as investors continued to digest reports the company is considering an entry into the electric vehicle market as soon as 2024. A potential Apple car would also include battery technology, offering competition to runaway leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

1. Data will be released early because of the holiday-shortened week
If you like economic data, Christmas is coming a few days early with a slew of indicators set to be released in the holiday-shortened week. Personal income for November is set to drop 0.3% according to consensus, but at a slower pace than the previous 0.7% decline. Consumption is forecast to turn slightly negative. Those are both due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
2. Jobless claims
Jobless claims are expected to stay elevated, mirroring virus case numbers. Consensus is for initial jobless claims to be 885,000, same as the prior week. That, along with durable goods orders, are also due at 8:30 AM ET. Also on tap: new home sales and the final December reading of University of Michigan sentiment.
3. Bye-bye Barr
And finally, we'll be saying goodbye to Attorney General William Barr. Wednesday will be his final day in office before he hands over the reins of the Justice Department to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Look for President Trump to possibly pressure the new guy into initiating various investigations in his final weeks in office.

Rosemary Vrablic, a managing director and senior banker in the lender's wealth management division, recently handed in her resignation, which the bank accepted effective as of year-end, Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) spokesman Dan Hunter said in an emailed statement.
According to the New York Times, which first reported Vrablic's resignation, she arranged for the lender to grant hundreds of millions of dollars of loans to Trump's company.
The resignation of another longtime colleague of Vrablic, Dominic Scalzi, has also been accepted by the bank, Hunter said, without mentioning reasons for the resignations.
Vrablic and Scalzi both joined Deutsche Bank in 2006 from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
The Times reported that Deutsche Bank in August opened an internal review into a 2013 real estate transaction between Vrablic and Scalzi and a company owned in part by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a client of Vrablic.
Reuters reported last month that Deutsche Bank was looking for ways to end its relationship with Trump after the U.S. elections, following negative publicity stemming from the ties.
The German bank, which first started lending to Trump in the late 1990s, has been dragged into congressional and other investigations looking into the real estate mogul-turned-politician's finances and alleged Russia connections.

As of November, Deutsche Bank has about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, currently overseen by his two eldest sons.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -American Airlines is beginning the phased return of furloughed workers after the U.S. Congress passed a pandemic aid package with $15 billion in payroll support for airlines, its executives said in a staff memo on Tuesday.
""While pay and benefits will be restored right away, people will be asked to return to the operation in phases,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo, released by American.
Air passenger traffic is down by about 70% versus a year ago as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the travel industry. U.S. airlines furloughed tens of thousands of employees when an initial $25 billion in federal payroll support that banned job cuts expired in October.
United Airlines executives warned on Monday that its recall of furloughed employees after the fresh aid would be ""temporary,"" saying ""we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months.""
American said the relief would help airlines serve passengers once the pandemic subsides, and in the nearer term, aid in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and other critical supplies.
Airlines have said they do not expect a robust travel recovery until vaccines or effective treatments are widely available. 
American, which has furloughed nearly 19,000 employees since October, stands to receive roughly $3 billion from the payroll package, one person briefed on the matter said.
The new aid package includes similar conditions as the previous one, such as caps on executive compensation and share buybacks, and requires airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time, offer the government warrants, and restore some routes. 
The program could stave off job reductions for the time being at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which has asked unions to accept pay cuts to prevent its first-ever furloughs next year.
A Southwest spokesman said the company had no updates on the potential furloughs and would closely examine the final terms and conditions of the program once the bill becomes law.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","U.S. lenders score small business relief, accounting help in pandemic package","By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The long-awaited nearly $900 billion U.S. pandemic aid package will help banks by boosting borrowers' finances, easing a key small-business lending program's rules and by granting accounting relief on deferred loan payments, lobbyists and analysts said. 
After months of partisan wrangling, the U.S. Congress over the weekend struck a deal on another pandemic aid package, including one-time $600 checks for most Americans, extended unemployment benefits of $300 per week and $284 billion more for the small business Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. 
Passed by lawmakers Monday night, the package includes a number of measures that the industry, potentially facing more than $300 billion in losses on souring loans through 2022, according to consultancy Deloitte, had lobbied for aggressively to bolster their books and help their customers. 
Those efforts extended through the weekend, with industry lobbyists making last-ditch calls to lawmakers to push for their asks in the final text, lobbyists said.
Rob Nichols, chief executive of Washington trade group the American Bankers Association, said on Tuesday that the deal should provide much-needed relief to families and workers.
""Importantly, this agreement contains several ABA-supported provisions... that will allow banks to provide additional help to individual and business customers under financial stress from the pandemic,"" he said in a statement. 
Among the biggest wins is a new streamlined process for writing off PPP loans. Under the program, lenders have dished out more than five million loans worth a total of $525 billion, on behalf of the government. 
Bank groups had complained that the documentation the government required to forgive those loans was too onerous and risked leaving borrowers with crushing debts and lenders with millions of high-risk, barely profitable loans. 
The bill simplifies forgiveness for loans of $150,000 or less, allowing businesses to attest on a one-page form that they used the funds for payroll and other businesses expenses. It also allows those expenses to qualify for deductions, simplifying tax returns for millions of borrowers.
It also tightens language promising lenders will not be held responsible if borrowers break the PPP rules, pledging no enforcement action may be taken against the lender if they acted in good faith and complied with relevant federal and state regulations. That should comfort lenders who had fretted they may be swept-up in a crackdown on PPP fraud. 
""It's an improvement over the current PPP program and has many fixes that needed to be addressed, and it extends some relief for the community banks and lenders to continue supporting small businesses,"" said Paul Merski, an executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers (NASDAQ:ESXB) of America. 
That relief included a year-long extension of a provision, originally due to expire on Dec. 31, which has made it easier for banks to give borrowers leeway on repayments by waiving the usual accounting treatment for modified loans.
The median rate of deferred loans relative to assets for U.S. banks tracked by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) was 1.6% in the third quarter, down from 5.3% in the prior quarter, as borrower stress eased. But that rate could rise again if the economy underperforms.
Had the waiver expired, banks would curtail their loan modification programs rather than incur the increased capital charges and regulatory scrutiny that come with the normal accounting treatment, said lobbyists.
""This will be very helpful for credit unions and banks working with borrowers,"" said Ryan Donovan, chief advocacy officer at the Credit Union National Association, who had pushed for the extension.

Users could purchase a hardware key from retailers, and register it with Facebook, the company said, confirming an earlier report https:// by news website Axios.
The world's largest social network said it also plans to expand Facebook Protect -its security program for high-profile accounts including election candidates - to more types of accounts globally next year.
The rollout of new security services follows a July hack of peer social network  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) which compromised many celebrity accounts, including those of President-elect Joe Biden and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.
Currently available in the United States, Facebook Protect offers a way for politicians, government agencies and election staff to set up additional security provisions such as two-factor authentication and real-time monitoring for potential hacking threats.

It will now be available to users like journalists and human rights activists who are at a higher risk of being targeted by sophisticated hackers, Facebook added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The so-called ""stay-at-home"" trade will not end next year even if the pandemic is defeated, according to managers of the top-performing U.S. mutual fund managers of 2020. They are continuing to bet on those stocks. 
Funds that went early into stocks such as  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc and telemedicine company Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc saw their returns soar this year as more aspects of everyday life went online. Yet the announcements of successful coronavirus vaccines by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in early November have helped broaden the market rally to financial, energy and leisure stocks that would benefit from an economic rebound. That has pushed the return of the S&P 500 Value index up 5% since then, slightly ahead of the 4.1% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index. 
""It's likely that we could see a temporarily cyclical rotation as the vaccine rolls out in mass,"" said Anthony Zackery, a portfolio manger at Zevenbergen Capital Investments. Two of the funds that Zackery helps manage - the Zevenbergen Genea and the Zevenbergen Growth - gained more than 130% since the start of the year through Dec. 18, putting both within the top 10 best-performing U.S. actively managed equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar. The benchmark S&P 500, by comparison, is up 14.8% over the same time. 
GRAPHIC: The Best Actively-Managed U.S. Stock Funds of 2020 https://graphics.reuters.com/FUNDS-YEAREND/oakpejxqlvr/chart.png
Yet Zackery cautioned that he thinks a value trade will be short-lived. ""We don't think a vaccine and reopening of the economy will stop the inevitable adoption of telemedicine, ecommerce and some of the other secular trends we're watching,"" he said.
Zackery said his fund has found ""fertile ground"" and added some of the recent growth-focused companies that have gone public in the last few months despite their high valuations. 
""Even companies like Snowflake or Airbnb or DoorDash may have high market caps compared with industry comparables, but they are bringing in sales and revenue, unlike the companies of the dot-com era,"" he said. 
With $21.3 trillion in assets, the U.S. mutual fund industry is the largest in the world and one of the prime ways through which Americans save for retirement. Overall, U.S. households hold 89% of all assets held in mutual funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, making them one of the best proxies for retail investor returns. 
Gary Robinson, a portfolio manager at Baillie Gifford whose Baillie Gifford US Equity Growth fund has returned 133.7% since the start of the year through Dec. 18, said he remains focused on e-commerce and telemedicine stocks that have rallied this year and secular growth companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Among new additions to the portfolio this year were cloud communications platform company Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) Inc, which has rallied 271% for the year to date, and insurance company Lemonade Inc, which is up 53% since it went public in July.
""Even after you've seen relatively fast growth, you've still got a lot of room to go,"" he said. 
Michael Baron, a portfolio manager at Baron Capital whose Baron Partners fund is up 145.6% since the start of the year, said he sees no reason to change the fund's strategy of mixing high-growth companies in with financials and real estate companies. 
""There's a light at the end of the tunnel but we're not making dramatic changes to the portfolio post-COVID,"" he said. 
Among the fund's holdings are hotel operator Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp, which Baron expects to post higher margins in 2021 after it took steps to rein in costs such as laying off 1,300 people in May, and home-listing site Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) Inc, whose shares have jumped 206% year to date. 

""We just don't think we are going back to the old ways of doing business,"" Baron said.

(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dropped 4% on Tuesday, down for a second straight day following the electric car maker's debut in the S&P 500. 
The stock has lost 10% since Friday, when it hit a record high as investment funds that passively track the S&P 500 bought $90 billion worth of Tesla shares so that their portfolios reflected the changes to the Wall Street's most followed benchmark.
For a second day, Tesla's stock contributed more than any other to the S&P 500's decline. The S&P 500 was last down 0.1%.
Losses on Monday accelerated late in the session after Reuters reported that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.
Apple jumped over 3% on Tuesday, increasing the iPhone maker's stock market value by more than the entire value of General Motors (NYSE:GM).
Up over 600% in 2020, Tesla, run by Elon Musk, has become by far the world's most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) or General Motors.

With a market capitalization now at $590 billion, Tesla is the most valuable company ever admitted to the S&P 500.

Investing.com --  CarMax (NYSE:KMX) delivered on results, but also failed to increase same-store sales, which is now driving shares 7% lower.
Same store sales dropped 0.8% and total sales were lower by 1%, the company reported for the third quarter. That compares with increases of 7.5% and 11%, respectively, for the third quarter in 2019. The unexpected drop comes as used car sales overall have been rising as people quit flying and move out to the suburbs.
The used-vehicle sales pace has been declining since peaking in mid-July, according to Cox Automotive. In June and July, used vehicle sales climbed rapidly and were running between 10% and 15% above summer 2019. Since then, the sales pace has fallen, turning negative in August and hitting a low point of down 17% in mid-November.     
""Demand softened and sales trended down in the latter part of the quarter,"" CarMax said in a statement. ""Some of the factors that we believe impacted sales were the surge in COVID-19 cases, which constrained demand and resulted in tightened occupancy restrictions and shelter-in-place orders from state and local governments, as well as the uncertainty around the election and future stimulus programs.   
CarMax reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.42, better than the expected $1.14, on sales of $5.18 billion, which compares to the estimated $5.04 billion. 
Shares of CarMax hit a record in August, and have since fallen 13%. 
Rival AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN) is trading down nearly 2% and  Penske Automotive Group Inc  (NYSE:PAG) is also in the red.

Investing.com --  IAC jumped 14% after saying it would spin off Vimeo, its video software company, to shareholders of the mother company. 
Vimeo, which serves more than 200 million users, is the 42nd most popular digital service in the U.S., according to a YouGov survey. Vimeo's November revenue grew 54% from a year earlier, and subscribers increased by 24%.It will become the 11th company to emerge from IAC and its predecessors, and comes amid a splash of initial public offerings and companies listing via reverse mergers. Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) and DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH)each soared on their opening days earlier this month. On Monday, SoftBank filed for an initial public offering for its special purpose acquisition company, hoping to raise $525 million to invest in a technology company.
IAC had said in November that it was looking at spinning off Vimeo, at the time valued at $2.75 billion. Earlier that month, it had raised $150 million in equity from Thrive Capital and GIC.
IAC plans to hold a stockholder meeting in the first quarter of 2021 to review and approve a proposal to implement the spin-off, which, if approved, is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021.
The transaction is anticipated to take the form of a reclassification of IAC shares, with the effect of IAC stockholders receiving a proportionate amount of Vimeo stock.  
""It's time for Vimeo to spread its wings and become a great independent public company,"" said IAC Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin in a statement
The separation is expected to afford numerous benefits, such as the creation of ""pure-play"" Vimeo equity currency through which the company could more effectively raise capital as it aims to invest further in product, technology, enterprise sales and international expansion and pursue strategic acquisitions.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Alaska Airlines agrees to buy 23 Boeing 737 MAX jets,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Alaska Airlines has agreed to buy 23 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX 9 jets, the companies said on Tuesday, confirming an Oct. 8 Reuters report that the U.S. planemaker was in talks with Alaska to stimulate demand for the jet's comeback. 
The order, worth some $2.96 billion at list prices before expected steep discounts, comes less than three weeks after European budget airline Ryanair also placed a lifeline order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX jets.
Boeing is battling to build momentum for the 737 MAX as its cash-cow jetliner re-enters commercial service following a 20-month safety ban triggered by fatal crashes.
""We like to keep the balance sheet strong so that in times like this we can be contrarian and make moves to fundamentally improve the competitive position of the company,"" Alaska Airlines Chief Executive Brad Tilden told Reuters.
Tilden declined to discuss the final price tag, or whether France-based Airbus had submitted a rival proposal.
The deal was expected to include significant discounts given the 737 MAX's recent woes and plunging demand for airplanes during the coronavirus crisis, industry sources have said.
Even at a fraction of the MAX's list price of $129 million, the deal could help Boeing to stem a cash hemorrhage caused by a stockpile of roughly 450 undelivered MAX jets.
The deal also accelerates a shift in Alaska's fleet back towards Boeing from Airbus. Alaska Airlines operated an all-Boeing fleet until it acquired Virgin America in 2016.
Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, the fifth largest U.S. passenger carrier, flies 166 older Boeing 737s and 71 Airbus A320-family aircraft.
Alaska, which already had ordered 37 MAXs before the grounding, has one of the strongest balance sheets among U.S. airlines. Analysts believe it could become more competitive than its peers after the pandemic.

In late November,  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK) Group Inc said it would lease 13 new Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes from Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp, and said it would sell 10 Airbus A320s to Air Lease.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Reserve ordered  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Friday to strengthen its anti-money laundering policies after bank examiners found deficiencies in its U.S. operations.
The order directs the bank to adopt a formal plan to overhaul its policies within 90 days to ensure it is appropriately monitoring for illicit activity, and regularly report to the regulator on its progress.
In a statement, the bank said it was committed to meeting the terms of the order ""in a timely and thorough manner,"" and was already pursuing an ""extensive enhancement plan"" to its New York operations.
The enforcement order, reached jointly with the New York Department of Financial Services, comes days after Swiss prosecutors charged the bank over alleged failings related to a Bulgarian crime ring accused of laundering cocaine trafficking proceeds. An unnamed former bank manager was also indicted in the Swiss Federal Criminal Court.

Credit Suisse ""unreservedly"" rejected those allegations, adding it was convinced its ex-employee was innocent and it had improved its operations since the alleged activity took place.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Relatives of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX crash victims on Tuesday urged the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to delay approving the aircraft's return to service, saying there are unanswered questions about its safety.
Last month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared the jet following design changes around systems involved in two crashes that together killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, sparking a global grounding and safety reviews.
EASA has said it could formally lift its own ban next month, once public and industry feedback on its conditions for putting the jet back into service have been studied.
In a letter to EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky and in comments filed with the agency, relatives and friends of Ethiopian Airlines crash victims said it should first finish its analysis of the modified aircraft and complete its safety report on the crash.
""It would be impossible for EASA to conclude that the revised 737 MAX is safe before its own safety assessment is complete,"" they said in the letter.
An EASA spokesman said the agency does not comment on any received feedback at this stage of the recertification process. It plans to publish the final airworthiness directive in January, once all the feedback has been reviewed, he said.
The families also called into question the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's decision to lift its flight ban following a Senate Commerce Committee report on Friday that concluded the agency and Boeing officials colluded during 737 MAX recertification testing.

They urged EASA to explain why Boeing's changes make the aircraft safe and to require that it increase the plane's safety margins by implementing a third Angle of Attack sensor. They also called for redesigning the flight deck and crew alert system ""to meet modern safety standards,"" among other steps.

Investing.com --  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 4% on news it's getting back into the car business. 
The tech company expects to build a self-driving passenger vehicle with its own breakthrough battery technology by 2024 in what is being called ""Project Titan,"" Reuters reported, citing people familiar. Apple started working on a car project in 2014, only to dump it last year.  
It's the latest in tech companies moving into self-driving. Rival Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has already built a robo-taxi service called Waymo, and just a few weeks, Uber (NYSE:UBER) sold its ATG self-driving unit to start-up Aurora to create a company with a $10 billion valuation, Forbes reported.
The battery is key to the Apple car to reduce costs and expand range, Reuters reported, again citing a person familiar with the situation. The company will work with third parties for elements of the system, including lidar sensors.     
The news prompted some skepticism. 
Citi analyst Jim Suva offered insights into the impact on the company
""Apple conducts R&D in many areas, and while we are not surprised to hear the media once again discuss Project Titan for autos, we are very skeptical that Apple will actually produce a car, as auto sector profitability is much lower,"" Suva said in a note, according to StreetInsider. ""Rather, we believe the outcome of this is likely a further push by Apple of its operating system into consumer and enterprise markets (Apple’s CarPlay coupled with Apple’s cloud and analytics)"".
Apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers, according to Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.
“My initial reaction as a shareholder is, huh?” he told Reuters. “Still don’t really see the appeal of the car business, but Apple may be eyeing another angle than what I’m seeing.”

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Confusion reigns as companies, industries try to navigate U.S. COVID-19 vaccine rollout","By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies and industry groups trying to move their workers to the front of the line for a COVID-19 vaccine remain confused about conflicting state and local guidelines on how shots will be administered and to which workers, even as millions of doses make their way across the country.
An independent advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday voted that 30 million essential workers are next in line for vaccines. Those vaccinations are expected to start in January or February.
While states often follow CDC guidelines, they generally have broad discretion when it comes to vaccine distribution.
The panel listed categories including first responders, teachers, and workers in food and agriculture, manufacturing, grocery stores, public transit and at the U.S. Postal Service. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) was faced with the tough choice of ranking a vast group of essential workers who, according to a list by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, make up nearly 70% of the U.S. labor force.
The ACIP recommendations, which still need to be adopted by the CDC, come months after states formulated their own distribution plans, which have been disseminated to local health departments in preparation for the vaccine. The state-level plans differ from each other and from the federal guidelines.
It also is unclear what procedures, if any, are in place for individuals to prove they belong to a high-priority group. One industry group said on Monday it would offer its members a model letter to give to employees, attesting to their ""essential"" status.
The United States has two authorized COVID-19 vaccines, one from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and another from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. The vaccines are rolling out as hospitals reach peak capacity and deaths have exceeded 315,000.
The lack of coordinated plans has led dozens of industry groups and individual companies, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, to lobby state and federal officials to move their workers closer to the front of the line.
Several states including New York, Massachusetts and Michigan do not follow the panel's recommendations and have instead drafted their own list of essential workers to be prioritized for a vaccine. Some also prioritize people with pre-existing medical conditions, who were not accounted for by the advisory panel.
Massachusetts, for example, prioritizes Uber and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) ride-hail drivers in the same phase as grocery-store workers, while it does not mention manufacturing at all.
PIECEMEAL APPROACH 
Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi in a letter to President-elect Joe Biden on Monday called for more federal guidance once Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
""We ask that you continue to provide federal leadership to state and local leaders and reinforce the need to provide early vaccine access for essential critical infrastructure workers, including rideshare drivers and delivery people,"" the letter read.
Some industry groups, including the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers including Albertsons Companies Inc, and the American Federation of Teachers, a labor union, welcomed the ACIP's recommendation and the inclusion of their workers.
But some groups also cautioned that despite their inclusion, the practical question of how vaccines will reach workers' arms was still far from clear amid the patchwork of state rules.
The Consumer Brands Association representing food, beverage, personal care and household product companies including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Co, said it expected hybrid solutions, from partnerships with pharmacies to hiring outside healthcare service providers.
""It's for this reason that nothing has changed about our concerns about the piecemeal state vaccination playbooks,"" a spokeswoman said.
The spokeswoman also said it remained unclear how workers could verify they were indeed ""essential,"" adding that Consumer Brands would provide its members with a template they can put on company letterhead confirming essential-worker status, similar to letters distributed during curfews and lockdowns so employees could get to work.
In North Carolina, which has one of the most extensive vaccine distribution plans, hospitals could submit lists of people eligible for the first vaccines to a central data system. But a spokeswoman for the state's health department did not immediately respond to whether the same system would allow companies to submit the names of non-healthcare essential workers.
Other industry groups, like the National Waste & Recycling Association, which represents companies including Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) and  Republic Services Inc  (NYSE:RSG), said it would continue pushing to prioritize its workers for a vaccine, despite not being included in the ACIP recommendations.

The group on Monday asked CDC Director Robert Redfield, in a letter seen by Reuters, to include the waste and recycling industry in the next vaccination phase across the country.
Kirk Sander, the group's chief of staff and vice president of safety and standards, said one of its members, a large medical waste company, saw local officials prioritize its workers, who pick up waste from hospital wards, for a COVID-19 vaccine in some counties, but not in others. 
""It gives weight to that conversation if the CDC weighs in,"" Sander said of Monday's letter.

Investing.com -- Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) jumped almost 15% to yet another record after announcing a deal to buy equipment maker Precor for $420 million.
Shares of the bike maker subsequently received price target increases from Wedbush and Stilfel. Peloton has been a major beneficiary of the coronavirus pandemic, which as gyms around the world shuttered, forcing those of us interested to build our own home fitness centers. Peloton has been struggling with an excess of demand and an inability to fulfill the deep, desperate need people suddenly have found for at-home bicycles with classes attached. This may help to speed things up. Customers have been told they'd have to wait at least 10 weeks in some cases for equipment to be delivered.
Nonetheless, the stock has rallied about 480% in 2020, alongside other winners like  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), up 500% this year.
Precor is a commercial fitness equipment provider with a U.S. manufacturing presence, which will help establish Peloton's domestic manufacturing capacity and accelerate its reach into the commercial market. By making fitness equipment closer to U.S. consumers, Peloton will be able to deliver connected fitness products to members sooner, the company said in a statement. Peloton plans to produce connected fitness products in the U.S. before the end of 2021.
Precor's U.S. facilities will join Peloton's existing manufacturing network with its third party manufacturers and the Tonic facilities based in Taiwan.  
Precor is a division of Finnish sporting goods company Amer Sports, among whose owners is China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Limited. The transaction is expected to close early next year.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, with the discovery of a new strain of the Covid-19 virus - and all that that may imply for fresh restrictions on the economy in the new year - continued to weigh on sentiment.
By 9:55 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 142 points, or 0.5%, at 30,074 points, while the S&P 500 was roughly flat and the Nasdaq Composite - as usual when virus fears come to the front of investors' minds - outperforming with a 0.4% gain.
There was little reaction earlier to a small upward revision in U.S. third-quarter GDP data, which was also notable for personal consumer expenditures being revised down slightly from their first reading. The passage of the $900 billion fiscal relief package through Congress has also been thoroughly priced in, while existing home sales for November came in almost exactly as forecast at 6.69 million.
Among early movers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 4.3% after Reuters reported that it has revived its plans to develop all-electric, self-driving cars, after a couple of years in which it seemed the project had been put on the back burner.  Reuters reported that the company is planning to come to market with a mass product by 2024. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which would risk losing some of its unique cachet as a result of competition from one of the few companies with as much brand power, fell 1.4%. 
However, the biggest beneficiary of the story was QuantumScape stock, which rose 27% on the perception that Apple may be interested in using its solid-state batteries. Reuters' story had noted that Apple's change of heart had been triggered in part by a 'radical' advance in battery technology. 
Another big gainer was Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) stock, which rose some 13.5% after the company said it had agreed to buy Precor, a rival maker of fitness equipment. The deal will help Peloton expand its manufacturing capacity, relieving a potential bottleneck after a year in which the pandemic has turbo-charged demand for its products.
As such, a deal that will cost Peloton $420 million has added over $3 billion to the company’s market value.
Elsewhere, CarMax (NYSE:KMX) stock fell 7.0% after the company reported a 1% drop in like-for-like used vehicle sales in the three months through November. The market was more upset by that than it was impressed by a comfortable beat on the bottom line.
And  Moderna  and  Pfizer  both suffered from a report in Science Magazine trying to explain the incidence of strong allergic reactions to their vaccines. The magazine hypothesized that nanoparticles of the chemical of polyethylene glycol, or PEG, may be responsible for the reactions.

(Reuters) - Ouster Inc, a U.S. startup that makes lidar sensors for self-driving cars and smart cities, said on Tuesday it has agreed to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Colonnade Acquisition Corp.
The deal values San Francisco-based Ouster at around $1.9 billion and makes it the fifth lidar manufacturer this year to agree a SPAC merger to go public, following on from Velodyne Lidar Inc, Luminar, Innoviz and Aeva.
Ouster sees its digital lidar technology as having practical applications beyond autonomous vehicles and extending to areas such as drones, smart cities and robotics, according to company co-founder and Chief Executive Angus Pacala. 
""The vision of the future that we're pushing towards is lidar on every vehicle on earth, every moving object on earth and every piece of intelligent fixed infrastructure on earth, in the same way that camera technology has propagated and become ubiquitous in the last 20 years,"" Pacala said in an interview, speaking with Colonnade Chief Executive Remy Trafelet. 
Reuters had reported earlier that Ouster and Colonnade were nearing a merger agreement.
SPACs like Colonnade are increasingly popular investment vehicles which raise funds in an initial public offering (IPO) with the aim of buying a private company. The acquired company then becomes public as result of the merger and is an alternative to the traditional IPO process.
Colonnade raised $200 million in an IPO in August. For the deal with Ouster, Colonnade also raised $100 million through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, transaction. Investors in the PIPE included Cox Automotive, Fontinalis Partners, and WWJ Enterprises.
Overall the deal will bring in up to $300 million in gross proceeds for Ouster. 
Ouster, which expects to generate around $19 million in revenue in 2020, stood out from other companies in the space that Colonnade had looked at buying because its business is already generating revenue, Trafelet said. 
""It's not a business plan – they're selling real products to real customers right now,' he said. 
Lidar sensors, which use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car, are seen as essential by many automakers to allow higher levels of driver assistance right up to making them capable of self-driving.
Five-year-old Ouster had previously raised $142 million from private market investors, including Cox , Silicon Valley Bank and Fontinalis, which is co-owned by Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Executive Chairman Bill Ford.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Britain tells shoppers food is plentiful but supermarkets fret about next week,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said there was plenty of food in the shops on Tuesday but industry groups repeated warnings of shortages of some fresh produce from next week unless freight routes to mainland Europe are swiftly restored.
Interior minister Priti Patel said Britons should not be concerned despite Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's, Britain's two biggest supermarket groups, raising the alarm on Monday that gaps could start to appear on fruit and vegetable shelves within days.
Freight from France is being disrupted as part of a wider suspension of travel links with Britain to try to curb a new faster-spreading strain of COVID-19. 
""I don't think anybody should be worried - there is plenty of food in our shops,"" Patel told LBC radio. 
British supermarkets are facing record Christmas demand due to COVID-19 restrictions on the hospitality industry and on travel and there are fears of panic buying.
""UK shoppers need have no concerns about food supplies over Christmas, but impacts on local on-shelf availability of certain fresh foods look likely from next week unless we can swiftly restore this link,"" said Ian Wright, CEO of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents over 300 food and drink businesses.
The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents more than 170 major retailers including the big supermarkets, is also concerned about supplies shortly after Christmas, highlighting possible shortages of salad, vegetables and fruit, including raspberries and strawberries.
""The borders really need to be running pretty much freely from tomorrow to assure us that there won't be any disruption,"" Andrew Opie, the BRC's director of food and sustainability, told BBC radio.
He noted that 90% of the lettuces consumed by Britons and about 70% of soft fruit comes through the Channel ports at this time of year.
TESTING
The BBC cited France's Europe Minister Clément Beaune as saying that Britain and France would announce a deal to restart freight by Wednesday. One option is to roll out mass testing for truck drivers.
""Whatever is agreed, we need to be careful it doesn't add too much friction to the supply chain which in itself causes disruption by causing delays to the drivers whilst they're being tested,"" said Opie.
Though large queues again snaked around supermarkets across Britain on Tuesday and some shelves were stripped bare, food retailers said they had not seen any major changes in customer buying behaviour.
Opie said supermarkets had expected and planned for Christmas queues. 
""You need to remember these are the busiest days for shopping...and remember all the stores are still operating all of their COVID protocols, which means you can't get as many people into a supermarket as you would do normally,"" Opie said.

""We're not seeing the sort of excessive buying in any kind of volumes that we saw around that period in sort of mid-March,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) -Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, with Washington's approval of an $892 billion pandemic relief package helping them recover some of the losses caused by fears over a highly infectious new strain of COVID-19. 
The Euro STOXX 600 added 0.8%, its biggest one-day jump in over five weeks in sight. German and French indexes added 1% and 0.8% respectively.
London's blue chips turned positive, too, recovering early losses even as Britain adjusts to strict lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the new strain of coronavirus. Wall Street futures also edged into the black. 
Fuelling the optimism, in part, was the U.S. Congress's approval on Monday of a coronavirus aid package after months of inaction. The first such aid since April came as the pandemic accelerated in the United States, infecting more than 214,000 people every day and slowing the economic recovery. 
The bill includes $600 payments to most Americans and additional payments to millions of people thrown out of work during the pandemic.
Market players also took stock of the damage from a new COVID-19 variant, with investors betting that vaccines would still be effective against the new strain. 
On Monday, countries across the world shut their borders to Britain because of fears over the new strain, snarling one of Europe's most important trade routes just days before Britain is set to leave the European Union. 
The discovery, just months before vaccines are expected to be widely available, brought back fears over the economic impact of new lockdowns to counter the virus, which has killed about 1.7 million people worldwide.
European shares had slumped 2.3%, their biggest one-day loss in nearly two months, in response.
The new strain ""is a bump in the road, but that road is still leading to a much stronger recovery in the second half of next year,"" said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
""Markets are a lot calmer today because of confidence that there is a big build up of pent-up demand and a return to much stronger levels of activity in the second half of next year."" 
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat. Earlier, MSCI's gauge of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan had sunk 0.8%.
THE POUND'S PROSPECTS
The stimulus news helped prop up the dollar index, which was still on course for a third consecutive quarterly loss after dropping some 12.5% from a March peak.
The index, which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 0.1% at 90.232, still below its Monday top of 90.978. 
ING analysts said the U.S. relief package ""won't be able to fully offset the effects of people staying at home as many businesses face tighter restrictions or are even forced to close."" 
In Britain, sterling slipped 0.5% after tumbling as much as 2.5% versus the dollar on Monday to a 10-day low amid the twin fears over COVID and Brexit. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke on disagreements over fisheries that are barring a new trade deal, sources said.
Analysts remained pessimistic on the pound's prospects, even after reports of progress in Brexit trade talks.

MUFG said in a note to clients it expected London and Brussels would strike a last-minute deal, but added: ""Even if a trade deal is reached, upside potential for the pound will now be dampened by recent negative COVID developments in the UK.""

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Airbus to be world's largest planemaker for second year,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to beat Boeing (NYSE:BA) to be the world's largest jetmaker for the second year in a row, ending 2020 by resuming deliveries of its A380 superjumbo to Emirates, though its final deliveries are likely to have dropped 35% from 2019 due to the pandemic. 
There were no immediate reports on Tuesday of deliveries or production being disrupted by travel bans imposed by many countries on Britain, where Airbus makes wings.
No flights have been scheduled over the Christmas break of special Beluga transport planes, which carry aircraft sections under an exemption from most coronavirus travel restrictions.
Barring widespread new travel upheaval, industry sources expect Airbus to deliver 550-560 planes in 2020 after it reached more than 520 this week, with nine days of the year still to go.
But they cautioned deliveries are subject to an unusual number of variables and schedules are not set in stone. Airbus is unlikely to repeat a record surge of more than 100 deliveries in December last year.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on specifics, but said Airbus continued to operate normally.
""We continue to deliver at full steam and this will continue over the holidays,"" he said. 
Airbus said on Monday it had delivered an A330neo to Uganda Airlines, though fresh doubts have surfaced over similar jets already built for troubled AirAsia X.
After a year-long pause in A380 deliveries to Dubai, Airbus has delivered two A380s to Emirates this month, tracking data shows. It will end the year with three A380 deliveries after Japan's ANA put a newly delivered plane into storage in October.
Airbus has halted initial assembly of the four-engined jet and has six left to deliver. Charter firm HiFly last week ended efforts to make profits out of a second-hand aircraft, meaning more A380s are seen likely to follow the ANA jet into storage.
Total Airbus deliveries are expected to fall 35% this year due to the impact on airlines of the pandemic, but Airbus has an insurmountable lead over Boeing, which delivered 118 planes up to the end of November, with the 737 MAX grounded during that period.
Between January and November, Airbus delivered 477 jets.
It has delivered 46 of its main category of planes so far in December, according to the Airbus Hamburg Finkenwerder tracking website, lifting total deliveries so far this year beyond 520.
Industry sources say Airbus may reach an informal goal of 560 deliveries in 2020, though each delivery comes with uncertainty and some experts say 550 is a safer estimate.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Factbox-Where U.S. banks won and lost in the new pandemic relief package,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Monday was scrambling to pass a $900 billion pandemic aid package, following seven months of partisan bickering. 
The banking industry aggressively pushed for extra stimulus and a raft of other measures which would help shore up struggling borrowers and ultimately benefit the industry. 
Here is what's in the package for banks:
PPP FUNDS AND FORGIVENESS
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been the centerpiece of Congress's efforts to help small businesses weather pandemic lockdowns. To date, banks have dished out $525 billion in PPP loans to be repaid by the government, provided borrowers spent the cash on qualifying expenses. 
Monday's package includes an additional $284 billion for the program and broadens eligible PPP expenses to include items like personal protective equipment for staff and operational costs. It also allows those expenses to qualify for deductions, simplifying tax returns for millions of borrowers.
Smaller companies which suffered a 25% or greater decline in 2020 revenues can seek a second PPP loan of up to $2 million. 
And critically for banks, the package includes a streamlined forgiveness process for loans of less than $150,000, requiring borrowers only sign a one-page form attesting that the funds were used as intended. Banks had fretted that the original forgiveness process was too onerous for smaller borrowers.
TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS
Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) are the accounting and regulatory framework for loan modifications, such as deferring the loan, extending it, or reducing monthly repayments.
Banks say TDR accounting is onerous, sometimes incurring additional capital charges, extra operational hassles and generally acting as a drag on banks' overall asset quality. They say banks should not be penalized for trying to help customers who need temporary relief to keep them afloat until the pandemic passes.
Congress in March suspended the process for TDR accounting through Dec. 31, paving the way for banks to modify loans without fear of penalty. The new package extends that relief to Jan. 1, 2022 after lenders, fearing regulators and investors may fault them for ballooning TDRs, pushed for an extension. 
CREDIT LOSS ACCOUNTING RULES
Current Expected Credit Losses or ""CECL"" is an incoming accounting standard that requires financial institutions to make expected credit loss allowances for the lifetime of a loan. 
Banks say the rule adds volatility to the amount of capital they must hold and creates incentives to reduce lending when borrowers need it most. The new relief package gives banks the option of ignoring the new standard until 2022. Banking groups had been pushing to delay implementation until at least 2023.
According to the American Bankers Association, of the institutions required to implement CECL in January 2020, roughly 50 took advantage of a one-year delay granted by CARES Act. 
COMMUNITY BANK LEVERAGE RATIO 
In 2018, Congress introduced a simple community bank leverage ratio for smaller lenders to reduce their overall capital burden. The law allows regulators to set the required level, based on a leverage ratio, at between 8% and 10%, with regulators opting for 9%, despite community bank protests.

To boost small banks' ability to lend, the CARES Act brought this ratio down to 8% until Dec. 31. But banking groups failed to get that lower ratio extended indefinitely.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) said it stands to lose more than $5 billion worth of aircraft orders if AirAsia X Bhd's (AAX) debt restructuring scheme goes through, court documents showed, joining more than a dozen creditors that have challenged the Malaysian low-budget carrier's plan.
Airbus's challenge comes as AAX defended its scheme from key lessor BOC Aviation Limited's (BOCA) allegations that it favoured Airbus and lacked a debt-to-equity swap offer for creditors.
In a Dec. 16 affidavit filed at Kuala Lumpur High Court, Asia-Pacific Head of Region Anand Emmanuel Stanley said there was a strong possibility Airbus ""will suffer substantial losses and prejudice"" from termination of purchase agreements.
""AAX has ordered and Airbus has already built, or substantially built, seven A330neo aircraft which are currently in the inventory,"" he said, adding that there are another 71 on order that may impact Airbus's profitability if cancelled.
Despite Airbus's objections, AAX's affidavit filed on Monday showed it was supportive of the airline seeking a creditors' meeting needed to approve the scheme. Other creditors, such as Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), have agreed to consider the scheme, while a few lessors said they support the airline's restructuring efforts, it said.
Castlelake's Vice President Marketing Sankalp Garg told AAX in an email that the lessor ""would defiantly want to see (AAX)succeed.""
AAX has been seeking court approval to convene the meeting for creditors to vote on the scheme. On Monday it requested the court for a stay on all proceedings against it, adding it was necessary to protect its assets pending approval of the scheme.
AAX revealed in a Dec. 17 affidavit seen by Reuters it owes Airbus 48.71 billion ringgit ($12 billion) including predelivery payments for committed purchase of 118 aircraft.
BOCA has said AAX's debt calculations should not include future debts, which are primarily owed to Airbus. Airbus alone holds about 75% of the total debt value needed to approve the restructuring, giving lessors relatively little say.
AAX Senior Legal Counsel Shereen Ee denied the calculations were unfair as they also consider termination compensation for BOCA until the end of its lease period.
As for BOCA's proposed debt-to-equity conversion, Ee said it ""would run counter to the objective of restructuring AAX to ensure it can raise fresh funds to continue as a going concern.""
She said any party may have an equity stake in AAX if they inject fresh funds in return for it.
BOCA became one of Norwegian Air's top shareholders in May after lessors agreed to convert debt to equity.
The airline failed to get more state support last month and sought bankruptcy protection. It secured shareholders' vote last week for its rescue plan.
BOCA is AAX's largest lessor, AAX's lawsuit showed.
AAX would continue engaging with all creditors, a company spokeswoman said. 
""We are working with all stakeholders to expedite the completion of this recapitalisation so that we can start flying again,"" she said.
The airline, which has been recording losses since June 2019, said the alternative was a liquidation with nothing for creditors and shareholders.
Airbus and BOCA declined to comment while legal proceedings and discussions are ongoing.
AAX, the long-haul unit of budget airline AirAsia Group, has total debts and liabilities of about 64.15 billion ringgit ($15.8 billion), the lawsuit stated. It had earlier proposed to reconstitute its debts into a principal amount of 200 million ringgit.
Legal Counsel Ee said the scheme would ""at least offer creditors a prospective chance for survival"".

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",U.S. publishes list of Chinese and Russian firms with military ties,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) -The Trump administration on Monday published a list of Chinese and Russian companies with alleged military ties that restrict them from buying a wide range of U.S. goods and technology.
Reuters first reported last month that the U.S. Department of Commerce drafted a list of companies that it linked to the Chinese or Russian military, news that brought a rebuke from Beijing.
The final list does not include Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), or the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Colorado's  Arrow Electronics  (NYSE:ARW) and Texas-based TTI Inc, a Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) electronics distributor. Those companies were on the draft list seen by Reuters. 
However, Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute, which designs COMAC planes, and Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co, which manufactures COMAC planes, are on the list. 
The final list names 103 entities, 14 fewer than on the draft list seen by Reuters in November. Fifty-eight are designated under China, down from 89, and 45 entities are tied to Russia, up from 28.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday the action establishes a new process ""to assist exporters in screening their customers for military end users."" 
The final list was published on the Commerce Department website https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/12/commerce-department-will-publish-first-military-end-user-list-naming on Monday and is scheduled to be posted for public inspection in the Federal Register on Tuesday.
China urged the United States to stop what it called erroneous actions and treat all companies in an equal way, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.
Publishing the list in the waning days of the Trump administration follows the addition of dozens of Chinese companies to another U.S. trade blacklist, including the country's top chipmaker, SMIC, and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, on Friday.
Tensions between the United States and China have escalated over the past year, as Trump blamed it for the coronavirus pandemic, China imposed a national security law in Hong Kong and a dispute involving the South China Sea has intensified.
The U.S. government also has grown increasingly concerned about China’s “military-civil fusion,” a policy that aims to build up its military might and technological development in tandem.
In the spring, the Commerce Department expanded the definition of ""military end users,"" as the department defines the companies with military ties.
The category includes not only armed service and national police, but any person or entity that supports or contributes to the maintenance or production of military items - even if their business is primarily non-military. The ""military end user"" designation requires U.S. companies to obtain licences to sell to the firms, which are more likely to be denied than granted. The list is not definitive and Commerce said U.S. companies must continue to do their own due diligence to help decide whether their buyers are considered military end users.
Publication of the list is likely to anger China. Its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, in November called news of the draft list ""unprovoked suppression of Chinese companies by the United States."" 
While COMAC was removed, seven Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) subordinate entities remain on the list.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) both have joint ventures with AVIC and supply COMAC, which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus.

This month, Arrow and TTI both denied their subsidiaries have ties to the Chinese military and said they were working to be removed from any final list.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday as the approval of a U.S. stimulus package helped allay worries of a further dent to the global economy from a new coronavirus strain in the UK.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1%, recovering from a more than 2% slide in the previous session, which was also its biggest one-day drop in nearly two months.
The U.S. Congress on Monday approved an $892 billion fiscal stimulus following days of furious negotiation. President Donald trump is expected to sign it into law, keeping hopes of an economic recovery alive. 
Strict lockdowns went into effect in Britain on Monday to curb the spread of the new coronavirus strain said to be up to 70% more transmissible than the original, triggering border bans and travel restrictions from several countries.
The BBC reported that Britain and France would announce a deal to restart freight by Wednesday.
Record growth in UK GDP, however, saw London's blue-chip index reverse early losses to trade 0.3% higher, held back only by materials and energy stocks, which tracked declining prices of underlying commodities. [O/R][MET/L][.L]
""The GDP reading ... has shielded the markets slightly,"" said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex. 
""You've still got the COVID travel ban. That is really weighing on the UK markets and preventing them from doing much this morning. I think perhaps they could have been lower if that GDP figure hadn't been revised higher.""
Banks led the rebound in Europe, followed by retailers and tech stocks. 
U.S. stocks cut losses overnight on stimulus news and, while Dow Jones futures traded flat, S&P and Nasdaq futures pointed to a higher open, signalling European shares could hold on to their gains on cautiously upbeat sentiment. (N)

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>","Analysis: From famine to feast, investment in European tech startups roars back","By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) - With Europe in coronavirus lockdown, venture capital fund manager Fergal Mullen told his investors in April he would find it hard to back a startup without first meeting its founders.
A couple of months later, the Geneva-based co-founder and partner of Highland Europe broke his own promise and invested in Meditopia, a mindfulness app with teams in Berlin and Istanbul that he got to know over some 40 calls on video app Zoom.
""I had to eat my hat,"" said Mullen, looking back on a year of deal making that, after a sudden stop in the spring, came back to life in late summer and has gathered pace since.
Highland Europe has just raised 700 million euros ($850 million) for a fourth fund, its largest, and is preparing for the sale or flotation of around 10 of its portfolio companies next year.
And, according to interviews with more than half a dozen investors, the wider recovery in European tech investment activity looks likely to extend into 2021 as venture-backed startups achieve scale.
Proceeds raised by European venture funds have already hit an annual record 17.1 billion euros in the year to date, while the amount invested in startups has reached 39.7 billion euros, according to data platform Dealroom.co.
Taking into account reporting lags, the final sum invested is on track to beat last year's all-time high of 40.3 billion euros, said Tom Wehmeier, partner at Atomico and author of the closely-watched State of European Tech https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com report.
""The scale of those outcomes is getting bigger and bigger, and the velocity in which value is being created - it's getting faster and faster,"" said Wehmeier, pointing to the 115 venture-backed 'unicorns' in Europe valued at more than $1 billion.
While Europe still lags North America by four to one in dollars invested in tech startups, the institutional money flowing into venture capital has grown threefold over the last five years.
Nearly two-thirds of venture capitalists and 70% of their investors expect European tech to gain ground on the United States and China over the next decade, according a survey by Atomico.

DRY POWDER
Early-stage and growth investor Index Ventures raised $2 billion just before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and soon discovered that remote working enabled it to review and do deals far more quickly.
""We never had a slowdown and had a lot of dry powder,"" said partner Martin Mignot. ""With everyone remote we can see and meet more entrepreneurs.""
Where deal flow has slowed is via exits onto public markets, with proceeds from initial public offerings (IPOs) by European technology firms less than half their 2018 peak even as a string of IPOs took U.S. markets by storm.
That partly reflects the growing depth of private markets, however, say investors who point to Klarna, the Swedish financial technology company, achieving a valuation of more than $10 billion in its latest funding round.
UiPath, whose software helps automate routine business tasks, has achieved similar 'decacorn' status while still private and, like Klarna, is eyeing an IPO in 2021.
The Romanian startup now has a U.S. headquarters and plans to float there. That's a common route for European startups chasing rich U.S. valuations and founder-friendly listing rules - and a challenge for Europe's tech ecosystem, investors say.
UiPath was backed in its infancy by Earlybird, whose emerging Europe fund turned heads in June when Istanbul-based Peak Games, in which it had invested, was sold to Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) Inc for $1.8 billion.
Such deals are breeding new startups even in parts of Europe previously little known for home-grown tech entrepreneurship.
""Every liquidity event, every acquisition, every IPO ends up spawning groups of these talented people,"" said Earlybird's Cem Sertoglu. 
LONDON STRONG
While the remote working trend is helping founders take on global markets without having to relocate to Silicon Valley, it is also taking the edge off the near-term risks arising from Brexit - Britain's looming exit from the European single market.
""It won't affect the momentum that much in 2021, given how much pent-up demand there is, how much money is sitting on the sidelines, and how many conversations are happening,"" said Erin Platts, the London-based regional head of Silicon Valley Bank, a specialist lender to technology firms.
Britain has actually extended its lead this year in venture fund raising and its tech startups have attracted a third of total European investment, Dealroom.co data show.
It also remains the preferred landing zone for U.S. software firms seeking to gain a foothold in Europe, said Stephen McIntyre of early-stage investor and advisory firm Frontline (NYSE:FRO).
""The only people who are talking about Brexit are the Brits and Irish,"" said McIntyre. ""With U.S. CEOs, not only does it not come up – they honestly think it’s done.""

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",EasyJet defers Airbus aircraft deliveries,"LONDON (Reuters) - British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ), whose finances have come under severe pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic, has agreed with Airbus to defer the delivery of aircraft, it said on Tuesday.
European travel has been at very low levels for more than nine months, forcing easyJet to take on more debt, tap shareholders for cash and sell dozens of aircraft to boost its finances to survive until flying recovers. Last month it reported a 1.27 billion pound ($1.7 billion) loss.
The airline said the delivery of 22 aircraft will be deferred from 2022-2024 to 2027-2028.
In addition 15 delivery dates within the period 2022 to 2024 will move to more closely match forecast seasonal requirements.
EasyJet said that under the terms of its 2013 agreement with Airbus the future aggregate cash price of the aircraft subject to deferrals will increase.
The airline also had the option until Dec. 31 2020 not to take up to seven aircraft scheduled for delivery between 2022 and 2026. 
It has now agreed with Airbus to reallocate the aircraft to which this option applies, to seven planes due for delivery in 2025 to 2026, with the deadline to exercise this option amended to December 2021.
The changes will result in easyJet taking no deliveries in 2021, eight in 2022, seven in 2023 and 18 in 2024.
EasyJet has also retained options to increase its deliveries in 2023 to 30 aircraft.
""In this period of uncertainty, this flexibility is even more valuable, as it will enable us to quickly flex our fleet size in response to customer demand,"" CEO Johan Lundgren said.
Shares in easyJet, down 47% this year, closed Monday at 757.2 pence, valuing the business at 3.47 billion pounds.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning, with a new COVID-19 strain threatening to trigger a fresh wave of lockdowns and travel restrictions dampening sentiment.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.45% by 10:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.49%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 slid 0.95% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.03%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.21% and the Shenzhen Component was fell 0.33%. The U.S. Commerce Department added over 100 Chinese and Russian companies to a new list of firms it says have links to their nations’ militaries.
Anyone looking to sell items that could eventually be used for military purposes to the 58 Chinese and 45 Russia companies on the list will need a license, the Commerce Department said in a statement on Monday. Seven subsidiaries of China’s Aviation Industry Corp., as well as Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, were included on the list.
The discovery of a new strain of the COVID-19 virus, also referred to as the B.1.1.7 strain, saw European shares slump to their lowest level since October, with global shares also retreating from the records highs seen during the previous week.
The B.1.1.7 strain was first seen in the U.K. and countries from Canada to Hong Kong have shut their borders to the U.K. to keep the strain out. The U.K. has already imposed a full Tier 4 lockdown in London and southeastern England, with the ensuing travel chaos and the possibility of food shortages coming days before the U.K. is set to leave the European Union.
The discovery, coming just months before COVID-19 vaccines are due to become widely available, renewed investors’ COVID-19 fears.
“What we’ve seen out of the U.K. is a scary thing for the markets, which could incentivize some profit-taking,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Private Bank chief investment strategist Steven Wieting told Bloomberg.
However, the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine should be a “game-changer” in the long-run, he added.
Investors are also concerned that the B.1.1.7 strain is reportedly up to 70% more transmissible than the original.
“An escalation of European COVID-19 restrictions in response to fears around a new variant, which is supposed to be faster spreading, should, and did, of course, elicit a negative reaction from prices via the near-term global growth impact. Illiquid conditions will persist through year-end, but dips like this could present more of an opportunity to fade than anything else,” Axi Chief Global Market Strategist Stephen Innes told Reuters.
The gloom overshadowed news from across the Atlantic that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $892 billion COVID-19 relief package earlier, also passing a $1.4 trillion measure that will keep the government funded for another year.
The relief bill will become law once passed by the Senate, where it is currently under review, and signed by President Donald Trump. The package includes $600 payments to most Americans as well as additional payments to those made redundant during the COVID-19 pandemic and comes just as the larger round of benefits expires on Saturday."

The models include the Lamborghini Urus, Porsche Cayenne and Audi’s Q8, Q7, Q5, A6 Allroad, and e-tron vehicles and VW Tiguan. The ITC said it has made no decision on the merits.

LONDON (Reuters) - Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc has cut its annual margin interest rate for premium customers in half to 2.5%, the company said on Monday, making it one of the cheapest in the sector.
The rate cut is part of the company's overall goal to lower the cost of investing, Robinhood said in a statement, and is the latest competitive move by the popular trading app.
It comes less then a week after Massachusetts securities regulators accused the company of engaging in aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors and failing to prevent outages on its trading platform.
Robinhood in a statement said it disagreed with the allegations and will defend itself.
The lower margin rate will be available to customers who pay $5 a month for its Gold account, and meet certain eligibility requirements, the company said.
""We review factors like investment objectives, experience, and risk tolerance to determine eligibility,"" said Madhu Muthukumar, Robinhood's head of product management.
Founded in 2013, Robinhood has been credited with helping usher commission-free trading throughout the retail brokerage industry.
It has seen business boom during the coronavirus pandemic as more homebound consumers took to buying and selling stocks online. The app now counts more than 13 million users.
While its user-friendly and engaging service has made it appealing to millions of young customers, it has also drawn the scrutiny of critics and regulators who are concerned the company may be encouraging risky behavior in retail investors. It also suffered a number of outages this year.
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, in an administrative complaint on Wednesday alleged that Robinhood marketed itself to investors without regard for the best interest of its customers.
The complaint alleged that Robinhood used the promise of free stock trades to attract new users and strategies such as ""gamification"" to entice repeated use of its app.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -American Airlines and United Airlines said on Monday they were preparing to recall tens of thousands of furloughed employees as they awaited lawmakers' approval of a fresh $15 billion in payroll support under a broader COVID-19 relief package.
But in a staff memo, United executives warned that it expects the recall will be ""temporary"" as travel demand remains depressed. The relief would cover employee payroll costs until March 31, 2021.
""The truth is, we just don't see anything in the data that shows a huge difference in bookings over the next few months,"" CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) and President Brett Hart said in the memo, released by United. 
Wrestling with a sharp downturn in travel demand amid the pandemic, American and United together furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October, when an initial $25 billion to cover six months of airline workers' salaries expired.
The House of Representatives and Senate were aiming to pass a bipartisan $900 billion coronavirus aid package before the end of the day.
The $15 billion earmarked for airlines requires all furloughed workers to be recalled and receive their full salaries from Dec. 1 through March 31, 2021.
""We are already starting to work through the details of how we will bring back team members, but we’re not over the finish line yet,"" American CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo, adding that they hoped employees would receive paychecks by Dec. 24. 
The terms of the new assistance program mirror the initial package passed by Congress in March, which required larger airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time and offer the government warrants. 

It also requires airlines to resume flying to some routes stopped after the first package expires, and gives the Transportation secretary authority until March 1, 2022 to require flights to small and remote communities that airlines served before the pandemic.

The company intends to have its units listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""SVFAU"" and Class A ordinary shares under ""SVFA"".
According to the company, each unit, which consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-fourth of a redeemable warrant, is priced at $10. SVF said its IPO pricing is an estimate solely for calculating the SEC registration fee.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities and Cantor are underwriters to the IPO.
With SVF, SoftBank has joined the trend for special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC) - shell vehicles that raise money in an IPO before merging with a private firm. A record number of companies have taken the SPAC route to bypass the traditional IPO.
The group has been biding its time since efforts to raise capital for a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund were unsuccessful following poor performance.
It has used its mounting cash reserves to take positions in listed U.S. tech firms and has a growing number of portfolio companies going public after the IPO window reopened.
Home-selling platform OpenDoor Technologies Inc, backed by SoftBank Group, which had its Nasdaq debut on Monday, also took the SPAC route.

Investing.com – The Dow clawed back its losses Monday, as the widely expected rollout of a $900 billion stimulus package and a surge in financials help stocks recover and eased fears that a new strain of Covid-19 will hurt global growth. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.12%, or 37 points, but had been down by more than 400 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 was down 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.10%.
Financials helped the market recover losses, with banking stocks leading the charge higher. The Fed on Friday after-markets closed said, based on its latest stress tests, it would allow banks to buy back stocks and pay out dividends as its stress tests suggested banks had ""strong capital levels.""
The stress test started in 2009 and is supposed to show what happens to banks' balance sheets – in terms of losses and capital levels – under an extreme hypothetical adverse scenario.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) closed higher, with the latter surging 6%.
Markets got off to a weak start as sea of red washed over Wall Street after a new strain of Covid-19 spreading rapidly across England prompted fresh travel restrictions from Canada and parts of Europe and raised concerns about the impact on the global economic recovery.
""While news of a new COVID-19 strain in London first emerged a while back, tightening restrictions by the EU and Canada and deepening lockdowns are sparking heightened concern,"" Scotia Economics said in a note.
The market recovery was also supported by expectations it was about to get a shot in the arm as lawmakers on Capitol Hill get ready to vote in favor of a $900 billion stimulus package that will include direct funding to Americans.
""This is a very, very fast way of getting money into the economy. Let me emphasize: People are going to see this money at the beginning of next week,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC.
On the vaccine front,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) moved a step closer to gaining EU approval for its Covid-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The European Medicines Agency granted the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine a conditional marketing authorization, paving the way for the drug to begin distribution later this week.
Energy stocks were among the biggest decliners as the restrictions on global travel scaled back expectations for the recovery in travel demand, weighing on oil prices.
Industrials were hurt by falling airlines stocks, with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) in red, and the latter down 2% on fears of further travel restrictions.
In other news,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) jumped 5% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results late Friday, driven by its direct-to-consumer push.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, fell 6.5% on its S&P 500 debut, but still remains up nearly 700% for the year so far. The weakness in Tesla comes on reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is mulling an entry into the electric vehicle market as soon as 2024. A potential Apple car would also include battery technology that could reduce costs and increase range, offering competition to runaway leader Tesla.     "

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered as investors cheered the $900 billion stimulus package while swallowing fears about a virulent new strain of the coronavirus that prompted lockdowns in the U.K.
U.S lawmakers were set to vote on the stimulus deal, which is said to include funding for households as well as businesses to help prop up the economy even as a surge in virus cases forced new shutdowns.
Many families are struggling with lost jobs and wages, and word of $600 checks per individual under a certain income may not cheer expectations for the end of the year. Sectors like hospitality, travel and entertainment have also been hard-hit by pandemic restrictions on business activities.
Americans face a grim winter, with record-setting death tolls and hospitals strained to capacity even though new vaccines promise to bring an end to the crisis.
The S&P 500 shed points on Monday despite the addition of high-flying Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the electric car company founded by Elon Musk. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Will there be a car with a bow on it under your tree? 
Buying a used car online seems to have been a popular pandemic hobby, because shares of companies that specialize in online car sales have been flying. 
On Tuesday,  CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX) reports earnings, which are expected to be $1.14 a share on revenue of $5 billion.
2. Economic output estimate for the third quarter
This is the third estimate for gross domestic product in the third quarter. The number, due out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), is expected to be 33.1% for the third quarter compared to the negative 31.4% recorded in the second quarter. 
That rebound comes as a fresh wave of lockdowns is spreading across the U.S. and parts of Europe, and with evidence there is a new, more easily transmissible, version of the virus. Core PCE prices are expected to show growth of 3.5%, the same as the previous quarter.
3.  Consumer confidence going into the holiday 
December’s consumer confidence reading is expected to be 97, up from 96.1 last month, as households try to wrap up the year. The number is due out at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed lower on Monday, having clawed its way back from steep losses early in the session as investors juggled the outbreak of an ominous new strain of COVID-19 with the passage of a long-anticipated stimulus package.
The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in the red, but financials helped the blue-chip Dow reverse course for a modest gain.
""The 'Santa rally' will have to wait,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""Troubling news about COVID in the UK has reminded markets that COVID isn't solved yet; the road ahead may be bumpy and uncertain."" 
Congress hammered out a pandemic relief agreement on Sunday after months of partisan wrangling. The $900 billion package, expected to pass on Monday, includes unemployment aid, small business relief, and vaccine distribution, but the dollar amount fell short of what many had hoped for.
""Fiscal stimulus plan appears big enough to hold off a recession, but not for long,"" Carter added. ""But while it's not as large as many market participants hoped, it does include many meaningful actions that can support markets.""
But the emergence of new, highly infectious strain of COVID-19 in Britain has raised fears of additional shutdowns, and prompted countries around the world to shut their doors to travelers from the United Kingdom.
The news sent airline stocks sliding, even with the prospect of $15 billion in payroll assistance for commercial carriers included in the stimulus deal.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc became the most valuable company ever added to the S&P 500 and will account for about 1.69% of the index. The electric car maker's stock ended the session lower.
Banks bucked the trend. The U.S. Federal Reserve released the results of its semiannual stress test late Friday and announced relaxed restrictions on buybacks and dividends. 
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.94 points, or 0.12%, to 30,215.99, the S&P 500 lost 14.47 points, or 0.39%, to 3,694.94 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 13.12 points, or 0.1%, to 12,742.52.  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) rose after the athletic apparel maker boosted its full-year revenue forecast, prompting multiple brokers to raise their price targets.
Shares of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) slid after announcing it would buy U.S. rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc for $4.4 billion.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp lost ground after saying it would acquire Finland-based startup Nordcloud, in its latest effort to bolster its cloud-computing business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers are expected to vote Monday to approve landmark reforms on how the government certifies new airplanes are safe in the wake of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes, according to a summary made public Monday. 
The measure, whose inclusion in a year-end legislative package was first reported earlier on Monday by Reuters, would boost Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversight of aircraft manufacturers, require disclosure of critical safety information and provide new whistleblower protections.
The measure repeals the industry's authority to self-certify new airplanes and creates new safety reporting channels for FAA employees. 
The reforms aim to address shortfalls exposed by the two 737 MAX crashes in five months that killed 346 people and led to plane's worldwide grounding for 20 months that was only lifted by the FAA last month.
The legislation, intended to be included in a COVID-19 relief package, requires an expert review panel evaluate Boeing’s safety culture. Boeing and the FAA have declined to comment.
Boeing did not initially disclose the existence of a key safety system tied to both fatal crashes known as MCAS to pilots. The legislation requires manufacturers to disclose to the FAA, airlines and pilots ""all safety-critical information related to an aircraft.""
The FAA must review Boeing employees performing duties on behalf of the FAA to ensure they meet minimum qualifications. 
The FAA must also report to Congress on the status of its implementation of various recommendations issued after the 737 MAX crashes.
The moves include increasing civil penalties, providing resources for the FAA to build highly qualified staff and requiring reviews of pilot-training standards. 
It also requires system safety assessments for all significant proposed design changes and requires FAA approval of all Boeing employees conducting certification tasks for the FAA. 
Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed a bill to reform FAA airplane certification and the U.S. House unanimously passed a similar bill.
On Friday, Senate Commerce Republicans released a 102-page report that found Boeing officials ""inappropriately coached"" test pilots during recertification efforts for the MAX.

The committee said it appeared FAA and Boeing officials ""were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.""

1442,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 02:27PM ET</span>",IPO Euphoria Drives Record $435 Billion in U.S. Stock Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- In a year that saw a pandemic upend financial markets and economies around the globe, U.S. companies and their largest shareholders raised a record $435 billion with stock sales.
That’s far above the previous high of $279 billion set in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The windfall shows how issuers have dramatically turned to capital markets amid an equity rebound from the depths of the pandemic. About a quarter of this year’s bonanza came from traditional initial public offerings, which have raised a record $100 billion -- the most ever, excluding the impact of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.’s massive debut in 2014.
In a departure from past years, the largest IPOs delivered some of the best returns in 2020. Freshly minted stocks such as Snowflake Inc., Airbnb Inc. and Unity Software Inc. have soared as investors looked beyond economic, political and corporate-profit uncertainties. Companies that have raised more than $1 billion are trading 81% above their average offering price, outperforming smaller debuts.
“What we’re seeing is deals often overshooting fundamental value,” said Paul Abrahimzadeh, co-head of equity capital markets for North America at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). “Record high growth multiples are directly related to lower rates. Anything that grows in a low growth environment, gets a massive premium.”
While mega-listings by technology companies have drawn investors’ attention, it was the biotechnology industry that lured the most cash of any sector. More than 100 listings in that sector have raised about $23 billion this year, followed by $19 billion for tech, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
Over 70 foreign companies went public in the U.S. this year, raising more than $21 billion -- the most since 2014. The majority of those proceeds came from Chinese debuts despite congressional action to step up regulatory scrutiny.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). drove much of the year’s activity, each being credited with a share of over 10% of the traditional IPO market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Wall Street has seen a spike in listings by special purpose acquisition companies -- or SPACs -- which have become a hot area of the market as a way for purchasers to avoid the costly and time-consuming initial public offering process. Instead, they sell shares of a company that has no operations, promising to use the money within two years to buy a private one.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG and Citigroup handled the most of those issues this year.
More than 240 SPACs went public this year in the U.S., raising $81 billion for potential acquisitions. Although some successful mergers have come out of this sector -- such as Nikola Inc. and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc. -- these debuts in general underperformed. SPACs are trading about 15% above their IPO prices on average.
Secondary Offerings
While 2020 was a banner year for IPOs, companies that were already public also took advantage of demand. The $260 billion raised by these deals is the most ever, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
While pandemic-stricken issuers such as airlines and cruise-ship operators raised cash to stay afloat, investors had plenty of incentive to fund the deals. The biotech sector also drew the largest portion of the year’s windfall, raising about $63 billion, such as the stock sale by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. in May to fund its coronavirus vaccine candidate.
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). emerged as the year’s top banks for secondary offerings.
While companies bucked traditional IPOs for SPACs, they found other ways to get creative for companies that were already public. For example, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. announced some of the largest at-the-market programs in history. These deals allowed companies to capitalize on bullish bidding from retail investors by selling shares directly into the open market. The year proved the busiest year on record for these programs.
Another nontraditional strategy that gained in popularity is the registered direct offering. These sales, which also spiked to a record this year, allow issuers to skip hiring underwriters. Typically reserved for the smallest of offerings, in 2020 the deal structure was adopted for larger companies such as Carnival,  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA). and  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd.
Convertible Bonds
This was also a massive year in equity-linked issuance. More than $100 billion of convertible bonds were sold in the U.S., according to Bloomberg’s league tables, roughly doubling 2019’s volume.
Favorable deal terms and low interest rates contributed to the surge in popularity. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BofA were the top underwriters of U.S. equity-linked issuance this year, Bloomberg’s league tables say.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) abruptly called for an end to enrollment in its coronavirus vaccine trial and told scientists from six Latin American countries to wrap up their work within 48 hours, two researchers told Reuters.
The halt was due to J&J's decision, announced later on that same day on Dec. 9, to cap the number of participants at about 40,000 people globally, down from a previous plan for 60,000. 
The drugmaker said that a surge in coronavirus cases in the areas it was testing would give it enough data to vet the vaccine.
Wrapping up recruitment more quickly - while continuing to monitor volunteers already participating - would keep J&J on target to seek U.S. authorization for the shot early next year, the company has said, if it proves successful against a virus that has already killed nearly 1.7 million people.
J&J told Reuters it would not comment on its enrollment beyond a Friday statement that said the trial had closed.
But the move has raised questions, and sparked disappointment, for some in Latin America, according to interviews with a dozen researchers, government officials and disease experts. 
Dr Miguel O'Ryan, leader of trials in three medical centers in and around Santiago, Chile, told Reuters his trials were abruptly closed to new volunteers after his team of 50 doctors and nurses had rushed to find people willing to take part in each age group. 
Researchers had been left ""furious"" that they weren't given any prior warning and had to let down hundreds of people already scheduled to participate, he said. 
""At first they contact you, say they want all this, you get geared up and then overnight they tell you 'that's it,'"" he said. ""You understand the need to be more flexible... but it is hard for the research community in a study like this when the rules of the game change so quickly.""
Peru, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia had all offered to participate in the trial, hoping that would give them preferential access to J&J's vaccine in the global race to stockpile doses. J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply. 
Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials.
J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers.
The drugmaker expects an initial analysis of the data by late January. If the trial proves successful, the company plans to seek U.S. authorization in February.
SEEKING SUPPLY
To date, none of the six countries in Latin America participating in the trial has finalized a vaccine supply agreement with J&J, even though they still do not have enough doses from other vaccine makers to inoculate all of their citizens. Health officials in all six countries said that negotiations were still in progress. 
Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who has extensive disease research experience in Latin America, said ensuring both rich and poor countries had good access to vaccines was a ""key social justice issue for the world.""
""Countries in Latin America, as they are establishing trial sites, need to pressure for these deals when they are negotiating with the industry. But also it's on the companies,"" he said. 
Ko cited the approach of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc to helping less wealthy nations produce and distribute its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with Oxford University.
AstraZeneca's vaccine is viewed as one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.
J&J turned to Latin America when infection rates there spiked, as a way to accelerate testing of the vaccine and gauge its effectiveness in diverse populations. The drugmaker shared its plans for the region with Reuters in September, saying it aimed to enroll 20,000 participants in the six countries by November.
The J&J vaccine is easier to transport and store and is administered in a single shot, unlike vaccines from front-runners  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which are delivered in two doses.
J&J has signed an agreement in principle to provide the COVAX vaccine program with up to 500 million doses of its vaccine through 2022 for distribution to lower income countries. 
""This vaccine would be a game changer because of that single dose, not just for Latin America but for Asia, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and much of the world,"" said Ko. ""Two doses is exponentially more difficult to administer. I would think countries would jump on this if a safe and effective one-dose vaccine comes onboard.""
Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to purchase vaccines from four companies including J&J, with health officials indicating a preference for the J&J single-dose shot.
Mexico's Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier this month at a news conference that hosting the Janssen trial would give the country priority access to the vaccine. Foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said last week Mexico could order 22 million doses under a memorandum of understanding.
The Mexican government declined to comment on the halting of trial recruitment and the likelihood now of a priority vaccine supply deal.
A Peruvian government source told Reuters that new deals could be announced in the coming days, but declined to comment on which companies they could involve. 
The source said that there were constant surprises in the fast-moving negotiations taking place between governments and pharmaceutical companies around the world in the race to lock in deals, with intense and regular back-and-forth around price, quantity, delivery times and contractual conditions. 
""Things change so fast that I could tell you something now and tomorrow it will be outdated,"" he said.
FAMILY AFFAIR
During a conference call that Janssen - J&J's pharmaceuticals division - convened with scientists from 100 Latin American trial sites on Dec. 9, local researchers, who had been working at full speed to help the company meet its ambitious goals, voiced their anger at the sudden announcement they should now wrap up their operations when their target volunteer numbers were not yet met and they had hundreds of people scheduled to be screened and vaccinated, according to two participants.
J&J in the statement issued on Friday expressed ""its thanks to all participants, trial sites and health care professionals involved in the ENSEMBLE study."" It did not comment on the angry reaction over the conference call. 
In all, the Latin American sites appear to have enrolled about 16,000 people, according to a Reuters tally of figures reported by trial leaders and governments.
Any shortfall would be meaningful for individual research sites, who are paid based on the number of people they recruit. Reuters could not determine the range of what researchers are paid, which varies depending on a number of factors, including their specific locations, third-party partners and target size of trials.
The urgency to sign people up quickly was evident at a site in Colina, Chile, late November, where a Reuters journalist was among the dozens of volunteers who moved along the queue in a narrow waiting room.
Most of those volunteering were medical workers, the worst-hit by the pandemic, and their families. Trial staff also signed up their own families and friends to help make their numbers, they told Reuters.
The start of trials in Chile, Peru and Mexico were delayed by several weeks, held up by factors like regulatory scrutiny, technical glitches and a scramble to get supplies.
In Brazil, the effort began without a hitch in October, with people from all walks of life taking part, said a researcher.
""There were thousands who volunteered. People are very enthusiastic to help and put up with long waits,"" said Eduardo Vasconcellos, trial leader at the L2iP clinical research institute in Brasilia. 
Alejandra Camino, a trial investigator at privately-run DIM health clinics in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, said that, although the abrupt end to enrollment was not ideal, it was important to remain flexible in the fight against COVID-19.

    ""It's a disappointment because if you set it up and found a venue, your operation is now going to be out of pocket,"" she said of her colleagues' work on their trials. ""But we are talking about a pandemic.""

1445,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley lead U.S. bank rally after stress test","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - U.S. bank shares outperformed the broader market on Monday, led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), after the Federal Reserve said stress test results meant the sector could resume stock buybacks for the first time since the coronavirus-led downturn. 
The Fed said the biggest U.S. banks had enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and would now be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis.
Earlier this year, the Fed barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This was its second bank ""stress test"" for 2020, the first time the Fed has done two in a year since annual health checks began after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. 
Goldman shares were last up 7.2% after surpassing their January high for the first time since the COVID-crisis. Morgan Stanley was up 5.9% and trading at its highest since September 2007. 
In comparison, the S&P 500 bank subsector, which does not include Goldman or Morgan Stanley, was up 3.1%. 
The regulator's decision came quicker than many investors had expected and suggested Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs investors were in line for bigger buybacks than the majority of the sector, according to Piper Sander analyst Jeffery Harte.
""Overall, the amount of share buybacks the Fed's math suggests the big banks will be able to make in the first quarter of 2021 is good news for the group,"" said Harte.
As for Goldman Sachs, Harte noted that investors had worried more about the bank's dividend prospects during the pandemic. 
""It's quite a positive change from people being concerned Goldman wouldn't be able to maintain their dividend to being able to buyback more stocks than most of the sector,"" he said.
The Fed's decision came earlier than expected and the results were a little better than expected across the board, said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
""Generally people thought the Fed was going to keep restrictions in place another quarter or two,"" said Grant, who also suggested investors were favoring Morgan Stanley and Goldman due to relatively cheap valuations. 
Goldman's 9.9 forward price to earnings multiple, which compares its trading price to analyst expectations for earnings per share for the next 12 months, is well below the industry median of 12.9, according to Refinitiv 
Morgan Stanley's 12.3 multiple also lags the median. 
In the sector index JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) led gainers, up 4.8% while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) climbed 3.7% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) was up 4.0%.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was down 0.6% as investors fled risk after a new strain of the coronavirus emerged in the United Kingdom, leading several countries to close their borders to Britain just days before the UK is set to leave the European Union.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 12:52PM ET</span>",Big Tech's stealth push to influence the Biden administration,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Silicon Valley is working behind the scenes to secure senior roles for tech allies in lesser-known but still vital parts of president-elect Joe Biden's administration, even as the pushback against Big Tech from progressive groups and regulators grows. 
The Biden transition team has already stacked its agency review teams with more tech executives than tech critics. It has also added to its staff several officials from Big Tech companies, which emerged as top donors to the campaign.
Now, executives and employees at tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) are pushing to place candidates in senior roles at government agencies, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
The agencies many of these executives are aiming for include the U.S. Commerce Department, Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Office of Information & Regulatory Affairs - a key agency under the White House Office of Management & Budget which drafts policies impacting the tech industry, the State Department and the Department of Defense, according to the sources.
Many company executives, who in some cases helped raise money for the Biden campaign or have ties to those on the president-elect's transition team, still have a huge commercial interest in pushing candidates with industry ties at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission – both of which are investigating whether Big Tech abused its market power. But the spotlight on those agencies from progressive interest groups and members of Congress is likely to make it much harder for Silicon Valley to succeed, the sources said.
To be sure, there is no formal process via which such names and recommendations are being floated by company executives to the transition team. A Biden transition spokesman Cameron French said agency review team members and future administration appointees will be committed to implementing Biden's policy ideas. 
""Each member of the Biden-Harris transition and incoming administration will have values that align with the President and Vice President-elect on a host of issues including the tech sector,"" he said.
Facebook and Microsoft declined comment. Amazon's public policy and communications chief Jay Carney told Reuters that Amazon is not trying to get anyone from the company placed in the new administration. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is completely false,"" Carney said. 
Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said ""as a company, we make no recommendations and are unaware of any such communications."" 
SEEKING INFLUENCE
Researchers, lawyers and consultants tracking the transition or working with the team told Reuters the moves are part of an effort by many large tech company officials to influence future policymaking. They are also making sure the Biden administration is not captive to the ideas of progressive Democrats and a growing anti-monopoly movement, who have consistently pushed for higher scrutiny of such companies.
""In 2020, appointing the CEO or top executives of a tech company directly in to your cabinet is bad optics and bad politics,"" said Max Moran, a researcher with the Revolving Door Project. He added that allies of Big Tech have begun to emerge as candidates for Biden jobs.
For example, Google's former Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, a billionaire who is a Silicon Valley titan, has been making personnel recommendations for appointments to the Department of Defense - as the company tries to pursue military contracts and defense work, according to three sources.
Schmidt chairs the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI). His vice-chairman on the commission, former deputy secretary of defense Robert Work, has briefed the Biden transition team on national security issues. Schmidt's name has also come up in discussions to lead a Biden White House technology task force, a suggestion that has been opposed by progressives, according to three sources. 
One of the names Schmidt has floated for a senior defense department role is Christopher Kirchhoff, a former aide to the Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff under the Obama administration who currently works at Schmidt Futures, two sources said. Schmidt has also pushed for Jared Cohen, the chief executive of Jigsaw, a tech incubator that operates as an independent unit under Google, for a role inside the state department or the defense department, according to two sources. Cohen has previously served at the State Department.
A spokeswoman for Eric Schmidt declined comment. A NSCAI spokeswoman said any work being done by Schmidt and Work in their personal capacity is not associated with the NSCAI.
Similarly, two Amazon officials have landed spots on the president-elect's agency review teams for the State Department and the Office of Management and Budget.
Now, executives with Amazon are pushing allies for roles inside the Biden administration, according to sources who work with the transition. Names that have emerged as a result include Indra Nooyi, former chairwoman of Pepsi, who now sits on Amazon's board and whose name has been floated to run the Commerce Department, three sources said. 
Facebook, unlike the other companies, has already made significant inroads into the Biden transition team, multiple sources said. 
For example, former Facebook director Jessica Hertz is the Biden transition's general counsel. Austin Lin, a former program manager at Facebook, is on an agency review team for the Executive Office of the President. Erskine Bowles, a former Facebook board member, is already advising the transition team, along with Jeff Zients, another former Facebook board member, who has now been picked to become Biden's COVID-19 czar. 
Another ally for some large tech companies is Biden's pick for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who has ties with both Amazon and Google, according to four sources. Google was a client at WestExec Advisors, which was founded by Blinken. Blinken also helped Amazon's public policy and communications chief Jay Carney get hired into Joe Biden's media team in 2008. 
Google's Castaneda said the company's relationship with West Exec lasted one month in 2018 and the company did not retain any member of the firm. Carney declined comment. WestExec Advisors declined comment. Blinken did not respond to requests for comment.
Four sources said names floated by tech companies have been discussed during meetings held by the Biden transition's agency review teams. These teams have made several hiring recommendations, they said.
GROWING PUSHBACK
While Silicon Valley reaches for a bigger seat at the table, the pushback from progressive groups is notable. 
In November, 32 antitrust, consumer advocacy, labor and related groups sent a letter to Biden asking him to reject the influence of Big Tech companies on his administration. 
Many of these groups are now banding together and advocating more forcefully. For example, several of the 32 are part of a new coalition that is designed to expand the number of groups that care about the industry's influence on government. Alex Harman, who oversees competition policy for Public Citizen, an advocacy group which is part of the coalition, said he has been in meetings with Biden's agency review teams with a clear goal: making sure such hires are not made by the administration.

Biden's teams have been listening to their concerns, but it's not much of a dialogue, he added. ""They are not telling us what they are thinking, they are just asking us what our priorities are.""

Investing.com --  FuboTV's up 25% as live sports partnership deals may be on the table. 
Shares are up more than 430% to a 2020 record as cord-cutters turn to new alternatives to for their viewing pleasure. 
""Everything is always on the table,"" Chief Executive Officer David Gandler told Axios, as the company ""should be looking at"" forming exclusive partnership deals for live sports offerings.
FuboTV, founded in 2015, is mainly focused on providing live sports including NFL, MLB and NBA games. It streams 90% of nationwide football games; 100% of the NHL and 88% of MLB. FuboTV also has more regional sports networks in its base package than any other live TV streaming platform.
Third quarter numbers reported last month exceeded the company's own expectations. Paid subscribers rose 58% in the third quarter from a year earlier to 455,000. Revenue per user also increased in that time by 14% to $67.70.
""We believe fuboTV sits firmly at the intersection of three megatrends: the secular decline of traditional TV viewership, the shift of TV ad dollars to connected TVs and online sports wagering, a market which we intend to enter,"" said Edgar Bronfman Jr., executive chairman of the company, in a statement. ""As a result, we believe our growth opportunities are numerous. Our optimism in the future of fuboTV and the live TV streaming business has never been stronger.”

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Aon's $30 billion Willis Towers deal in EU antitrust crosshairs,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Aon (NYSE:AON)'s $30 billion bid for Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) to create the world's largest insurance broker faces a five-month long investigation after EU antitrust regulators voiced concerns that the deal may hurt competition in key markets.
The merger of the world's second and third largest brokers would overtake world No. 1 Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (NYSE:MMC). The deal came just as financial markets were sliding as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
The pandemic has triggered a sharp rise in claims for insurers, on top of other challenges such as climate change, and hit their investment portfolios. 
Falling valuations and companies looking to shore up business models have in turn sparked a run of deals across the insurance industry.
Aon said it was confident of securing EU approval without having to sell any assets to allay competition concerns and that it was on track to close the deal in the first half of 2021.
The European Commission said the deal could significantly reduce competition in markets for commercial risk brokerage services, re-insurance brokerage and provision of retirement and health & welfare services to commercial customers.
It cited brokerage services to large multi-national customers in property and casualty, financial and professional, credit and political risk, cyber and marine as well as customers in the space and aerospace manufacturing industry as the most affected.
The EU investigation will also examine the provision of reinsurance brokerage services and the provision of retirement and health & welfare services. The EU competition enforcer set a May 10 date for its decision.

Reuters had reported on Dec. 15 that the EU competition enforcer would open an in-depth investigation into the deal after Aon declined to offer concessions to address EU competition concerns.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities tumbled, the dollar strengthened and volatility surged across asset classes as a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain in Britain threatened to torpedo markets' optimism over a vaccine-fuelled rebound in economic growth.
Wall Street was tipped to open sharply lower.
The strain, said to be up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has put some 16 million Britons under tougher lockdowns and prompted several countries to shut their borders to the UK, effectively overshadowing positive U.S. news on a much-needed stimulus bill.
The shutdown of international travel and the flow of freight in and out of Britain threatens chaos for British households and businesses. 
Coinciding with the lack of a post-Brexit trade deal ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, it sent the pound 2.5% lower below $1.32 at one point, though the currency clawed back some of the losses to trade around $1.3285 by 1250 GMT. 
Markets broadly edged off earlier lows though most stayed firmly in the red. UK equities were down just over 2%, while UK banks Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) lost more than 6% at one stage before recovering slightly.
European equities fell around 2.5%. Travel and leisure stocks lost 3.5%.
""Our base case, based on what we know, is that we will stay under strict lockdowns for weeks into the New Year,"" said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal & General Investment Management. 
He said the strain had already likely entered Europe, meaning ""countries that are not in lockdown will have no choice but to do that quickly and that's what markets are reacting to.""
The selloffs triggered across-the-board increases in volatility, a measure of price swings on an asset class, taking Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" the VIX to the highest since early November.
Currency volatility jumped too, with overnight sterling volatility approaching nine-month highs 
Futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, recouping some earlier falls, while Nasdaq futures were down 1.2% (NQc1).
While safe-haven assets such as German and U.S. government bonds rallied, gold, which usually rises during times of turmoil, fell as much as 1.3% before clawing back some of that loss.
Its weakness on a day of big equity selloffs will rekindle memories of the market slump of March when investors sold assets en masse in a rush for the dollar.
On the positive side, U.S. congressional leaders have finally agreed a roughly $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill.
LGIM's van den Heiligenberg predicted also that vaccine rollouts would limit market downside.
""A correction is justified but a very strong selloff would surprise us...because of the vaccine, by next March-April, we should be able to think about normalisation again,"" he added. 
DOLLAR DASH?
The equity selloff sent investors scurrying for the U.S. dollar, pushing the greenback index as high as 90.8, well off last week's 2-1/2- year low. 
The euro fell as much as 1% at one point to $1.216.
U.S. and German bond yields slipped, with 10-year U.S. yields down six basis points. British two-year borrowing costs hit record lows
The U.S. two-year/10-year Treasury yield curve, another gauge of growth expectations, flattened a touch. It had risen to its steepest level in almost three years on Friday amid optimism about the stimulus bill..
The turmoil could upend some bullish bets on oil and copper which were expected to benefit from a growth upswing next year.
Brent crude futures dropped 3% while copper fell off the $8000-per-tonne mark it recently scaled for the first time since 2013.

""The message is clear: oil prices are still very much and will continue to be at the mercy of the pandemic,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.

On traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year, large queues snaked around some Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY), Aldi and Lidl stores, according to Reuters reporters across London. 
Many shoppers were buying traditional Christmas fare, or adapting it after Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed stricter measures from Sunday which have stopped many families meeting up and pushed people to rush to buy food for their own gatherings.
""Sunday was exceptionally busy - today has gone bananas,"" said one supermarket manager.
At Waitrose in Clapham, many shoppers had planned to leave London to see family for the festive period but were now stocking up for a Christmas in the capital. 
Meat and milk were sold out in some supermarkets but traditional panic buying targets such as baked beans and pasta were in good supply. 
Gaps will start to appear on British supermarket shelves within days if transport ties with mainland Europe are not quickly restored, Sainsbury's warned on Monday.
Sainsbury's said all products for ""the Great British Christmas lunch"" were already in the country and it had plentiful supplies of these.
Johnson's spokesman said supply chains were resilient.

""It remains the position that people should shop normally,"" the spokesman said.

Tesla’s shares sank 5% to $659.99 a half hour into the session. In its first day in the S&P 500, the stock was one of the biggest drags on the benchmark index, which was down 1.2%. 
The company, headed by billionaire Elon Musk, becomes the most valuable ever admitted to Wall Street's main benchmark and accounted for a 1.69% weight in the index ahead of Monday's trading. The shares had surged some 70% since mid-November, when Tesla's debut in the S&P 500 was announced https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/media-center/news-announcements/#indexNews, and have soared about 700% so far in 2020.
The shares jumped 6% on Friday in a day of frantic trading ahead of their S&P 500 entry.
Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 led index-tracking funds to buy $90.3 billion of shares by the end of Friday's session so that their portfolios reflected the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices' analyst Howard Silverblatt. The change is effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, S&P said earlier in December, and Tesla is replacing Apartment Investment and Management Co. 
""All the buying was done on Friday,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities. ""The news is done now ... the question now is what next.""
Silverblatt said for every $11.11 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 changes 1 point, while the S&P's 2021 price/earnings ratio will rise to 22.6 from 22.3. 
The dividend yield for the S&P after Tesla's inclusion would fall to 1.53% from 1.56%, he said. 
California-based Tesla's stock surge has put its market value at about $630 billion, making it the sixth most valuable publicly listed U.S. company with many investors viewing it as wildly overvalued. 
Tesla is by far the most traded stock by value on Wall Street, with $18 billion worth of its shares exchanged on average in each session over the past 12 months, easily beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in second place with average daily trades of $14 billion, according to Refinitiv.

About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders.

Investing.com --   Nike  (NYSE:NKE) rose to a record after reporting stellar results and a strong outlook, and getting price target bumps from several analysts.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said revenue estimates may be far below true potential.
Earnings per share of 78 cents beat the 62 cent estimate on sales of $11.24 billion, which compares to the expected $10.55 billion. Second quarter revenue was up 9% compared to the prior year, led by Greater China where sales grew 24%. Brand digital sales increased 84%, with triple-digit growth in North America.
""We are increasing our full year outlook for revenue and now expect low teens growth versus the prior year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend in the earnings call on Friday. ""Our gross margin outlook is also improving, with stronger than planned return to normalized inventory levels and lower than expected markdown activity across our portfolio. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand up to fifty basis points versus the prior year, including 35 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.""
Morgan Stanley increased the price target to $176 from $165 on the good guidance. Analyst Kimberly Greenberger said that although valuation multiples are high, out-year revenue forecasts may be as much as $3 billion too low, according to StreetInsider.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) reiterated a buy-equivalent rating on the stock and raised the price target on the sneaker maker to $162 from $160, citing strong sales and better-than-expected cost management. 
Analyst Michael Binetti said the firm sees strong potential for the second half above guidance and positive revisions to consensus margin estimates for ""several"" quarters, according to StreetInsider.

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe faces significant disruption to air transport as a growing number of countries bans flights from Britain due to fears over a new coronavirus strain, prompting airlines to repeat calls for more testing to keep borders open.
Eurocontrol Director General Eamonn Brennan said there had been 900 daily flights between Britain and the 27 countries of the European Union between Monday and Saturday last week. 
""We’ll see a significant impact on the network as a result of the new (coronavirus) variant in the UK,"" the head of the pan-European air traffic control agency wrote on Twitter.
Already reeling from the loss of some six million flights since March due to the pandemic, airlines faced a flood of overnight restrictions echoing the sudden impact of ash from an Icelandic volcano eruption in 2010, albeit on reduced traffic levels.
""The measures came in at extremely short notice,"" an airline industry official told Reuters.
Shares in European airlines fell sharply, led by UK-based carriers easyJet (LON:EZJ), down almost 10%, and British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), down 9%.
As EU officials met to try to forge a coordinated response, airlines issued a fresh appeal to step up testing regimes in order to keep borders open.
""Governments must cooperate to put mutually recognized testing capacity in place so that borders can remain open to the vast majority of healthy passengers,"" the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.
IATA, which represents most major airlines, said the World Health Organization had adopted a mantra of ""test, test and test again"" and added: ""We implore governments to act on this advice"".
MIXED RESTRICTIONS
Under initial restrictions, which came into force on Monday, carriers faced a mixed bag of conditions.
Italy and Germany exempted cargo and medical flights from their bans on flights from the United Kingdom, which has said a new, more easily transmissible variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly. 
Romania also exempted mail flights, but it was not immediately clear to what extent postal services would be hit elsewhere.
Germany's Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) said earlier it was halting all deliveries of parcels to Britain.
France, Latvia and Bulgaria banned all flights from Britain with no apparent exemptions, according to notices to pilots. Britain expressed surprised at the inclusion of freight.
Airlines operating in London Heathrow, meanwhile, were warned to ensure passengers do not become stranded in Britain and ""can be appropriately routed to the final destination"".
The Netherlands said in an industry bulletin that Dutch carriers and Britain's easyJet would be able to repatriate aircraft and crew ""in order to get these planes out of the United Kingdom"".
Long-haul travel was also affected, though traffic on those routes is already the worst hit from the slump in air travel demand caused by the pandemic.
Hong Kong said it would ban all flights arriving from the United Kingdom from midnight, in the first such move in Asia.

Canada said on Sunday it would halt passenger flights from the United Kingdom for 72 hours.

Investing.com --  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6% from an all-time high as it makes its debut in the S&P 500. 
The stock hit a record of $695 on Friday, and had rallied some 730% this year. 
Tesla is the most valuable company admitted to the Wall Street benchmark and will account for 1.69% of the index, Reuters said, citing S&P Dow Jones Indices' analyst Howard Silverblatt. 
The electric vehicle maker traced broader markets lower as the U.K. shut down amid a mutation of the coronavirus that frightened investors. The $900 billion stimulus plan that was finally agreed upon yesterday wasn't enough to ease fears. The company is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of about 172 times, according to Yahoo Finance. That measure of value compares to Ford's 24 times, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 32 times and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s 30 times.
Analysts are split on the stock, which has 7seven buy ratings, 11 holds and seven sells, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Price targets range widely from $60 to $750, with the average at about $417.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower on Monday, as news of the discovery of a new strain of the Covid-19 virus prompted fears of tighter lockdowns and more economic damage, especially in Europe.
Markets were also selling the fact of a fiscal relief package agreed by Congress over the weekend, after buying heavily into the rumor during months of negotiations beforehand. Lawmakers have agreed a $900 billion package that will help stave off the worst effects of the pandemic’s latest wave, which has seen layoffs rise and economic activity slow sharply in recent weeks.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 193 points or 0.6% at 29,986 points. The Dow Futures contract had traded down more than 600 points overnight, so that represents something of a recovery.
The S&P 500 was down 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6%
Among the big outperformers were banking stocks, after the Federal Reserve said it will allow banks to resume stock buybacks from the first quarter of next year. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 3.4% in response to the bank’s statement on Friday that it intended to launch a new $30 billion buyback program in the first quarter, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) stock rose 4.9% to a new 52-week high, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock also both rose over 3%.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) stock also bucked the trend, the sports gear company rising 6.0% after a handsome earnings beat on Friday evening.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 6.2% on its first day of trading as an S&P 500 stock. Retail investors who ran the stock up aggressively ahead of its inclusion in the index now have a reduced incentive to hold it, after passively-managed funds that track the S&P were effectively forced to include it in their portfolios. A brief exchange between CEO Elon Musk and a Bitcoin enthusiast prompting him to convert the cash on Tesla's balance sheet into digital currency may also have unsettled some investors (albeit while inspiring others). Musk had tweeted a suggestive picture at the weekend giving the impression that he wanted to invest in Bitcoin.
As so often happens with negative news about the coronavirus, travel stocks were among the hardest hit, as investors pushed back their expectations for the travel industry to return to normal. Newly-listed Airbnb  (NASDAQ:ABNB), whose IPO two weeks ago was supported by heavy interest in ‘reopening’ trades, fell 6.8%. It's still trading at more than double its IPO price, however.

(Reuters) -Britain's financial watchdog has fined U.S.-listed  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW)'s UK business 8.96 million pounds ($11.88 million) for failing to protect client assets, likening it to missteps taken by Lehman Brothers before the 2008 financial crisis.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said https:// the penalty was for Charles Schwab UK Ltd (CSUK) carrying out a regulated activity without permission and making a false statement to the watchdog.
It added that the breaches, which occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, affected retail customers.
""As we saw with Lehman Brothers and subsequent cases, a lack of client asset protections can easily lead to increased costs to consumers and funds being trapped for long periods of time,"" said Mark Steward, executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA.
A spokesperson for the company acknowledged that the matter was settled with the FCA, adding that client money and assets were protected at all times in accordance with U.S. rules. 
""Although no clients or assets were negatively impacted, we regret the errors and are pleased this matter has been resolved,"" CSUK said. 
The regulator said CSUK neither had the right records and accounts to identify its customers' client assets, nor did it have adequate organisational arrangements to safeguard them.
The FCA said the company did not have permission to safeguard and administer custody assets at all times, and failed to mention the breach when applying for the correct permission. 
The firm falsely informed the FCA that its auditors had confirmed it had adequate systems and controls in place to protect client assets, the watchdog said, adding there was no actual loss of client assets. 
CSUK agreed to settle the case and qualified for a 30% discount, without which the penalty would have been 12.8 million pounds, the FCA added.

1464,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",Wall Street Set for $11 Billion in Buybacks on Fed Decision,"(Bloomberg) -- The six biggest U.S. banks will be able to buy back as much as $11 billion of their own shares in the first quarter of next year after the Federal Reserve gave lenders the green light to resume purchases.
Bank stocks climbed after the central bank’s show of confidence, even as U.S. equity futures pointed to sharp losses for the broader market. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) jumped 4.6%,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). added 3.7% and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). advanced 3.2% in early New York trading.
The gains followed a second round of 2020 stress tests, released late Friday, that indicated Wall Street navigated the Covid-19 turbulence and has adequate capital to weather an extended economic downturn caused by the virus. In June, the Fed put temporary caps on shareholder payouts by the biggest banks, prohibiting them from buying back their own stocks or increasing dividend payments.
JPMorgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in statements they plan to resume buybacks starting next quarter. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs said they also intend to resume purchases next year, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan has said the firm plans to buy back stock “as soon as we’re allowed to.”
Based on the new distribution policy, the six biggest U.S. banks could buy back as much as $11 billion of shares in the first quarter, assuming fourth-quarter earnings come in at the levels analysts estimate. That would roughly triple their shareholder payouts.
Wall Street banks have been largely on the sidelines during this year’s stock market rally as they’ve eagerly awaited permission to boost capital distributions.
Here are some other key takeaways from the Fed stress tests:
Dividends unchanged
Even as buybacks resume, dividends will remain unchanged through March, capped at whatever each bank returned in this year’s second quarter. The Fed said banks’ payouts to shareholders in the first quarter of next year can’t exceed their average quarterly income for 2020.
The banks currently distribute about 30% of their profit to shareholders through dividends. The buybacks can bring total payouts to 100% of banks’ average net income over the previous four quarters.
Banks are ‘a source of strength,’ Fed says
Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said the banking system has been “a source of strength during the past year,” adding that the second round of stress tests “confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy.” None of the largest banks fell beneath their capital minimums under the Fed test’s hypothetical scenarios.
Dissenting views
Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups have been urging the Fed to force banks to stockpile capital as long as the economy continues to sputter. Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who voted against the decision, said: “Prudence would call for more modest payouts to preserve lending to households and borrowers during an exceptionally challenging winter.”
Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a member of the Senate Finance committee, said regulators should be focusing on strengthening the financial system so it can support customers during the pandemic, rather than allowing “billions in dividends and bonuses for a select few.”
European regulators are stingier
The Fed’s relaxation of capital rules is greater than what European regulators are permitting. The Bank of England, which is again allowing dividends, has capped payouts at 25% of banks’ profit. The European Central Bank is allowing 30% of recent net income to be distributed to shareholders, compared with U.S. banks, which can return all the profit they’ve made this year.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","Sacklers cited fear of OxyContin lawsuits before transferring $10 billion from their company, documents show","By Mike Spector, Chad Terhune and Lisa Girion
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Members of the wealthy Sackler family, owners of OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, have long denied that the $10 billion they transferred from their company over the course of a decade was an unlawful attempt to shield assets in anticipation of litigation over their role in the opioid crisis. 
But a review of emails, memos, depositions, legal motions and other documents unsealed late on Friday in Purdue's bankruptcy proceedings show Sackler family members discussed potential litigation exposure at least as early as 2007, a full decade before they faced a new wide-ranging legal attack and significant financial transfers stopped. The documents were unsealed in response to legal actions from Reuters and other news organizations seeking to remove their heavy redactions. 
Purdue faced investigations and litigation before 2007, which it settled. Whether creditors can demonstrate that financial transfers since then were legally dubious hinges in part on whether they can show that the Sacklers knew they faced additional and significant litigation that could threaten Purdue’s solvency and the family’s wealth, estimated in December at $10.8 billion by Forbes magazine. 
In response to questions from a House oversight panel last week, David Sackler, who served on Purdue’s board from 2012 to 2018, testified that neither he, nor others, anticipated vast litigation that now totals roughly 3,000 legal actions. “I don't believe anyone knew that lawsuits that really began in earnest in 2017 would be coming back in 2008,” he told lawmakers. 
But in a March 2007 email with relatives, his uncle, Jonathan, at the time a director, cited “ongoing risks” two months before a Purdue affiliate pleaded guilty to misbranding OxyContin, adding that “if there’s a future perception that Purdue has screwed up on compliance, we could get murdered.” 
In a subsequent message, he said the family was “not really braced for” challenges that included “the emergence of numerous new lawsuits.” Jonathan died in June. 
In May 2007, a week after the company affiliate's guilty plea, David Sackler expressed concerns about future litigation to his father and uncle, the latter of whom assured him there was no basis for suing the family.  
“Well, I hope you're right and under logical circumstances I'd agree with you, but we're living in America. This is the land of the free and the home of the blameless,” Sackler wrote in an email. “We will be sued. Read the op-ed stuff in these local papers and ask yourself how long it will take these lawyers to figure out that we might settle with them if they can freeze our assets and threaten us.” 
The message was sent years before David Sackler joined Purdue’s board, at a time he knew little about the company's affairs, his lawyers said in a court filing. 
   
GAUGING LITIGATION RISK 
In court filings, the family members contend that Purdue management told them as recently as 2016 that they viewed opioid litigation risk as low and that creditors citing their emails have taken messages out of context. Most of the more than $10 billion they took out of Purdue went toward business investments and paying taxes, with Sackler-controlled entities receiving roughly $4 billion, documents show. 
""We supported the release of documents by the court and reaffirm that members of the Sackler family who served on Purdue's board of directors acted ethically and lawfully in every regard,"" Sackler family members targeted with litigation said in a statement. 
""These cherrypicked snippets of emails ignore the full context of what they say and the rest of the legal filings, all of which demonstrate how the fraudulent conveyance claims are entirely without merit,"" added Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer for the Raymond Sackler wing of the family, referring to creditors' challenges concerning the transfers. 
The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 people across the United States since 1999 due to overdoses from prescription painkillers and illegal drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. Purdue creditors have pursued the company and family through the company’s bankruptcy proceedings, forcing the drugmaker and the Sacklers to turn over tens of millions of documents. 
State officials said the documents undercut the family members' claims. “The Sacklers told Congress they did nothing wrong,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who has sued the Sacklers and Purdue alongside nearly every other state. “The evidence tells a different story – they got rich fueling the opioid crisis and plan to walk away billionaires.” 
‘WE DON’T WANT TO STAY’ 
Sackler family members also pursued acquiring additional product liability insurance and explored selling Purdue outright to offload its troubles, both without success, the documents showed. 
In a February 2008 email, Mortimer D.A. Sackler urged Richard Sackler, at one point Purdue’s president, to sell their company. “Fundamentally, we don’t want to stay in this business anymore (given the horrible risks, outlooks, difficulties, etc) and I think the majority of your family feels the same way,” Mortimer said. About a week later, he again pushed for a sale: “It is simply not prudent for us to stay in the business given the future risks we are sure to face and the impact they will have on the shareholder value of the business and hence the family’s wealth.” 
‘TRULY SORRY’ 
Purdue said it produced tens of millions of documents to creditors, including those that are privileged relating to the Sacklers, as part of an effort to settle widespread litigation in a deal it values at more than $10 billion, largely based on delivering addiction treatment and overdose reversal medications under development. 
The company has proposed restructuring into an entity run for the benefit of plaintiffs and no longer controlled by the Sacklers, who would contribute $3 billion. The entity also would continue selling OxyContin, which has drawn objections from state attorneys general and Democrats on Capitol Hill. 

Under a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Purdue pleaded guilty in November to criminal charges for misconduct relating to its opioids and agreed to more than $8 billion in penalties that will mostly go unpaid. 
Sackler family members agreed to pay $225 million to settle civil claims that they disputed. Neither they, nor other individuals, have been criminally charged. 
At the congressional hearing, David Sackler said press accounts of his family were wrong.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Southeast Asia travel app Traveloka weighs public listing options,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Traveloka, Southeast Asia's largest online travel app, said on Monday it was looking to go public soon and was evaluating a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as a possible stock-market listing option.
SPACs are shell companies that use proceeds from going public to buy another company, not yet identified at the time of listing. The resulting merger with the target company, often a start-up in a high-growth sector, offers it a faster and lower cost way to market than a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
“A SPAC is one of the options we are evaluating given we have been approached by a few,"" Traveloka president Henry Hendrawan said in a statement in response to a Reuters query.
Bankers have also said Jakarta-based Traveloka is among a handful of Southeast Asian companies that have been approached or are targets of SPACs. 
A source with knowledge of the matter said Traveloka is still deciding between an IPO or a SPAC and eying a valuation of $5-6 billion. Traveloka declined to comment.
Hendrawan told Reuters in late 2019 that Traveloka would consider a possible dual listing in Jakarta and another centre such as the United States. 
The eight-year-old Indonesian startup, which claims more than 60 million downloads and has expanded into financial services, announced in July it had raised $250 million in its latest funding round. 
After an earlier battering as Southeast Asian countries closed borders and imposed strict lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic, Traveloka is benefitting from an uptick in domestic tourism as governments in Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore encourage residents to explore their own countries. 
""Traveloka will be profitable by 2021,"" East Ventures managing partner and longtime backer Willson Cuaca told Reuters earlier in December. 
Hendrawan also told media in October he was expecting Traveloka to potentially be profitable by 2021.
Other investors include Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and U.S. online travel player  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE).

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler and French rival PSA gained EU antitrust approval on Monday for their $38 billion merger to create the world's No.4 carmaker after pledging to boost Japanese rival  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM). 
The two carmakers are looking to the deal to help them tackle the industry's dual challenges of funding cleaner vehicles and the global pandemic.
The European Commission said PSA will extend its small van agreement with Toyota Motor by increasing capacity for Toyota and cutting transfer prices for the vehicles, spare parts and accessories to address EU competition concerns, confirming a Reuters story in October.
""Access to a competitive market for small commercial vans is important for many self-employed and small and medium companies throughout Europe,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Fiat and PSA will also allow rivals to access their repair and maintenance networks for vans to help new entrants expand in the market, the EU competition enforcer said.
The merged entity to be called Stellantis would own brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati as well as Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Opel and DS.
""FCA and Groupe PSA warmly welcome the European Commission’s clearance authorizing the merger and the creation of Stellantis, a world leader in new mobility,"" the companies said, adding that the shareholders of both companies will meet separately on Jan 4 to approve the transaction. 
""The closing of the merger is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2021"".
FCA's controlling shareholder is Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family while PSA's investors are the Peugeot family, the French government and China's Dongfeng.

Futures contracts on the S&P 500 were trading down 0.5%, following European stocks lower after several major countries moved to suspend travel from the U.K. amid concerns about a new strain of Covid-19.
Traders who spent most of the year pushing up shares of Tesla in anticipation of surging demand from index funds saw its climax Friday, as frantic purchases by passive managers drove the shares up almost 5% as exchanges closed. At the end of the day, Tesla shares closed at an all-time high. More than $150 billion worth of Tesla shares traded on Friday, ahead of the index inclusion.

“There is strong precedence for positive returns for stocks prior to S&P 500 inclusion and post announcement, but very limited precedent for near term out performance post inclusion,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note earlier this month.
Market strategists have been divided on how the addition of the famously volatile stock would impact the benchmark gauge. According to Susquehanna quantitative derivative strategist Souhow Yao, the inclusion will have a limited impact on implied volatility, and that if Tesla was added a month ago, volatility for the S&P 500 would have actually decreased.
On the other hand, Interactive Brokers’ Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick said Tesla’s historic volatility suggests daily moves of about 4% up or down, and at its current market value can end up budging the index by about 2 points.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>","Shell to write down assets again, taking cuts to more than $22 billion","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Monday said it will write down the value of oil and gas assets by $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion following a string of impairments this year as it adjusts to a weaker outlook.
In an update ahead of its fourth quarter results on February 4, Shell said the post-tax charge was due in part to impairments on its Appomattox field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the closure of refineries and liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts.
It said some charges involved in its restructuring would be recognised in 2021.
Shell shares were down by around 4% in early trading in London.
In October, Shell, the world's biggest LNG trader, wrote down the value of its LNG portfolio by just under $1 billion, focusing on its flagship Prelude project in Australia.
That followed a $16.8 billion writedown in the second quarter which also included Prelude and a sharp cut in its price outlook.
(Graphic: Downsizing, https://graphics.reuters.com/OIL-WRITEDOWNS/qmypmxlrovr/chart.png) 
CEO Ben van Beurden on Feb. 11 will unveil Shell's long-term strategy to sharply reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and expand its low-carbon energy and power businesses.
In its update, the Anglo-Dutch company also said it expects oil and gas production in its upstream division to be around 2.275 to 2.350 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly higher than in the third quarter. 
Production was impacted by the closure of platforms in the Gulf of Mexico due to hurricanes as well as mild weather in Northern Europe.
LNG liquefaction volumes are expected to be between 8 and 8.6 million tonnes.
Oil refinery utilisation is expected to be between 72% and 76% of capacity in the quarter, reflecting continued weak demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Shell, the world's largest retailer, said its fuel sales were expected to be in a range of 4 to 5 million barrels per day, roughly similar to the third quarter.
Record profits from its marketing business, which includes over 45,000 petrol stations, strongly boosted Shell's third-quarter results. The company said, however, that its fourth-quarter marketing results were expected to be ""significantly lower"" than the previous quarter.
Oil and gas trading profits were also set to decline sharply in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, it said.

Future sold its retail assets in August to Reliance Industries in a deal Amazon said breached agreements Future made with the U.S. ecommerce leader in 2019.
In October, Amazon had won an injunction to halt the sale from a Singapore arbitrator that the sides had agreed to use in case of dispute.
Future later said the order was not binding, prompting Amazon to lodge a complaint with India's market regulator.
Future is widely credited as transforming India's retail sector in recent decades. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the business so hard that founder Kishore Biyani sought a buyer.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month approved Future's sale of its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
On Monday, the court observed that the suit filed by Future Group unit Future Retail was maintainable and its resolution approving the transaction with Reliance was also valid.
However, it noted that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage, Justice Mukta Gupta said in the verdict.
India's retail sector is likely to grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, showed data from  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR). The key battle is over groceries, likely to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024, the data showed.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Tesla's rise made 2020 the year the U.S. auto industry went electric,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Wall Street made 2020 the year that the U.S. auto industry decided to go electric.
Tesla's market capitalization surged above $600 billion, making the once wobbly startup founded by billionaire Elon Musk worth more than the five top-selling global vehicle making groups combined. The exclamation point came on Friday when Tesla rose to a record high in frantic trading ahead of the stock's much anticipated entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index.. 
For 2021, all signs point toward the industry accelerating its shift toward electrification, a turning point as historically momentous as the launch of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's moving assembly line for the Model T or General Motors (NYSE:GM) ' 2009 bankruptcy. 
Tesla's ascent came the same year that activist hedge funds and other investors ratcheted up pressure on corporations to fight climate change. Evidence is growing that more investors have concluded the century-long dominance of internal combustion engines - ""ICE (NYSE:ICE)"" in industry slang - is headed toward a close within a decade. 
From London to Beijing to California, political leaders also embraced plans to start phasing out internal combustion engine-only vehicles as early as 2030. Pressure to cut greenhouse gas emissions undermines the logic for significant new investments in ICE engines. Thousands of manufacturing jobs are currently tied to internal combustion in the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and other countries.
Other powerful forces also shook the auto industry's status quo this year. The COVID-19 pandemic stripped away the sales and profits that incumbent automakers had counted on to fund methodical transitions to electric vehicles. China's rapid recovery from the pandemic exerted an even more powerful gravitational pull on industry investment.
WILL CONSUMERS PLUG IN?
This was the year GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and other top industry executives began to echo Tesla's Musk, saying electric vehicle battery costs could soon achieve parity with internal combustion technology. Still, it remained to be seen whether consumers, particularly in the United States, are ready to say goodbye to petroleum-fueled pickup trucks and SUVs. 
The best-selling vehicles in the United States remain large, petroleum-burning pickup trucks. Demand for these vehicles powered a recovery for Detroit automakers after the pandemic forced factories to shut down in the spring. 
The best electric vehicle and battery makers could field models that match internal combustion upfront cost as soon as 2023, brokerage Bernstein wrote in a report. 
""ICE game over with BEV ~ 2030,"" Bernstein's auto analysts wrote, using the industry's acronyms for internal combustion engine and Battery Electric Vehicle.
The shift toward electric vehicles is speeding a parallel transformation of vehicles into largely digital machines that get much of their value from software that powers rich visual displays and features such as automated driving systems.
Across the industry, century-old manufacturers such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) are scrambling to hire programmers and artificial intelligence experts. 
The capability of software to manage autonomous driving systems, electricity flows from batteries and data streaming to and from vehicles is replacing horsepower as a measure of automotive engineering achievement.
Tesla's use of smartphone-style over-the-air software upgrades was once a unique feature of the Silicon Valley brand. In 2020, the best-selling model line in the United States, the Ford F-150 pickup, was redesigned to offer over-the-air software updates, making the technology as mainstream as it gets.
THE PANDEMIC AND CHINA
In the best of times, traditional internal-combustion vehicles would have faced huge costs and disruptions to their workforces to evolve to electric, software-intensive vehicles. But the shock delivered by the coronavirus pandemic gave manufacturers much less money and time to adapt. 
Consultancy IHS Markit forecasts that global vehicle production will not match 2019 levels again until 2023. Automakers will have produced 20 million fewer vehicles by 2023 than they could have built had output stayed at 2019 levels.
“Only the most agile with a Darwinian spirit will survive,” said Carlos Tavares, the  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) chief who will lead the combined Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Fiat Chrysler when that merger is completed. 
The pandemic also elevated the importance of China to the industry's future. That country's swift recovery from the pandemic amplified the gravitational pull of its huge market on automotive investment, despite anti-China rhetoric from U.S. and European politicians.
China's drive to reduce dependence on petroleum is compelling automakers to shift investment toward battery electric and hybrid vehicles, and re-center design and engineering activities to Chinese cities from traditional hubs in Nagoya, Wolfsburg and Detroit. Tesla said it will establish a design and research center in China. 

Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) AG Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius put it bluntly in October: “We need to look at our production footprint and where it makes sense, shift our production,” he said during a video call. “Last year we sold around 700,000 passenger cars in China. The next biggest market is the U.S. with between 320,000 and 330,000 cars.”

The unit is selling its cloud-connected products under the new name at a time of heightened concern in the United States about the national security risk of Chinese firms collecting and using the personal data of U.S. citizens.
Documents filed in California showed the unit became Wright Robotics in August, after the United States in May added CloudMinds to its so-called Entity List citing the risk of the firm procuring items and technology for China's military.
The United States can restrict sales to blacklisted firms of goods made domestically as well as goods made abroad containing U.S. technology.
It expanded the definition of military end use in April to include any firm that supported the maintenance or production of military items even if they primarily did commercial business.
CloudMinds has since been bailed out by a state-backed fund in Shanghai as part of Chinese government action to prop up such firms, said two other people familiar with the matter.
It has also been on a promotional drive by marketing its technology as a coronavirus countermeasure, with the U.S. re-branding to Wright Robotics an attempt to avoid negative baggage associated with the CloudMinds name, the first two sources said.
Wright Robotics markets its temperature scanners as designed in California. Advertised features include facial recognition, data management, remote monitoring and, with its most advanced models, the ability to scan large numbers of people at locations such as transport hubs and shopping centres.
It is not clear how much personal data the devices can collect. Neither Wright Robotics nor CloudMinds - which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands but has the bulk of its workforce and revenue in China - responded to requests for comment.
In support of the devices, a testimonial on Wright Robotics' home page from ""Sheila H."" reads, ""We decided to get this one because their company is in California. I saw other products have an issue with tech support or after-sales because the sellers are in China.""
The U.S. Commerce department, which blacklisted CloudMinds, declined to comment. SoftBank Group Corp declined to comment. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
AMBITION
Temperature scanners are a far cry from CloudMinds' ambition to offer an ""end-to-end cloud robot system"". Attempts to sell a modified version of SoftBank's Pepper were hampered by technical problems and the firm struggled to find a market outside of China, Reuters previously reported.
The firm was blocked from exporting U.S. technology to China last year before the blacklisting, and laid off most of its U.S. staff. During a failed attempt to list in the United States, it identified its local unit as CloudMinds Technology Inc.
Filings signed by its head of U.S. operations, Karl Zhao, showed CloudMinds Technology Inc became Harix Cloud Robotics Inc in July and then Wright Robotics Inc in August. Zhao is listed on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) as Wright Robotics' president.
The unit partnered with Sprint, owned by SoftBank until the April closure of the wireless carrier's merger with T-Mobile US Inc. SoftBank retains a stake in the merged entity.
Wright Robotics touts its scanners as ""T-Mobile 4G LTE ready"" and sells them through the T-Mobile IoT Marketplace.
T-Mobile US declined to comment.
Weeks before the blacklisting, but after Reuters reported its export restrictions, CloudMinds was granted a $1 million to $2 million loan under a pandemic aid program, showed Treasury data from August. 

A spokeswoman for the lender, Silicon Valley Bank, declined to comment beyond pointing to the bank's ""robust compliance programme"". A spokesman for the Small Business Administration, which approves the loans, declined to comment on individual cases.

""Through our in-house COVID-19 testing program, we detected an increase in the number of asymptomatic positive cases at our PNE5 facility in northern New Jersey and have proactively closed the site until December 26th out of an abundance of caution,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters.
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, said it isn't anticipating any impacts to operations or deliveries due to this shutdown. 
It did not specify the number of workers who contracted the disease at its PNE5 facility, which is a sorting center.
The company, however said, that its employees will be paid for the shifts that they miss because of the shutdown of the facility.
In October, Amazon said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized the COVID-19 response of the company.
Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said Amazon put its employees' health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic. 

The company had said it would expand virus testing to 50,000 U.S. employees per day by November through internally built capacity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan legislative deal unveiled by U.S. lawmakers on Sunday will grant U.S. airlines $15 billion in new payroll assistance that will allow them to return more than 32,000 furloughed workers to payrolls through March 31, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The support is part of $45 billion earmarked for the transportation sector in a $900 billion package for COVID-19 relief.
Amtrak, the nation's largest passenger railroad firm, is due to receive $1 billion while $14 billion will go to public transit systems and $10 billion to state highways, a senior Democratic aide said.
The legislation is also expected to include significant changes to how the Federal Aviation Administration certifies new airplanes following two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people, three congressional aides said, but specific details were not immediately available.
The sources declined to be identified as the package's details have yet to be formally unveiled.
The aviation assistance comes after five months of furious lobbying - first by aviation unions and later by airline executives - who argued the industry desperately needed new government help as travel demand remains devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. transit systems have also warned that without new government aid they could be forced to make draconian cuts in service and employment.
U.S. airlines furloughed more than 32,000 workers in October, after a six-month $25 billion bailout measure expired on Sept. 30. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) alone furloughed 19,000 employees, while United Airlines furloughed more than 13,000.
The U.S. Transportation Department said U.S. passenger airlines had 368,000 full-time workers as of Oct. 15.
Airline workers will be paid retroactive to Dec. 1 and airlines will have to resume flying some routes they stopped after the aid package expired, congressional aides briefed on the talks said. Airline workers cannot be furloughed through March 31 as a condition of the assistance.
Airlines should receive funds about 10 days after the bill is signed, sources said.
The new assistance program is expected to mirror the $25 billion program approved by Congress in March, which required larger airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time and offer the government warrants. It is also expected to include minimum flight requirements. 
U.S. carriers are losing $180 million in cash daily, with passenger volumes down nearly 70% from year earlier levels while cancellations are rising, according to industry lobby Airlines for America.
Congress in March approved a separate $25 billion in low-cost government loans for airlines and suspended some aviation excise taxes through Dec. 31.
The new $45 billion transportation package is also set to include $1.75 billion for airports and $200 million for airport concessionaires, $1 billion for airport contractors and $2 billion for the private motorcoach, school bus and ferry industries, officials said.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>","Australia regulator chief Sims says Google and Facebook draft laws fair, critical for media future","By Jane Wardell
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims said proposed laws that will make Australia the first country in the world to force Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to pay for news were fair and critical for the survival of the media industry.
Sims said he was surprised to hear criticisms from Google about the draft legislation unveiled by the Australian government earlier this month.
Google last week declared the code unworkable, citing in particular a requirement to provide publishers with two weeks' notice of certain changes to algorithms and internal practice. 
""We thought they were comfortable with that ... so we were very surprised that they're still complaining about that,"" Sims said in an interview on Monday for Reuters Next https://reutersevents.com/events/next.
Some media organisations, meanwhile, are unhappy that the code includes a ""two-way value exchange"" when deciding commercial agreements, which requires media companies to consider the value they receive from Facebook and Google users viewing their content. 
""To be honest, we never thought that value was very large, because if the platforms weren't there, our judgment is people would go straight to the news media businesses website anyway,"" Sims said, noting the first draft of the code employed a one-way value exchange. 
""But we do understand that there is some value in that, so it was only fair to recognise that, after all, we want a bargaining code that is seen to be fair and I think two-way value achieves that.""
The ACCC has increasingly focused on the rapidly growing market power of Google and Facebook. It has two inquiries open into advertising technology and mobile app stores, with reports due in January and March, respectively. 
Sims, who expressed concern about excessive pricing and self-preferencing by the app stores, said the reports would put a spotlight on the state-of-play and added the regulator would continue to focus on data concerns in 2021. 
""I'm hopeful that not just Australia, but companies overseas will benefit from what we find,"" Sims said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, with risk appetite sapped by a rapidly-spreading new strain of COVID-19 in the U.K., despite the progress made on the latest U.S. stimulus measures.
Described by U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock as “out of control,” the discovery of the new strain saw London enter an emergency Tier 4 lockdown. The lockdown sees 16 million Britons in London and southeastern England stay at home, just days before the Christmas holidays.
European neighbors, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium have closed their borders to travelers, and in some cases freight from the U.K. Other countries, such as Canada, Argentina and Chile have also banned flights from the U.K., with other countries considering similar bans.
Japan’sNikkei 225 fell 0.56% by 10:12 PM ET (3:12 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.39%. The country reported 926 daily cases on Monday, after seeing cases exceed the 1,000 mark over the weekend.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.21%. Sydney’s 5 million residents are also battling a COVID-19 outbreak in the city that originated in the northern beaches area. Lockdowns currently in place in the area are set to be reviewed on Wednesday, but other states and territories quickly closed their borders, leading to flight cancellations and disruptions in Christmas plans.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.08%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.56% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.19%. The People’s Bank of China left its benchmark lending rate for corporate and household loans steady for an eighth consecutive month at its December fixing on Monday, as per market expectations. The one-year loan prime rate was unchanged at 3.85%, while the five-year loan prime rate remained at 4.65%.
U.S.-China tensions also rose as Beijing threatened to impose countermeasures after the U.S. Commerce Department blacklisted more than 60 Chinese companies, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., “to protect U.S. national security” on Friday.
Meanwhile, news of the U.K.’s lockdown overshadowed the progress made towards passing the latest stimulus measures in the U.S. Although the text of the $900 billion bill is still being written, the House of Representatives is due to vote on it later in the day, followed by the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that “at long last we have a bipartisan breakthrough” that was needed to get the bill passed in the House and Senate.
On the vaccines front, the Food and Drug Administration also granted emergency use approval for  Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine mRNA-1273 over the weekend. Inoculations are due to begin on Monday.
Despite warnings not to view vaccines as a panacea to COVID-19, some investors were encouraged by the approval of mRNA-1273, following the approval for  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE's (F:22UAy) vaccine BNT162b2.
“For many, the end of 2020 cannot come soon enough … the pathogen has wrought mayhem across financial markets and so we expect the New Year wish of many market participants to be that the arrival and initial distribution of coronavirus vaccines now signals light at the end of a very tiring and debilitating tunnel,” First Abu Dhabi Bank Pjsc chief economist Simon Ballard told Bloomberg."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to set tough financial targets for state-run firms to try to improve their valuations ahead of a push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to privatize some companies, according to a draft government document and sources.
The government, which is trying to rein in its fiscal deficit, wants state-run firms to focus on improving market capitalisation and dividend payouts from the 2021/22 fiscal year, starting April, as well as ramping up the sale of non-core assets, the sources said.
State-run companies have traditionally largely targeted raising output and increasing revenues, rather than improving efficiency and valuations, contributing to years of share price underperformance versus the broader market.
""The companies need to raise their valuation and profitability in a changing business environment. Then only we will be able to get a better price (from stake sales). Shareholders and investors should be rewarded,"" said a government source with knowledge of the plan.
After regaining power in 2019, Modi's government prepared a plan https://reut.rs/3nGyaZh to raise as much as 3.25 trillion rupees ($44 billion) over 5 years by selling down its stakes in companies including Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Indian Oil Corp, NMDC Ltd, Coal India, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and BEML Ltd.
It announced moves to privatize companies in non-strategic parts of the economy and reduce the number of firms in key sectors. The government has already initiated steps to privatize Bharat Petroleum, Container Corp and Shipping Corp.
However, weak investor sentiment and limited demand have led to delays. So far this fiscal year to end-March 2021, the government has raised only a tenth of its targeted 1.20 trillion rupees stake sales.

(Graphic: Share price of India's leading state-run firms has declined over years, https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-COMPANIES/GOVT/yxmvjqjynpr/MARKETCAP.JPG)
The planned changes in annual targets could be announced in next year's federal budget, due in February, a second government source said.
""The state run companies will need to deploy funds raised through asset monetization for issues like debt repayment. They should have return on capital employed and return on equity quite high on the margin,"" the source said.
For the first time, India will include annual targets for state-run companies on metrics such as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), according to the sources and a document on the draft guidelines, which is currently before a government committee.
Other targets will include increasing market capitalisation or share price, as well as measures such as return on net worth and capital employed, they said.
For unlisted companies an improvement in earnings per share will be a key parameter instead of market capitalisation, the document showed.
Managers at state-run companies will have their bonuses and incentives linked to meeting the annual targets.
India's finance ministry and department of heavy industries did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comments.
The new annual target structure has yet to be approved by the committee, which comprises officials from various ministries and the cabinet secretary, the first source said.
Changes in the annual target policy had been suggested by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which spearheaded the federal government's stake sale drive, the source added.
For companies in which the government wants to cut its stake, DIPAM will set targets like listing, buyback, offer for sale, minimum public shareholding norms and strategic disinvestment to help the government get a better price for any selldown, the document showed.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) said on Monday it has agreed to sell a 26.25% stake in its Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) facilities to Global Infrastructure Partners Australia for $2.5 billion, helping the oil major meet its annual target for divestments.
Shell, advised by Rothschild & Co, put a minority stake in the asset up for sale earlier this year, after infrastructure investors expressed interest in the asset which has a guaranteed earnings stream for 15 years. 
The sale price was in line with analysts' expectations.
""This decision is consistent with Shell's strategy of selling non-core assets in order to further high-grade and simplify Shell's portfolio,"" the company said in a statement.
Shell is aiming to raise $4 billion a year from asset sales. The sale to Global Infrastructure Partners puts it on target for this year, following the divestment of its Martinez refinery and Appalachia shale gas assets.
The QCLNG plant is majority owned by Shell, with minority stakes owned by China National Offshore Oil Corp and Tokyo Gas Co. 
The stake Global Infrastructure Partners has bought gives it a piece of a U.S.-dollar denominated, inflation-linked usage fee paid by CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) and Tokyo Gas over about 15 years, regardless of the LNG plant's throughput.
Global Infrastructure Partners was not immediately available for comment on the deal.
Shell's remaining 73.75% stake in the common facilities aligns with its stake in the overall QCLNG venture, which produces liquefied natural gas at an 8.5 million tonnes a year plant for export mostly to China and Japan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers will back $1.9 billion to fund a program to remove telecom network equipment that the U.S. government says poses national security risks as part of a $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill, two sources briefed on the matter said on Sunday.
Lawmakers will also back $3.2 billion for an emergency broadband benefit for low-income Americans, senior congressional aides confirmed after Reuters first reported the planned broadband spending.
The COVID-19 relief bill invests $7 billion to increase access to broadband, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement, adding the low-income program will ""help millions of students, families and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic.""
The Federal Communications Commission said in June it had formally designated China’s Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) as threats, a declaration that bars U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies.
Earlier this month, the FCC finalized rules that require carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to ""rip and replace"" that equipment but is awaiting funding from Congress.
Huawei said earlier this month it was disappointed in the FCC’s decision ""to force removal of our products from telecommunications networks. This overreach puts U.S. citizens at risk in the largely underserved rural areas – during a pandemic - when reliable communication is essential.""
The bill ""establishes a temporary, emergency broadband benefit program at the FCC to help low-income Americans, including those economically challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, get connected or remain connected to broadband,"" according to a fact sheet seen by Reuters.
The source also said the program will supply a $50 monthly subsidy to qualifying households ""to help them afford broadband service and an internet-connected device.""
The bill also expands eligibility for the rip-and-replace reimbursement program to communications providers with 10 million subscribers or less but prioritizes reimbursement for providers with 2 million subscribers or less, the source said, citing a draft fact sheet.
The bill will include $285 million for connecting minority communities and will establish an Office of Minority Broadband Initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).
It will also offer funding to ""support minority-serving education institutions, including when they partner with minority-owned businesses, to expand broadband capacity and use at the school and in the surrounding community,"" the fact sheet seen by Reuters said.
It also includes about $250 million for additional FCC support for telehealth and $1 billion for a NTIA tribal broadband connectivity grant program.
There is a separate $300 million NTIA grant program to promote broadband expansion to underserved Americans, especially in rural areas, and $65 Million for better broadband maps.

That fully funds the FCC’s development of new more accurate broadband availability maps to help the agency better target government funding for broadband deployment.

(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) said on Sunday it has agreed to buy U.S. rocket engine manufacturer Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc for $4.4 billion, including debt and net cash.
The deal is Lockheed's biggest acquisition since Jim Taiclet took over as chief executive in June. He is seeking to beef up the company's propulsion capabilities amid competition from new entrants such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, for space contracts with the U.S. government.
""Acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne will preserve and strengthen an essential component of the domestic defense industrial base and reduce costs for our customers and the American taxpayer,"" Taiclet said in a statement.
""As part of Lockheed Martin, we will bring our advanced technologies together with their substantial expertise and resources to accelerate our shared purpose: enabling the defense of our nation and space exploration,"" Aerojet's CEO Eileen Drake said in a statement. 
Lockheed said it will pay $56 per share for Aerojet Rocketdyne, a 33 percent premium to Friday's closing price. The purchase price will be reduced to $51 per share after the payment of a pre-closing special dividend, Lockheed added.
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company already uses Aerojet Rocketdyne's propulsion systems in its aeronautics, missiles and fire control offerings. 
Lockheed said the transaction, which is set to be scrutinized by regulators given the company's leading position in the defense sector, is expected to close in the second half of 2021.

Taiclet took the top job at Lockheed in June and closed https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2020-11-25-Lockheed-Martin-Completes-Acquisition-of-i3-Hypersonics-Portfolio on a deal to buy Integration Innovation Inc., a Huntsville, Alabama-based hypersonic weapon software and systems maker, by November.

Middle East Airlines (MEA) Chairman Mohamad El-Hout did not say when this rule would be introduced, but the warning will raise concerns for holders of dollars who have been virtually locked out of dollar accounts since late 2019.
The authorities have limited dollar withdrawals to about $500 a month, with a few exceptions, and imposed an exchange rate of about 3,900 Lebanese pounds, effectively slashing the value of those deposits as the unofficial street rate is now over 8,000. Before the crisis, 1,500 was the freely-used rate.
Buying airline tickets was one way those dollars held in local banks could be used, in a nation with a large diaspora and where hard currency has grown scarce.
Dollars transferred to Lebanon in more recent months, known as ""fresh dollars"", are held in new accounts and not subject to withdrawal or other restrictions.
""If the company wants to ensure its stability, we will reach a time when we will need to have sales in 'fresh dollars',"" Hout told Reuters, adding that MEA would need to do this because the carrier's expenses for fuel and other items were in dollars.
He said the alternative was to stop operating the carrier, which is majority owned by the central bank.
He also told a Lebanese television channel that prices lowered, by about 40%, once payment was in ""fresh dollars"".
Many people in Lebanon, which for decades prided itself on its open economy and as a regional banking centre, now rely on cash support from their families abroad to help them get by amid bank restrictions and soaring prices.

JANUARY JITTERS
The virus even wasn't the first thing that spooked the markets this year. The tone was set when an escalation of an oil market turf war between Saudi Arabia and Russia sent oil prices crashing over 5% on Jan 8. 
Just days later though China's stock markets began to fall as a cluster of more than 50 pneumonia cases in Wuhan city sparked a warning from the WHO there could be a new SARS-like virus.
Oil continued to fall as traders were also now worrying about a drop in Chinese demand, but other major markets were not seriously affected until mid-February when it became clear the virus was rapidly spreading out of Asia. 
Cue carnage. From February 20 to March 24 as Europe's big economies locked down, MSCI's 49-country world share index lost more than a third of its value haemorrhaging a staggering $18 trillion.

For reference, the record quarterly drop for Wall Street was 40% in 1932 in the midst of the Great Depression. The fact that the S&P and Dow were at record highs back in mid February made the crash this time seem more brutal.

MARCH MADNESS
Governments were already trying to shore up their economies, but just like the financial crisis a decade previously it took powerful central bank medicine to steady the markets. 
The Federal Reserve's move to cut U.S. interest rates to zero in mid-March initially had zero impact, but once it opened new swap lines to keep money markets flush with dollars and the ECB and other big central banks arrived with their own measures, the rout eased. 
The amount of money and effort thrown at the problem has been unprecedented. 
BofA calculates that central banks have spent $1.3 billion an hour buying up assets since March and made 190 interest rate cuts this year, which works out as four every five trading days.
As well as fuelling the monster market rebound, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates the central bank moves have left nearly $35 trillion, or 83%, of all richer, developed nations' government debt with a 'negative yield' once inflation is factored in.
It means investors are effectively paying for the privilege of lending to those countries. Germany's finance ministry for example says it has earned more than 7 billion euros ($8.51 billion) from issuing new bonds this year.

RECORD PLUNGE
Locking down much of the world economy has not been easy.
By April the International Monetary Fund was forecasting global growth would to fall to -3 percent, a 6.3 percentage point downgrade from its January estimate. Its latest forecast is for -4.4% for the year. ""This makes the Great Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis,"" it has said.
Unemployment and global debt levels have also surged and the World Bank warns global extreme poverty is set to rise for the first time in over 20 years. 
It could push an additional 88 million to 115 million people below the breadline this year and as many as 150 million by the end of next year.

APRIL FALLS
Stock markets were beginning to recover in April but the shocks did not stop. Oil went negative for the first time ever, dropping as low as minus $40 a barrel as oil producers began to fear storage capacity could run out.
It did not last long though. By the end of April it was back up to almost $20 a barrel and is now back above $50 - a 220% gain for anyone brave enough to dive in - although it is still down nearly 25% for the year as a whole.

WINNERS AND LOSERS
A breakdown of the best- and worst-performing stocks also tells the story of the pandemic, which has now claimed over 1.6 million lives. 
Malaysian rubber glove maker Supermax and Korean pharmaceutical firm Shin Poong have rocketed roughly 1,000% and 2,000% respectively.
The boom in working from home and video chat has lifted Zoom 490%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), one of the drug firms delivering a vaccine, is up over 635%, sit-on-your-sofa stocks like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have jumped 64% and 75% respectively while the other big trend of the year - electric cars - has seen Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surge 683% and its rival Nio (NYSE:NIO) charge up nearly 1,000%.

At the other end, cruise ship company Carnival (NYSE:CUK) has sunk 57%, scores of airlines, travel firms and retailers have been battered, while aero engine maker Rolls Royce (LON:RR) has been pummelled nearly 50% for the year.

EMERGING HOPE
A seesawing of major currencies has also happened. The safe-haven dollar surged up until the mid-March turnaround but is now down 6.66% for the year and 5% since late September, whereas the euro and yen are up roughly 10% and 5%.
Sweden's crown is the top 2020 performer with a 13% jump. A 6.6% surge for China's yuan will be one of its best year's too though there is still plenty of pain in emerging markets.
Brazil's real is down 20%. Russia's rouble - one of last year's top performers - is down 15% despite a bounce and near bullet-proof balance sheet. Turkey's lira has climbed off record lows but is still down 22%, while Mexico's peso and South Africa's rand are both down around 4.4% although they were down 14% and 20% respectively at the end of September.

NOVEMBER REIGNS 
November was also key. First came the U.S. election defeat for Donald Trump which raised hopes some of the global trade tensions would ease. Then days later, the long-awaited news that one of main vaccine hopes had proved over 90% effective in protecting people from COVID-19.
That double boost saw a record 12.6% monthly leap in the MSCI world stocks index adding approximately $6.7 trillion - or $155 million a minute - to the value of world equities.
It is still going. Stocks are now up over 13% for 2020, U.S. and German government bonds and corporate debt have all returned between 10% and 13.5%, gold is up 25%, while the super-sized FAANG tech stocks group are up 100%.
""The 2020 stock rally from lows is now bigger than 1929, 1938, 1974; high prices clashing with positioning (is) verging on greedy bullish,"" BofA analysts wrote in note pointedly titled 'Frankenbull'.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","China could restrict bank tie-ups with fintech platforms, official suggests","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's former finance minister Lou Jiwei suggested that China could restrict the number of banks a single fintech platform can partner with, to prevent any platform from gaining too much market share, state media reported on Sunday.
China’s regulators last month warned the country’s tech giants that they face closer scrutiny. A planned $37 billion stock listing of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Ant Group, scheduled to be the world's largest, was then abruptly suspended.
Speaking at a wealth management forum on Saturday, Lou, who remains influential as the external affairs director at a top advisory body to the Chinese government, warned that a fintech platform with an oversized market share can lead to bad debts, the Securities Times said.
""We can limit the number of banks that any single platform can work with, so as to let more platforms do similar businesses under the same conditions,"" he said, adding that fintech platforms should not be allowed to grow to the point of ""winner takes all"" and ""too big to fail"".
China has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which include the likes of Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) that rank among the world's largest and most valuable. Many of these companies have gathered large amounts of user data in the course of providing their services. 
A securities watchdog official said Beijing should consider imposing a digital tax on technology companies that hold copious amounts of user data, state media said last week.

Regulators last week fined tech firms such as Alibaba for not reporting past deals properly for antitrust reviews. This is the first time any internet company has been fined for violating a 2008 antimonopoly law.

(Reuters) - Business groups expressed concerns over Britain's new COVID-19 restrictions, with the Confederation of British Industry calling them a ""real kick in the teeth"" for many businesses.
Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, told Reuters in an emailed statement that the move would hit businesses which were already struggling badly, and the government needed to take a ""fresh look"" at how to support UK businesses through to the spring.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that London and southeast England will be placed in a new Tier 4 level of lockdown. Non-essential retail will close, as will indoor leisure and entertainment.
The new restrictions add to uncertainties faced by British businesses amid the possibility of a no-deal Brexit with less than two weeks left before Britain leaves the European Union's orbit.
Businesses fear a failure to agree a deal on goods trade would send shockwaves through financial markets, hurt European economies, snarl borders and disrupt supply chains. 
""This third shutdown comes at the worst possible time, as businesses face close of year challenges as well as uncertainty and upheaval from the Brexit transition period which ends in just 12 days' time - with still no deal agreed"", said Mike Hawes, chief executive of Britain's car industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. 
The British Retail Consortium added that the consequences of the new restrictions will be severe and that the government will need to offer additional financial support to businesses. 

The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry called for the suspension of taxes and rates for any companies forced to close their doors.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has temporarily shut all of its 53 stores in California because of a coronavirus outbreak and 16 stores in the United Kingdom following restrictions introduced by the government in London, a spokesman said on Saturday.
The company said on Friday it was temporarily shutting some stores in California following a surge in COVID-19 cases, sending the iPhone maker's shares down in trading after the bell. That announcement covered at least 12 stores.
""Due to current COVID-19 conditions in some of the communities we serve, we are temporarily closing stores in these areas. We take this step with an abundance of caution as we closely monitor the situation and we look forward to having our teams and customers back as soon as possible,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement.
Customers would still be able to pick up existing orders for the next few days, the spokesman said. The statement did not mention when Apple expects the stores to reopen.
Coronavirus cases are increasing in the United States and the United Kingdom, with the U.S. having had over 17.4 million infections and about 314,000 deaths.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday imposed an effective lockdown on over 16 million people in England and reversed plans to ease curbs over Christmas. The UK's other nations, whose response to the pandemic differs from that of England at times, also took action.

Johnson said London and southeast England would now be placed in a new Tier 4 level of lockdown and people in those areas will be required to stay at home except for essential reasons such as work. Non-essential retail will close, as will indoor leisure and entertainment.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>","U.S. shoppers grab last-minute holiday gifts, pick up online orders in-store","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Many U.S. holiday shoppers, wary of spending time in stores during the latest surge of COVID-19 cases and nervous about packages not arriving before Christmas, were on a mission on Saturday: snatch up last-minute gifts fast or pick up online purchases in-store.
The ""Super Saturday"" before Christmas is traditionally the busiest day of the year for holiday purchases, and this year online retail has been extra busy. But news reports about high-priority vaccine shipments have many Americans fretting that gift deliveries could be delayed this week.
""If you haven't ventured out and you haven't gotten your gifts, you almost have to,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry adviser at NPD Group. ""Online orders aren't going to get delivered on time and nobody wants to risk showing up empty handed.""
U.S. retailers are expected to ring in record sales, with over 150 million American shoppers slated to buy holiday gifts Saturday online or in-store, up by more than 2 million from last year, the National Retail Federation said on Thursday.
Many last-minute holiday shoppers on Saturday were picking up orders in-store that they had placed online, four retail experts making checks in a total of six states said.
As states enforce stricter mandates and consumers, by and large, continue to avoid strolling through the local mall, those who had not already ordered for pickup were mercenary in their approach and would ""pop in and out, grabbing the one or two gifts they already knew they wanted,"" Bill Park, a partner at Deloitte & Touche LP, said of shoppers at the King of Prussia mall outside Philadelphia.
Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners, said the same was true of customers at malls in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. ""This is mission shopping, that's what this is."" 
Johnson expects people to spend $36.1 billion this Super Saturday, up from $34.4 billion last year. That includes in-store and online purchases but excludes sales at gas stations, restaurants and automobile dealers.
RECORD SALES
Curbside business contributed greatly to the traffic at big retail chains including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) on Saturday, according to retail analysts in Miami, New York City and Chicago.
Many retailers have clocked record digital sales during the pandemic, overwhelming traditional shipping companies including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS and the USPS. Vaccine shipments are a priority now, and this week, delivery drivers in the Northeast have had to contend with a major snowstorm.
In turn, department stores like Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and J.C. Penney are dangling perks such as free gift wrapping and extra discounts for those who ""click and collect"" online orders.
""It wasn't going to arrive in time,"" Elyse R., 31, said standing at the curbside counter at Nordstrom's flagship store in Manhattan. She was referring to the facial massage tool she ordered online for her sister for curbside pickup. ""I popped into another store and now I'm going to go home.""
While Elyse waited for her order, she played a contact-free trivia game at a booth next to the counter that could win her a $25 gift card. Such tactics have helped lure people in to shop on the spot or return later, a store associate said.

""The goal, even with pickup, is to get you in the store,"" NPD's Cohen said.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers make push for airplane certification reforms,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are making a final push in 2020 to win approval of landmark reforms to how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new airplanes in the wake of two fatal Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes, five people briefed on the matter said Saturday.
On Nov. 18, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed a bill to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes, grant new protections for whistleblowers and bolster misconduct investigations and discipline management at the FAA, among other reforms. The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill the same week.
Lawmakers hope to attach significant reforms to a massive bill expected to be voted on in coming days that would provide about $900 billion in COVID-19 relief and fund the government's operations. One congressional aide said ""House and Senate committee negotiators on that issue have gotten to a good place on it.""
On Friday, Senate Commerce Republicans released a 102-page report that found Boeing officials ""inappropriately coached"" test pilots during recertification efforts after the 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people.
The committee said it appeared FAA and Boeing officials ""were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.""
Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker said the report found ""significant examples of lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA. It is clear that the agency requires consistent oversight to ensure their work to protect the flying public is executed fully and correctly.""
The FAA said Friday it was ""carefully reviewing the document, which the committee acknowledges contains a number of unsubstantiated allegations"" and added it was confident safety issues in the two fatal Boeing crashes ""have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners.""
The COVID-19 bill is expected to provide $45 billion in transportation assistance.
Three congressional aides said Saturday funding is likely to include $15 billion for a four-month extension of passenger airlines payroll assistance, $14 billion for public transit agencies, $10-$12 billion for state transportation departments, $1 billion for passenger railroad Amtrak, $2 billion for private motorcoach companies and other transportation providers and $1 billion for airport contractors.
It is possible the final measure could include $2 billion for airports, aides said.
The numbers have changed several times in negotiations and are not final.

One proposal that appears to have been dropped is an effort to help aerospace companies with government assistance to avoid new layoffs.

""DJI is disappointed in the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision"", a representative of the company said in an emailed statement. ""Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally.""
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is ratcheting up tensions with China in his final weeks in office.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have risen amid the handling of the coronavirus, back and forth sanctions, a trade war over tariffs and China's imposition of its national security law in Hong Kong.
Generally, entity-listed companies are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers. An entity list designation does not bar a company from selling products in the United States.
The U.S. government has previously raised concerns about DJI and other Chinese makers of drones.
In January, the U.S. Interior Department said it was grounding its fleet of about 800 Chinese-made drones and earlier halted additional purchases of such drones.
In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones.

Separately, U.S. lawmakers this month opted not to ban the purchase of Chinese drone technology by U.S. agencies as part of an annual defense bill.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Saturday it had approved the use of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine by pilots and air traffic controllers.
The announcement follows the FAA's Dec. 12 approval for pilots and controllers to use the vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech
The U.S. aviation regulator said pilots and controllers must not fly or conduct safety-related duties for 48 hours after receiving doses. The FAA said it ""will monitor the patient response to each vaccine dose and may adjust this policy as necessary to ensure aviation safety.""
On Thursday, groups representing aviation unions and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and other airlines, wrote all U.S. governors asking them to ""prioritize aviation frontline workers for allocation of the vaccine in your upcoming implementation plan.""
The groups noted that ""aviation workers are frontline workers who either encounter the traveling public frequently or are required to perform our work in close proximity to our colleagues and perform our jobs onsite.""
Earlier this month, the FAA sent guidance to airports to prepare for vaccine distribution, including other facilities that may serve as alternate or diversion airports.

The FAA said that some aircraft used for vaccine shipments may be larger than the aircraft used for passenger-carrying flights that typically serve that airport and operators may opt to have extra aircraft rescue and firefighting services.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc is in talks to merge U.S. benefits services provider Alight Solutions LLC with a blank-check acquisition firm backed by veteran investor Bill Foley, according to people familiar with the matter.
The merger with Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp would result in Alight becoming a publicly-listed company at a valuation of more than $8 billion, including debt, the sources said.
The deal talks come more than a year after Blackstone canceled an initial public offering (IPO) of Alight as it was about to raise up to $800 million, amid concerns that it would not fetch the terms it was seeking. A deal with Foley's blank-check acquisition firm would underscore the growing popularity of these vehicles as an alternative route to the stock market.
The sources cautioned that the negotiations may not lead to a deal and requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Blackstone and Alight declined to comment, while a Foley spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Foley Trasimene is a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which raised $900 million in an IPO in May to merge with a private company, without telling investors in advance what that company would be.
Buyout firms have traditionally cashed out on their investments by selling companies outright or taking them public. The potential deal for Alight highlights how Blackstone sees SPACs as a viable alternative.
Earlier this month, Blackstone and another private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners, agreed to merge payments platform Paysafe Group Holdings Ltd with another Foley-backed SPAC, Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp II, in a deal worth $9 billion, including debt.
Based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, Alight offers cloud-based benefits administration and human resources services to 30 million people in 188 countries, according to its website.

It was acquired by Blackstone in 2017 from insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc, in a deal that valued it at up to $4.8 billion.

1504,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 07:38AM ET</span>","Where There's a Kardashian, There's Gonna Be Luxury","By Christiana Sciaudone and Liz Moyer
Investing.com -- As long as there are Kardashians and Kardashian wannabes, there will be room for luxury. 
And when we say luxury, we mean none less than retail, wine and hotelier giant LVMH, or LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (PA:LVMH). 
LVMH is poised to close its admittedly messy deal with Tiffany, which will only elevate it to an ever greater status as the world’s quintessential company catering to the wealthiest among us, as well as those who aspired to be so.
But LVMH was not immune to the retail sector's struggle this year amid pandemic-related shutdowns that changed consumer behavior.
Investing.com's Christiana Sciaudone argues the favorable case to invest in LVMH, while Liz Moyer explains there is reason to be cautious.
The Bull Case
Tiffany's blue box brand will add more than $4.3 billion a year to LVMH’s coffers -- in a non-Covid year, that is -- but more importantly, it will expand the brand’s presence in jewelry. 
The company’s jewelry and watch segment is its smallest, bringing in about $5.3 billion in 2019. Tiffany will bump the segment from last place to third behind fashion and leather goods and selective retailing, ahead of wine and spirits and perfumes and cosmetics. More than that, it will bring a household name to the company, whose brightest brands are Bulgari, Hublot and Tag Heuer. 
Tiffany isn’t the only acquisition in line for LVMH. It’s buying a minority stake in WhistlePig, a rye whiskey maker, a drink that is drunk mainly in the U.S. -- for now. Moët Hennessy will bring the drink to customers around the world. WhistlePig The Boss Hog Vth Edition: “The Spirit of Mauve” retails for about $739.99. 
If anyone is going to succeed in bringing an American whiskey to connoisseurs around the world, it’s LVMH. The behemoth behind Veuve Clicquot and Dom Perignon is trading at a record high, and boasts a market cap of 256 billion euros, the largest company in France and the second largest in Europe after Nestle. That valuation compares to Cartier-owner Richemont’s 41.5 billion euro market cap. 
And not only do LVMH stores have global reach, it also owns the Belmond hotel brand located from Brazil to Cambodia and media including Le Parisien to increase its reach.
Like many retailers, LVMH got hit hard by the pandemic. After seeing record revenue of 15.3 billion euros in the fourth quarter of 2019, it reported sales of 7.8 billion euros in the second quarter of 2020. But, that climbed back up to 11.9 billion euros for the third quarter as luxe started to rebound. 
The quarter saw a “strong rebound” in activity with double-digit organic revenue growth for the fashion and leather goods segment, with Louis Vuitton showing “exceptional momentum and creativity, in all areas, from products to shows and events.”
China results were also improving for the watches and jewelry business, and champagne seems to be back in fashion for the third quarter.
But why even bother buying high-end goods when one can hardly leave the house? People “may buy something because it is trendy or it has a really cool design or because he or she is feeling blue and needs a pick-me-up. It is someone who cares less about durability and more about emotional satisfaction and appeal,” according to Lee Eisenberg’s 2009 book, Shoptimism: Why the American Consumer Will Keep on Buying No Matter What.
And, tell us, who doesn’t need a pick-me-up in 2020?
The Bear Case
The pandemic has dramatically changed consumer behavior. Since the first stay at home orders this spring, people have hunkered down at home in comfortable clothing, unconcerned with personal grooming to any great extent because they were working from home.
Shopping moved from the mall -- which was shut or forced to curtail occupancy -- to online sites. And the browsing and scrolling favored big retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and less so luxury goods sellers and upscale department stores like Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Neiman Marcus.
So, it’s no wonder revenue is down, and so is profit. Based on the outlook, profit could fall this year an estimated 41%, while revenue could be down 16% when all is said and done.
That will rebound when the pandemic goes away and people have the ability to freely shop in malls and department stores again, sure. But how long that takes is anyone’s guess.
LVMH owns 75 main brands such as Louis Vuitton and Fendi over five different businesses, including fashion and leather (which has been about half of sales this year through September), selective retail stores (about one-quarter), fragrance and cosmetics (about 10%), watches and jewelry (less than 10%) and wines and spirits (about 10%).
This year it made splashy deals -- the controversial one for  Tiffany & Co  (NYSE:TIF). and one announced this week for a specialty whiskey maker -- but those beef up its two smallest contributors, sales-wise.
Meanwhile, its biggest businesses are contributing the most pain. Fashion and leather organic revenue is down 11% after gaining 17% last year, according to Motley Fool. Retailing is down 31%, and fragrance and cosmetics fell 25%. 
Motley Fool notes the clothing lines and spirits businesses staged a comeback in the third quarter -- perhaps there was plenty of pent up demand for chic clothes and expensive alcohol when stores were finally allowed to reopen to the shopping public.
With the holiday season upon us, LVMH has a few things going for it. It’s high-end clientele is perhaps less affected in the pocketbook than more ordinary consumers. But aspirational brands tend to attract buyers who may be reaching a little financially to have a luxury handbag, and that aspirational buying may be tough during these volatile economic times. 
Subdued holiday celebrations also don’t bode great for sales of champagne and top shelf liquor. LVMH investors may have to wait a while to pop the cork.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Apple puts supplier Wistron on notice after Indian factory violence,"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Chandini Monnappa
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) -Apple Inc has placed supplier Wistron Corp on probation, saying on Saturday it would not award the Taiwanese contract manufacturer new business until it addressed the way workers were treated at its southern India plant.
Early findings of an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) audit in the wake of violence at the Wistron plant in India's Karnataka state showed violations of its 'Supplier Code of Conduct', the Cupertino, California-based tech giant said in a statement.
Contract workers angry over unpaid wages destroyed property, gear and iPhones on Dec. 12, causing millions of dollars in losses to Wistron and forcing it to shut the plant.
Apple said Wistron had failed to implement proper working hour management processes, which ""led to payment delays for some workers in October and November"".
Wistron on Saturday admitted some workers at the plant in Karnataka's Narasapura had not been paid properly or on time, and it was removing a top executive overseeing its India business.
Apple said it will continue to monitor Wistron's progress on corrective action.
""Our main objective is to make sure all the workers are treated with dignity and respect, and fully compensated promptly,"" Apple said, adding that it continued to investigate issues at the plant, which is located some 50 km outside of the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and assembles one iPhone model.
""This is a new facility and we recognise that we made mistakes as we expanded,"" Wistron said in a statement. ""Some of the processes we put in place to manage labor agencies and payments need to be strengthened and upgraded.""
Wistron said it is re-structuring its teams and setting up 24-hour hotlines for employees to make anonymous complaints.
""Apple has sent a strong message to its suppliers, telling them unequivocally that they need to adhere to its standards,"" Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based tech researcher Counterpoint said.
""In the long-run it should make suppliers more cautious and likely create fewer such public-relations headaches for Apple.""
MANUFACTURING SETBACK
The Apple probation will delay Wistron's smartphone production and hurt its manufacturing push in India where it had committed to invest some 13 billion rupees ($177 million) over the next five years as part of New Delhi's production-linked incentive plan for smartphone manufacturing.
Wistron had plans to make another iPhone model at the Narasapura plant and was planning to hire up to 20,000 workers in a year's time, a source told Reuters previously.
But it could not cope with the rapid scaling up of manpower and breached several laws, Karnataka state officials found after an inspection of the plant following the violence.
The number of workers rose to 10,500 from the permitted 5,000 in a short span of time, the Karnataka factories department said in a report, which was reviewed by Reuters.
""The HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws,"" the report of the inspection, which was conducted on Dec. 13, concluded.
Wistron did respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment on the violations listed.
Other violations highlighted in the report included underpayment of wages to contract workers and housekeeping staff, and making female staff work overtime without legal authorisation.
The findings of this inspection, and another preliminary government audit, confirm the grievances over unpaid wages and poor attendance recording systems recounted in interviews to Reuters by at least half a dozen Wistron workers.
The Wistron probation will likely also dent Apple's plans to scale up in India, a market it has bet on to expand its manufacturing base beyond China.
Apple began the assembly of its first iPhone model in India via Wistron in 2017. It has now ramped up assembly operations, with Foxconn in southern India and another top supplier Pegatron is set to begin local operations.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Wistron's Indian factory in Karnataka state could not cope up with the rapid scaling up of manpower and breached several laws, a government inspection has revealed following violence at the site last weekend. 
Several thousand contract workers at Wistron angered over alleged non-payment of wages destroyed property, factory gear and iPhones at the plant early on Dec. 12, causing millions of dollars in losses to the Taiwanese contract manufacturer and forcing it to shut the plant.
The manpower at this plant, which assembles one iPhone model and became operational earlier this year, rose to 10,500 workers from the permitted 5,000 in a short span of time, according to a Karnataka factories department report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
""Though 10,500 workers are employed in the factory the HR department has not been adequately set up with personnel of sound knowledge of labour laws,"" said the report of the inspection conducted on Dec. 13.
The report said there is a wide gap between practices followed at the factory and legal requirements.
Wistron did not respond to a request for comment.
Apple, which is conducting it's own audit at the factory, also did not comment.
Wistron introduced 12-hour shifts from the earlier eight-hour shifts at the plant in October but failed to properly address ""the confusion in the minds of the workers"" about their new wages inclusive of overtime, the report noted.
The company also did not inform the factories department of the new work shifts, it said.
Wistron, which also changed its attendance system in October, did not fix for two months a glitch which caused employees' presence to be incorrectly registered, the probe found.
Some other violations highlighted in the report included underpayment of wages to contract workers and housekeeping staff, and making women staff work overtime without legal authorisation.
An earlier government audit of the factory, just hours after the rampage, had also found ""several labour law violations"", Reuters previously reported.
Karnataka state, home to India's showpiece software services sector and global firms such as Bosh and Volvo, has previously tried to soothe investors by condemning the violence and assuring Wistron of its support.
""The company has started an internal audit, which should help it improve systems,"" said Gaurav Gupta, the top government official at Karnataka's Industries Department. 

""We expect it will bring up solutions to improve relationships with workers and pave the way for starting operations soon.""

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors bet old-school retailers will rebound in 2021,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As holiday shopping season wraps up, U.S. equity investors are gauging whether long-languishing shares of brick-and-mortar retailers can sustain their recent rebound in anticipation of a full economic reopening in 2021. 
The SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF, which tracks a broad group of retailers such as department and specialty stores, is up nearly 40% this year. Its gain reflects a rally that has lifted shares of companies in sectors particularly sensitive to the economic cycle, such as industrials and energy, in the wake of recent breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccines. 
Those numbers pale in comparison with the massive gains online companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc and Wayfair (NYSE:W) Inc have notched this year, after the pandemic accelerated a shift toward internet shopping.
Some investors, however, believe that more traditional retailers may be able to narrow that gap in the coming year. Their view dovetails with a broader bet that vaccines against the coronavirus will spur widespread economic reopenings across the United States, helping the industries that have suffered most from the effects of COVID-19.
""There's anticipation of people shopping,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. ""Wall Street is looking forward to a time when we are not locked down.""
Investors next week will have an eye on the University of Michigan's widely followed consumer sentiment index, which remains below pre-pandemic levels but has recently ticked higher.
One source of consumer spending could come from additional stimulus checks to individuals included in a $900 billion coronavirus aid package that Congress has moved closer to approving, said Alex Ely, chief investment officer of Macquarie Investment Management's small and mid-cap growth equity team.
At the same time, brick-and-mortar stores that have withstood the economic onslaught from the pandemic may have more solid footing next year as competitors have faltered, said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management. 
J.C. Penney, J. Crew, Pier 1 Imports and Neiman Marcus are among the retailers that declared bankruptcy this year.
""On the back side of this... there could come a period of prosperity,"" Marshall said.
Retail shares likely will not advance in unison, as the pandemic has only magnified long-standing trends that will separate winners from losers, investors said.
Jason Hans, portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management, expects department stores to resume their underperformance. At the same time, certain specialty retailers could catch up once in-store shopping recovers, he said. He has added to his position in children's clothing company Carter's (NYSE:CRI) Inc.
Traditional retailers' online presence may also play an important role in determining their fate. 
Hodges Capital's Marshall, for instance, owns shares of  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO), which has substantially increased its online sales. 
Bokeh Capital's Forrest said she has gravitated to retailers such as Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN), which she classifies as ""good real-world merchandisers"" - those that successfully lure customers into impulse buys and have potential to translate that strength into online sales.
The retail recovery, however, may face some hitches. U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in November, likely weighed down by raging new COVID-19 infections and decreasing household income. Further delays in additional fiscal stimulus could place more near-term strain on economic indicators.
But some investors are willing to look past that momentary weakness.
""The fundamentals are going to be much better in the second half of 2021 and 2022,"" Macquarie's Ely said. ""But you want to buy six to nine months ahead of when things are great. Now is the time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) officials ""inappropriately coached"" test pilots during recertification efforts after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people, according to a lengthy congressional report released on Friday.
The report from the Senate Commerce Committee Republican staff raised questions about testing this year of a key safety system known as MCAS tied to both fatal crashes was contrary to proper protocol.
The committee concluded Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing officials ""had established a pre-determined outcome to reaffirm a long-held human factor assumption related to pilot reaction time ... It appears, in this instance, FAA and Boeing were attempting to cover up important information that may have contributed to the 737 MAX tragedies.""
The report citing a whistleblower who alleged Boeing officials encouraged test pilots to ""remember, get right on that pickle switch"" prior to the exercise that resulted in pilot reaction in approximately four seconds, while another pilot in a separate test reacted in approximately 16 seconds.
The account was corroborated during an FAA staff interview, the committee added.
Numerous reports have found Boeing failed to adequately consider how pilots respond to cockpit emergencies in its development of the 737 MAX.
Boeing said Friday it takes ""seriously the committee’s findings and will continue to review the report in full.""
The FAA said Friday it was ""carefully reviewing the document, which the committee acknowledges contains a number of unsubstantiated allegations.""
The agency added it is ""confident that the safety issues that played a role in the tragic (737 MAX) accidents involving Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have been addressed through the design changes required and independently approved by the FAA and its partners.""
Senate Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker said the report ""details a number of significant examples of lapses in aviation safety oversight and failed leadership in the FAA."" 
The committee also said ""multiple independent whistleblowers contacted the committee to allege FAA senior management was complicit in determining the 737 MAX training certification level prior to any evaluation.""
Boeing resisted requiring simulator training for pilots before operating the 737 MAX but reversed course in January.
The report also noted Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) was able to operate more than 150,000 flights carrying 17.2 million passengers on jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed.
The Senate report said the Southwest flights ""put millions of passengers at potential risk."" Southwest said Friday it was aware of the report and added ""we do not tolerate any relaxing of standards that govern ultimate safety across our operation.""
Boeing still faces an ongoing criminal probe into the MAX. The committee said its review was ""constrained due to the continued criminal investigation""
Last month, the FAA approved the 737 MAX's return to service and flights have resumed in Brazil. The first U.S. 737 MAX commercial flight with paying passengers is set for Dec. 29.

Last month, the Senate committee unanimously a bill to reform how FAA certifies new airplanes and grant new protections for whistleblowers, among other reforms, while the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill.

(Reuters) -Nike Inc said on Friday that full-year revenue will likely be better than previously expected, after COVID-wary shoppers demanding outdoor sportswear drove its third consecutive surge in online sales.
Shares in Beaverton, Oregon-based  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) were up about 5% in trading after the bell. They have gained about 37% this year.
The global health crisis has pushed people to take up activities such as running or biking, giving a much needed boost to Nike and other sportswear makers after they took a hit to sales earlier in the year.
Under lockdown, people have also been logging into Nike's workout and store apps en masse, driving significantly higher online sales all year.
The time Nike has invested in its e-commerce channels has paid off and given it a big competitive edge over rivals like Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
""Nike's website is promptly updated and easy to browse, its app is intuitive and its focus on gathering customer data through its various services has really helped it target the right consumers at a time when people are more cautious with their spending."" 
The world's biggest athletic apparel company said it expects annual revenue growth in the ""low-teens,"" up from its previous forecast of a high single-digit to low double-digit increase. 
Nike said digital sales jumped 84%, with triple-digit growth in North America - its biggest market - and strong double-digit increases in other parts of the world.
Revenue rose about 9% to $11.24 billion in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts on average had expected $10.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company reported a 12% increase in profit to $1.25 billion, or 78 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations of 62 cents per share.

Selling and administrative expenses fell 2% to $3.3 billion, further boosting profit, as the pandemic kept Nike from spending as much on marketing its brands and sports events.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>","Fed sees 'strong capital levels' at banks after stress tests, greenlights share buybacks","By Pete Schroeder and David Henry
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The largest U.S. banks have enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and will be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis, the U.S. Federal Reserve said.
The central bank on Friday released the results of its second bank ""stress test"" for 2020, the first time it has put banks through their paces twice in one year since it began the annual health checks following the decade-ago financial crisis. The Fed had previously barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves during the coronavirus pandemic.
The relaxed restrictions were met quickly with announcements from some large firms, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), that they planned to buy back stock beginning in the new year.
The results of the second test of 2020, which the Fed pursued to reflect the severe economic impact of the pandemic, found that banks suffered more severe losses than under the previous, pre-pandemic test.
But months of building up reserves helped ensure they were positioned to weather the downturn well, with firms building capital reserves in 2020 despite setting aside nearly $100 billion in loan loss reserves. 
The Fed found all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking those hypothetical losses, leading the central bank to relax its restrictions on capital payouts by banks, allowing them to buy back stock in the first quarter of 2021, after barring them in June. 
""The banking system has been a source of strength during the past year and today’s stress test results confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy,"" said Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles in a statement.
Under the new restrictions, a bank would be allowed to pay out dividends and buy back stock so long as such sums did not exceed its net income from the last year. The Fed also announced it would not use the new results to tweak how much it ordered each bank to hold as a ""stress capital buffer"" following the previous test results.
See FACTBOX for more on how this year's tests have changed
The new leeway from the Fed will send bank analysts off to calculate how much each bank might be able to spend on share buybacks in coming months based on their estimated fourth quarter earnings. 
Shortly after the results were released, JPMorgan announced it would begin buying back stock in the first quarter under a new $30-billion repurchase program.
""We are pleased that the results of the Federal Reserve’s latest stress test demonstrate the resilience of the largest US financial institutions in the midst of a devastating pandemic. Based on the results and guidance from the Federal Reserve, we intend to resume share repurchases next quarter,"" said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in a statement.

Analysts will also be comparing details of loan losses that the Fed estimated with provisions the banks have made this year for losses they expect. Shares of banks that seem to have put aside more reserves than they will likely need could get a lift from the comparisons.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","U.S. blacklists dozens of Chinese firms including SMIC, DJI","By Alexandra Alper, David Shepardson and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States added dozens of Chinese companies, including the country's top chipmaker SMIC and Chinese drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, to a trade blacklist on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration ratchets up tensions with China in his final weeks in office. 
Reuters first reported the addition of SMIC and other companies earlier on Friday. The move is seen as the latest in Republican Trump's efforts to burnish his tough-on-China image as part of lengthy fight between Washington and Beijing over trade and numerous economic issues.
The U.S. Commerce Department said the action against SMIC stems from Beijing's efforts to harness civilian technologies for military purposes and evidence of activities between SMIC and Chinese military industrial companies of concern.
The Commerce Department will ""not allow advanced U.S. technology to help build the military of an increasingly belligerent adversary,"" Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. 
The department also said it was adding the world's biggest drone company DJI to the list along with AGCU Scientech; China National Scientific Instruments and Materials, and Kuang-Chi Group for allegedly enabling ""wide-scale human rights abuses.""
""The United States will use all countermeasures available, including actions to prevent (Chinese) companies and institutions from exploiting U.S. goods and technologies for malign purposes,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added in a separate release. 
SMIC and the other companies did not immediately comment. 
But some lawmakers, industry executives and former officials raised questions about the impact of Friday's move against SMIC. Generally, entity-listed companies are required to apply for licenses from the Commerce Department that face tough scrutiny when they seek permission to receive items from U.S. suppliers. 
But SMIC will only face a tough review standard when it seeks licenses for highly advanced U.S. chipmaking equipment at 10 nanometers or below. Licenses for all other items shipped to the company will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, the Commerce Department said. 
""It’s a nice (public relations) line: 'We're putting it on this bad guys' list,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official, who said he imagines the agency was already blocking shipments of such technology to SMIC. ""As a practical matter ... it doesn't change anything.""
Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs committee echoed Reinsch's comments, saying he feared the rules were more ""bark than bite."" ""I have concerns it undermines the intent, and may create an exception for malign actors to evade U.S. export controls"" he said in a statement. 
'ARBITRARY SUPPRESSION'
But Chinese authorities did not mince words about Washington's latest gambit. 
In an address to the Asia Society on Friday, China's State Councillor Wang Yi, who is also the country's foreign minister, noted the expanding list of U.S. sanctions and called on Washington to stop its ""arbitrary suppression"" of Chinese companies.
China's foreign ministry said that if true, the blacklisting would be evidence of U.S. oppression of Chinese companies and that Beijing would continue to take ""necessary measures"" to protect their rights.
""We urge the U.S. to cease its mistaken behavior of unwarranted oppression of foreign companies,"" ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular news conference in Beijing on Friday. 
The Commerce Department released a list of 77 companies and affiliates to the so-called entity list, including 60 Chinese companies. 
The designations by the Commerce Department include some entities in China that allegedly enable human rights abuses and some helping it construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea, the agency said. 
It also cited entities that acquired U.S.-origin items to support the Chinese military and those engaged in the theft of U.S. trade secrets.
Companies previously added to the list include telecoms equipment giants Huawei Technologies Co and 150 affiliates, and ZTE Corp (HK:0763) over sanction violations, as well as surveillance camera maker Hikvision over suppression of China's Uighur minority.
FRAYING TIES
Shares in SMIC, formally the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, fell 5.2% in Hong Kong on Friday, while the company's Shanghai-listed shares declined 1.8%. The benchmark indices in the two markets were down less than 1%.
SMIC had already been in Washington's crosshairs. 
In September, the Commerce Department mandated that suppliers of certain equipment to the company apply for export licenses after concluding there was an ""unacceptable risk"" that equipment supplied to it could be used for military purposes.
Last month, the Defense Department added the company to a separate blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, effectively banning U.S. investors from buying its shares starting late next year.
SMIC has repeatedly said that it has no relationship with the Chinese military. 
SMIC is the largest Chinese chip manufacturer but trails Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the industry's market leader. It has sought to build out foundries for the manufacture of computer chips that can compete with those of TSMC.

Ties between Washington and Beijing have grown increasingly antagonistic over the past year as the world's top two economies sparred over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong and rising tensions in the South China Sea.

Investing.com – The Dow retreated Friday, as stimulus negotiations look set to drag on into the weekend on differences over the Federal Reserve's use of emergency lending powers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.41%, or 124 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.07%. All three indexes closed higher for the week.
In a sign that outstanding issues remain on stimulus talks, Senate Majority Mitch McConnel is reportedly seeking to propose a two-day stopgap funding fill to keep the government open and buy more time to get a deal over the line, Politico reported.
Republicans reportedly want to curb the Federal Reserve's use of emergency lending powers, while Democrats want to grant the central bank more leeway to carry out the measures, casting doubt on hopes a deal would be sealed by the end of the day.
GOPs believe the Fed's use of emergency lending programs has pushed the central bank to operate beyond its monetary policy purview.
President Donald Trump supports the Republican efforts to rein in the Fed's power.
""We are strongly in support of Senator (Pat) Toomey’s view with respect to the Treasury emergency funds,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters, according to Reuters.
House Nancy Pelosi reportedly twice delayed her press conference on the progress of stimulus, adding to investor jitters.
The day of red on Wall Street was led by value stocks – those tied to the progress of the economy – with real estate and consumer discretionary stocks among the biggest decliners.
Energy stocks were not far behind, falling more than 1% as the threat to demand of fresh restrictions to curb rising Covid-19 cases weighed on sentiment.
In the US, coronavirus cases topped 17 million, with more than 3,600 deaths recorded on Thursday. But help in the battle against the pandemic appears to be on the way as the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s coronavirus vaccine emergency use authorization.
In tech, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) closed 6.3% lower on fears over a further dent in its chip business as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is reportedly set to design its own chips for servers and surface PCs, according to Bloomberg.
Industrials, meanwhile, were held back by a 5% plunge in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) after the shipping giant's lack of guidance and weaker than expected margins in its ground business offset better-than-expected second-quarter results.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) hit a record high of $684.74 before paring some gains to trade about 1.5% higher as the electric car maker joined the S&P 500 index after the markets close.
""We believe the sustained profitability trajectory as evidenced in the September quarter was the final straw that got Musk & Co. into the S&P 500 this time around despite all the noise around tax credit boosts on the Street,"" Wedbush said in a note.
In the after-market hours, banking stocks surged as the Federal Reserve said it would allow banks to buyback stocks and pay out dividends as its stress tests suggested banks had ""strong capital levels."" The Fed's stress tests estimated that banks had enough capital to cover $600 billion of losses in a sudden economic downturn. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) jumped more than 5% higher in after-hours trade."
1516,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Trump signs bill that could kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation that would kick Chinese companies off U.S. stock exchanges unless they adhere to American auditing standards, the White House said, giving the Republican one more tool to threaten Beijing with before leaving office next month.
""The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" bars securities of foreign companies from being listed on any U.S. exchange if they have failed to comply with the U.S. Public Accounting Oversight Board's audits for three years in a row.
While it applies to companies from any country, the legislation's sponsors intended it to target Chinese companies listed in the United States, such as  Alibaba  (K:BABA), tech firm  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc and oil giant PetroChina Co Ltd.
The legislation, like many others taking a harder line on Chinese businesses, had passed Congress by large margins earlier this year. Lawmakers - both Democrats and Trump's fellow Republicans - echo the president's hard line against Beijing, which became fiercer this year as Trump blamed China for the coronavirus ravaging the United States.
The act would also require public companies to disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.
Chinese officials have dismissed the measure as a discriminatory policy that politically oppresses Chinese firms.

Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms, citing national security concerns.

Hilcorp's Harvest Alaska, a midstream services provider, said it received approval from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska on Dec. 14 to acquire BP's nearly 49% interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) and 49% of Alyeska Service Company and other Alaska midstream interests. 
The 800-mile TAPS is one of the largest pipelines in the world and transports oil from the North Slope to the northern most ice-free port in Valdez, Alaska.
Last year, BP agreed to sell all its Alaskan properties, including interests in the most prolific oil field in U.S. history at Prudhoe Bay, and the Trans Alaska Pipeline, to Hilcorp Energy.
Oil majors including BP have reduced their production roles in the northernmost U.S. state as output slid and lower-cost fields emerged elsewhere. Hilcorp, known for buying up oil castoffs, acquired half of another BP Alaska project in 2014.

(Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended lower on Friday, pulled down by uncertainty around a coronavirus stimulus deal, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares hit a lifetime high in anticipation of their addition to the S&P 500 next week.
All three major indexes hit record highs at the opening before retreating. The S&P 500 technology index, which has led gains this week, was the biggest drag on the overall benchmark index.
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc, which will become on Monday the most valuable company to be ever added to Wall Street's main benchmark index, traded in heavy volume.
""You're already seeing significant levels of volume in Tesla stock today, moving a lot higher as a lot of these different ETFs and mutual funds position ahead of the change to get us close to the price as possible for tracking error purposes,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Investors are seeing increased trading volumes also due to the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures at the end of trade, also known as ""quadruple witching.""
The U.S. Congress looked increasingly unlikely on Friday to meet a deadline to agree on $900 billion in fresh COVID-19 aid and instead may pass a third stopgap spending bill to keep the government from shutting down at midnight.
Recent weak economic data has increased pressure on lawmakers to reach a deal. 
""Investors definitely want to see something come through or like to see something come through on the stimulus front sooner rather than later as COVID cases continue to rise and economic data has shown that it is beginning to deteriorate,"" Bell said.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.51 points, or 0.38%, to 30,187.86, the S&P 500 lost 12.78 points, or 0.34%, to 3,709.7 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.11 points, or 0.07%, to 12,755.64.
The prospect of continued monetary and fiscal stimulus has helped stocks look past the economic impact of the pandemic, and set them up for strong annual gains, despite a rocky start to the year.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brexit clouds airline ownership as Spanish-led fix rebuffed,"By Laurence Frost and Gabriela Baczynska
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Spain, Ireland and Hungary have tried and failed to loosen EU airline ownership rules in a draft aviation deal with the UK, two people with knowledge of the matter said, out of concern about Brexit's impact on British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), Ryanair and Wizz Air.
France and Germany are said to have rejected a softening of longstanding rules that require EU airlines to be owned and controlled by EU nationals or else lose their licences.
While the ownership issue poses no immediate threat to flights, it brings a longer-term challenge to some of Europe's biggest aviation names, with or without a trade deal.
British investors will be deemed non-EU after the Brexit transition ends on Dec. 31 - a headache for airline groups with EU-licensed carriers and large UK shareholder bases.
""There's been a last-ditch effort from a few member states to get something more liberal in the agreement on ownership and control,"" said an aviation source briefed on the discussions. 
""There is not a hope in hell of it happening,"" the source added. ""The big pushback came from France and Germany.""
Spokespeople for the European Commission and the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland and Spain declined to comment or did not respond to Reuters questions.
London and Brussels have for months been negotiating a post-Brexit aviation accord to accompany a broader trade deal. The trade talks appeared to be on a knife-edge on Friday, with time running out for an agreement.
But the rebuff to Spanish-led efforts means that even a deal breakthrough would leave ownership problems unsolved.
They are particularly acute for IAG, which also owns Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spanish-based Iberia and Vueling. A large UK shareholder base and a 25% stake held by Qatar Airways will leave EU investors in a clear minority.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary predicted recently that Brexit could force a breakup of IAG, in comments dismissed by the UK-headquartered group, listed in London and Madrid.
SHARE CAPS
The Irish low-cost airline acknowledges that Brexit will swing its own non-EU shareholders into a majority, and has warned that they stand to lose their votes and the right to buy new shares in the absence of a deal granting more flexibility.
Even including UK investors, EU ownership has previously fallen close to 50% at both IAG and Wizz Air - listed in London and based in Budapest. To stay compliant, IAG barred non-EU share purchases for most of last year, while top Wizz shareholder Indigo Partners sold part of its stake.
EasyJet, reliant on its Austrian carrier for some routes post-Brexit, is also trying to bolster its non-British EU investor ranks, which currently hold about 45% of the group.
All the affected airlines maintain they are Brexit-ready, with ownership compliance strategies vetted and approved by national authorities under Brussels supervision.
""Last year, IAG's airlines submitted plans on ownership and control to the national regulators in Spain and Ireland,"" a group spokeswoman said. ""Those regulators confirmed that the plans would satisfy EU ownership and control rules in the event of a no-deal Brexit.""
As the same governments' failed initiative shows, however, concerns persist that the compliance efforts may be unsustainable, or open to legal challenge by competitors.
Stripping votes may restore European control but not ownership. Among other moves, IAG's transfer of most Iberia voting rights to retailer El Corte Inglés might not amount to relinquishing ""decisive influence on the running of the business"", as the critical EU regulation defines control.
'INTRANSIGENT'
The proposals from Spain, Ireland and Hungary would have allowed UK-based airline shareholders to continue to be counted as EU investors.
""Hungary has Wizz Air listed in London, (and) Spain has Iberia in a group with BA, so their interests were in watering down ownership and control requirements in the new UK deal,"" an EU diplomat told Reuters.
""But the Commission has been rather intransigent on this one,"" the diplomat said. Relaxing ownership rules could weaken EU autonomy, they added, ""a major issue compared to some specific interests of some specific member states.""
Rival airlines under solidly EU ownership may also seek competitive advantage by demanding a strict application of the rules by the Commission or the European Court of Justice.
Relaxing ownership requirements for the UK could give third countries like Qatar a bridgehead to buy up stakes in EU carriers, a policy official at a major European airline said.
""The rules are there to be obeyed,"" he said. ""If there is a legal challenge and the Commission checks Spain and Ireland's analysis, it will lead to some difficult conversations.""
But investors are more focused on a post-pandemic travel recovery and Brexit-related currency risks than on longer-term ownership issues, Citi analyst Mark Manduca said.
Airline breakups are an unthinkable outcome of rules ""originally designed to stop Asian and Middle Eastern airlines from buying up stakes,"" said Manduca, who expects EU policy eventually to accommodate the multinationals.
""A bunch of lawyers will be discussing this for most of 2021,"" he said.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Tesla shares rise in busy trade ahead of S&P 500 debut,"By Noel Randewich and Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) -Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gained on Friday in a busy day for the electric car maker's stock ahead of its much-anticipated grand entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index.
Elon Musk's Tesla on Monday will become the most valuable company ever admitted to Wall Street's main benchmark, accounting for over 1% of the index. The shares have surged over 60% since mid-November, when its debut in the S&P 500 was announced.
The company's shares were up 2.2% to $670.30 in mid-day trading, hitting a record high, although the stock did briefly turn negative during the session. Tesla shares have soared some 700% so far in 2020.
Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 forced index-tracking funds to buy about $85 billion worth of Tesla shares by the end of Friday's session so their portfolios correctly reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Those funds will simultaneously have to sell other S&P 500 constituents' shares worth the same amount. 
Turnover in Tesla shares hit about $30 billion at the mid-day mark of Friday's session, with trading volume topping 44 million, according to Refinitiv data.
The inclusion of Tesla's shares may be a double-edged sword for index trackers. 
""Index-based funds will be paying a higher price than those that bought the stock when the entry date was announced, but will benefit as the fund better represents the U.S. large-cap universe,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""Tesla’s absence in the prominent index has been notable in 2020."" 
Actively managed funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500, many of which until now have avoided investing in one of Wall Street's most controversial stocks, will also be forced to decide whether to own Tesla.
""Everyone has known this is coming for two or three weeks, so the real question now is if it continues to be an outperformer and, if so, then what is the catalyst,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
Tesla's inclusion will ripple through the S&P 500 itself.
Because of Tesla’s high market value compared to its expected earnings, the addition of the stock to the S&P 500 is expected to increase the index’s forward 12-months price-to-earnings ratio from 22 times to 22.3 times, according to David Aurelio, senior manager of equity markets research at Refinitiv.
""There are a lot of concerns from our clients out there that this addition could be a negative for the S&P 500,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas. ""The reason why it has been kept out of the S&P is due to its volatility.""
While some investors view Musk as a visionary entrepreneur, others worry about missed production targets and corporate governance risk after Musk was forced to step down as chairman to settle fraud charges in 2018.
California-based Tesla’s stock surge has put its market value at over $600 billion and making it the sixth most valuable publicly listed U.S. company, with many investors viewing it as wildly overvalued. 
Tesla’s meteoric rise has made it the most valuable auto company in the world despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). 
Tesla is by far the most traded stock by value on Wall Street, with $18 billion worth of its shares exchanged on average in each session over the past 12 months, easily beating Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in second place with average daily trades of $14 billion, according to Refinitiv.
A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle related to profitability that had prevented Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500.

About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies' shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla's influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished compared with its overall value.

MILAN (Reuters) - A new, downsized Alitalia aims to break even in terms of core profit in 2022, excluding aircraft costs, the state-owned carrier's CEO-elect said on Friday.
""We are like a start-up company that takes its first step, like a hiker who wants to get to the top but may have to change its path several times,"" Fabio Lazzerini told a press call to present the 2021-2025 business plan.
After 11 years of turbulent private management and three failed restructuring attempts, the coronavirus crisis scuppered the Italian government's plan to sell the airline and Rome decided to re-nationalise it.
Italy has set aside 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion)for a new company that will buy the good assets of the old carrier and launch a new strategy with state support.
Lazzerini and Chairman-elect Francesco Caio face widespread scepticism that the renationalised Alitalia can be profitable after it burnt through around 8 billion euros of taxpayers' money in the last four years.
Lazzerini, who served as managing director at Gulf airline Emirates in Italy before moving to Alitalia in 2017, said the new carrier would start with 52 planes and up to 5,500 staff, nearly half the levels of the old Alitalia. 
The carrier will clinch an industrial partnership next year, Lazzerini said, adding talks were underway over two possible options.
The old Alitalia is part of the SkyTeam Alliance, which includes U.S. carrier Delta and Europe's AirFrance-KLM. Last year, Germany's Lufthansa held talks with the old Alitalia over a possible alliance. 
The 2021-2025 plan for the new Alitalia will now be submitted to the Italian parliament and to the European Commission for approval. 
Brussels will check whether there is a clear break between the old and the new company, otherwise the revamped Alitalia may be asked to repay state aid the old company received, draining much-needed financial resources.
The carrier will focus on Rome's Fiumicino airport, which is operated by AdR, and Milan's city airport of Linate, which is managed by privately-owned SEA.

1526,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Analysts Say Politics May Outweigh Economics in Fed Stress Tests,"(Bloomberg) -- Results from the Federal Reserve’s special coronavirus stress tests, due after the bell, may highlight the primacy of political tensions over the financial health of the nation’s biggest banks.
Though lenders are expected to pass the tests, the Fed is likely to keep a pandemic-induced halt on buybacks and caps on dividends after it extended the unprecedented constraint in October through year-end, according to analysts.
Banks have been under fire as critics argued that allowing capital distributions creates risk during a challenging economic period. However, bank executives including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon have said they have extraordinary amounts of capital and would like to buy back stock.
U.S. banks will probably prove their resiliency, even under the exam’s harsher assumptions,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo said. However, he believes the Fed won’t allow more capital to be returned to shareholders until perhaps the third quarter of 2021. Like other analysts, he says the problem may be with perception by both politicians and the public.
“Regulators might not want to risk reputations by having banks repurchase stock or increase dividends at a time of rising Covid cases, greater pandemic burden on consumers and businesses, and lingering economic uncertainty,” he wrote in a note to clients.
Mayo added that if he’s wrong about political concerns overriding new buybacks and bigger dividends, then “stocks trading close or below book value would be among the greatest beneficiaries,” like  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Over at UBS, analyst Saul Martinez expects the status quo will be extended, with the Fed keeping existing limitations through at least the first quarter.
“Even if banks perform well and keep capital levels above the minimum threshold in the stress scenarios,” he said that the Fed could justify keeping restrictions by citing rising Covid-19 cases and signs of economic weakness, even with vaccine distribution and effective treatments.
Plus he warned that “criticism from select policymakers could emerge if restrictions are lifted as the Biden administration prepares to take office.”
On the other hand, John Augustine, Huntington Private Bank’s chief investment officer, sees the potential for buybacks as soon as April, particularly as banks may be over-reserved for loan losses. In a phone interview, Augustine said that the “banks are arguably over-capitalized.” He added that a rebound in bank stocks this quarter was likely driven in part by expectations for dividends and share repurchases next year, as the pandemic ebbs with widespread vaccination.
“The Fed may well wait another quarter until Spring 2021 to allow the Covid-19 pandemic to subside,” with the post-vaccine economic landscape helping the outlook, Janney Montgomery Scott’s director of research Christopher Marinac wrote. He suggested that investors should focus any immediate disappointment into thinking about banks growing their capital and tangible book value as they retain more earnings for the next few months.
RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy noted that next year’s stress tests are “around the corner,” with the Fed publishing economic scenarios for what’s known as the 2021 CCAR exam in January. Cassidy expects those economic scenarios will be “more severe” than this year’s had been, which will “likely result in some banks having greater capital depletion.”
Banks stocks slipped for a second day on Friday morning, with the KBW Bank Index shedding 1.1%. The index, hammered by Covid-driven economic woes and low interest rates, has underperformed the broader market this year, with a drop of 17%, versus a 15% rally for the S&P 500. JPMorgan Chase & Co.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Analysis-Debate over pulling fuses widens regulatory cracks on 737 MAX,"By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX is set to return to the skies in Canada with a local twist in the cockpit, after Ottawa became the last major Western regulator to lift a 20-month safety ban. Small print in Thursday's Transport Canada announcement sheds light on a regulatory split over the use of a less common tactic to overcome cockpit distractions, deepening international disunity over the lessons from two fatal crashes.
Transport Canada joined the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators in requiring more training and revisions to MCAS anti-stall software implicated in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which killed 346 people.
But unlike the FAA, Canada will give pilots an option to intervene in an electrical system to silence an alarm thought to have distracted crew as they tried to control the doomed jets.
In an unusual move, pilots in Canada will be allowed to pull a circuit-breaker or electric fuse to silence an erroneously activated ""stick shaker,"" which vibrates the control column and makes a loud noise when the jet risks losing lift.
""Normally, pulling circuit breakers is considered an outdated practice and should only be done when directed by a checklist and not as a method of troubleshooting,"" said Tim Perry, president of Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) Canada.
Perry said he backs Canada's procedure: ""Upon thorough evaluation, we deemed it safe."" 
The two MAX crashes, involving a computer that pushed the nose down because of false flight data, had already undermined decades of efforts to harmonize safety rules as regulators worldwide banned the jet without waiting for the FAA.
The Canadian push to let pilots pull a circuit-breaker is further proof of regulators' willingness to check each other's homework and could increase pressure to be heard from pilots.
""The more differing viewpoints you have, the more of a problem it is for industry,"" said Michael Daniel, a former FAA certification expert. 
Transport Canada, a low-key figure in a field dominated by heavyweights in the United States and Europe, said it had spent over 15,000 hours reviewing the MAX. Like its European counterpart, it is unwilling to surrender its increased role. 
""Canada will absolutely have a greater involvement in ... either independent testing throughout the validation process, or a greater engagement in the actual testing itself,"" Nicholas Robinson, its head of civil aviation, told Reuters.
PILOT ROLE
Pilots, who played an important part in MAX discussions, also want a permanent say in future approvals.
""The extensive return-to-service exercise illustrates the need to have airline pilots involved in the certification process,"" said Perry.
The delicate role of cockpit fuses surfaced in 2014 when an Indonesia AirAsia captain appeared to pull a fuse linked to a malfunctioning computer before his Airbus jet crashed, investigators said. https://reut.rs/3gTXAjE
French and Indonesian investigators disagreed over how far that went against the manual. 
In a Boeing study of stick-shaker alarms on 737s since 2001, cited in the official report on the first 737 MAX crash in 2018, crew had pulled a breaker in one out of 27 such incidents.
While not common, Robinson said there are cases where pilots pull breakers. He said it's better to act with an established procedure, like Canada's new rule, than to react on the spot. 
""In some cases, the only way to cancel the warning is to pull the circuit breaker,"" said U.S. aviation training expert Kit Darby. ""It's like someone blaring their horn at you."" 
As discussions over the 737 MAX grounding wore on, Europe's regulator and pilot unions backed Canada's plan.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency ordered a colored cap on the circuit breaker to help find it.
The FAA refused to follow suit, saying pilots would not be able to reach the right fuse with seat-belts properly fastened.
It publicly raised concerns that trying to reach behind for the fuse panel would distract pilots from primary duties and could result in accidentally pulling the wrong fuse.

Pilots at U.S. budget carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) have backed the Canadian move and urged the FAA to adopt it.

The bank in September had appointed Stephen Burke to take over Raymond's role as the lead independent director effective Jan. 1.

1532,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mixed Ahead of 'Quadruple Witching'; Dow Flat,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed again on Friday, holding on to Thursday's gains after hitting new record highs in anticipation of a stimulus package that still remains out of reach.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrialized Average was up 4 points, essentially unchanged, at 30,308 points. The S&P 500 index was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%.
Momentum has drained from the market after reports indicating that the long-awaited stimulus package is not likely to be agreed until the weekend, although lawmakers on both sides reiterated after Thursday's talks that a deal is within reach and that they won't leave for their holiday recess until a deal is in place. 
Traders are bracing for volatility on what is the last day of trading for December options contracts in both single stocks and index products. Such 'quadruple witching' days typically get very choppy in the final minutes before settlement, and the big role played by options trading in this year's rally may lead to a repeat of that. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), one of the biggest players in the options market this year, has however said it will allow its positions to largely roll off at the end of the day. 
Brokers typically hedge their short options positions by buying the underlying stock. If the options aren't rolled over, the brokers are likely to unload some of their positions.
Against that backdrop, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which has been one of the most actively traded through options all year, rose to a new record high before retracing a little to trade up 2.7%. Big Tech stocks edged slightly lower, as the accumulation of antitrust actions against the big Internet platform companies began to weigh a little, although here too the influence of the options expiry was also felt.
Another big lawsuit was launched by the Attorneys-General of 38 states against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) on Wednesday, alleging abuse of its dominant position in the search market.
However, the news wasn't all bad, as consumer products giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) said it would end its boycott of advertising on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Facebook stock was nonetheless down 0.6%.
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell another 5.1% as investors took profits ahead of an expected decision later in the day by the Food and Drug Administration to give its Covid-19 drug emergency use authorization. It;s still up more than 50% since  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech first indicated that their vaccine, which uses the same messenger RNA technology as Moderna's, was effective in treating the disease.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock also fell 4.4% after it failed to give guidance for 2021 in its quarterly update after the bell on Thursday, prompting fears that the online shopping boom that has propelled its share price this year may cool quickly if the pandemic fades again as spring arrives and vaccines become widely distributed."

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Retail traders leave Wall Street for dust in 2020 stocks rally,"By Tommy Wilkes and Thyagaraju Adinarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Retail traders have ridden 2020's stock market rally better than the professionals, with their most popular picks outperforming market indexes and well-resourced investors such as hedge funds.
Online trading platforms have reported a retail rush since the COVID-19 pandemic hit markets in March, with near-zero interest rates and a roaring rebound luring a new generation of stuck-at-home traders wanting to sharpen their skills on stocks.
And while the scramble into fast-growing but highly-valued stocks has echoes of the 2000 dotcom bubble, plentiful cheap cash means retail traders do not yet look ready to cash in.
COVID-19 WINNERS
Record sums of central bank stimulus have turbocharged markets in 2020, inflating asset prices, often to record levels and particularly in U.S. tech.
Retail investors have picked the biggest beneficiaries, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), electric vehicle makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio (NYSE:NIO), as well as pharma hopefuls looking for a break in the COVID-19 vaccine hunt. 
A basket of 58 U.S.-listed stocks popular with retail traders is up more than 80% this year, outstripping the S&P 500's 14.5% rise and a hedge fund basket's return of 40%, two Goldman Sachs-compiled indexes show.
(GRAPHIC: Retail stock pickers outsmart Wall St professionals - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-STOCKS/jznvnqlzepl/chart.png)
Amateur traders have also piled into electric truckmaker Nikola, which is yet to sell a truck, and big lockdown winners in exercise bike maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and Zoom. 
Market veterans draw comparisons with the frenzy in little-known internet stocks before the 2000 dotcom crash. 
""Of course it's a bubble. But money is free, liquidity is high, its never been easier to trade for retail punters, there's no savings rate or bond yield and everyone wants the bubble to pop,"" Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud Securities, said.
AT A STRETCH
Many of the stocks retail traders have been buying look expensive, based on the commonly-used price-to-earnings ratio.
The P/E ratio for stocks in Goldman's 'Retail Favourites' index is deeply negative, as the companies lose money. 
For the 'Hedge Fund VIP' index, the ratio is 32.
(GRAPHIC: Retail favorites trade at high multiples - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/qzjvqdngmpx/Pasted%20image%201608205802278.png) 
Many institutional investors have poured cash into the same pumped-up shares, but they usually diversify. 
Retail portfolios therefore have much weaker balance sheets, as shown by the net debt to operating profit ratio for Goldman Sach's hedge fund basket of 1.8, against retail's 4.8.
Stretched valuations and a concentration of retail investors in some stocks, Refinitiv data shows they own 20% of Tesla shares against 0.17% of 117-year-old Ford, could exacerbate a selloff if confidence in ever-rising prices wanes. 
EVASIVE EUROPE
In Europe, where retail share ownership tends to be lower than in the U.S., small investors have had far less luck.
Stocks hit hard by the economic downturn are among their most popular purchases, trading platforms told Reuters.
Heavily bought shares include Airbus and Rolls Royce (LON:RR), British bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY), Lufthansa and International Consolidated Airlines (OTC:ICAGY), data from Saxo Bank, IG Group, AJ Bell, Interactive Investor and eToro shows.
Despite a vaccine-inspired rebound since November, these stocks remain deep in the red and way off the 4% year-to-date drop in the broader European market.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Friday, stalling near record highs as investors look to Washington for fresh news about a Covid relief package.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 24 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 3 points, or 0.03%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 cash index are on course for their third positive week in four and the Nasdaq Composite its fourth weekly gain in five, with all three indices closing Thursday at record highs.
U.S. lawmakers are running short of time to pass not only a pandemic rescue package but also a comprehensive spending bill to fund the government before federal funding runs out at the end of Friday.
Both major parties have cited progress, but there are still sticking points holding up an agreement over a potential $900 billion economic rescue package, meaning talks look likely to stretch into the weekend.
“It appears risk sentiment can still benefit from stimulus news, although there is a risk of a partial government shutdown over the weekend possibly pouring some cold water on the otherwise upbeat mood,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Meanwhile, Thursday’s initial jobless claims figure showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment assistance jumped to a three-month high last week, while the surge in Covid-19 cases is resulting in more business shutdowns across the nation.
A FDA advisory panel voted Thursday to recommend Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use. This could result in the drug being given the approval as soon as today, quickly joining the initial 2.9 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that began shipping around the country on Sunday.
In the corporate sector, quarterly earnings are expected from Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), owner of the Olive Garden chain and others, and motorhome manufacturer Winnebago (NYSE:WGO) before the open, and footwear manufacturer  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) after the close. 
The economic data slate is relatively light Friday, with the third-quarter current account balance data the main release.
Oil prices slipped, retreating from the nine-month highs seen the previous session as traders waited for Congress to approve a new Covid-19 relief package. The Baker Hughes oil rig count is also due later Friday.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $48.33 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $51.40. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since early March on Thursday.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,892.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2260.

 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc, whose technology has become a feature of household get togethers in 2020's socially distanced world, said it was removing the time limit for its free accounts on all meetings globally for the holiday season.
This covers the Christian celebrations of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, the end of Hannukah for Jews and Kwanzaa marked by African-Americans, as well as New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. All of them fall in late December or early January.
The coronavirus pandemic has roared to new highs around the world during a second wave, forcing many people to stay home and plan gatherings with friends and family over the Internet instead.
""Whether coming together on the final day of Hanukkah, celebrating Christmas, ringing in the New Year, or marking the last days of Kwanzaa, those connecting with friends and family won't get cut short,"" a Zoom spokesman said.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Meet has already said free users would not have to limit conversations to 60 minutes till March.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s Webex, who have usage grow during the pandemic, have so far not announced any relaxation in meeting length caps.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Analysis-U.S. retailers want shoppers to help Santa with curbside pickup,"By Melissa Fares, Nivedita Balu and Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - With homebound Americans making record numbers of online holiday purchases and snowy streets worsening a logjam for shipping companies, retailers are enticing shoppers to pick up orders in person to ensure their stockings are stuffed Christmas morning.
Long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine shipments have further complicated the picture for retailers, who hope drivers for Uber (NYSE:UBER), DoorDash and other gig economy firms will help them avoid a nightmare before Christmas.
The worst-case scenario is that ""presents could be sitting in a retailer’s warehouse or stuck in one of the carriers' sort centers as opposed to under the Christmas tree,"" said Trevor Outman, co-chief executive of shipping consulting firm Shipware.
After online spending surged during the early part of this year's coronavirus pandemic, retailers and shippers teamed up to get a head start on holiday promotions beginning in October. 
Yet procrastination remained as big a holiday season tradition as greeting cards or eggnog. Some 54 percent of shoppers plan to purchase their last gift during the week leading up to Christmas, according to a survey released Thursday by the National Retail Federation, a trade group.
An anticipated surge in e-commerce, combined with heavy snowfall throughout the Northeast, could delay many deliveries, carriers have warned.  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and DHL have been enforcing volume agreements with retailers, meaning there are times when packages do not get picked up.
The website for Danish jewelry company Pandora (OTC:PANDY) A/S has a clock counting down days, hours, minutes, and seconds for its Christmas Eve delivery deadline: Thursday, Dec. 17 at 11:59 p.m. EST. Last year, the retailer, which has partnered with UPS for eight years, set a deadline of Dec. 19.
""The last four to five days before Christmas, we’ll be focused on click-and-collect as a primary vehicle to drive sales among people online,"" Sid Keswani, President of Pandora Americas, told Reuters.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Best Buy, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and LVMH-owned Sephora are among more than two dozen major retailers advertising turnaround times as fast as two hours for curbside pickup and buy-online-pick-up-in-store, according to a Reuters tally. 
""We've gotten to a point where, if you didn't shop early, you’re kind of out of luck, especially with the big storm on the East Coast,"" said Gabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners. “You have to do curbside. You don’t have a choice.""
On Tuesday, Walmart penned a blog post alerting readers “there’s still time to sleigh the holidays"" with contactless curbside pickup and delivery.
A candy cane-colored banner splashed across Macy’s website greets shoppers with “Get your gifts by Christmas!” and offers three options: store pickup, contact-free curbside pickup and a new same-day delivery in partnership with DoorDash.
Regional department store chain Belk is offering up to an additional 15% off purchases to encourage pickup. Rival J.C. Penney is offering 10% off click-and-collect orders.  
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), advertised free gift wrap for shoppers who collect orders in stores.
Some say this approach is at odds with messages from public officials advising people to stay home as coronavirus cases rise. Retailers have responded by spelling out the safety measures they have taken.   DECK THE HALLS WITH FAST DELIVERY
UPS, FedEx and USPS ""are already strapped for adequate capacity to handle 3 billion parcels between now and Christmas, which is 800 million more than the same period in 2019,"" said Satish Jindel, president of delivery tracking and management firm ShipMatrix. 
""If they have to divert resources to transporting Covid-19 vaccine shipments, it will create further delays in delivery of holiday online orders,"" Jindel said of UPS and FedEx.
The crunch gives  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart an opportunity to show off their robust curbside operations. Target owns same-day delivery provider Shipt and Walmart has built up its network of delivery drivers. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also uses gig Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) drivers to augment delivery.
Gig delivery services, with millions of drivers ready for last-minute orders, could have an outsized role, retail and shipping experts said.
Uber's drivers, who have struggled during the pandemic, are making home delivery of presents. ""Succulents to your sister"" to ""homemade pie to your nephew,"" the rideshare app advertised.
Retailers including PetSmart, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), MAC and Sephora have bolstered same-day delivery partnerships with crowd-sourced companies including DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates.
FastAF, which uses micro-fulfillment centers to deliver hot products like Dyson Airwrap and Nintendo  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) to people in New York City and Los Angeles within two hours, said its partnership with DoorDash allows it to bypass traditional shippers.

""People who used to be taxi drivers or Uber drivers have started... delivering packages,"" said Andy Halliwell, UK-based international retail strategist at Publicis Sapient. ""We're seeing sedans driving around streets full to the brim of Amazon parcels or ASOS (LON:ASOS) parcels.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were mixed early on Friday, capping the last full trading week of the year with investors still on edge over a Brexit trade deal and U.S. stimulus package.
Shares in London inched up, lifted by a weaker dollar. Frankfurt barely gained and Paris slipped.
""The uncertainty around what's coming over the next few days is keeping investors a little bit nervous as we have two factors likely to be resolved over the next days: the EU-UK deal and the U.S. stimulus plan,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Dutch health technology firm Philips rose 2% after it agreed to buy U.S. cardiac diagnostics and monitoring firm BioTelemetry (NASDAQ:BEAT) in a deal worth $2.8 billion.
A more pessimistic tone to Britain's protracted talks with the European Union weakened the pound, with only days remaining before the UK leaves the bloc's single market on Dec. 31.
The EU warned there were just hours left to strike a deal, undermining British domestically focussed mid-caps as the prospect of trade tariffs in the New Year loomed.
""The EU-UK talks could well go right up to the wire as neither side wants to be seen be giving in too easily. It's all about the optics for both sides, so it could take a little bit longer than most people are comfortable with,"" Hewson said.
The British pound slipped 0.29% to $1.3546, off the two-and-a-half-year high it hit on Thursday.
Among the day's economic data, British retail sales fell 3.8% for the month in November when a four-week lockdown in England closed shops selling non-essential goods to the public.
A separate gauge of UK consumer confidence jumped by the most in eight years this month, boosted by the country's coronavirus vaccine programme.
WALL STREET RECORDS TUMBLE
The prevalent underlying mood on global equities remained upbeat. All three major U.S. stock indexes, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P500, ended at record highs on Thursday on optimism about a coronavirus stimulus bill.
U.S. S&P 500 futures were flat.
Markets were also encouraged that the United States stood ready to ship 5.9 million doses of a new coronavirus vaccine developed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) that's close to winning regulatory approval.
""Even though the current state of outbreak is so bleak, markets are assuming vaccines will help the U.S. achieve a herd immunity next year and that everybody will be dancing in spring, with pent-up demand for consumption exploding,"" said Kozo Koide, chief economist at Asset Management One.
Asian shares slipped on Friday after Reuters reported that the United States is set to add dozens of Chinese companies, including the country's top chipmaker SMIC, to a trade blacklist later in the day.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.4% from Thursday's record. Mainland Chinese shares fell 0.35% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.67%.
Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.2%, facing strong resistance around 27,000.
The dollar index stood at 89.91, having slipped below 90 for the first time in two and a half years. 
The euro traded at $1.2260, having hit a two-and-a-half-year high of $1.2273 on Thursday.
Bitcoin rose 1.9% to $23,256 after breaking $20,000 on Wednesday, setting off a fresh wave of buying.
Spot gold eased to $1,879.6 per ounce from a one-month high of $1,896.2 the day before. Copper hit its highest levels in almost eight years. 

Oil climbed to a nine-month high before easing in Asia on Friday. Brent crude futures traded at $51.34 a barrel, down 0.3% on day but not far from Thursday's peak of $51.90, having gained 2.7% so far this week.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","Reopening rally? Speculative bubble? These days, it's hard to tell","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Surging U.S. stocks are stretching equity valuations near their highest levels in years, leaving investors to determine whether the rally signals a coming economic rebound or an asset price bubble in the midst of a global pandemic.
After a 15% year-to-date rally, the S&P 500 trades at 22 times forward earnings, compared to a historical average of 15.3 times, according to Refintiv Datastream.
The technology sector, which accounts for nearly 28% of the index, trades at an even higher P/E ratio: 26.4 times compared to its historic average of 20.6 times.
Bulls argue stock prices are justified, with expectations that vaccines against COVID-19 will support a reopening of the economy. They also tout the relative attractiveness to assets such as bonds, with yields at extremely low levels.
Others believe pockets of the market have already entered overvalued territory.
""In aggregate, (stock valuations) are elevated .. relative to history. In certain parts of the market, there is definitely a bubble,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell weighed in on the debate in the press conference following the central bank's monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, saying he did not believe equities were overpriced on a risk-reward basis and pledging the Fed would continue supporting the economy with its massive monthly purchases of U.S. government bonds.
The S&P 500 is up 66% from its March lows and hit a record high on Thursday, even as data showed the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week, offering more evidence economic recovery was faltering.
Skeptics point to a 680% rally this year in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, Bitcoin's climb to $20,000, and money pouring into special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, as evidence of bubble-like investor behavior.
Meanwhile, a BofA Global Research survey showed this week that stock-hungry fund managers dropped cash levels so low it triggered a ""sell"" signal for equities in the bank's model.
In his Wednesday comments, Powell said while P/Es are ""historically high,"" the ""equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk... is not at incredibly low levels, which would mean that (stocks) are not overpriced in that sense.""
The equity risk premium, which compares the earnings yield on stocks to the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury note favors stocks over bonds, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.
Historically, when stocks hold equity risk premium levels they are at currently, the S&P 500 has outperformed the 10-year Treasury note by 10.3% over the following 12 months, Lerner said. 
""People who say the market is highly valued, they are correct,"" Lerner said. ""People who say the equity market has relative value, in our view that is correct.""
Equities look comparatively attractive because dividend, earnings and cash flow yields are much higher than fixed income yields, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Private Bank said in a recent report.
""You may not be getting a bargain in stocks, but they will likely outperform fixed income and cash next year,"" the bank's outlook report said.
Another factor supporting stocks, Lerner said, is that valuation measures may not fully account for the corporate earnings boost in the coming years, should the economy recover.
Valuations of mega-cap companies with huge weight in the S&P 500 are also skewing overall market valuations higher, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU). 
Pockets of value exist elsewhere, such as in airlines, hotels and real estate companies that were hammered by the pandemic-induced economic shutdowns, Krosby said.

The valuations of the market's ""most dormant"" companies ""are not stretched by any means at this point,"" Krosby said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint rocket venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), said it expects to receive two new rocket engines from billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin by next summer.
ULA, the Pentagon's top launch contractor for national security satellites, had initially expected the shipment in 2020 for a debut flight in early 2021, but this was delayed by development hurdles.
The installation of Blue Origin's reusable BE-4 engines into ULA's next-generation Vulcan rocket will keep it on track for the debut launch of a moon lander dubbed Peregrine at the end of 2021, ULA Chief Executive Tory Bruno said. The Vulcan rocket has won a slate of key U.S. defense missions through 2027. 
""That is now our expectation, that Peregrine will go to space in the 4th quarter of 2021,"" Bruno told reporters during a call on Thursday. 
ULA picked Blue Origin's BE-4 in 2018 to power Vulcan, a two-stage heavy-lift rocket that will succeed ULA's Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) 5 workhorse.
The delivery of Blue Origin's BE-4 was delayed over an issue with the engine's complex single-shaft turbopump, the part of a rocket engine that injects flammable propellants during ignition with forces of 80,000 horsepower. 

Those challenges are ""all behind us now and we are very confident in the final configuration,"" Bruno said.

1543,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 05:37AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Norwegian Air Lives to Fly Another Day,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NORR) lives to fly another day.
The beleaguered discount airline’s shareholders have overwhelmingly backed a restructuring plan proposed by management that will allow it to keep flying for the immediate future, and maybe hang on until better days return next year.
Earlier this month, management had presented a plan to stay afloat that envisaged the issue of new shares to raise up to 380 million euros, and the sale of a bunch of aircraft that it won’t be needing any time soon.
That plan will form the basis of negotiations with the group’s creditors, who will also be required to convert large amounts of their claims into equity.
The company, which had captured imaginations and hearts a few years ago with its bold move to launch the discount flying model on transatlantic routes, is currently operating under Irish bankruptcy protection, after a first bailout back in the spring still left it with too much debt and not enough earning power.
The Norwegian government refused to back a second bailout on the grounds that there wasn’t much Norwegian about the airline beyond its name. Many of its planes and its financing arm are based in low-tax, light-regulation Ireland, hence that is the law that will govern the restructuring.
Why would anyone want to get involved with an obvious zombie that still has a huge amount of work to do to transform itself into a phoenix? The airline is a shadow of its former self, having suspended all international operations and running only a minimum of domestic Norwegian flights. To add insult to injury, it now faces competition from low-cost rival Wizz Air on those routes.
Available seat capacity was down 96% from year-earlier levels in November, while total passenger traffic was down 98%.
Clearly, the stock is not for widows and orphans at this point. If the talks break down, the airline will collapse, the shares will end up worthless and the undeserving state-backed giants such as Air France KLM  (PA:AIRF) and Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), having secured billions of euros in aid from taxpayers, will congratulate themselves on seeing off another challenge from an upstart startup.
Even if the talks proceed well, the immediate outlook for cash flow is still miserable and will remain so until vaccine distribution and seasonal factors bring the pandemic under control again. Nor is the prospect for a quick resolution particularly great: the deadline for leasing companies to convert their substantial claims on the company isn’t until the end of June, leaving an important element of the recapitalization math uncertain for up to six months.
But if – IF – Norwegian can hang on that long, however, the payoff could be substantial. Travel agent bookings for next summer indicate that demand has been more pent-up than permanently lost, and competitors’ fleets have been aggressively pruned, addressing some of the overcapacity problem that is a permanent feature of the sector. Brand goodwill is likely to remain high as long as the fear of being stranded by a sudden bankruptcy can be contained.
There are surely safer ways to make a bit of money, but with most cyclical stocks having sharply rerated since November, Norwegian does offer an increasingly rare chance for some high-beta thrills."
1544,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 04:02AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Higher; Economic Data Cheer,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged cautiously higher Friday, with investors optimistic about future growth despite keeping a wary eye on the ongoing Brexit negotiations.
At 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index outperformed, climbing 0.6%. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said late Thursday that  “big differences” remain between the two sides, and that “bridging them will be very challenging.”
A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also warned it was “very likely” there would be no agreement unless the bloc changed its position “substantially”.
Talks are progressing behind the scenes, and such negative language could be expected as a negotiating tactic, but time is running out for the two sides to agree a deal to cover around $1 trillion in annual trade at risk of facing tariffs and quotas at the end of the year.
This potential disruption to the European economy as a whole comes as the region continues to suffer from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
That said, Friday’s economic data have been reasonably positive. The widely-watched German IFO Business Climate index climbed to 92.1 in December from 90.7 the previous month. U.K. consumer confidence also rose in December, helped by the start of the country’s vaccination program, while retail sales dropped by 3.8% in November. This was the biggest decline since the first lockdown in April, but was still better than the 4.2% drop expected.
Additionally, an advisory panel in the U.S. recommended the approval of  Moderna  's  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Covid-19 drug late Thursday, clearing the way for a second vaccine to enter the fight against the pandemic.
In corporate news, British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) stock fell 0.9% after a report that it had agreed to buy Spanish carrier Air Europa for 500 million euros ($612.55 million).
 Vivendi  (PA:VIV) stock rose 1.6% after the French conglomerate agreed to sell another stake of 10% in Universal Music Group to Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), the latest in a string of eye-catching deals in music that has underlined the value of rights holders' income streams.
Dutch health technology firm Philips (AS:PHG) rose 2.3% after it agreed to buy U.S. cardiac diagnostics and monitoring firm BioTelemetry (NASDAQ:BEAT) in a deal worth $2.8 billion.
Oil prices slipped, retreating from the nine-month highs seen the previous session as traders waited for Congress to approve a new Covid-19 relief package.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $48.34 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $51.39. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since early March on Thursday.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,885.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2260.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>","Analysis: Insurers, drugmakers sail into unknown with COVID vaccine rollout","By Jonathan Saul and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Speedy global delivery of COVID-19 vaccines by air and sea in ultra cold conditions will lead to a jump in cargo insurance rates and spur demand for new areas of coverage, leaving underwriters on high alert. 
Pharmaceutical companies normally manage the risks of transporting their products through buying insurance or relying on an in-house insurer, known as a ""captive"" insurer.
But as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and other drugmakers start to roll out vaccines more broadly, existing company-wide annual cargo insurance programmes are likely to be insufficient, industry sources say.
""Where manufacturers or logistics providers see gaps in their coverages, they may look to the insurance markets to plug those gaps,"" said Charlie Netherton at broker Marsh.
The first U.S. vaccine shipments departed Pfizer's facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan this week, while tens of thousands of people in Britain have had their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, which was developed with Germany's BioNTech.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc is also due to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine once regulatory approval is secured, as is Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) which has developed a vaccine with Oxford University.
Transporting vaccines, however, is already high risk, with around 30% of vaccine consignments globally lost to damage or theft, insurance sources say.
Prices for new contracts in the transport insurance market were climbing sharply even before the pandemic following rising claims and reduced competition, and industry sources expect insurance rates to jump when pharma companies involved in COVID-19 vaccines renew their annual policies next year, given the additional risk.
""Vaccine producers which do not have long-term contracts in place must expect additional insurance costs of up to 20% compared to the previous year,"" said Reiner Heiken, chief executive of U.S.-headquartered Hellmann Worldwide Logistics. 
Those companies are also expected to take out more cover for added risks including extra-cold transport and increased likelihood of cyber attacks or old-fashioned theft, sources said.
    To rein in their insurance costs, drug firms are likely to take on more of the initial risk themselves, or make more use of in-house captives, which have become increasingly popular in large firms.
Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca did immediately respond to requests for comment via email. 
GOING MISSING
Insurers, for their part, also risk claims under liability policies if the vaccines are administered after being damaged in transit, and cause major side effects, Nicky Stokes at broker New Dawn Risk said.
A consignment carrying tens of thousands of packs of a COVID-19 vaccine that is lost, stolen or damaged from a truck or refrigerated container has an estimated value of $15-$50 million, industry sources say.
Such losses compare with total claims on cargo insurance of $563 million last year, the International Union of Marine Insurance said.
The U.S. and British governments have said they will take on liability risk if the vaccines cause side effects but it is not clear if that includes side effects caused by damage in transit.
Any losses on the transport of vaccines would come on top of more than $100 billion in claims due to the pandemic predicted by Lloyd’s of London this year across a range of insurance classes. 
Transporting the vaccine by the first movers such as Pfizer requires constant conditions of -70 degrees Celsius. Monitoring will be complex at scale. 
If the vaccines ""veer outside of their optimum temperature range for a certain period of time then regulatory bodies will deem them spoiled and unfit for consumption, which for insured or insurers would mean a loss,"" said Mel Buitendag with insurance broker Gallagher.
The vaccine is so far being transported by plane.
   However, A.P. Moller Maersk, the world's no.1 container shipping line, said it has an agreement with COVAXX, a division of U.S. private group United Biomedical, to move the vaccine in specialised refrigerated reefer containers. 
    ""Transportation by air freight is happening already,"" said Maersk's global head of pharmaceuticals Hristo Petkov. ""For ocean volumes we are looking at end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter.""
COVAXX's Chief Executive Mei Mei Hu told Reuters it was working with Maersk to secure comprehensive cargo insurance for the full value of each shipment.
""The greatest common risk to temperature-controlled cargo transported via either sea or air is at the points of transition to the last mile - between ocean and inland or air and inland,"" Hu said. 
""Any transition point can introduce extra handling, changes in power supplies, or delays in customs clearance that can threaten the shipment's integrity."" 
ARMED GUARDS
Interpol has issued a global warning about vaccines being a prime target for organised crime.
The vaccines are likely to need advanced tracking and even armed escorts, Gallagher's Buitendag said. 
Cargo insurance typically excludes cyber attacks, so pharma companies usually buy extra cover. 

""A successful worldwide distribution will require unparalleled data connectivity,"" said Kevin Rimmer, head of cargo at broker McGill and Partners.

The result came after union negotiators reached a second tentative agreement with GM last week after the union members rejected the first deal. 
The two sides have had 26 rounds of negotiations since July. 
About 54% of members approved the agreement while around 44% rejected the terms. The remaining votes were invalid. 
In the second deal, GM agreed to drop a damage suit filed against its union and offered the lump-sum payment worth 4 million won ($3,664.11) for each member by end of the year, an official at GM's South Korean operation told Reuters. 
The automaker also offered to raise discount rates on cars for employees and their families.
GM rejected employee demands to raise the retirement age by five years to 65 and to build more vehicles at one of its South Korean plants. 
GM's South Korean workers staged several rounds of partial strikes since Oct. 30 as they demanded an end to a wage freeze put in place after 2018 that helped prevent GM's Korean operations from going into bankruptcy. 
That has cost the automaker about 25,000 vehicles in lost production, according to an official at GM's Korea unit, which comes on top of some 60,000 units lost earlier in the year due to the spread of the novel coronavirus. 

Last month, the automaker issued its strongest warning yet that the persistent industrial unrest in South Korea could in the long term drive the automaker out of the country.

“Gold’s recent underperformance versus real rates and the dollar has left some investors concerned that Bitcoin is replacing gold as the inflation hedge of choice,” the bank said in a note. “While there is some substitution occurring, we do not see Bitcoin’s rising popularity as an existential threat to gold’s status as the currency of last resort.”
Bitcoin has seen a blistering rally this month, exceeding $23,000 per token on Thursday, having only surpassed the $20,000 milestone for the first time on Wednesday. Its ascent has prompted debate about whether the upstart will cut into gold’s role, with JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Institutions and wealthy investors avoid cryptocurrencies due to “transparency issues, while speculative retail investment causes Bitcoin to act as an excessively risky asset,” Goldman said. “We do not see evidence that Bitcoin’s rally is cannibalizing gold’s bull market and believe the two can coexist.”

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>",Pandemic tests Rolls-Royce resilience after prolonged engine trouble,"By Sarah Young and Tim Hepher
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) may be the jewel in Britain's industrial crown, but the coronavirus crisis has left the engine-maker facing one of the toughest challenges in its 114-year history.
The Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) supplier bought itself time by raising 5 billion pounds ($6.8 billion) to survive the global grounding of planes, but is warning that 2020 will be even worse than expected.
Before it secured extra funds in November, analysts had raised the possibility that the maker of powerplants for British nuclear submarines might need to be saved by the state.
And Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to allay concerns last month, saying the government would work with Rolls to ensure its long-term future as a ""great, great British company"" after credit agencies cut its debt rating to ""junk"".
As one of only four major aero engine-makers globally, Rolls symbolises British industrial interests at a crucial time for a country trying to assert its place in a post-Brexit world and dogged by uncertainty over future trade relations.
But existing concerns over a long-running problem with engine blades have been compounded by worries over Rolls' finances, which represents a significant stumbling block in an industry where airlines sign decade-long agreements.
With many airlines only paying when they fly, Rolls' future depends on the recovery of engine flight hours on widebody intercontinental jets, and convincing its airframer partners and airline customers that its problems are behind it. 
Both have fretted about one of the industry's key suppliers during the crisis, several industry executives told Reuters.
""When you buy an airplane it is for many years. If the engine manufacturer disappears or changes shape, that can hurt the (future) value,"" one airline executive said.
The problems are particularly unsettling for Airbus, which depends on Rolls for all wide-body jets after the A380's demise.
And airlines looking to its flagship A350 or smaller A330neo are asking Airbus for reassurance both about Rolls' engines and its financial position.
While Airbus backs Rolls' technology, it wants ""to understand what is going on with them on everything,"" an industry source said.
Meanwhile at Boeing, many of its 787s had to be grounded due to the Trent 1000 problem, which Rolls says will cost it 2.1 billion pounds to fix in the 2017-2023 period, just as travel demand was surging before the pandemic. 
Boeing, keen to keep its main engine partner GE competitive, is also anxious about Rolls, sources said.
Airbus and Boeing had no comment on supplier discussions.
In response to questions from Reuters, Rolls referred to comments made by Chief Executive Warren East on Dec. 11.
""We can now look forward with confidence that we have sufficient liquidity to get through the crisis, however long it lasts,"" East said of the company's November fundraising. 
LOW FLYING
Without a recovery in engine flying hours, Rolls will struggle for revenue to repair its balance sheet, a pre-requisite for investing in new technology to secure its future and leave its problems behind.
Those troubles stem largely from cracked turbine blades in the Trent 1000 engines used in some twin-aisle jets and Rolls' lack of a presence in single-aisle short-haul models, which are predicted to lift airlines out of the COVID crisis.
Engine makers were locked in a long-running chess game even before the pandemic, which analysts say Rolls entered more dependent on out-of-favour intercontinental jets than its most direct rival  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). 
Now under East, 59, Rolls faces the quest for greener technology without the finances it enjoyed after a stint of state ownership in the 1970s and 1980s.
Rolls has other divisions operating in nuclear and defence that are more resilient and it also hopes to raise more than 2 billion pounds by selling assets in a challenging market.
""He took charge of a tanker that was heading towards an iceberg. And then all of a sudden, the pandemic meant that the ship started going faster,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. 
East, who became CEO in 2015, wants to correct what most see as a mistake in exiting a venture with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus single-aisle jets. Airbus went on to sell 7,455 A320neos with new engines from Pratt or GE/Safran venture CFM.
Rolls is fine-tuning another bet on new engine architecture. Its UltraFan engine will be 25% more efficient than its early Trents by blending innovations in the core and the surrounding flow of cooler air, while being more flexible in size.
Although COVID-19 dented service revenue by speeding the demise of the Airbus A380, it helped Rolls by giving it more time to prepare for the only potentially new project: a possible Boeing 757 replacement that could lay the foundations for a future replacement to the troubled 737 MAX.
Rolls faces the battle of the decade against CFM and Pratt & Whitney to be included if Boeing, looking to put 737 MAX problems behind it, proceeds with any plan to build a new plane.
""If Boeing launches a new aircraft, Rolls has to be on it,"" said an industry source who has studied the mid-market plans.
But Brexit means it could face more competition on its Airbus home market as two opposing fronts, with GE powering most Boeing wide-body jets and Airbus tied to Rolls, start to unwind.
""Brexit provides a convenient break point of strategic thinking,"" said engine industry expert Guy Norris, a senior editor at Aviation Week. ""Rolls could be threatened in their prime (Airbus) spot by a motivated GE."" 
Cemented by joint European research initiatives, Rolls' pairing with Airbus was once so tight that Airbus secretly examined buying it eight years ago, according to people familiar with the aborted study.
CARBON CONUNDRUM
Since a breakthrough in COVID-19 vaccines in November, Rolls' shares have soared on hopes that the worst is behind it but they are still down by half from the beginning of the year.
It said last week the recovery in engine flight hours - the main driver of service revenues - was slowing due to a new wave of COVID-19 infections, and it would burn through 4.2 billion of cash this year, slightly more than it expected in October. 
But East stuck to targets, saying cost cuts were working.
Along with other engine makers it increasingly faces a new problem: how to decarbonize an industry that makes gas turbines.
East has told investors he will stick around to oversee the move to a post-carbon economy, but having resources to invest will depend on asset sales and a wide-body market recovery. 
""Nobody has any idea what's going to be the technology that wins. And so, everyone's going to be throwing mud at the wall and Rolls can't really afford to do that,"" Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham said.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 12:06AM ET</span>",Gucci joins Alibaba's luxury e-commerce site to woo Chinese consumers,"MILAN (Reuters) - Fashion label Gucci will open two flagship stores on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s online luxury shopping platform, underscoring the importance of the Chinese market for high-end brands seeking to reverse a revenue slide due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Gucci, the profit engine of French group  Kering  (PA:PRTP), is one of the most prized names to join the Tmall Luxury Pavilion platform, which was created in 2017 and now boasts more than 200 brands ranging from apparel to high-end cars. 
Gucci's first flagship store, selling fashion and leather goods collections, will open on Dec. 21, the two companies said in a joint statement on Friday. A second store focused on beauty products will launch in February 2021 and will be operated by Gucci's license partner Coty (NYSE:COTY).
China - where consumers shop far more by mobile phone apps than in the United States or Europe - has been a rare bright spot for luxury goods brands this year, with sales surging there since lockdown measures began to ease in the spring.
Chinese customers already represented around 35% of luxury goods purchases before the pandemic and are now expected to account for almost half of global sales of high-end clothes, handbags and jewellery by 2025, according to consultancy Bain.
Luxury brands, which used to be more reticent to sell their products online, have been forced by the pandemic to shift more business on the web, including through third parties. They are also targeting younger consumers who are expected to drive the post-COVID-19 recovery. 
Gucci has its own Chinese website, gucci.cn, and is present on all major Chinese social media platforms, including Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and WeChat. 

Alibaba said Tmall Luxury Pavilion has a consumer base of 750 million people.

Its current capacity is about 7.1 million doses and a new cold storage room will allow for a further 1.5 million doses, Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said in a newsletter on Friday.
Airlines battered by COVID-19 are preparing for key roles in the mass vaccine rollout that promises to unlock an immediate boost for the sector - and beyond that, its own recovery and survival.
""We are the third-largest freight carrier in the world, and with our 20 dedicated freighters and cargo bellies of passenger aircraft supporting our extensive freighter network, we stand ready to assist with what will be the biggest humanitarian response to a situation involving civil aviation that anyone has ever seen,"" Owen said.
Cathay has invested in a new generation track-and-trace system called Ultra Track to allow freight forwarders to monitor the condition of vaccine shipments in real-time.
""We will be offering the service free of charge for any COVID-19 vaccine shipments from all of the vaccine manufacturing centres,"" Owen said.
Ultra Track uses a low-energy Bluetooth transmitter that can record and transmit GPS positions, temperature, vibration and humidity in real-time.
More than half of vaccines go to waste globally every year because of temperature control, logistics and shipment-related issues.

Logistical hurdles are a significant risk for efforts to rapidly distribute COVID-19 vaccines, but they have resulted in booming business for companies that sell technology for monitoring shipments from factory freezer to shot in the arm.

1559,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Mixed as U.S. Stimulus Measures Negotiations Continue,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning as negotiations over the latest U.S. stimulus measures continue in Congress.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.15% by 10:18 PM ET (3:18 AM GMT). The Bank of Japan handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, keeping the interest rate steady at -0.10%.
South Korea’sKOSPI edged up 0.17% while in Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.83%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.66%
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.05% and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.12%.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that a bipartisan U.S. stimulus deal “appears to be close at hand” but will likely require work over the weekend to get through Congress. A $1.4 trillion spending bill for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 must also be passed by Friday to avert a government shutdown.
The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise through the country, prompting some areas to tighten restrictive measures. Congress is under pressure to pass the spending bill and reach a consensus for the latest stimulus measures amid a faltering economic recovery.
The unexpectedly large number of jobless claims over the past week is another reason for the two sides to reach an agreement. The number of claims filed throughout the week rose to 885,000, more than the 800,000 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 862,000 claims filed during the previous week.
Some investors were optimistic about the long-term economic recovery.
The stimulus package “ought to be a sufficient bridge ... that along with at this stage a preparedness for this COVID-19 emergency and the fact that vaccines are ahead by mid-year, would certainly be sufficient to get us through this period of weakness,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Private Bank global investment strategist Steven Wieting told Bloomberg.
Other investors were more cautious in their optimism.
“We are in an environment now where bad news is good news because it means more stimulus. That will have to change, but it is very difficult to know when central banks will stop having their foot to the floor and everyone has to reassess,” ANZ Research chief economist Sharon Zollner told Reuters.
In Europe, leaders are isolating and scrambling to get tested after coming into contact with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has tested positive for COVID-19.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) are continuing to revise information for their COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 after an allergic reaction to the jab was reported in Alaska.
Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is due to meet to discuss emergency use approval for  Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine mRNA-1273. An advisory panel voted 20-0 with one abstention on Thursday to grant the approval.
Across the Atlantic, hopes for a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K. and the European Union after trade talks on Thursday dimmed.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said “big differences” remain between the two sides, particularly on fishing, and that “bridging them will be very challenging.”
Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with von der Leyen on Thursday evening, after which he said the talks were in a “serious situation” and would fail unless the EU softened its stance on fishing, which he described as “not reasonable.”
A spokesman for Johnson added it was “very likely” there would be no agreement unless the bloc changed its position “substantially”.
U.K. chief Brexit negotiator David Frost on his part warned that progress in the talks has been “blocked and time is running out”."

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 08:08PM ET</span>",U.S. FDA advisory panel sets stage for Moderna vaccine authorization,"By Manas Mishra and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) -A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday overwhelmingly endorsed emergency use of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's coronavirus vaccine, virtually assuring a second option for protecting against COVID-19 for a pandemic ravaged nation.
The committee voted 20-0 with one abstention that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks in people aged 18 and older, one week after the same panel backed a similar vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), leading to an FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) a day later.
The FDA is expected to grant the EUA as early as late Thursday or Friday, providing another ray of hope to a nation that has lost more than 300,000 lives to COVID-19 - including a one-day high of 3,580 deaths on Wednesday - while record numbers of patients threaten to overwhelm U.S. hospitals and healthcare workers.
""To go from having a (genetic) sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement,"" said Dr. James Hildreth, chief executive of Meharry Medical College, who voted to recommend the vaccine for emergency use. 
The one abstention came from Dr. Michael Kurilla, who works at the National Institutes of Health and felt blanket authorization for those 18 and older was too broad.
""I'm not convinced that for all of those age groups the benefits do actually outweigh the risk. And I would prefer to see it more targeted towards people at high risk of serious and life threatening COVID disease,"" he said.
The Moderna vaccine is set to begin distribution as soon as the FDA gives the green light. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNBC on Thursday that 5.9 million doses have been allotted for states and large cities and were ready to ship nationwide. 
The vaccines are not a panacea, however, as they will take months to roll out to a nation where the virus is running rampant and public health measures such as social distancing and mask wearing are being rejected by large parts of the population. 
EASIER TO TRANSPORT AND STORE
Unlike Pfizer's vaccine, which comes with complex distribution challenges due to its need to be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), Moderna's vaccine does not require specialized ultra-cold freezers or vast quantities of dry ice, making it easier to supply rural and remote areas.
The company said on Thursday it has expanded the handling guidance for the vaccine to allow it to be moved locally in a liquid state at standard refrigerated temperatures. In some cases, Moderna said, this could be the only practical way to move it to clinics or remote locations.
U.S. officials have said they expect to have 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people. Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in pivotal clinical trials with no serious safety issues.
The first wave of doses are expected to be earmarked for healthcare workers who treat COVID-19 patients and vulnerable residents and staff of nursing homes.
Documents prepared by FDA scientists and released ahead of the meeting, said a two-dose regimen of the Moderna vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19 and did not raise any specific safety issues.
Perhaps even more significant, as hospital intensive care units fill to capacity across the country, there were no cases of severe COVID-19 among those who got the vaccine in the trial versus 30 such cases in the placebo group.
The vaccine, based on the new technology of synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), is administered in two shots about 28 days apart. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot is also an mRNA vaccine.
The United States in August entered a $1.5 billion pact with Moderna to acquire 100 million doses of its vaccine.
About 20 million doses are expected to be delivered this month, with the rest of the initial purchase coming in the first quarter of next year. Last week, Moderna agreed to deliver an additional 100 million doses in the second quarter.
In the global race to produce highly effective vaccines against the coronavirus that emerged in central China late last year, the Massachusetts-based biotech company has reached the finish line ahead of some much larger rivals such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). 
An emergency meeting of a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel is expected to follow the FDA's authorization of Moderna's vaccine with its official recommendation of its use for the U.S. public. 

Following that, state and local public health authorities will begin administering the first doses.

The company, formed by a 46 billion euro ($56 billion) union of France's Essilor and Italy's Luxottica, had given itself until the end of 2020 to find a new CEO - a compromise candidate to appease both sides. 
The firm had even hired headhunters to find external candidates. It declined to comment on Thursday whether that search was still on. 
EssilorLuxottica said French executive vice-chairman Hubert Sagnieres - who under the terms of the merger had been sharing powers with Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder and executive chairman of Luxottica, for the first three years - had decided to relinquish his executive functions.
Del Vecchio would do the same as a result, remaining non-executive chairman, it added. 
Francesco Milleri, originally of Luxottica, will become chief executive with Paul du Saillant, of Essilor, stepping up as deputy CEO, the group said, until its shareholder meeting in 2021. It did not specify what would happen at that stage. 
The merger of the lens and eyewear maker was seen as a smart strategic move by investors, but the integration of the two firms was plagued by tensions over governance, with both sides trading barbs over who was trying to dominate the company. 
Sagnieres said in a statement that governance changes would become ""more fluid"" with the latest shake-up, adding it would help speed up the group's integration.

(Reuters) -The U.S. National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday alleged Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) illegally fired an employee this year who was raising alarm about workplace safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amazon associate Gerald Bryson was helping lead a protest outside a company warehouse in Staten Island, New York on April 6 while off the job, when he got into a dispute with another worker, according to Bryson's attorney Frank Kearl. Amazon later fired Bryson on the grounds he violated its vulgar language policy, Kearl said.
In a statement, Amazon said Bryson was ""witnessed by other employees bullying and intimidating a female associate."" While it respects workers' rights to protest, Amazon said that does not give them impunity when acting wrongly. 
In June, Bryson filed an unfair labor practice charging that Amazon terminated him for protesting work conditions, which is protected under the law. On Thursday, a spokesman for the U.S. NLRB said the case had merit. 
The decision marks at least the second time the Board alleged Amazon has violated labor law during the pandemic, which the company is contesting. It comes at a time of increased organizing at Amazon over work conditions, including a nascent drive to unionize in Alabama.
Amazon now has a chance to settle the charge, potentially reinstating Bryson and offering missed pay, or the Board will bring a case against the company.
""We look forward to sharing the facts on this case before an administrative law judge should the NLRB issue a complaint,"" Amazon said.
The company has taken measures to keep workers safe during the pandemic, including adding temperature checks and requiring social distancing at facilities. Still, more than 19,000 of Amazon's U.S. front-line employees have contracted COVID-19, the company has said, and some staff have demanded warehouse closures. 
Kearl, Bryson's attorney, said, ""Amazon’s goal in firing him was to prevent worker organizing"" and meant Bryson ""had to go through a pandemic without income. The injustice of that is infuriating.""

Investing.com - FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reported Thursday second-quarter results that topped expectations, but the shipping giant refrained from providing guidance amid ongoing uncertainty.
FedEx shares fell 3% after-hours trade following the report.
FedEx announced earnings per share of $4.83 on revenue of $20.60 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $3.93 on revenue of $19.28 billion.
The results were boosted by volume growth and pricing initiatives across all transportation segments though were partially offset by costs to support strong demand and to expand services, the company said.
Looking ahead, the company said it was not providing an earnings forecast for fiscal 2021. ""While the overall environment ""remains uncertain, we expect earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2021 driven by the anticipated heightened demand for our services as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities.""
FedEx said its capital spending forecast for the year remains $5.1 billion.

This year ""Super Saturday"" falls nearly a week before the holiday, giving shoppers a few extra days to complete purchases than they had last year. Many are likely to stick with online purchases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Consumers have embraced an earlier start to the holiday season. They are spreading out their holiday shopping and taking advantage of sales and promotions from retailers in local communities and national brands,"" trade group NRF President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said.

Of those planning to shop on Saturday, 42% intend to do so online only, the retail trade group said.

Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners, expects people to spend $36.1 billion this year on Super Saturday, up from the $34.4 billion they spent last year. These estimates include in-store and online purchases but exclude sales generated at gas stations, restaurants and automobile dealers. In comparison, Black Friday generated $29.7 billion in sales this year, he said.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite reached new records on Thursday as Congress inched closer to agreement on a $900 billion economic rescue package.
Talks on Capitol Hill continued after new data showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment assistance jumped to a three-month high last week, well above estimates.
Weakness in the labor market, combined with new business shutdowns across the nation to stop the spread of the coronavirus, is putting even more pressure on lawmakers to get a stimulus deal done before they leave for the holiday break.
Vaccines continue to be delivered despite a storm that blanketed the Northeast U.S. with heavy snow, with some parts of central New York buried under three feet of it. The Food and Drug Administration could approve Moderna’s vaccine by Friday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings from Darden and  Nike  
The service industry has been hardest-hit by the pandemic, as businesses were forced to close or restrict occupancy to slow the spread of the virus. But some are doing better than others. Darden Restaurants Inc (NYSE:DRI), owner of the Olive Garden chain and others, is expected to report earnings per share of 71 cents on sales of $1.7 billion.
At the same time, casual and athletic apparel brands have done well as shut-in consumers shopped online for shoes and exercise clothing. Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) is expected to report EPS of 62 cents on revenue of $10.5 billion.
2. Next up for vaccines
Investors cheered last week when the FDA approved a vaccine by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) for emergency use, and that vaccine has since rolled out and been put to use. On Friday,  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) steps into the spotlight.
The Cambridge, Mass., drug maker traded up 5% on Thursday in anticipation of an FDA announcement. The shares are up 634% this year.
3. A Fed official scheduled to speak
The Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard is scheduled to speak Friday at 11:00 AM ET (1500 GMT) on the topic of climate change and financial regulation. The appearance is hosted by the Center for American Progress.
Brainard has been an outspoken proponent of extra stimulus to support households and businesses, urging Congress to act quickly. This week, the Fed left interest rates alone and said it would support the economy until the recovery is complete.

The company in August said it was offering voluntary separation packages to 4,000 workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, as it looked to streamline itself while its sales were taking a hit from the health crisis.
Coca-Cola said on Thursday it will not disclose the number of employees who have accepted the package. It also did not give details about the timeline for the job cuts. 
The news of job cuts come as millions of Americans are already stuck on unemployment benefits as a relentless wave of new COVID-19 infections hobble business operations.
""The pandemic was not a cause for these changes, but it has been a catalyst for the company to move faster,"" Coca-Cola said in an emailed statement.
It had about 86,200 employees at the end of last year, of which 10,400 were located in the United States.

(Reuters) - A former  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc trader has avoided prison after being convicted of lying to customers about bond prices, in a defeat for U.S. prosecutors in their largely unsuccessful eight-year crackdown on improper sales tactics.
Michael Gramins, 38, was sentenced on Thursday to two years probation by U.S. District Judge Robert Chatigny in Hartford, Connecticut.
The sentence means prosecutors failed to win convictions and prison terms that survived the appeals process against any of the eight traders criminally charged with cheating customers on bond trades following the 2008 financial crisis.
Jesse Litvak, formerly of Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Group and the only other trader convicted, had his conviction overturned in May 2018.
Gramins was accused of lying and training subordinates to lie to asset managers, hedge funds and insurers in the ""opaque"" residential mortgage-backed securities market.
Prosecutors said Gramins induced customers to buy bonds at inflated prices or sell bonds at depressed prices, hoping to boost Nomura's profit and his own pay.
Chatigny, however, said that while Gramins ""lied time after time, transaction after transaction, spanning a long period of time, ... his conduct was aberrational.""
The judge also said the married father of two had been punished ""severely"" enough, including losing his career in financial services, without the ""substantial"" prison term prosecutors sought.
Gramins' lawyer Marc Mukasey said in an email: ""We are thrilled with the judge's decision. Justice prevails."" 
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut declined to comment.
Jurors convicted Gramins in June 2017 on a conspiracy count, while acquitting him or deadlocking on eight other counts.
Chatigny set aside the conviction a year later, finding that some testimony had been improper. The federal appeals court in Manhattan reinstated the conviction in Sept. 2019.
Without admitting wrongdoing, Nomura agreed in July 2019 to pay $26.5 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges over its supervision of Gramins and other traders.
The case is U.S. v. Gramins, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 15-cr-00155.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) has agreed to pay $22 million to resolve U.S. allegations that it illegally used two charities that help cover Medicare patients' out-of-pocket drug costs as a means to pay them kickbacks to use its multiple sclerosis drugs.
The deal, announced by the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday, was the latest to result from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers' financial support of patient assistance charities that has resulted in more than $1.04 billion in settlements.
A specialty pharmacy that performed services for the Biogen, Advanced Care Scripts, will also pay $1.4 million to resolve claims it conspired to help it use the charities to pay kickbacks to patients taking the MS drugs Avonex and Tysabri.
Neither Biogen nor ACS admitted wrongdoing. Biogen said it believed its conduct was appropriate but entered into the deal to put the investigation behind it. ACS' lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.
But the government has alleged that various pharmaceutical companies used such charities as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.
The investigation came amid heightened attention to rising drug prices. Co-pays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine's cost. 
The government alleged that Biogen from 2011 to 2013 used the foundations Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund, and The Assistance Fund as conduits to pay thousands of patients' co-pay obligations.

Good Days and TAF in 2019 paid $2 million $4 million, respectively, to resolve similar allegations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) should voluntarily take action immediately to better vet paid-for promotions for financial products, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday after a damning report on the watchdog's handling of a collapsed fund.
Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said Google should make checks with regulators to see whether potential advertisers had already been shut down in some other guise, before promotions are posted online.
""We believe some considerable effort could be put in to deal with how these are screened before they are allowed to advertise, with cross referencing with data bases that we run and international regulators run as well,"" Rathi told Reuters.
""There are steps that can be taken now,"" he said.
Rathi has met Google twice since taking office in October.
""There is a constructive discussion going on. I think what's important is action in this online space as well,"" he said.
Google said it has robust financial products and services policies, and this year added a requirement for some advertisers who promote financial services in Britain to complete a business operations verification programme, when requested by Google.
Google said it has also recently updated policies to restrict the rates of return a firm can advertise and ban the use of terms that make unrealistic claims.
The FCA and Rathi's predecessor, now Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, were heavily criticised on Thursday in a report into the watchdog's ""failures"" in handling London Capital & Finance, an investment fund that collapsed last year.
LCF was regulated by the FCA and used Google to promote unregulated mini-bonds in a ""misleading"" way, the report ordered by the finance ministry said.
The FCA had told LCF in 2017 that its website and sponsored Google promotions were misleading, and also failed to contain a ""capital at risk"" warning, the report said.
But it was not until December 2018 that the FCA ordered LCF to withdraw all existing marketing for bonds, and the company collapsed a month later.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen said he will now consider whether paid-for advertising on online platforms should be regulated by rules on financial promotions.
Glen said that fraudulent online advertising could be designated as a ""priority harm"" under planned new laws on online content, meaning it would be policed by the FCA.
FCA Chair Charles Randell said the consumer investment market needs a careful review to spell out where investors are protected.

""In the long term, there is clearly a fundamental change in our society and in the way people engage with decisions, particularly online and the government recognises that,"" Randell said.

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Sacklers apologize but deflect blame at U.S. congressional opioid hearing,"By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Two members of the wealthy Sackler family who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP offered apologies on Thursday for the role the prescription painkiller has played in the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic but sought to deflect personal responsibility in response to withering criticism from lawmakers.
Testifying remotely during a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee, David and Kathe Sackler, both of whom previously served on Purdue's board, insisted they were assured by management that the company was meeting regulatory and legal requirements as the opioid crisis unfolded.
The two, among several Sackler family members with ownership interests in Purdue, agreed to testify only after the committee's chairwoman, Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, threatened subpoenas.
""Watching you testify makes my blood boil,"" Democratic Representative Jim Cooper told David Sackler. ""I'm not sure that I'm aware of any family in America that's more evil than yours.""
Cooper was among the committee members who directed fury at the Sacklers for reaping billions of dollars from Purdue as Americans became addicted to opioids. The lawmakers compared them to imprisoned Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and showed slides of expensive real estate holdings.
""What you've heard from the press about the Sacklers is almost certainly wrong and highly distorted,"" David Sackler testified. ""We also fully acknowledge that there is an opioid crisis that has ruined too many lives, and that OxyContin addiction and abuse played a role in that. We are truly sorry to everyone who's lost a family member or suffered from the scourge of addiction."" 
But Sackler said he acted legally and ethically while on Purdue's board. 
His cousin, Kathe Sackler, detailed her experience losing a 23-year-old brother to suicide. As a mother, she said, her ""heart breaks"" for parents who have lost children to opioids. 
""It distresses me greatly and angers me greatly that the medication that was developed to help people ... has become associated with so much human suffering,"" she said. ""I am happy to apologize to the American people.""
'I HAVE STRUGGLED'
Maloney asked her whether she would apologize for her personal role in the epidemic.
""I have struggled with that question. I have tried to figure out: Is there anything that I could have done differently knowing what I knew then, not what I know now?"" Kathe Sackler responded. 
""There's nothing that I can find that I would have done differently based on what I believed and understood then, and what I learned from management in the reports to the board, and what I learned from my colleagues on the board,"" she added.
The hearing began with family members of opioid victims sharing stories of personal loss, including the father of an 18-year-old woman on the cusp of attending college who took one OxyContin pill and died.
Under a settlement with the Justice Department, Purdue pleaded guilty in November to criminal charges for misconduct with its opioids and agreed to more than $8 billion in penalties that will mostly go unpaid. Sackler family members agreed to pay $225 million to settle civil claims they disputed. Neither they, nor other individuals, were criminally charged.
The opioid epidemic has claimed the lives of roughly 450,000 Americans since 1999 due to overdoses from prescription painkillers and illegal substances such as heroin and fentanyl.
Purdue reaped more than $30 billion from opioid sales over the years that enriched Sackler family members, and it funneled illegal kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies, investigations have found. The drugmaker, which filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and its Sackler family owners are in discussions to settle thousands of lawsuits from U.S. communities seeking to hold alleged perpetrators responsible for fueling the epidemic. 
Purdue Chief Executive Craig Landau, an anesthesiologist, also testified at the hearing, noting his work treating pain, including with troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of the U.S. Army Reserve. He expressed contrition and pointed to Purdue's guilty pleas. 
Lawmakers pressed the Sacklers on more than $10 billion that Purdue transferred over the course of a decade, much of which went to family members. 
Maloney cited a 2007 email from David Sackler, a week after a Purdue affiliate pleaded guilty to misbranding OxyContin, in which he questioned whether the family's wealth would withstand possible future litigation. 
David Sackler said he was unaware then that Purdue and family members would face the opioid litigation barrage that later materialized. 
""No,"" David Sackler responded when Maloney asked whether the family was cashing out, leaving less money for plaintiffs in opioid lawsuits.
""I also am very angry,"" Kathe Sackler said. ""I'm angry that some people at Purdue broke the law. I'm angry about it from 2007 and I'm angry about it now, again, in 2020.""
Representative James Comer, the committee's top Republican, emphasized he was pro-business. 
""But there are bad actors,"" Comer said. ""And to the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, let me be as clear as I can be: You all are bad actors. And there is no excuse for what you did.""

(Corrects to say Purdue CEO Craig Landau, not Kathe Sackler, is an anesthesiologist who treated wounded U.S. service members, paragraphs 8 and 17)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two top U.S. Senators on Thursday said they were seeking answers on whether the recent hacking attack against the federal government compromised U.S. taxpayers' data, which could make millions of Americans more vulnerable to identity theft and other crimes.
As officials continued to assess damage from the cyberattack, U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden asked the Internal Revenue Service whether the tax agency was affected and, if so, what it was doing to mitigate the fallout and protect against further intrusions.
The sweeping campaign, done by hackers believed to be working for Russia, leveraged technology from SolarWinds Corp used by multiple U.S. government agencies and other businesses, Reuters has reported.
The U.S. government has not publicly identified who might be behind the massive intrusion, and several U.S. lawmakers on Thursday said it appeared that U.S. officials were still analyzing the impact of the attack.
""I think the government is still assessing how bad the damage is,"" Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told MSNBC in an interview.
Grassley and Wyden, in their letter, sought an immediate briefing from IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig on the impact to U.S. taxpayers, whose sensitive financial records are filed each year with the agency. 
The IRS has used SolarWinds technology as recently as 2017, they said. 

""Given the extreme sensitivity of personal taxpayer information entrusted to the IRS, and the harm both to Americans’ privacy and our national security that could result from the theft and exploitation of this data by our adversaries, it is imperative that we understand the extent to which the IRS may have been compromised,"" the senators wrote.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Column: Six Social Security fixes that should be on Biden’s agenda next year,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden will be plenty busy battling the pandemic when he takes office next month, and Social Security will likely not be on top of his agenda. But nudging higher reforms for Social Security, our most important retirement program, would be a very smart move.
The role of this safety net has never been more important as the country attempts to dig out from the COVID-19 disaster. Here are six Social Security moves the new president and Congress should make.
ADDRESS SOLVENCY
Social Security’s long-term solvency already was eroding before the pandemic, and that has accelerated a bit due to the economic downturn and accompanying slump in revenue from the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) - better known as the payroll tax. Social Security’s actuary now projects that the combined retirement and disability trust funds will be “exhausted” in 2034 - a term referencing the point when reserve funds will be gone. That is one year earlier than the last projection by Social Security’s trustees, before the pandemic began.
At the point of exhaustion, Social Security would have sufficient income from current tax payments to meet roughly 80% of promised benefits. And the exhaustion date could come sooner, depending on the length and depth of the recession.
As a candidate, Biden issued a detailed plan for Social Security that addresses the solvency problem by adding a new tier of FICA contributions for high earners. Currently, workers and employers split a 12.4% FICA tax, levied on income up to $137,700 (In 2021, the cap will be adjusted for inflation to $142,800). Biden would add a new tax at the same rate on incomes over $400,000. 
Biden stayed away from any broad-based FICA tax hike, which would allow lawmakers to avoid political flak for raising taxes on people with less-than-stratospheric incomes - but his plan extends solvency only until 2040. It would be good to go further, but that would probably need a new source of revenue - for example, a tax on Wall Street or fossil fuels. That seems sensible but unlikely to me. 
IMPROVE BENEFIT ADEQUACY
The economic devastation wrought by COVID-19 makes expansion of Social Security benefits more critical than ever. Biden has proposed a series of moderate expansions that should be passed into law. They include crediting caregivers in their benefits for time spent out of the workforce - a change that would especially benefit women, who already face a substantial retirement gender gap https://nyti.ms/3mk50h5. He also would expand benefits for widows and seniors who had collected payments for 20 years. 
Biden also favors shifting to a more generous yardstick for determining Social Security’s annual cost-of-living adjustment.
REOPEN FIELD OFFICES - SAFELY
The Social Security Administration’s vast network of field offices has been closed since March due to the pandemic, with most staff operating virtually. As the pandemic recedes, it will be critical to reopen the offices safely from a health perspective, with a priority on offices that serve lower-income workers who are less likely to interact with the agency online.
Reopening could present opportunities for modernization of the offices. “You could really transform the offices to make them green from an environmental perspective and safe,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group that recently published a set of transition recommendations https:// for the new administration. 
REVERSE TIGHTENING OF DISABILITY RULES
The new administration should move quickly to reverse -wherever possible - steps the Trump administration has taken through rulemaking to make it tougher to file for, and receive, Social Security disability benefits. That is especially wrongheaded as evidence grows that many COVID-19 victims will suffer long-term effects from the disease https://reut.rs/2KadgmR that will leave them unable to work and in need of Social Security income. 
FIX THE COVID 'NOTCH'
Pandemic-driven job loss has created a technical glitch that threatens unwarranted benefit cuts for workers who turn 60 this year. 
Benefits are based on each worker’s earnings history, indexed to reflect growth in the aggregate of all national wages. But aggregate wages will fall substantially this year due to job loss in the pandemic - an unusual situation that the Social Security system is not built to accommodate. The indexing is done in the year you turn 60, which is why this age group would suffer a singular hit. Social Security’s actuaries estimated earlier this year that someone expecting an initial benefit of $2,000 per month next year would receive roughly $119 less as a result of the “notch.”
The most sensible fix also is simple. Congress should put a floor underneath the system’s indexing of earnings - similar to the hold-harmless provision for cost-of-living adjustments - to ensure that the aggregate wage calculation cannot decrease benefits.
FIX THE FICA MESS
President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum https://reut.rs/2KtBGay in August ordering the deferral of FICA taxes through year-end as an economic stimulus measure. This was an ineffective idea from the start, since it provided tax relief to employed people, not those who have lost jobs and need disaster relief. And most employers wanted nothing to do with it, since it created a liability that would have to be repaid later through a temporary doubling of tax liabilities for workers and employers. 
Lacking federal guidance, very few private-sector employers implemented the plan - but it was enforced by the federal government. That means federal workers will see a sudden bump in their taxes starting in January.
Biden could reduce the impact with an executive order that spreads out the repayments over a longer period of time.
A much broader set of retirement policy reform also awaits action. But Social Security was designed to meet moments like this one. The opportunity to put the program to good use should not be wasted.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",COVID vaccine is bonanza for digital supply chain tracking industry,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - More than half of vaccines go to waste globally every year because of temperature control, logistics and shipment-related issues.
Logistical hurdles are a significant risk for efforts to rapidly distribute COVID-19 vaccines, but they have resulted in booming business for companies such as private California-based Cloudleaf, Germany's SAP SE (DE:SAPG) and others that sell technology for monitoring shipments from factory freezer to shot in the arm.
Cloudleaf, backed by Intel Capital, the venture arm of chipmaker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), uses sensors attached to material containers to track the location, temperature, humidity, vibration and acceleration.
The sensors send data to the cloud, where an artificial intelligence algorithm can predict if action is needed to prevent a product from becoming exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range, known as excursions.
Cloudleaf Chief Executive Mahesh Veerina said orders have jumped 500% this year. To keep pace, the company had to expand its workforce and increase capital spending by as much as 80%. He expects a similar growth in capital spending in 2021.
""I have CEOs calling and saying 'Hey, can we get this up in the next 4-5 weeks'?"" Veerina said. 
The booming business has also increased the need for fresh capital. Cloudleaf has raised millions of dollars this year and has plans to raise ""very significant"" amounts of capital next year too, Veerina said.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech's vaccine must be shipped and stored at ultra-cold temperatures or on dry ice and can only last at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days. 
In contrast,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's vaccine, which is expected to receive U.S. regulatory authorization as soon as Friday, can be kept in a regular refrigerator for up to a month.
These varying requirements have increased the risks of logistical mishaps. 
A quarter of all vaccines are degraded by the time they arrive at their destination due to incorrect shipping procedures, according to the International Air Transport Association. Losses associated with temperature excursions in the healthcare industry are estimated at about $35 billion annually.
Given the scale and the magnitude of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the losses could be significantly higher in 2021, analysts said.
At least two trays of COVID-19 vaccine doses delivered in California needed to be replaced after their storage temperatures dipped below minus 80 Celsius (minus 112 Fahrenheit), U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on Wednesday.
Blockchain and sensor-enabled cold chain monitoring tools can help reduce the losses as well as mitigate the risks of theft or counterfeiting of the vaccines.
Moderna is using SAP's digital solutions to help serialize and distribute its vaccine. The applications are designed to prevent counterfeit medicines and enable collaboration with contract manufacturers and wholesalers.
BOOMING DEMAND
Similarly, Israeli startup Varcode, which makes smart tags that measure time and temperature, and can track and trace products throughout the supply chain, has seen a multifold jump in orders. 
Before the pandemic, the orders for Varcode's tags would range between 100,000 to 1 million units. Since the middle of this year, Chief Executive Joe Battoe said some of the companies involved in the vaccine distribution have been asking for billions of tags. This, in turn, has led to a 200% increase in Varcode's capital spending this year.
Battoe said the pandemic had ""been good for our business.""
Varcode's low-cost cloud-based, blockchain-enabled technology not only sends out alerts when a product goes outside its prescribed temperature range, but also captures the cumulative time that the product has been outside of the temperature range.
Its smart tags are serialized and need just a smart phone to scan them. Every scan leaves a digital trail, reducing the risks of theft or counterfeiting.
The tags can track individual vials, making them a better fit for the vaccine distribution in small and rural areas which may require fewer than the minimum order of doses.
Varcode's tags are produced in Israel. The soaring demand, however, has prompted Varcode to invest in a unique printer and an applicator that would generate the tags on site where the vaccines are being manufactured and apply them to carts going down the conveyor belt in real time.

Battoe reckons the $5 billion global cold chain monitoring technology market could grow 50% next year, thanks to the vaccine rollout.
""I don't think we would be garnering the attention ... had it not been for the scale and the sensitivity of these vaccines,"" Battoe said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google won EU antitrust approval on Thursday for its $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) after agreeing restrictions on how it will use customers' health related data.
The deal had triggered criticism from privacy advocates on both sides of the Atlantic, consumer organisations and Google rivals about the company's market power and the use of people's health data in targeted advertising.
Fitbit, once the leader in the wearable devices market, has lost market share to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei in recent years.
The European Commission said it had agreed concessions with Google, valid for 10 years with the possibility of another 10-year extension, addressing competition concerns, confirming a Reuters story in October.
Google will store Fitbit user data separately from Google data used for advertising, and will not use data from Fitbit and other wearable devices for Google Ads. Users can decide whether to store their health data in their Google or Fitbit account.
The tech giant will maintain access to users' health and fitness data to software applications through Fitbit Web API software, without charging for access and subject to user consent.
It will continue to provide a free API software license for core functionalities to Android device makers, allowing their gadgets to function with Android smartphones.

Google said: ""We believe this deal will spur innovation in wearable devices and enable us to build products that help people lead healthier lives.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, focusing on the prospect of a stimulus package from Congress rather than on signs of a further slowdown in the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both hit new record highs against a backdrop of reports suggesting that Congress would pass a package including direct checks to household and a limited enhancement of unemployment benefits to mitigate the effects of the latest wave of the pandemic, which has notched successive records for deaths and hospitalizations over recent days and weeks.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152 points, or 0.5% at 30,307 points. The S&P 500 was likewise up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Earlier, the Labor Department had reported that initial jobless claims rose to a new three-month high last week at 885,000, defying expectations for an improvement to 800,000.
The market interpreted the news as likely to focus lawmakers’ minds on completing a stimulus package likely to be worth around $750 billion.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said the package was essentially an ‘automatic stabilizer’ along European lines, and more to be viewed as an ‘anti-depressant’ than as a stimulant.
Among early movers was home builder  Lennar 's (NYSE:LEN) stock, which shot 9.3% higher on the back of a better-than-expected quarterly update that was also buttressed by more strong data from the housing market. 
Housing starts rose 1.2% in November to their highest since the pandemic erupted, driven mainly by the construction of multi-family homes. Building permits, meanwhile, rose to their highest in over a decade, as urban professionals continue to look for bigger premises outside of city centers. 
Also moving sharply was Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) stock, which soared 29% after the pharmacy chain reported a much better-than-expected third-quarter profit and said it now expects to be profitable for the full year. 
Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock meanwhile rose 6.4% after it resolved a long-running dispute with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) unit HBO Max over running the latter's content on its streaming devices. The news was followed by a number brokerage upgrades. It means HBO Max will run on its devices from Thursday.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock meanwhile rose 4.5% after it signed a preliminary deal for 200 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, pending authorization from the regulators.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>",Climate change turns up the heat on ad industry,"By Andrew R.C. Marshall, Valerie Volcovici and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - The avuncular man in the TV ad has an urgent-sounding message from his employer, the oil giant  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
""I think renewable energy is vital to our planet,"" says the man, identified only as an environmental expert called Steve. ""At Chevron we're investing millions in solar and biofuels technology to make it work."" He adds that the energy can be made widely available and the work needs to begin “right now.” 
What Steve doesn't mention, according to three U.S. lawsuits alleging deceptive advertising, is that Chevron is overwhelmingly focused on fossil fuel extraction and its investment in renewables remains miniscule compared to the billions it spends each year on drilling for oil and gas. 
Critics have long attacked the oil industry for ad campaigns that they call ""greenwashing"" - telling people that policies or products are more environmentally friendly than they really are. But the ad agencies behind the campaigns have largely escaped scrutiny.
That's changing, as the issue of climate change shoots up the global agenda. Climate activists and some ad industry figures are calling on agencies to declare or dump their Big Oil clients.
Recent lawsuits by four U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a city allege “greenwashing"" by oil companies, accusing them of making ""misleading and deceptive"" claims. The suits don’t name the ad agencies as defendants, but do single out at least 15 campaigns. As a result, the companies could face embarrassment or become embroiled in the litigation. 
Sean Corey, a Chevron spokesman, said such lawsuits are ""meritless"" and ""serve only to divert attention and resources away from the collaborative, international efforts that are critical to developing a meaningful solution to climate change."" 
Pressure has been building against oil and gas companies in recent years to address dangerously rising global temperatures. The companies, which rank among the world's worst polluters, have been targeted by protests outside their offices and seen sponsorship deals with museums, art galleries and others canceled in the United States and Europe.
A prominent climate protest group, Extinction Rebellion, last year unfurled a banner reading ""TELL THE TRUTH"" outside the advertising industry's top awards ceremony in Cannes, France. Activists in the Netherlands and other European countries are campaigning for a tobacco-style ban on fossil fuel advertising.
All these pressures will likely intensify after the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has vowed to get tough on climate change. 
Most major advertising companies with fossil fuel clients, and the U.S. ad industry's leading trade group, declined to comment for this story or did not respond to requests for comment. However, in a statement, WPP Plc (LON:WPP), the world's largest advertising and public relations holding company, defended its practices.
""WPP recognises the importance of its role in addressing climate change by applying rigorous standards to the content we produce and helping clients to accelerate the world's transition to a lower-carbon economy,"" the agency said. A spokeswoman also said the company ""will not undertake work which is intended or designed to mislead.""
WPP did not handle the ad featuring Steve, formally known as ""We Agree."" That ad is part of a global campaign created in 2010 by New York-based agency Dentsu McGarryBowen LLC. Jennifer Ferguson, a spokeswoman for McGarryBowen's holding company, Dentsu Group Inc, declined to comment.
'A SEA CHANGE' 
Delaware, along with Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, the District of Columbia and the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, are suing key players in the oil industry for violating consumer protection laws with the help of ""greenwashing"" ad campaigns. 
The new scrutiny of advertising campaigns raises the prospect that ad agencies could see their names dragged into litigation along with their oil company clients, said Karen Sokol, an environmental law professor at Loyola University New Orleans.
Sokol said that similar lawsuits against the tobacco industry brought to light information on the role of advertisers and PR companies in deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking. 
In 1997, R.J. Reynolds tobacco company agreed to pay $10 million to settle a lawsuit over a campaign for its Camel brand, which was accused of targeting children. The ""Joe Camel"" campaign was executed by large advertising firms that also were sued.
Ultimately, Sokol said, details about advertising and marketing practices that emerged during litigation against the tobacco industry contributed to the companies' decision in the late 1990s to pay billions of dollars annually in a massive settlement with the vast majority of U.S. states and territories.
""There was a sea change in how we viewed tobacco products after we learned about that industry's disinformation,"" she said. ""We're on the cusp of that with climate.""
Others predict that Big Oil’s message makers will likely avoid costly courtroom verdicts. Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in climate change, among other things, said it was unlikely that ad firms would be held liable for misleading communications by fossil fuel companies. That’s because the primary duty of those firms is to their clients, the companies, and not to the public, he said.
However, he added, given the ""existential stakes"" of climate change, advertisers likely won't escape being sued in the first place. ""I fully expect that advertising/PR firms, bankers, insurers, accountants, lawyers, and other professionals that support fossil fuel companies, will increasingly find themselves targeted by lawsuits and pressure campaigns.""
'CREATIVITY HAS CONSEQUENCES'
The picture is different in Europe, where regulators have taken action against a number of ad campaigns by oil companies.
In 2019, for instance, the UK advertising watchdog upheld a complaint against an ad by Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) that suggested gas was a ""low carbon"" energy source. In January, Italy's competition authority slapped state-backed energy giant Eni SpA with a €5 million ($6.10 million) fine for ads claiming that its diesel was ""green"" and helped the environment.
In the United States, ad agencies face a more immediate worry.
Several current and former ad executives and industry experts say advertisers for fossil fuel companies face a big challenge in appealing to young people, who polls show are far more concerned about global warming than their elders. In addition, some say, agencies with oil industry clients face a struggle to recruit talented young people with climate concerns.
Ad agency staff ""are forced to treat all clients as equal,"" said Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra, a mid-sized advertising firm based in London. ""But for the best young talent that simply isn't good enough anymore. They know that creativity has consequences, so our industry cannot be neutral.""
Futerra has set up an initiative in which agencies voluntarily declare what proportion of their revenue comes from so-called ""high-carbon"" clients, including not just Big Oil but also the aviation, automobile, concrete and plastics industries. 
Futerra disclosed in 2019 that 1% of its revenue was generated by clients involved in plastics or aviation, but otherwise had no high-carbon clients. 
Her firm and 244 small to mid-size agencies have signed on to the initiative, she said. 
The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, criticized the spate of recent efforts to get advertising firms to ditch the oil and gas industry, saying that they were ""divisive"" and ""unfounded.""
""We are focused on being part of the solution, and we welcome debate on the best ways to innovate for a cleaner, reliable and affordable energy future,"" said API spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt.
Together with their subsidiaries, the Big Four advertising companies - WPP, Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC), Publicis Groupe and Interpublic Group of Companies (NYSE:IPG) - handle the accounts of many major oil companies. The accounts provide much-needed income for an ad industry financially devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.
WPP and IPG told Reuters they would not disclose their client lists. Omnicom and Publicis didn't respond to a request for comment. 
'THE CLARION CALL' 
Despite financial strains exacerbated by the pandemic, the oil industry's spending on advertising and PR will continue, or perhaps rise, as it fights tougher climate-related regulations and shrinking social acceptance in many countries, ad industry experts told Reuters.
""Over the past thirty years, the major oil companies have ramped up their PR activities whenever it appears that the government is considering regulation of their activities,"" said Bob Brulle, Visiting Professor of Environment and Society at Brown University in Rhode Island. ""It is quite predictable that this will occur as the Biden administration starts acting to control carbon emissions.""
The suits by Delaware and Hoboken cite four WPP campaigns for fossil fuel companies as ""misleading"" or ""greenwashing."" 
WPP, which is not named as a defendant, declined to comment on the lawsuits.
WPP's website publishes an emphatic statement in favor of addressing climate change by its subsidiary, Ogilvy Consulting. ""As industry leaders, we must be the clarion call,” said the article. ""We must act now.""
Those actions included helping its clients from the energy sector ""accelerate the world's transition to a lower-carbon economy,"" WPP told Reuters.
Christine Arena, CEO of Generous, an ad agency in San Francisco, said big agencies were positioning themselves as saviors of the climate while representing companies accused of wrecking it. In 2015, Arena was one of four executives who left a large U.S. public relations firm to protest its representation of oil companies.
""We're at the point where you can no longer play both sides credibly or with impunity,"" she said.

1597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",BlackRock Sees ‘Advantageous’ Trade in Dividend Stocks Next Year,"(Bloomberg) -- The stocks that appeal to investors looking for a steady stream of income are back in favor and may continue to beat bonds in a world of historically low rates, according to BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
After several companies cut or suspended their dividends earlier in the year and “arguably scared investors away,” expectations for payments have stabilized, said Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. fundamental active equity at the world’s biggest asset manager. That’s good news for high-dividend firms at a time when interest rates around the globe are set to stay low for longer, he added.
“Investors will increasingly come to the view that it’s not only safe but advantageous to return to dividend payers,” said DeSpirito, who oversees $137.3 billion in assets at the New York-based firm. “Company dividends are likely to provide better income than bonds for some time.”
While the firm doesn’t disclose its top picks for next year, it lists  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). among BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund’s largest holdings as of Nov. 30.
Investors seeking reliable income have been coping with anemic bond rates amid easy monetary policy and unprecedented support from central banks during a pandemic that’s ravaged the global economy. Dividend stocks are among the opportunities to add yield to portfolios, UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note to clients. While rates on 10-year Treasuries are below 1%, the S&P 500 Utilities Index is on track to pay a dividend yield of about 3.4% this year.
After dipping to $39.05 a share in early April, the amount of dividends expected from S&P 500 companies this year has jumped to $57.95 a share. That’s encouraging, especially when it comes to companies that typically don’t show rapid growth, but offer higher cash payouts.
The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index -- consisting of companies that have increased payouts for at least 25 straight years -- has climbed about 65% since the market bottomed in March. That’s in line with the advance in the American stock benchmark. However, they’ve lagged behind high-flying technology companies that are flush with cash and can thrive even during challenging economic times. The NYSE FANG+ Index of giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). has soared over 125% in the span.
While the economic rebound is still struggling amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases and threats of tougher restrictions, prospects for fresh stimulus combined with the vaccine rollout could help spur a rotation from megacap tech shares into other companies.
Investors have recently tiptoed back into value stocks -- those that typically trade at low prices relative to their earnings. As the economy gets out of a rut, those companies could enjoy a larger bounce, DeSpirito said. In addition, many of the Covid-19 beneficiaries are low-dividend payers, and that creates a gap for “dividend growers to fill,” he added.

1598,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Up 130 Pts as Stimulus Confidence Rises,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, continuing the recent strong rally as confidence grows about the economic recovery with another Covid relief package likely and the Federal Reserve remaining very accommodative.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 130 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 19 points, or 0.5%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 62 points, or 0.5%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 cash index are on course for their third positive week in four and the Nasdaq Composite its fourth weekly gain in five, closing Wednesday at another record high.
U.S. lawmakers appear to be closing in on a $900 billion coronavirus relief deal to help boost the country’s economy with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases causing many businesses to shut down again.
“We made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief package that would be able to pass both chambers with bipartisan majorities,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday, after prolonged negotiations between the congressional leaders of both parties.
The legislation is expected to include $600 to $700 stimulus checks, extend unemployment benefits, help pay for vaccine distribution and to also assist small businesses.
The Federal Reserve, for its part, promised on Wednesday to continue its bond-buying program until “substantial further progress” has been made in restoring full employment and hitting its 2% inflation target.
The Covid-19 continued to claim victims throughout the country, with Wednesday seeing the highest number of new cases, 244,365, as well as a record number of deaths, 3,607, nearly 500 more than the previous high.
Vice President Mike Pence and President-elect Joe Biden are set to get the vaccine in the coming days to try and boost public support, while French President Emmanuel Macron became the latest high-profile person to test positive for the virus. 
In the corporate sector, quarterly earnings are expected from FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which must be enjoying the holiday shipping rush, as well as pharmacy retailing giant Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corporation and food retailer  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS). 
November data for building permits and housing starts are scheduled for release later Thursday, along with jobless claims figures and an update from the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index.
Oil prices surged Thursday, hitting a nine month-high after government data showed a fall in official U.S. oil inventories of 3.1 million barrels last week, suggesting demand remained resilient despite the surge in Covid-19 cases.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $47.98 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.3% to $51.22. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since early March.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,881.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2237.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",EU watchdog sets out 'evolutionary' change to insurance capital rules,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's capital rules for insurers need changing to reflect low interest rates and the need stronger supervisory powers to tackle risks, the bloc's insurance watchdog said on Thursday.
The EU is reviewing its Solvency II capital requirements for insurers that were introduced in 2016.
""EIOPA proposes changes in several areas but with balanced overall impact on insurers. This reflects the fact that Solvency II is overall working well,"" the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) said in a statement.
It will be up to the EU's executive European Commission to make proposals for legislative changes, which would need approval from EU member states and the European Parliament.
EIOPA said that national supervisors in the EU27 should have powers to impose a capital surcharge on insurers to cover systemic risk, and to impose additional measures such as a ban on dividends to preserve an insurer's financial position.
There were areas of ""significant concern"" that need addressing in the review as cuts in interest rates to mitigate the economic hit from COVID-19 has sent almost the entire euro swap curve into negative territory.
Insurers use rate curves to assess their liabilities and hence capital requirements.
""EIOPA's advice is that it is essential to recognise this economic picture in Solvency II,"" the watchdog said.

Although the electric carmaker’s eye-watering rally has pushed its shares near 170 times the consensus 2021 earnings estimate, its addition will only have a minimal impact on the benchmark’s valuations because of a nuance in index metric calculations, confounding the “instinctive conclusion” of many investors, Goldman strategists led by David J. Kostin wrote in a Dec. 16 note.
Tesla shares have surged 644% this year, pushing the company’s market value close to $600 billion, of which about 80% is floating. And although S&P 500 constituents are weighted according to their free float cap, index metrics conventionally treat the benchmark as an aggregate of its individual constituents rather than a cap-weighted average, according to Goldman.
“Given Tesla’s large size and elevated multiple, many investors erroneously intuit that the company’s inclusion into the S&P 500 will lift the index’s current 22x P/E multiple -- which already registers close to the highest levels on record -- by two multiple turns or more,” Kostin and his colleagues wrote. Instead, “it will lift the index P/E ratio by just 0.4 multiple turns.”

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","Coronavirus won't stop Japanese firms buying abroad, says Suntory CEO","By Ritsuko Ando
TOKYO (Reuters) - The chief executive of Japanese beverage maker Suntory Holdings said on Thursday the coronavirus crisis and other geopolitical risks would not deter his company or other Japanese firms from overseas acquisitions.
Shrinking demographics, low borrowing costs and years of slow economic growth have forced Japanese companies to turn to overseas acquisitions for growth. Suntory's $16 billion purchase of Kentucky bourbon maker Beam in 2014 is a prime example.
""A 'post-pandemic' world will eventually arrive, and considering the low cost of financing, if opportunities arise we'd want to pursue them,"" Suntory CEO Takeshi Niinami said, although he said his firm had no immediate acquisition plans.
Suntory, which has annual sales of around 2.6 trillion yen ($25 billion), is one of the most familiar consumer companies in Japan, with brands including ""The Premium Malt's"" beer, ""Boss"" canned coffee and ""Yamazaki"" whisky.
In addition to Jim Beam, it has acquired several Scotch whiskies such as Laphroaig and Bowmore, as well as soft drink brands such as Lucozade. 
""There's no growth if you're only looking at domestic demand,"" he said, adding that India, Southeast Asia and China were the most interesting markets for Suntory.
Niinami, an economic adviser to Japan's government, said he hoped U.S. President-elect Joe Biden would rebuild multilateral relations and stabilise U.S. ties with major trading partners.
He was more cautious about the outlook for Japan's domestic restaurant and bars, key customers for Suntory, saying conditions had worsened since June when he had said more than 20% of bars and restaurants could fail.
""I would say everyone's understanding is that things are more severe compared with that time,"" he said. 
""Through December, January into February, we may see 20, 30% of these businesses close down,"" he said. ""The first quarter of next year is likely to be a very tough period."" 
Japan's capital of Tokyo raised its COVID-19 alert level on Thursday to the highest of four stages as the number of new cases spiked to a record daily high of 822.
Niinami said the availability of vaccines and virus tests would be crucial for restoring Japanese consumer confidence, and for successfully staging the Olympic Games in the summer.
""If the vaccine and other measures help to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and if we are able to hold the Olympics in August, that will mark a positive turnaround for the world, not just for Japan,"" he said.

1603,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 05:52AM ET</span>",StockBeat: That Light at the End of the Tunnel Keeps Getting Bigger,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The Covid-19 winter remains a hard slog in the near term, but European equities are getting used to looking forward to a brighter 2021.
Markets were broadly higher on Thursday after talks on a U.K.-EU trade deal appeared to grind slowly but surely to a solution that, while still far from optimal for either side, will at least avert total chaos on the borders come January 1.
For companies, meanwhile, the light at the end of the tunnel is becoming brighter and wider, allowing investors to look through still dismal economic and health data, on a day when Germany recorded its highest-ever number of new Covid-19 cases and French President Emmanuel Macron also tested positive.
For example, European car registrations fell some 14% in November as the second wave of Covid broke across the continent, even though showrooms stayed open in many countries. Yet you wouldn’t know it from looking at share price in the sector. The Stoxx 600 Automobiles & Parts index was up 0.4% by mid-morning in Europe and has ground out a 5% increase over the last month, for all that the newsflow on the public health front has been overwhelmingly negative.
Likewise, SSP Group (LON:SSPG), which owns chains of food outlets that operate in U.K. train stations and airports, reported its biggest ever annual loss of 426 million pounds ($575 million) before tax in the year through the end of September, on a 51% drop in like-for-like sales.
The company said in a statement that the three months through December had also been miserable with sales expected to be down 80% on the year. It also expects the first three months of 2021 to be “volatile”.
Yet SSP Group stock rebounded from an initial loss of 5% to be down less than 2%, still firmly in the range into which has settled since the game-changing announcement of Pfizer’s and BioNTech’s success in developing an effective vaccine against Covid-19.
And in the same vein, there was little to be cheerful about in the latest update from French aerospace supplier Figeac (PA:FGA), which continued to refuse to give guidance as it emerges from a nightmare year. The stock still rose 6.1%, ostensibly on the lack of any fresh negative surprises.
For others, meanwhile, there were further signs that the recovery is still well entrenched. Electricite de France (PA:EDF) stock rose 2.3% after it revised its basis operating profit target for the year up to 16 billion euros, while Villeroy & Boch (DE:VIBG_p), a German midcap that supplies tableware and ceramics to both business and household customers, revised its 2020 profit guidance higher for a second time, helped by buoyant online sales to its well-heeled private customers and a strong rebound in China. Villeroy & Boch stock rose 7.6% to a new post-pandemic high."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German fintech N26, valued at $3.6 billion in its May fundraising, is targeting breaking even on an operating level by end-2021 and is eying at least one more financing round before going public in 2023 at the earliest, its founder and Chief Executive said. 
""If we list on the stock exhange in three years that would be fast,"" Valentin Stalf told Reuters, adding that conditions for raising cash from private investors remained attractive.
N26's smartphone banking app offers a scalable, low-cost model that has already attracted backing from, among others, insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, Chinese internet giant Tencent, venture capital firm Earlybird and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel. 
Founded in 2013, N26 is Germany's most valuable fintech, having raised $570 million. It has more than 5 million customers and competes with other mobile banks such as Revolut und Vivid Money.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has not had any negative impact on its trading, the company has put the foray into new markets on hold, including plans to launch in Brazil, and is instead focusing on its core markets Germany, France, Spain and Italy, Stalf said. 
N26 decided to pull back from the UK on Brexit, but is continuing with its rollout in the U.S., he added. 
Under fire in Germany for his foot-dragging on letting employees organise a works council - a standard procedure in Germany - Stalf said that a global employee represenation was being set up by the end of the year.

From stocks to safe-haven gold and volatile bitcoin, financial assets were in festive mood. Bitcoin hit another all-time high after first shattering the $20,000 level on Wednesday.
U.S. congressional negotiators were ""closing in on"" a $900 billion COVID-19 aid bill expected to include $600-$700 stimulus checks to individuals, lawmakers said on Wednesday.
Such checks issued during Spring led to money pouring into stock markets and bitcoin from punters, helping stocks recover quickly from the COVID-19 blow. A trader in London pointed to chances of a new retail-led boost to stock markets.
The general risk-on mood sent dollar to 2-1/2-year lows against major peers, while the MSCI world stock index reached a new high of 639.64. The index has climbed 16% since the end of October. Since then, multiple COVID-19 vaccine breakthroughs have been announced.
""While we expect stocks to benefit further from positive news on vaccine rollouts and U.S. fiscal support, the same cannot be said for the US dollar,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
""We see further (dollar) weakness ahead.""
European stocks and the euro rallied for the fourth straight session as investors built up positions in riskier assets, anticipating a sharp economic recovery in 2021 backed by wider vaccine rollouts and ultra-easy monetary policy.
The British pound hit May 2018 highs on hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6% to a record high. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.2% - just shy of a 29-year peak. (T)
Wall Street stock futures were pointing to more upside, with S&P 500 futures hitting a record high after the Nasdaq's record close on Wednesday.
SANTA RALLY

""My suspicion is markets are inclined to extend this rally for two reasons,"" said Vishnu Varathan, head economist at Mizuho in Singapore, citing U.S. monetary policy support and vaccine rollouts.
""If new infection numbers don't go crazy...I think there is some scope for a so-called Santa rally into the end of the year,"" he said. 
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed on Wednesday to keep pouring cash in to markets until the U.S. economic recovery is secure.
Bond traders were disappointed he did not extend the Fed's purchase program deeper down the yield curve, and U.S. Treasuries sold off at longer tenors, but others took it as a signal the bank will have their back. [US/]
The Swiss National Bank kept its ultra-expansive monetary policy on hold, keeping the world's lowest interest rates and staying ready to launch currency interventions despite being labelled a currency manipulator by the United States.
The Swiss Franc was last at 0.8835.
Better-than-expected labour data in Australia pushed the Aussie as high as $0.7624, its strongest since mid-2018. [AUD/]
The Aussie is also riding high on surging prices for iron ore and a mood that has pushed currencies in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Sweden and Norway to milestone peaks. [EMRG/FRX]
The kiwi rose to its strongest since early 2018 after New Zealand's economic growth beat expectations.
U.S. Treasuries steadied, with the yield on benchmark ten-year government bonds flat at 0.9246%.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin extended gains after breaking past $20,000 overnight. It rose 8% to $23,058. Investors are attracted by its momentum - it is up 200% this year - and its purported resistance to inflation because of its limited supply.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",U.S. airlines closing in on new government assistance package,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are on the brink of receiving a four-month extension of a government assistance program that is expected to provide another $17 billion to fund payroll costs, congressional aides told Reuters.
A roughly $900 billion coronavirus relief bill still under negotiation would allocate $17 billion to airlines and allow them to bring back more than 32,000 workers furloughed in October, after a prior six-month $25 billion measure expired on Sept. 30.
A final deal on the $900 billion relief package could be reached as early as Thursday morning in the United States.
Airline workers would be paid retroactive to Dec. 1 and airlines would have to resume flying to some routes they stopped operating after the aid package expired, congressional aides briefed on the talks told Reuters. Airline workers could not be furloughed through March 31 as a condition of the assistance.
Reuters first reported on Dec. 1 that a bipartisan $908 billion proposal included $17 billion for airline payroll assistance, as well as $15 billion for U.S. transit systems, $4 billion for airports, $1 billion for passenger railroad Amtrak and $8 billion for private bus companies and other services.
In October, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) furloughed 19,000 employees while United Airlines furloughed more than 13,000 employees.
American Airlines suspended flights to some smaller U.S. airports in October.
On Dec. 9, the number of passengers screened at U.S. airports dipped to 501,513, the lowest number since July 4 as COVID-19 cases spiked.
The new assistance program is expected to mirror the earlier $25 billion program approved by Congress in March, which required larger airlines to repay 30% of the payroll grants over time and offer the government warrants.
U.S. carriers are losing $180 million in cash daily, with passenger volumes down 65% to 70% and cancellations rising, industry lobby Airlines for America said.
Congress previously set aside another $25 billion for airlines for low-interest loans.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, with investors buoyed by progress over Brexit negotiations and U.S. stimulus talks, ahead of the Bank of England’s latest policy-setting meeting.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 0.3%. 
EU and U.K. negotiators continued to discuss the future trade relationship between the two sides, with a breakthrough still seemingly tantalisingly far away.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday that ""there is a path to an agreement now"" on a deal, with fishing rights appearing to remain a key sticking point.
Helping sentiment was the news that Germany and France will begin inoculating their citizens with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine in the last week of December, once it is approved by the European Medicines Agency.
Across the Atlantic, negotiations over a new coronavirus-relief spending package continued on Wednesday, with senior U.S. lawmakers on both sides sounding more positive than they have in months about approving a $900 billion stimulus bill.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meanwhile held off from increasing its asset purchases, although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it will maintain its massive asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” in employment and inflation. 
The Bank of England is next up, holding its last meeting of the year later Thursday. It's widely expected to refrain from yet more stimulus , having already increased its asset purchase program last month. 
In corporate news, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock rose 1.6% after the mining giant named finance director Jakob Stausholm as its new CEO, while Electricite de France stock rose 2.6% after it raised its EBITDA forecast for 2020 to over 16 billion euros.
Also in the U.K., telecoms group and Internet provider Talk Talk (LON:TALK) stock climbed 2.4% after it said it had agreed to sell itself to a buyout fund backed by Martin Hughes' Toscafund.
WPP (LON:WPP) stock rose 2.9% after the advertising giant forecast its earnings to rise by double-digits over the next three years.
Oil prices surged Thursday, hitting a nine month-high after government data showed a fall in U.S. crude stocks last week, suggesting demand remained resilient despite the surge in Covid-19 cases.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels in the week to Dec. 11, the Energy Information Administration said late Wednesday. The extent of this drop came as a surprise, particularly after the industry group API reported Tuesday that stocks grew by almost 2 million barrels in the same time period.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $48.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $51.68. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since early March.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.3% to $1,883.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2233.

Shares in the Kyoto-based gamemaker rose 6.6%, reaching the highest level since December 2007, amid demand for its  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) console and a broader buying of Japanese gaming stocks. Sony Corp (T:6758)., which recently released its PlayStation 5 console, also reached a record, surpassing the 10,000 yen per share mark for the first time since 2001.
“Investors have their attention toward game makers amid the recent coronavirus spread and the upcoming Christmas season,” said Ryuta Otsuka, a strategist at Toyo Securities Co.
Videogame makers have gained almost across the board from the surge in stay-at-home stocks this year, with gaming a chief beneficiary of changing customer habits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Software makers Capcom Co. and Koei Tecmo Holdings Co. both hit new highs in Tokyo Thursday.
Combined hardware and software sales in the home console market in Japan rose 5.5% in November compared with the same month in 2019, SMBC Nikko analyst Eiji Maeda wrote in a note on Monday. Coronavirus cases in Japan began to increase during that month, when the PlayStation 5 and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s latest Xbox console were also both released. Tokyo was set to report a record 800 coronavirus cases on Thursday, local broadcaster NHK said.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>",Macron and the moguls: Inside the fight over a 'French Fox News',"By Michel Rose, Gwénaëlle Barzic and Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - Behind the corporate battle for French media company Lagardere, there's a political tug-of-war involving the country's richest man, a media magnate and President Emmanuel Macron.
At stake is control of one of France's best-known private radio stations and its power to sway voters ahead of France's presidential election in 2022, when Macron could face off once again with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
Macron fears that if media tycoon Vincent Bollore wins Lagardere, he could use its Europe 1 radio to inundate the airwaves with right-wing views and make the president's re-election bid even tougher, two sources close to the matter said.
So when Bollore's Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) built a stake in Lagardere in April, Macron's office relayed its concerns to Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of luxury goods empire LVMH and one of the president's early supporters, the sources said.
""The situation is being followed closely from on high,"" one of the two sources told Reuters.
Weeks later, Arnault stepped into the fight, backing Chief Executive Arnaud Lagardere's holding company with funds and pledging his support to the son of the company's late founder Jean-Luc, whom Arnault has said was his best friend.
Macron's office and a spokesman for Bollore declined to comment. LVMH did not respond to requests for comment on behalf of Arnault.
At the time, Arnault's move was seen as an attempt to bolster its defences in tandem with Bollore against the Amber Capital hedge fund in London, which has also built up a stake in Lagardere and campaigned to change the company's management.
A source familiar with Arnault's thinking said his attachment to Jean-Luc Lagardere was genuine, and had prompted him to act when his son sought help to fend off Amber Capital. 
But the billionaire's move puzzled French business rivals. 
FRENCH FOX?
After a career built on a reputation for penny-pinching on deals such as LVMH's renegotiated purchase of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, they wondered whether Arnault may have had another motive for ploughing funds into Lagardere.
After his initial investment of 80 million euros ($97 million), Arnault bought a direct stake of 7.75% in Lagardere, which is worth 209 million euros now. 
Speculation has been growing in French media that there was a political angle to Arnault's surprise move to invest in a company racking up losses and debts as the coronavirus pandemic battered its global network of airport retail outlets. 
Macron's inner circle was concerned that through Vivendi, now Lagardere's biggest shareholder, Bollore could consolidate his media assets and build a French version of U.S. conservative media network ""Fox News"", helped by Europe 1, the sources said.
Shortly after Arnault invested in Lagardere, a first pitch by Bollore to buy Europe 1 in June for 250 million euros was turned down by Lagardere's management, a third source said. 
Vivendi declined to comment. 
The company already owns France's biggest pay-TV company Canal Plus, whose free-to-air news channel CNews has taken a conservative turn since Bollore took control. 
Anti-immigration and hardline law-and-order comments made by some of its talk show hosts regularly inflame social media and both its viewership and advertising revenues have jumped.
The network's boss Serge Nedjar has acknowledged that some of its commentators are provocative but said in a recent interview that the priority of CNews was to host open debates on all topics and there was no political line.
Lagardere's Europe 1 station has struggled with losses and falling audience numbers but has kept a following among urban, educated and more conservative-leaning listeners.
'NO MORAL BARRIER'
While Lagardere's arcane ownership structure gives its chief executive the right to veto significant decisions despite holding only 7% of the company, analysts still expect its major investors to try to grab bits of the business. 
Vivendi now holds a 27% stake and has teamed up with Amber on 20% to push for board changes. Even Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, Lagardere's long-silent third biggest investor with 13%, has called for fair representation for all shareholders. 
The moves have put pressure on Lagardere's management to deal with the situation, especially the billionaire dealmakers, while Amber Capital has maintained its campaign for an overhaul to drive a better share price performance.
Four sources close to the situation said discussions over how parts of Lagardere could be spun off had begun in recent weeks. One said that Arnault and Bollore had met in person.
The two have never been direct business rivals, and are not especially close, but neither is interested in an all-out war over Lagardere, people who know them said.
Bollore may be content to pick up parts of Lagardere's publishing division, home to Hachette, or agree to cede some media assets even if he launched a full takeover, an option that could unblock the complex saga, people close to the talks said.
Such scenarios were still speculative, the people said. 
Letting Arnault take Lagardere's media outlets, which include the Paris Match weekly and Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche, however, could pose issues. The billionaire already controls financial daily Les Echos and newspaper Le Parisien.
Lagardere also owns a travel retail business, but the sector has been hit hard as the pandemic has pummelled the travel industry, and Arnault is experiencing similar problems within LVMH, which owns duty-free retail chain DFS.
But for those planning Macron's re-election campaign, keeping Europe 1 away from Bollore is a priority, especially given the growing popularity of CNews and its right-leaning commentators.
Its viewership doubled in October from last year and while it still trails France's market leader BFM, it's ahead of TF1's LCI news channel - and its transformation is not just alarming those in the corridors of power.
""The general idea is: in the name of freedom of expression, any right-wing person is welcome. There's no moral barrier,"" said Sebastien Cochelin, a CFDT union representative for Canal Plus. ""We're playing with fire.""

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Hong Kong take-private deals set to pick up pace after hitting three-year high in 2020,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Deals to take Hong Kong-listed companies private are set to accelerate next year, having already hit a three-year peak in 2020, as family-owned and other businesses reel from economic downturn amid the COVID-19 pandemic, bankers and investors said.
Private equity firms with billions of dollars to spend are also expected to keep hunting for targets in the Asian financial hub, they said, making them attractive as partners for some tycoons to take their firms private.
The total value of buyouts of Hong Kong-listed companies stood at $22.5 billion for the year through mid-December, up 160% from the same period last year and the highest since 2017, according to Refinitiv data. 
The number of such transactions - at 54 - is already an annual record, according to the data.
""We may see more take-private deals in Hong Kong in sectors where you see valuation dislocation,"" said Jonathan Zhu, Hong Kong-based managing director of Bain Capital Private Equity, referring to the difference between firms' market and perceived values.
""These tend to be businesses in sectors that are out of favour (during COVID) but still generate good yields,"" he said.
Deals in the pipeline include companies like semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASM Pacific Technology Ltd and telecom software provider AsiaInfo Technologies Ltd, Reuters has reported.
The surge comes amid a prolonged recession in the financial hub since 2019's pro-democracy protests, with the Hong Kong economy shrinking 3.5% in the third quarter as the pandemic and wider geopolitical tensions dimmed growth prospects in many sectors.
""The protracted effect on valuations from Hong Kong's social unrest, U.S.-China trade war, National Security Law and COVID is still there,"" said Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS.
""That's made a lot of companies vulnerable,"" he said. ""Next year the (take-private) pipeline is even more robust.""
The Hong Kong stock market is down 6% this year, while conglomerates and the property and construction sectors are down 30% and 13%, respectively, making them among the worst performers.
Nearly 60% of the take-private deals came from real estate, industrials, consumer and retail sectors, as per Refinitiv. 

Among those that sought to delist this year were blue-chip stalwarts Wheelock & Co and Li & Fung, with the founder of Hong Kong fashion retailer I.T. becoming the latest to attempt to take his company private.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Thursday morning, as the wait-and-see over whether the U.S. Congress will reach a consensus on the latest stimulus measures continues.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.09% by 9:56 PM ET (2:56 AM GMT), while South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.64%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.87%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.12%
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.33% while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.31%.
As negotiations for the stimulus measures continue in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared on Wednesday, “we’re gonna get there.”
Investors are now waiting to see if McConnell, alongside Republicans and Democrats in Congress, will deliver. Both sides were reportedly “closing in on” approving a $900 billion stimulus bill on Wednesday and are also working to pass a $1.4 trillion spending bill for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 by Friday to avert a government shutdown.
The U.S. Federal Reserve concluded its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. In its policy decision handed down on the same day, the Fed strengthened its commitment to support the U.S. economy by promising to maintain its massive asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” in employment and inflation. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added that said the case for fiscal stimulus is “very, very strong” as the U.S. continues to grapple with a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
Some investors pointed out that the Fed’s policy decision disappointed some investors.
“Powell assured the world that the Fed will extend its asset purchase program if economic growth slows,” CMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.
“The re-assurance saw the markets continue on their optimistic path,” he said, but added that some bond traders had been looking for more, prompting a selloff that steepened the U.S. curve.
Following the Fed, the Bank of England and the Mexican, Swiss and Indonesian central banks will hand down their policy decisions later in the day. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of Russia will hand down their decisions on Friday.
Meanwhile, the first known allergic reaction to BNT162b2, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (F:22UAy), was reported in Alaska. Snarls have also begun to emerge for a massive rollout program for the jab, which could see thousands more healthcare workers inoculated.
Despite the challenges posed to an unprecedented immunization drive,  Moderna  Inc's (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 is widely expected to receive U.S. regulatory authorization within the week.
Some investors remained optimistic for the market's prospects.
“The 12-month outlook looks quite a bit better, because we have high conviction now that there is going to be mass vaccination … there’s not going to be as acute of a health crisis as we’re experiencing right now,” Nuveen chief investment strategist Brian Nick told Bloomberg."

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Transport Canada is set to announce approval of design changes to Boeing’s 737 MAX as early as Thursday, in a first step toward bringing the aircraft back to the country's skies after a near two-year flight ban, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The Canadian regulator, however, is not expected to issue an immediate airworthiness directive, which is needed to help clear the way for the lifting of the ban on commercial flights.
Both of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because Transport Canada's decision has not yet been made public.
Canada was one of the last major nations before the U.S. to ground the MAX in March 2019, following two crashes that killed a total of 346 people.
A spokeswoman for Transport Canada declined comment on Wednesday night.
Transport Canada's move would follow earlier announcements by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) along with Boeing’s main regulator, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which lifted its own ban on Nov. 18.
Canada’s two largest carriers Air Canada and privately-held WestJet Airlines both fly the aircraft. 
Brazil’s Gol last week became the world’s first airline to fly the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX commercially since the planes were grounded, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is resuming commercial service at the end of the month.
Like EASA, Transport Canada has previously said there will be some differences between what the FAA has approved for the MAX and what Canada will require for its airlines, such as in training.
""The fact that Canada has chosen to include additional measures does not imply that aircraft flying under the FAA’s oversight are unsafe,"" Transport Canada said by email in November.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive-U.S., EU deal on aircraft subsidies should include China clause -USTR","By Andrea Shalal and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Europe should agree to cooperate in opposing any future ""hurtful"" subsidies used by China to build up its commercial aircraft industry, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Reuters in an interview.
Lighthizer said he was working to settle a 16-year-old dispute between Washington and Brussels over past government aid to aircraft manufacturers, but expressed frustration that current World Trade Organization rules would not prevent future subsidies by the European Union or China.
""If this plays out, they can start a new subsidy tomorrow, and drag out that litigation for five or six years, and there’s nothing under the WTO that you can do about it at all,"" Lighthizer said in a rare interview late on Tuesday.
He said he had made several proposals to settle the matter before the Trump administration leaves office on Jan. 20.
""In every proposal I’ve made, I’ve said we have to have a clause that says, that whatever we agree to, if China starts to do massive subsidies in this area and it’s hurtful, we have to be able to work together to solve that problem,"" he said.
The comments address what many trade experts have long regarded as the end game of the 16-year trade dispute - a transatlantic deal that the two sides could use to curb future subsidies by China in its fast-growing aerospace industry.
The WTO has ruled against every past use of government loans to develop new airplanes, but has not outlawed future subsidies.
U.S. and European negotiators have been engaged in intensive talks about ending the dispute over government aid to Europe's Airbus, which is politically backed by Britain, France, Germany and Spain, and U.S. aid to planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Emily Haber, Germany's ambassador to the United States, on Wednesday urged quick action to resolve the dispute, calling it a distraction from bigger issues that require joint action such as climate change and the pandemic.
She said a solution was urgently needed given the harmful impact of the coronavirus pandemic on aircraft manufacturers in both regions and moves by China to develop rival models.
European diplomats said the sides remained at odds, but expected to eventually reach an agreement with Lighthizer or possibly his successor.
The U.S. side has insisted on repayment of damages, a proposal rejected by EU negotiators, according to sources familiar with the matter. Reflecting U.S. concerns about the WTO, Washington is also seeking a bilateral dispute settlement mechanism that could be modeled on the system adopted in its U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, said one of the sources.

Both sides have imposed tariffs against each other's aircraft and a range of food and liquor products after receiving a green light from the WTO, which found both engaged in illegal subsidies in the past. The EU in November said it would impose tariffs on $4 billion of U.S. goods, while U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products have been in place since 2019.

(Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc has agreed to pay a $180 million penalty to settle accounting fraud charges for ""intentionally and materially"" overstating its 2019 revenue and understating a net loss, U.S. regulators said on Wednesday.
The U.S. Securities and Commission (SEC) fine on the China-based rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) comes after it said earlier this year that much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, sending its shares plunging and sparking an investigation by China's securities regulator and the SEC. 
The SEC said it found that Luckin ""intentionally and materially overstated its reported revenue and expenses and materially understated its net loss in its publicly disclosed financial statements in 2019.""
Luckin has not admitted or denied the charges, the SEC said. The company has agreed to pay the penalty, which may be offset by certain payments it makes to its security holders in connection with its provisional liquidation proceeding in the Cayman Islands.
“This settlement with the SEC reflects our cooperation and remediation efforts, and enables the company to continue with the execution of its business strategy,” Dr. Jinyi Guo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Luckin Coffee said in a statement.
“The Company’s Board of Directors and management are committed to a system of strong internal financial controls, and adhering to best practices for compliance and corporate governance,” Guo added.
The transfer of funds to the security holders will be subject to approval by Chinese authorities.
""Public issuers who access our markets, regardless of where they are located, must not provide false or misleading information to investors,"" SEC Director of Enforcement Stephanie Avakian said in a statement.
""While there are challenges in our ability to effectively hold foreign issuers and their officers and directors accountable to the same extent as U.S. issuers and persons, we will continue to use all our available resources to protect investors when foreign issuers violate the federal securities laws,"" she said.
Founded in June 2017, Luckin had one of the most successful U.S. IPOs by a Chinese company last year, attracting interest from prominent U.S. investors, including long-only funds and hedge funds.
But Luckin said in early April that as much as 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million) in sales last year were fabricated by its Chief Operating Officer Jian Liu and other staff, who had been suspended while the company carried out its investigation.
The falsified numbers equate to about 40% of Luckin’s annual sales projected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The Xiamen-headquartered company, which delisted from Nasdaq at the end of June due to the accounting scandal, used related parties to create false sales transactions through three separate purchasing schemes, the SEC alleged.
""Luckin employees attempted to conceal the fraud by inflating the company’s expenses by more than $190 million, creating a fake operations database, and altering accounting and bank records to reflect the false sales,"" the agency found.

Further, the SEC alleges that during the period of the fraud, Luckin raised more than $864 million from debt and equity investors.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing hires pilots for airlines to help relaunch 737 MAX - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is hiring up to 160 pilots to be embedded at airlines in its latest bid to ensure its 737 MAX has a smooth comeback after a 20-month safety ban, according to a recruitment document seen by Reuters and people familiar with the move. 
The new ""Global Engagement Pilots"" will act as instructors or cockpit observers on 35-day assignments at an equivalent annual salary that could reach $200,000, for a total potential cost of $32 million, one of the people said.
The unusual hiring spree is part of a Boeing campaign to protect the re-launch of its redesigned 737 MAX from operational glitches and rebuild trust following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people. 
The strategy also includes 24/7 surveillance of 737 MAX flights globally and talking points for flight attendants to reassure passengers who express concern.
""Duties include: consulting activities and assist in customer support, including flying opportunities,"" according to a summary seen by Reuters of job terms from a contracting firm carrying out the recruitment on behalf of Boeing.
Pilots must have 1,000 hours of instructor experience and ""no incidents, accidents, losses or violations,"" and be licensed on the 737 and other Boeing jetliners, it said. 
""We continue to work closely with global regulators and customers to safely return the 737-8 and 737-9 to service worldwide,"" a Boeing spokeswoman said.
Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have said the plane is among the world's safest after improvements to cockpit software and pilot training.
But a smooth return to service is seen as vital for Boeing, which faces costs of $20 billion over the grounding.
Boeing has already drawn up plans for a $1 billion initial investment in pilot recruitment, training, and developing a fight deck for the next generation of pilots.
But safety experts said its decision to recruit pilots directly is unusual and signals Boeing's wish to jumpstart the return to service and normalize the MAX as soon as possible.
EXTRA PILOTS 
CCL Aviation, based in Isle of Man, UK, is hiring the pilots on behalf of Boeing, according to the sources and document. The company calls itself the world's largest provider of flight training personnel and instructor pilots. 
CCL Aviation could not immediately be reached for comment.
Extra pilots are just one way Boeing is keeping close tabs on the 737 MAX's rollout. 
Boeing has also set up a 24/7 war room at its Seal Beach, California facility where staff using massive LCD screens will handle ""real-time fleet monitoring"" for ""rapid issue resolution"" if emergencies arise, sources briefed on the plan told Reuters.
Boeing has also deployed ""onsite specialized teams"" with 154 team members supporting five global regions.
It has held discussions with dozens of airlines to produce documents the carriers will use to discuss the 737 MAX safety with passengers, according to a person with knowledge of the effort. 
That includes a one-page primer offering flight attendants short, simple responses to questions from passengers about what went wrong during the 737 MAX crashes, and how Boeing fixed the problems, the person and a second industry source said. 
But the inclusion of language about ""shared accountability"" led to delays and irked some airlines, the second person said.

Indonesian investigators have said Boeing failed to grasp risks in the design of cockpit software on the MAX, sowing the seeds for a 2018 crash that also involved errors by airline workers and crew. U.S. regulators cleared the MAX last month.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday asked the U.S. government to prioritize essential workers including its warehouse, grocery store and data center staff for receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The request shows how the country's second-biggest private employer, with 800,000 workers in the United States, considers the vaccine important to keeping its staff safe and its facilities open. The U.S. National Retail Federation made a similar request on the industry's behalf Wednesday as well.
Administration of the vaccine began Monday in the United States, following emergency-use authorization last week. Early doses have been set aside for healthcare workers and nursing home residents.
Dave Clark, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said the company supports giving the vaccine to healthcare professionals and that essential workers should come next, in line with a government vaccine playbook from October. His letter was addressed to the head of an advisory panel at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called ACIP.
""We request that ACIP continue to prioritize these essential workers who cannot work from home, like those working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers and Whole Foods Market stores, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time,"" he wrote. Amazon owns the grocery chain Whole Foods and operates the cloud computing business AWS.

(Reuters) -Twitter Inc said on Wednesday that users will be required to remove new tweets that advance harmfully false or misleading claims about COVID-19 vaccinations, in an expansion of its rules on coronavirus misinformation. 
The social media company said in a blog post that users could be required to remove tweets with false claims that suggest vaccines are ""used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations, including statements about vaccines that invoke a deliberate conspiracy."" 
The policy, announced the same week that the first Americans received COVID-19 vaccinations as part of a mass immunization campaign, will also apply to false claims that the pandemic is not real or serious and vaccinations are unnecessary. Twitter said it will also apply to widely debunked false claims about the adverse effects of receiving COVID-19 vaccines.
Conspiracy theories and misinformation about the coronavirus and its potential vaccines have proliferated on social media platforms during the pandemic.
Twitter said that early next year it would start to label or place a warning on tweets with ""unsubstantiated rumors, disputed claims, as well as incomplete or out-of-context information"" about the vaccines.
A Twitter spokeswoman said the company would determine with public health partners which vaccine misinformation was harmful enough to warrant removal. 
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned YouTube have both in recent weeks announced bans on false claims about the vaccine that go against information from public health experts. 
Twitter previously required users to remove tweets with false or misleading information about the nature of the coronavirus, the efficacy or safety of preventative measures or treatments, official regulations or the risk of infection or death. The company says it hides such tweets and blocks users from tweeting again until they remove them. 

Twitter said it would enforce the updated policy from Dec. 21 and would expand these actions in the following weeks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.15%, or 44 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.20%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.520%.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 1.1% last month, a deeper contraction than the 0.3% decline expected. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  fell 0.5% confounding expectations for a 0.2% rise. 
But with U.S. lawmakers nearing a  deal on stimulus – expected to include much-needed support for businesses and unemployed Americans – economists expect the pain to be transitory.  
""COVID and the UI cliff will continue to weigh on spending in December, but we believe Congress is very close to finalizing a new stimulus bill which will reinstate enhanced UI (unemployment insurance) benefits from January through April at $300/week (or $1200/month),"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.

Investing.com -- Stocks were little changed on Wednesday despite progress on stimulus that would give a lifeline to households and businesses as the pandemic rages into the winter. 
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged and signaled that rates near zero would continue through 2023 to support the next phase of the economic recovery.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the first-quarter data in 2021 will show a significant hit from a surge in the virus, but the economy should perform well in the second half of next year, especially now that vaccines are being rolled out. 
Data from the Commerce Department showed that retail sales fell 1.1% in November, much worse than the 0.3% decline expected and a terrible sign for the beaten down retail industry going into the crucial holiday shopping season. 
Stocks could rally on word a stimulus package is finally on its way, even if lawmakers have to delay their holiday recess. 
Here are three things that could affect the markets tomorrow:
1. November housing starts expected to match October
It’s well-known by now that the pandemic encouraged a lot of families to move from urban areas to suburban and even rural areas. Stocks of home builders have benefited from the trend.
On Thursday, we get data on housing starts at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Analysts tracked by Investing.com see November starts coming in at 1.5 million, the same as October, after steady increases over the last six months.
2. Continuing and initial jobless claims seen falling from prior week
Workers in hard-hit industries like hospitality and restaurants may be heartened to hear that the proposed stimulus includes a few hundred dollars for individuals for pandemic relief. That’s a far cry from the $1,200 checks sent to individuals under a certain income level in the spring, but at least it’s a start. 
Unemployment remains elevated. Initial jobless claims for last week, expected out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), are expected to be 800,000, which would be down from 853,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to be 5.6 million, down from 5.7 million the prior week.
3. Earnings from logistics, pharmacy and cereal companies
FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), which is currently battling through the holiday shipping rush, is seen reporting earnings per share of $3.93 on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Pharmacy retailing giant Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) is seen reporting EPS of less than 1 cent on sales of $5.8 billion. And the maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms cereal,  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS), is expected to report earnings of 97 cents on revenue of $4.6 billion.

BOSTON/Washington (Reuters) -Investors don't expect the new administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to act quickly to change new rules that bar new investment in some Chinese companies, an executive for index provider MSCI Inc told Reuters on Wednesday.
During a consultation with more than 100 clients on how to reshape its indexes around the restrictions, MSCI found the conventional wisdom to be that altering the rules ""is not the highest priority for the Biden administration,"" Sebastien Lieblich, the Paris-based head of index research for MSCI, said in an interview.
MSCI Inc on Tuesday moved to delete the securities of seven Chinese firms from some of its global indexes after the outgoing Trump administration banned purchases of their shares in an executive order in November. The move followed similar steps by rivals including FTSE Russell and Nasdaq Inc..
The seven were among 35 companies listed by the U.S. Department of Defense as owned or controlled by the Chinese military, subjecting them to the new restrictions. China has condemned the moves, saying the effort runs counter to principles of market competition. 
A spokesperson for Biden's transition team declined to comment on Lieblich's remarks.
MSCI also had said it would launch versions of some indexes that retain the barred Chinese company securities. Lieblich said ""a small number"" of MSCI clients had asked for them but declined to be more specific.
Lieblich said MSCI decided not to delete subsidiaries or affiliates of some of the restricted Chinese companies, but could take further action if Washington gives more details about specific listings it wants barred.
""Whether the spirit of the order was to have everything excluded, that's an open question,"" Lieblich said.
MSCI's decision on subsidiaries and affiliates drew fire from U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who proposed legislation in October that would harden Trump's executive order.
""MSCI’s stated decision not to remove these firms' subsidiaries and affiliates underscores the need for Congress to take further action,"" he said in a statement.

""If any future Administration were to reverse course, it would be a clear signal that they are putting the interests of the Chinese Communist Party and Wall Street above the interests of American workers and mom and pop investors.""

Benchmark crude futures in the U.S. are the most expensive in months, following a rally fueled in part by optimism around the impending circulation of Covid-19 vaccines.
And the price of oil may rise further, hurting U.S. drivers. Banks, such as RBC, suggest a strengthening physical market and improving consumption in China, have also helped boost prices recently.
The crude needed to produce gasoline “is climbing due to the vaccination availability and promise that distribution is building toward being more widely available in 2021,” said Jeanette Casselano, a spokeswoman for AAA.
Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude futures are up about $6 a barrel since mid-November. Gasoline futures are trading at the highest since August.
Drivers are paying more to fill their tanks despite swelling gasoline supplies and the lowest seasonal demand for the fuel in decades. This combination typically leads to lower pump prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) made a final push on Wednesday to persuade a federal judge to force lenders of Revlon Inc to return half a billion dollars of its own money that it mistakenly sent them.
At the conclusion of a six-day non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said he would rule as quickly as he could, while admitting ""it's not the easiest case.""
The case stemmed from an Aug. 11 blunder where Citigroup, acting as Revlon's loan agent, wired $893 million to Revlon lenders, which the struggling cosmetics company controlled by billionaire Ronald Perelman did not owe until 2023, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment.
Ten asset managers including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management have refused to return $501 million.
Furman said he plans to consider their thinking immediately after being paid, as he decides whether there was a ""discharge for value.""
Such a discharge allows creditors who are owed money to keep sums they are mistakenly wired if they are unaware of a mistake.
""You might expect some sort of chat or email like, 'Whoa, can you believe it, they must have totally messed up,'"" Furman said.
Citigroup, the administrative agent for the 2016 loan, blamed human error for the overpayment.
It said the lenders should return its money because they knew it was sent in error and Revlon couldn't afford it.
""The question is, what would have a reasonable person done under the circumstances,"" Citigroup's lawyer Christopher Houpt said. Revlon's lenders acted ""as if there was no repayment,"" he said.
In contrast, the defendants said they had no reason to believe Citigroup blundered.
""The situation here is the exact payout of outstanding principal with accrued interest through that date,"" their lawyer Adam Abensohn said. ""That is quite different from hitting 'send' twice on the same interest payment.""
Furman urged the financial services industry and regulators to adopt procedures to address similar situations.
""The industry should figure out a better way of dealing with these things, even if this is a black swan event,"" he said.

The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",European tech firms seek to share in U.S. IPO bonanza,"By Clara Denina and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Some of Europe's tech companies are preparing to speed up listing plans early next year to grab some of the billions of dollars of investor cash that has already fuelled a record-breaking run of tech IPOs in the United States this year.
Tech sector valuations, already red hot prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, have hit eye-popping levels as investors bet that trends such as online shopping and food delivery will outlast the crisis.
The United States has attracted most of the listing action, with a record $81 billion of initial public offering (IPO) proceeds this year so far, based on Refinitiv data.
Shares in food delivery startup DoorDash Inc and home rental firm AirBnB surged between 70% and 115% on their first day of trading in New York last week. 
In contrast, European IPOs have raised just $19 billion this year, the lowest in at least a decade, partly because there are more attractive alternatives on offer such as private equity deals. 
But one equity capital markets banker said his team had around 50 mandates from companies across Europe to look into listings, more than 60% of which were tech or tech-related.
""There is a significant number of late stage private companies in the sector for whom an IPO is a realistic prospect in the short to medium term,"" said Claire Keast-Butler, a partner with law firm Cooley. 
Bankers say online food delivery business Deliveroo, cyber-security firm Darktrace, e-commerce website musicMagpie, e-retailer Moonpig and reviews site Trustpilot in the UK are among those looking to go public next year. 
In Germany, digital used-car trading platform Auto1 and online e-commerce About You are planning Frankfurt listings. In France, several ""unicorns"", which have talked about listing in the past, may accelerate their plans.
Meanwhile Polish parcel locker business InPost, which has benefited from this year's e-commerce boom, is set for a landmark Amsterdam IPO in early 2021 that could value it at between 7-8 billion euros, sources told Reuters this week.
Deliveroo, Darktrace, Trustpilot, Auto1 and About You declined to comment. 
""After a sustained period of strong performance, musicMagpie is reviewing a number of attractive alternatives to best support our continuing rapid growth,"" it said in a statement.
""As a high growth company we constantly evaluate our funding options, and regularly meet with advisers on this subject,"" a Moonpig spokesperson said.
HOME OR AWAY? 
But Europe's stock exchanges are not assured of bagging all the potential IPO candidates. Some may choose European exchanges for their market debut but others are considering listing in the United States, which has a more tech-savvier investor base and more relaxed listing rules.
Others may be snapped up by one of the 100-plus SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies) that have listed this year. These are shell companies that use the proceeds from going public to buy another company, not yet identified at time of listing.
""The factor that's most likely to hit European IPO volumes are IPO alternatives, such as SPACs and private equity,"" said Darrell Uden, global co-head ECM Europe at RBC Capital Markets.
Michiel Kotting, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone, which has stakes in many European tech firms, said that some European exchanges will still attract companies that have a regional appeal.
He cited Kahoot, a Norwegian educational gaming company listed on the Oslo exchange in which Northzone was an early investor, as an example of a company that listed locally but still attracted global institutional money. 
""Of course, most companies in this sector will look at the SPAC option as well,"" he added.
Some European stock exchanges are looking at making their listing rules more attractive by adjusting share class structures or reducing their free float requirement.
Britain is reviewing London's listing rules to make it more appealing for tech companies.
Companies aiming to list in London currently must have a minimum of 25% of shares available for trading, which makes it more difficult for owners to maintain control.
Tech companies are typically founder-led, mid-cap startups that want to keep enhanced voting power. 
""A separate share class, or a lower free float requirement at IPO, will allow founding and early shareholders to retain upside exposure, but still allow access to a range of financing alternatives to help continue to fuel and accelerate that growth,"" Uden said.

Dual-class structures are possible in the United States and other European exchanges, such as Euronext Amsterdam, so the UK is looking slightly out of step with other jurisdictions, Keast-Butler said.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Shares of e-commerce firm Wish fall in U.S. market debut,"(Reuters) - Shares of ContextLogic Inc, which does business as Wish, fell more than 5% in their debut on Wednesday after the e-commerce firm raised $1.1 billion in its U.S. stock market launch.
The company's shares opened at $22.75 on the Nasdaq, below its initial public offering price of $24 apiece. 
The debut gives Wish a market value of $13.34 billion. The San Francisco-based bargain shopping app sold 46 million shares at the top end of its targeted range of $22 and $24 per share.
The lackluster debut comes after mega-IPOs and stellar first-day pops of companies such as Airbnb Inc, DoorDash Inc and SnowFlake Inc.
Founded in 2010 by former Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) executive Peter Szulczewski and Yahoo veteran Danny Zhang, Wish has expanded rapidly beyond the United States and now has 100 million monthly active users, according to the company's website.
""We are investing in logistics, scaling the team on a global basis, looking for new revenue streams and improving our customer experience, which is more like TikTok for shopping,"" Szulczewski, Wish chief executive, said in an interview.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping as consumers stayed at home. Wish, which sells about 2 million products per day on its e-commerce platform, counts the likes of Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, GGV Capital, General Atlantic and DST Global among its investors.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities are the lead underwriters for Wish's listing.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Ransomware attacks on the rise even as cyber insurers scale back,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Carolyn Cohn
(Reuters) - Ransomware attacks increased in terms of both severity and costs this year, forcing insurers to become more selective and even scale back on the cover they offer against cyber crimes, a report from a leading insurer showed.
The total costs of ransom payments doubled year-on-year through the first six months of 2020, according to the report from Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley Plc that called such attacks the biggest threat facing businesses.
Ransomware attacks typically involve the infection of computers with malicious software, often downloaded by clicking on seemingly innocuous links in emails or other website pop-ups and leaving users locked out of their systems, with the demand of a ransom to be paid to restore computer functions.
They differ from a data breach or other types of hacking, which may steal large batches of customer data or other information from companies or individuals.
Paul Bantick, Beazley's global head of cyber and technology, said that ransomware attackers were demanding more money than in the past and had also become more creative in ways in which they sought to extort money.
""COVID-19, coronavirus, vaccines, all these things, they have enabled people to target organizations,"" Bantick said.
""Someone that you've been in contact with has tested positive, please click here to find out - You've got a much higher chance of, given what's going on in the world, people clicking on those bad emails,"" he said.
Giving no details of the companies involved, the report cites an incident where an automotive group was hit with ransomware and a cyber extortion demand of nearly $500,000.
The attackers provided proof they had extracted employee data and, after negotiations led by the insurer, a ransom of $50,000 was eventually paid, according to the report.
The rise in such incidents has led to a jump in cyber insurance rates, Beazley said, but added that capacity in the market had reduced because insurers were wary of losses.
Higher premiums have also resulted in smaller businesses, already hit hard by the coronavirus-induced slowdown, feeling the pinch.
Several industry players have told Reuters that many smaller companies have cut their cyber insurance completely this year due to a squeeze on cashflow from the coronavirus crisis and rises in other premiums.
They said cyber insurance businesses are also struggling with profitability, having been hit by the rise in ransomware attacks and legal battles over insurance claims after the NotPetya attacks in 2017.
Graeme Newman, chief innovation officer at another industry player, CFC Underwriting, said separately that rates had gone up by about 15% to 25% in the third quarter.
He also said there have been much bigger jumps in rates in certain sectors, including public entities and education.

""There have been some changes in capacity with a few smaller players exiting the market and others adjusting appetite. We are still writing with a line of up to $50 million but are being increasingly selective as to where we deploy this capacity,"" CFC's Newman said.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Massachusetts regulator accuses Robinhood of failing to protect investors,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts securities regulators on Wednesday accused the popular online brokerage Robinhood of engaging in aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors and failing to prevent outages on its trading platform.
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, in an administrative complaint alleged that Robinhood marketed itself to investors without regard for the best interest of its customers.
Galvin said Robinhood has a duty to protect its customers and their money. Yet, the complaint said, Robinhood gave its inexperienced customers the ability to make an unlimited number of trades without first screening them.
The complaint alleged that Robinhood used the promise of free stock trades to attract new users and strategies such as ""gamification"" to encourage and entice repeated use of its trading application.
""Treating this like a game and luring young and inexperienced customers to make more and more trades is not only unethical, but also falls far short of the standards we require in Massachusetts,"" Galvin said in a statement.
The regulator is seeking an administrative fine and an order requiring Robinhood to engage an independent compliance consultant to review its platform and policies.
Robinhood in a statement said it will continue to work closely and cooperatively with all regulators. 
""Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded,"" it said. ""We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.""
The Menlo Park, California-based company has amassed 13 million user accounts since its founding in 2013, with its commission-free trading model gaining popularity among retail traders during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Its valuation has surged to $11.2 billion. But the company has suffered several outages, and critics have argued its growth has been supported by drawing young, inexperienced traders to risky trading.

Still, it's been a tough year for pot companies. Both Tilray and Aphria's most recent quarterly sales missed the mark thanks to fewer medical patients and lower selling prices. 
Tilray is trading around $9.66 a share, a far cry from its 2018 high of $143.62. Aphria's had a slightly less bumpy ride, down some 43% from its 2017 high.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Wednesday it was suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most employees, managers and executives, as the embattled U.S. planemaker grapples with fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and 737 MAX crisis.
Boeing also said it was awarding employees - excluding executives and tens of thousands of engineers and machinists covered by union contracts - a one-time grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), determined by level. 
The mixed bag of news, delivered just before the U.S. holiday break in a memo to employees from Chief Executive Dave Calhoun, caps a year in which Boeing has shed thousands of jobs and cut production as it looks ahead to a recovery still years away.
""The next chapter of our history will be built on a culture of excellence anchored by shared accountability and ownership,"" Calhoun told employees. 
The grant, the first of its kind at Boeing in recent memory, will be awarded to about 82,000 employees and will vest three years from the grant date on Tuesday, Calhoun said. 
Boeing said days earlier that it was cutting production of its 787 Dreamliner for the fourth time in 18 months after posting zero deliveries in November, as recent production flaws compound delays from the COVID-19 crisis.
The pandemic decimated air travel and jet demand just as Boeing was working to win regulatory approval to return its best-selling jet, the 737 MAX, to the skies after a worldwide ban following crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people. 
The MAX is expected to resume U.S. service later this month following flights in Brazil and Mexico. 
In late October, Boeing said it was eliminating about 30,000 jobs to reach a workforce around 130,000 by end-2021 - thousands more than previously discussed.
Calhoun has predicted airline traffic would end the year at around 30% to 35% of 2019 levels, with a return to pre-pandemic levels in about three years.
""I know we will emerge from this a better company, one that is recognized for safety, transparency and quality,"" Calhoun told employees.

Analysts Doug Anmuth upgraded the stock to a buy-equivalent from neutral and bumped the price target to $65 from $52, according to StreetInsider. 
Shares are trading at their highest since 2014, and are up more than 70% in 2020.
""We are bullish on online advertising in 2021 and expect industry growth to reaccelerate,"" the analyst said in a note.
Twitter is expected to show the biggest rebound after a sharper ad decline in 2020, and a buyback plan should help support shares, JP Morgan said. The social media company is trading at a discount to rivals  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), which grow faster, but Anmuth said Twitter is ""under-owned."" 
The stock is trading at about 57 times forward price to earnings ratio, compared to Pinterest's 104 times and Snapchat's 417 times, according to Yahoo. While Twitter may seem cheap compared to those competitors, it's expensive overall -- the average PE ratio of Nasdaq companies is 21 times, according to Zacks.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 10:26AM ET</span>","Aramco may have to sell assets, borrow more to maintain Saudi dividend","By Saeed Azhar and Hadeel Al Sayegh
DUBAI (Reuters) - Oil giant Aramco (SE:2222), whose dividend remains vital to helping Saudi Arabia contain a huge deficit, may have to sell assets and borrow more to fulfil its fiscal role amid uncertainty in oil prices, market specialists said. 
While Saudi Arabia has increased non-oil revenues this year, Aramco still accounted for more than half its total income, and will be key to containing a budget shortfall this year forecast at 298 billion riyals ($79.4 billion), or 12% of GDP.
Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, listed in 2019 in a record $29.4 billion share sale, but the government still owns 98.2% of the group.
Though its profits plummeted this year as oil prices tumbled during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company is sticking to a promised $75 billion annual dividend that will go almost entirely to the government. 
While it is not obliged to maintain such a high payout, economists expect the firm to continue to offer the same support to state coffers next year.
""They can adjust the dividend to government lower, but they are more likely to maintain or increase the $75 billion and borrow if needs be,"" said James Reeve, chief economist at banking firm Samba Financial Group.
Aramco declined to comment. 
With oil prices at $50 per barrel or above, Aramco should be able to fund the $75 billion dividend and capex from operating cash flows, said Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch.
""However if oil prices are lower the committed dividend level becomes unsustainable, and Aramco would need to attract additional external debt or sell assets to fund it.""
For Yousef Husseini, equity analyst at EFG Hermes, it would make sense for Aramco to do some sale and leaseback-type agreements to improve liquidity.
Aramco is working with Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co on such a strategy, two sources said. Moelis also declined to comment.
The company is already weighing up a more than $10 billion sale of a stake in its pipeline assets to global investors, and could sell more assets to raise cash, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Aramco also issued international bonds for the second time this year, raising $8 billion.
""If oil prices range around $50 per barrel, Aramco will probably need to tap the market again even if they manage to sell some of their assets,"" said Alberto Bigolin, head of MENA fixed income at StoneX Group. 
""But I think it will be able to do so quite nimbly given how tight the credit markets are.""
In its 2021 budget, published this week, the government has not disclosed the projected share of oil revenue for next year. Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said as Aramco has become a public company, discussing projections would be very sensitive.
Basing its estimates on a Brent price of $48 per barrel, Al Rajhi Capital said it expects government oil revenues to range from 400 to 500 billion riyals ($106.6 billion-$133.3 billion) next year, depending on Aramco’s dividends.

Electrolysis is a carbon-free process - if powered by renewable electricity - to extract ""green"" hydrogen from water, but future German demand for the element as it moves to decarbonise its economy can't be met domestically. 
Aiming to build up partnerships overseas to secure imports, Germany approved in June a 9 billion euro strategy to promote hydrogen initiatives at home and globally.
Thyssenkrupp unit Uhde Chlorine Engineers (TKUCE), part of the group's Plant Technology division, will supply a 20 megawatt (MW) electrolysis plant, to produce hydrogen from solar and wind power, to the Element One project in the Saudi NEOM business region, Germany's economy ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The multi-billion dollar Helios Green Fuels Project in Saudi Arabia is due to produce 650 tonnes of hydrogen and 3,000 tonnes of ammonia per day from 4 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity from 2025.
The ammonia, which is easier to store and transport than gaseous hydrogen, will be shipped overseas for reconverting to hydrogen for use as an alternative fuel in transportation.
Helios also involves Saudi firm ACWA Power, Air Products (NYSE:APD) & Chemicals of the U.S. and Danish chemical catalysis producer Haldor Topsoe.
""The project contributes to building up reliable import capacities and the strategic positioning of German companies in this marketplace of the future,"" the ministry said.
Earlier this month, Germany said it would pay 8.2 million euro towards a Siemens hydrogen project in Chile.

Investing.com --  U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Wednesday as reports suggesting that a stimulus deal on Capitol Hill is near were offset by the weakest retail sales report in six months, the most concrete evidence yet that the latest wave of the pandemic is slowing the economy.
The news overshadowed what was set to be the main event of the day – the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions and press conference.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was essentially flat, up a mere 6 points at 30,206 points, while the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite were also up less than 0.1%.
All three indices had made strong gains on Tuesday on signs that Congress was close to finally agreeing a stimulus package after months of fruitless haggling.
Earlier, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell by 1.1% in November, their first decline in six months and worse than expectations for a 0.3% decline. October's sales numbers were also revised downwards. Coming against the backdrop of record coronavirus infection rates and tightening lockdown measures, the numbers appear to be clear evidence that the constant stream of layoffs due to the pandemic is feeding through into household consumption.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures showed that an outright contraction in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter is becoming increasingly likely, although he added the caveat that ""the weakness in sales is not due to a lack of resources; households are not constrained, in aggregate, by a lack of cash.""
As such, he added, ""softer spending now just adds to the pent-up demand for the post-Covid world.""
The data were enough to encourage some profit-taking on recent trades, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock falling 1.4% and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock falling 5.8%.
They also overshadowed the clearest signs in some time that Congress will agree on a relief package for the economy before it goes into recess at the end of the week. 
""We agreed we will not leave town until we've made a law,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was quoted by newswires as saying on Wednesday morning. """"We made major headway for hammering out a targeted relief package...that can pass both chambers by bipartisan majorities."" 
Other stocks making big early moves included Chinese-based streaming company iQIYI (NASDAQ:IQ), which fell 15% after a discounted secondary offering of shares and convertible debt worth around $1.5 billion, which will be channeled among other things to paying for new streaming content. 
Penumbra (NYSE:PEN) stock also fell by 7.8% as the furore over the medical device maker's catheters continued.

LONDON (Reuters) -World stocks rose to record highs on Wednesday as drugmakers rolled out COVID-19 vaccines and U.S. congressional leaders expressed optimism about a stimulus deal, with the upbeat mood dragging the safe-haven dollar to 2-1/2 year lows. 
In Europe, markets were cheered by the possibility of a Brexit trade deal, better-than-expected euro zone PMI economic data and a European Central Bank decision to let euro zone banks start paying dividends again if they have enough capital.
Markets are watching the U.S. Federal Reserve later on Wednesday for hints that it will extend its stimulus programme, and for whether it thinks the economy will suffer a double-dip recession or is on the cusp of a vaccine-inspired boom. 
E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were up 0.31%, after U.S. stocks climbed more than 1% overnight (N).
CMC Markets' senior analyst Michael Hewson said markets were being driven up by three main factors - ""the hopes of U.S. stimulus, the hopes of a UK and EU (Brexit) trade deal and better-than-expected PMIs"".
""You have all three of these creating positivity and optimism,"" he said, although he added that the impact of a new set of lockdowns in Europe was still to be felt. 
The MSCI world stock index hit a record high of 636.64, and was later up 0.4%. The index has climbed 15% since the beginning of November, propelled by trillions of dollars worth of global stimulus.
European stocks rose 1% to nine-month highs, with the UK's FTSE 100 index jumping 1.1%. 
The MSCI broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan was 0.9% higher. The region is also near record highs and up 3.8% so far in December, putting it track for its best yearly performance since 2017. 
U.S. congressional leaders reported substantial progress on Tuesday after two meetings of top Democrats and Republicans to end a months-long standoff on coronavirus relief and finalize a $1.4 trillion funding bill to avert a government shutdown. 
Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, said the prospect of a stimulus deal ""is rightfully welcomed by the markets, but the size of the fiscal package is the issue"".

1657,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",The ECB's 'Sorry Not Sorry' on Lifting Bank Dividend Ban,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The European Central Bank appears to have extracted itself from a little legal jeopardy by lifting its ban on bank dividends.
However, it has created such an environment around the issue that payouts will continue to be miserably thin for the foreseeable future, something that explains the relative lack of enthusiasm shown by bank Eurozone stocks as the details have dribbled out. 
The Stoxx 600 Banks index was up 0.4% by mid-morning in London on Wednesday but was still down 0.7% on the week. 
The ECB’s supervisory board confirmed late on Tuesday that it would allow banks to pay out up to 15% of their cumulative profits over the last two years, or an amount equivalent to 20 basis points from their core tier 1 capital ratio (the benchmark metric for financial strength), whichever is the smaller.
That’s a modest concession to the stronger players in a struggling industry who - despite the pressures of pandemic-driven loan losses, high legacy costs, ultra-low interest rates and technological change - are still meeting all their statutory requirements on capital and liquidity. Departing ECB board member Yves Mersch had admitted in an interview in November that there would be legal difficulties in trying to sustain a blanket ban beyond the end of the year. Even as it lifted the ban, it ""called on"" and ""asked"" banks to refrain from paying dividends until September, and also suggested they should go easy on bonuses for traders who - almost alone - have generated profits for the industry this year.
The move also resolves a slightly awkward inconsistency from the bank’s messaging over the last nine months. The ECB has stressed that banks went into this crisis in much better shape than in 2008, holding more capital and more able to absorb losses. The aggregate CET1 ratio at the end of the first quarter was a thoroughly respectable 14.4%.
But by imposing a panicked, blanket ban on payouts, it gave the impression of not really believing its own spin.
Chief supervisor Andrea Enria had reinforced that impression on multiple occasions, cajoling banks into recognizing potential problem loans early and writing them down accordingly. His warnings seemed to fall on deaf ears, as a third-quarter earnings season remarkable for its low provisioning was followed by a blunt warning in the ECB’s Financial Stability Review in November that banks appeared to be under-provisioning, in comparison both with banks in the U.S. and with historical precedents in Europe. 
Mersch, meanwhile, pointed out that the only reason banks were able to keep provisions so low was by making use of regulatory measures such as temporary government loan guarantees and moratoria. As long as they were enjoying such state support, he argued, the case for dividends was a weak one.
The ECB’s caution is understandable. While the current economic crisis clearly started outside the banking sector, its damage could be multiplied many times over if a new crippling wave of credit losses triggers a new financial crisis. Given that the ECB is now responsible for supervising the euro zone’s largest banks, such an embarrassment could fatally undermine its credibility not just as a supervisor but also in the realm of monetary policy.  
However, the use of administrative power to force banks into a policy that many businesses in the rest of the economy took freely as a matter of common sense, is a painful reminder of how little trust the authorities still have in the banks after the last financial crisis. And that is a judgment based on better access to information about banks’ books than any investor has."

The airline reported a HK$9.87 billion ($1.27 billion) loss in the first half due to the pandemic. Analysts had on average forecast a full-year loss of HK$18.3 billion before the announcement, according to 13 polled by Refinitiv. 
Its previous record annual loss was HK$8.7 billion in 2008, during the global financial crisis.
""We are still not seeing any meaningful improvement in our passenger business,"" Cathay Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a statement.
The airline reported a 98.6% fall in passenger numbers in November, though a smaller 26.2% decline in cargo carriage.
""Given the slow speed of recovery, we expect to operate about 9% of pre-COVID-19 capacity in December and slightly above 10% in January 2021,"" Lam said of the passenger business.
Cathay said in October it would cut 5,900 jobs to help it weather the pandemic, including nearly all of the positions at its regional airline Cathay Dragon, which it shut down.
As part of the restructuring plan, expected to cost HK$2.2 billion, the remaining pilots and flight attendants signed new contracts that resulted in permanent pay cuts.
The airline expects to operate less than 50% of its normal passenger capacity in 2021 due to border closures. In the first half, it plans to operate well below 25%, but it forecasts a possible recovery in the second half as COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out more widely.
To help bolster its balance sheet in the meantime, Cathay received a $5 billion rescue package led by the Hong Kong government in June.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, amid optimism over a potential Brexit deal and ahead of the Federal Reserve’s final policy-setting meeting of the year.
At 4:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.9%, and the U.K.'s FTSE index climbed 1.2%. 
U.K. and European Union continue to race against the clock to try and reach a post-Brexit trade deal. The European Union's chief executive said on Wednesday that there had been progress and that the next few days would be critical.
""As things stand, I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not. But I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow but it is there,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.
Economic data have also been reasonably positive in Europe, despite the surge in coronavirus cases prompting new restrictions across the continent. Both French and German PMI data came in ahead of expectations for December, suggesting the region’s economy has shown resilience during this trying period.
The optimism in Europe follows an upbeat session in Asia after a strong close on Wall Street overnight. U.S. lawmakers continue to discuss the possibility of another stimulus package to help support the Covid-ravaged economy, while Moderna’s vaccine has moved closer to being authorized for emergency usage.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve concludes its final policy-setting meeting of the year later Wednesday. Faced with an economy slowing as the coronavirus outbreak worsens, the central bank has to consider whether to alter its asset purchase program to provide more support for growth.
In corporate news,  Bang & Olufsen  (CSE:BO) stock soared 19% after the Danish consumer electronics company lifted its full-year guidance,  saying its fiscal first-half has been better than expected due to higher consumer demand for home entertainment.
Oil prices slipped back Wednesday following a surprise increase in U.S. inventories, putting the focus back on the impact on demand, given the tighter lockdowns caused by the surge in Covid-19 cases.
Crude stocks grew by almost 2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 11, according to industry group API, compared with the 3.5-million-barrel draw expected. Official government data are scheduled for later Wednesday.

BP and other European-listed oil and gas peers such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) are betting on an expected rise in carbon credit prices to counter falling fossil fuel profits as the energy transition accelerates.
California-based Finite pays landowners to manage forests, generating carbon offset credits which can be sold to polluters. The firm expects to generate $1 billion for landowners over the next 10 years, after a 20-40% cut of the proceeds, its chief executive Sean Carney told Reuters earlier this month. 
Finite currently has 50 carbon projects on three million acres in the United States and generated more than $500 million in revenue for landowners. 
BP declined to give the value of the acquisition or the size of its new stake in Finite. It made an initial investment of $5 million in Finite last year. BP said in the statement it would help expand Finite's reach into other countries. 
BP announced earlier this year that it aims to become one of the world's largest renewable power generators, part of a high-profile campaign to steer the company away from its reliance on fossil fuels that emit gases that heat the planet.

The firm plans to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 to 50 gigawatts while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) urged a U.S. judge to toss out the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract award after the Defense Department said in September a court-ordered re-evaluation had determined  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s proposal still represented the best value for the government.
The company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit said in a redacted Oct. 23 court filing unsealed on Tuesday that the award to Microsoft must ""be invalidated because it is the product of systematic bias, bad faith, and undue influence exerted by President Trump to steer the award away from"" the company. It called it a ""flawed and politically corrupted decision.""
The White House declined to comment, referring questions to the Justice Department. The Pentagon did not immediately comment.
Microsoft said in a statement Tuesday ""career procurement officials at the DoD decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution.""
It added ""it is time we moved on and got this technology in the hands of those who urgently need it: the women and men who protect our nation.""
AWS said in a statement Tuesday that as a result of the Pentagon revision in September ""the pricing differential swung substantially, with AWS now the lowest-priced bid by tens of millions of dollars.""
A judge in February granted Amazon's request to temporarily halt the deal from moving forward; that remains in place.
The court is considering motions to dismiss Amazon's amended complaint that have been filed by the government and Microsoft. The motions have not been made public and it is not clear when the judge might rule.
Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November 2019 after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.
Amazon's new filing said Trump and his administration ""intensified a campaign of interference and retribution against those in DoD perceived as disloyal to the president or capable of reaching conclusions at odds with his personal interests.""
The company argued the latest Pentagon review was ""riddled with errors even more egregious than those that plagued the initial award,"" and that the Pentagon ""manipulated its evaluations to a degree that belies any facade of rationality.""
The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract could reach as much as $10 billion and is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon.

Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the Pentagon made its choice fairly. Trump fired Esper last month.

Reuters reported on Saturday that the German government aims to buy a 25.1% stake in the company from private equity company KKR for 464 million euros ($562 million). 
Sources with knowledge of the matter have said the purchase was intended to ward off a foreign buyer from taking control of Hensoldt, whose high-tech cameras are used in Tornado fighter jets, and which listed its shares in an initial public offering in September. 

Hensoldt, a former Airbus unit, also supplies radar systems for Eurofighter jets and periscopes for Leopard tanks. KKR, which bought the company in 2016, retained a stake of more than 60% after the IPO.

Dunkerton, Superdry's biggest shareholder with a 20.3% stake, rejoined the company's board in April last year after narrowly winning a shareholder vote, prompting the existing directors, including then CEO Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.
The company, known for its hoodies and jackets featuring Japanese text, is attempting a turnaround under Dunkerton who founded the firm in 2003 along with James Holder, but left in 2018 because he could not ""put his name to the strategy"".
Bonello, who will join the company in March, spent 18 years at  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and was most recently the VP of operations for Vans EMEA.
The company also said Chairman Peter Williams (NYSE:WMB) would be stepping down next year, after less than two years in the role, once a successor is appointed.
His exit comes after the departure of Chief Financial Officer Nick Gresham, who stepped down in October, after only 16 months in the role.
""With the search for a new CFO well advanced, the completed executive team will be in place early next year and so 2021 is an appropriate time for me to step down,"" Williams said.

Dunkerton's appointment replaces his interim contract, which was due to expire in April 2021, Superdry said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Massive gains posted by companies at their trading debut in regional stock markets in Asia this year are raising the spectre of a bubble, bankers and brokers said.
A record number of companies in Asia are seeing their valuations double after initial public offerings (IPO) this year, driven by red-hot demand from retail investors making the most of unprecedented market liquidity and lower interest rates.
The huge price pops have taken place across regional stock markets, including in Hong Kong, China, and India, prompting concerns that a ""bubble"" could be emerging. 
""There is too much money in the world competing for the few new stocks that there are,"" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Hong Kong retail broker GEO Securities. 
""There is a bubble and it will burst … but it probably won't be yet.""
Governments and central banks globally have unleashed unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus to support coronavirus-hit economies this year. But while many economies are still struggling with fresh lockdowns due to a resurgence in cases, the stimulus has helped fuel record activity in international capital markets.
Valuations rose by 100% in 150 of Asia's IPOs this year, far outpacing the rest of the world where only 57 new deals achieved similar gains, according to Dealogic data.
In Hong Kong, the valuation of 11 firms doubled at their trading debut in 2020, while in mainland China 131 companies saw shares rise by at least 100% on listing day. 
The hefty gains in China have been helped by the rules governing China's STAR Market and Shenzhen's ChiNext index, which removed the traditional caps on IPO trading limits for the first five days that exist on other mainland markets. 
HONG KONG BOOM
Share prices increased by an average of 28.5% at Hong Kong listings this year, a sharp rise from an average 6.65% rise in 2019 and 0.28% gain in 2018. It was also far higher than an average 18.5% rise at listings in New York in 2020, the Dealogic data showed.
""The Hong Kong pop reflects the overall demand there is for deals, the secondary markets broadly and retail euphoria … we've seen it before and if any of these things go the wrong way it will have an impact,"" said an equity capital markets banker at a Wall Street firm, who was involved in several IPOs in Hong Kong this year.
Shares in Chinese detergent maker Blue Moon jumped as much as 25% at its Hong Kong debut on Wednesday, the latest IPO in Asia's financial hub.
Fourace Industries shares surged 230% following its $16 million IPO in September, the biggest rise among Hong Kong listings this year, while shares in Smoore International gained 150% in July after the company raised $1.1 billion at its IPO.
Stocks in Chinese toy maker Pop Mart International soared up to 112% in their Hong Kong debut last week.
""I'm worried for retail investors … they buy when they see hype,"" said a capital markets banker at a European institution, involved in a number of deals in Hong Kong this year. 

Elsewhere in Asia, stocks in Burger King India, which runs the franchise of Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc's U.S. chain Burger King, jumped nearly 88% at its market debut on Monday, after the company raised about $110 million.

BOSTON/WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - MSCI Inc will cut seven Chinese firms from some of its global indexes, it said on Tuesday, the third major index publisher to do so following U.S. restrictions on owning the companies.
As with similar steps by S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell the move means index-tracking funds will need to divest, the latest disruption to markets from an increasingly tough approach to China by the outgoing Trump administration.
Companies to be deleted include SMIC, China Communications Construction Co. and Hangzhou Hikvision, though MSCI said it will launch new parallel indexes that retain the securities.
MSCI said it decided to cut the companies after consulting customers following a ban on U.S. investors buying stocks that the U.S. Defense Department regards as backed by the Chinese military.
China has condemned that ban, announced last month by President Donald Trump, and fund managers have said it could benefit non-U.S. investors able to pick up the stocks.
Shares in the affected companies slipped slightly in broadly steady markets on Wednesday in Asia, with Hikvision, for example, down 1.4%. Hikvision has called its inclusion on the U.S. list ""groundless"".
MSCI said in a press release that it removed the companies based on feedback from more than 100 market participants in the United States and elsewhere. The firms will be cut at the close of business on Jan. 5.
Investors said MSCI's intended launch of new indexes, which retain the stocks, could be useful but that would depend on how widely such products are taken up as benchmarks.
""Many non-U.S. investors will be free to choose the index that retains the stocks, but many follow whatever the big U.S. houses are doing anyway,"" said Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong.
The other stocks cut by MSCI are China Railway Construction Co, China Spacesat, CRRC Corp and Dawning Information Industry Co Ltd. 
In a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday, the White House welcomed MSCI's decision without referencing its terms.
""For years American investors have unknowingly financed Chinese Communist military companies, which help the [People's Liberation Army] threaten U.S. service members,"" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council.

""Under President Trump's leadership, this is coming to an end,"" he said.

Investing.com – Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) saw its shares dive on Wednesday over reports that a top executive reportedly tendered a surprise resignation.
SMIC’s Shanghai shares (SS:688981) fell 7.38% to CNY54.12 ($8.27) by 11:26 PM ET (3:26 AM GMT), after plunging up to 9.8% lower earlier in the session. The company’s Hong Kong shares (HK:0981) were suspended from trading.
A stock exchange filing said that SMIC is checking the veracity of a resignation letter circulated in online media outlets and reportedly written by co-Chief Executive Officer Liang Mong Song. The company is trying to contact Liang to clarify his intentions but did not provide further details.
The U.S. Department of Defense added the company to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies on Dec. 4, labelling it as a national security threat.
Three other companies, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, China Construction Technology Co. Ltd. and China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, were also added to the blacklist on the same day. The addition of the four companies brings the total number of companies on the list to 35.
Inclusion in this list means that Americans will be restricted in their dealings in SMIC’s traded securities, or any securities that are derivative underlying such securities, according to a press release.
All Americans are not allowed to purchase the company’s securities for 60 days starting from Dec. 4 in Beijing, and all Americans will not be allowed to deal in SMIC securities 365 days therefrom, according to an executive order issued by U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 12, the press release added.
Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Shanghai, the company is China’s largest foundry specializing in the manufacture of semiconductors. SMIC is also at the center of Chinese ambitions to build a domestic semiconductor industry and wean the country off its dependence on U.S. chip technology."

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Delta Air Lines in talks to add more quarantine-free flights,"By Allison Lampert
(Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc is in early talks with governments to add more quarantine-free flights overseas, a company executive said on Tuesday, as the aviation industry turns to such testing-backed programs to revive demand battered by COVID-19. 
The U.S. carrier is rolling out two quarantine-free flights this week to Europe, where passengers are required to be tested for the novel coronavirus. 
The flights, which are restricted to essential travel to meet government requirements, begin later on Tuesday with a departure from Atlanta to Amsterdam.
""This is the first step,"" Perry Cantarutti, Delta’s senior vice president, alliances and international, told reporters on a call. ""Our focus is not just across the Atlantic. I think we’d like to see a similar program across the Pacific,"" he added.
“It’s a combination of certainly identifying the need and then finding an opportunity where you’ve got government authorities that are willing to have that conversation,” he added, without specifying the governments involved in the talks.
Even as COVID-19 vaccinations kick off this week in the United States and Canada, airlines see testing as the fastest way to resume international travel without quarantines since inoculation campaigns take time.
Airlines are on course to lose $157 billion this year and next, their main global body warned in November, in response to a second wave of coronavirus infections and shutdowns afflicting major markets.
Delta's tested flights to Amsterdam are operated with its partner KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France-KLM .
Delta will operate tested service to Rome three times a week starting on Saturday.
Countries are also taking steps to facilitate travel with Singapore, allowing a limited number of “high economic value” travelers under a “bubble” arrangement starting in January.
New Zealand agreed on Monday to allow quarantine-free travel with Australia in 2021.
Cantarutti said that after an initial trial period through late January, Delta hoped to leverage data and experience from the flights to help expand those routes to leisure travelers and reach agreements on other destinations.
Under the plan, passengers receive one test a few days before travel, another rapid-test shortly before departure in Atlanta, and a third test at the airport after landing.
The carrier is targeting markets for business travel, which has been hit harder than leisure during the pandemic.

""I certainly don't think this is the new norm,"" Cantarutti said of testing. ""But as a tool to help us get the people of the world moving again, I think this is a useful program.""

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Hackers used SolarWinds' dominance against it in sprawling spy campaign,"By Raphael Satter, Christopher Bing and Joseph Menn
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -On an earnings call two months ago, SolarWinds Chief Executive Kevin Thompson touted how far the company had gone during his 11 years at the helm.
There was not a database or an IT deployment model out there to which his Austin, Texas-based company did not provide some level of monitoring or management, he told analysts on the Oct. 27 call.
""We don't think anyone else in the market is really even close in terms of the breadth of coverage we have,"" he said. ""We manage everyone's network gear.""
Now that dominance has become a liability - an example of how the workhorse software that helps glue organizations together can turn toxic when it is subverted by sophisticated hackers.
On Monday, SolarWinds confirmed that Orion - its flagship network management software - had served as the unwitting conduit for a sprawling international cyberespionage operation. The hackers inserted malicious code into Orion software updates pushed out to nearly 18,000 customers.
And while the number of affected organizations is thought to be much more modest, the hackers have already parlayed their access into consequential breaches at the U.S. Treasury and Department of Commerce. 
Three people familiar with the investigation have told Reuters that Russia is a top suspect, although others familiar with the inquiry have said it is still too early to tell.
A SolarWinds representative, Ryan Toohey, said he would not be making executives available for comment. He did not provide on-the-record answers to questions sent via email.
In a statement issued Sunday, the company said ""we strive to implement and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, security processes, procedures, and standards designed to protect our customers.""
Cybersecurity experts are still struggling to understand the scope of the damage. 
The malicious updates - sent between March and June, when America was hunkering down to weather the first wave of coronavirus infections - was ""perfect timing for a perfect storm,"" said Kim Peretti, who co-chairs Atlanta-based law firm Alston & Bird's cybersecurity preparedness and response team.
Assessing the damage would be difficult, she said.
""We may not know the true impact for many months, if not more – if not ever,"" she said.
The impact on SolarWinds was more immediate. U.S. officials ordered anyone running Orion to immediately disconnect it. The company's stock has tumbled more than 23% from $23.50 on Friday - before Reuters broke the news of the breach - to $18.06 on Tuesday.
SolarWinds' security, meanwhile, has come under new scrutiny.
In one previously unreported issue, multiple criminals have offered to sell access to SolarWinds' computers through underground forums, according to two researchers who separately had access to those forums.
One of those offering claimed access over the Exploit forum in 2017 was known as ""fxmsp"" and is wanted by the FBI ""for involvement in several high-profile incidents,"" said Mark Arena, chief executive of cybercrime intelligence firm Intel471. Arena informed his company's clients, which include U.S. law enforcement agencies.
Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds' update server by using the password ""solarwinds123""
""This could have been done by any attacker, easily,"" Kumar said.
Neither the password nor the stolen access is considered the most likely source of the current intrusion, researchers said.
Others - including Kyle Hanslovan, the cofounder of Maryland-based cybersecurity company Huntress - noticed that, days after SolarWinds realized their software had been compromised, the malicious updates were still available for download. 
The firm has long mooted the idea of spin-off of its managed service provider business and on Dec. 9 announced that Thompson would be replaced by Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the former chief executive of Pulse Secure. Three weeks ago, SolarWinds posted a job ad seeking a new vice president for security; the position is still listed as open. 

Thompson and Ramakrishna could not be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday it was recalling 1.79 million vehicles worldwide in four separate campaigns, including some linked to reported fires.
The recalls cover 1.4 million vehicles in the United States.
The Japanese automaker said one recall covers 268,000 2002-2006 model year CR-V vehicles in the United States to replace power window master switches. Honda said there had been no reported injuries, but 16 fires reported related to the issue.
Honda conducted a prior recall of the power window master switches in 2012. The new recall is in response to moisture-related failures of switches repaired under the previous campaign. 
Honda is also recalling about 735,000 U.S. 2018-2020 Accord, Accord Hybrid and 2019-2020 Insight vehicles to update the Body Control Module software. A programming flaw could disrupt communication causing illumination of several warning lights and malfunction of electronic components, it said, including ""the rear view camera display, turn signals and windshield wipers.""
Honda is also issuing two recalls covering 430,000 U.S. vehicles in 22 U.S. states and the District of Columbia with significant road salt use to inspect and potentially replace front drive shafts. Both are in response to possible breakage of the drive shafts due to corrosion. No injuries have been reported in relation any of the recalls, the company said.
Honda said repair parts are not available for all vehicles involved in the drive shaft recalls. The recalls cover some 2012 Honda Civic Hybrid, 2007-2014 Honda Fit, 2013-2015 Acura ILX

2013 Acura ILX Hybrid and 2013-2015 Honda Accord vehicles. No crashes have been reported in the drive shaft or software recalls.

Texas, backed by other states, has long been expected to follow the Justice Department's lawsuit against Google but unrelated allegations against Attorney General Ken Paxton of bribery and abuse of office led to the departure of several lawyers who were key to the Google investigation.
With the new hires, the Texas lawsuit could come as early as this month, according to a source familiar with the office's planning.
Paxton's office said in a statement that it had notified members of the state legislature that the attorney general's office intended to enter into contracts with the two law firms ""to aid the State of Texas should it seek to file an antitrust claim against Google.""
The Lanier Law firm, including founder Mark Lanier, is based in Houston, Los Angeles and New York and its practice areas include product liability and business litigation, according to its website.
The law firm Keller Lenkner's website touts its work in complex litigation.
The federal lawsuit filed in October argued that Google built a great search engine but then fended off competition through exclusive deals with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others. It also alleged that Google abused its dominance in search advertising. Texas signed on to that lawsuit.
Colorado, New York and another group of states are also expected to file a lawsuit against Google. Those state attorneys general hope to consolidate their complaint with the federal lawsuit, they said in a statement in October.

The Texas led group has been focusing on Google's ad-tech dominance prompted by complaints by publishers and other businesses whose publications rely on advertising revenue to survive.

(Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest private equity firms, including Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, Silver Lake Partners LP and Thoma Bravo LP, own major stakes in the software firms whose shares dived on news that they were breached by suspected Russian hackers.
Shares in SolarWinds Corp, which is controlled by Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo, were down more than 5% on Tuesday, after the information technology services provider said on Sunday that cyber spies hid malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates. SolarWind's stock has slid 20.8% from last week's close.
Reuters reported that Russian hackers hijacked the SolarWinds software updates to break into multiple U.S. government agencies. Moscow denied having any connection to the attacks.
Following the plunge in the shares, Silver Lake's nearly 40% stake in SolarWinds is worth $2.3 billion, while Thoma Bravo's 33% stake is valued at $1.9 billion. They are still in the black, as each had invested $1.2 billion in the $4.5 billion leveraged buyout of SolarWinds in 2016. Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo have also earned $194.6 million and $234.67 million, respectively, from secondary stock sales since they took SolarWinds public in 2018.
Silver Lake declined to comment. Thoma Bravo did not respond to a request for comment.
In November, Blackstone led a $400 million investment in cybersecurity firm FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) Inc, with ClearSky, a cyber security-focused investment firm, joining as co-investor.
FireEye shares dropped more than 11% earlier this month after the company said hackers stole an arsenal of internal hacking tools used to privately test the cyber defenses of its clients. FireEye has contracts across the U.S. national security sector and other allied countries.
Following the breach, FireEye agreed to amend the deal to make it more favorable to Blackstone and ClearSky, according to regulatory filings. The FireEye preferred shares they stood to receive, paying a 4.5% dividend, would be converted into common stock at $17.25, not $18 as previously agreed. FireEye shares were trading on Tuesday afternoon around $13.58.
Blackstone declined to comment.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>","'The way out is through': Zuckerberg, execs set Facebook roadmap at year-end meeting","By Katie Paul
PALO ALTO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s top executives sought to rally employees around business priorities like commerce and virtual reality at a year-end meeting on Tuesday, playing down criticism faced this year of the company's record on false and violent speech.
""The way out is through. I believe the only way forward is to keep working,"" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees, according to audio of the address heard by Reuters.
Zuckerberg acknowledged that criticism of Facebook had hurt staff morale, saying public scrutiny ""comes with the territory."" But he also struck a defiant tone, arguing that at least some of the pushback came from rivals or those with an interest in tarnishing Facebook's reputation.
""We also have to recognize that we have many competitors, and there are people who believe that their success depends on us failing. So it's important that we don't just reflexively accept all criticism,"" he said.
Critics have blasted Facebook this year over its hands-off approach to speech on its services, including in a rare walkout by staff accusing Zuckerberg of inadequately policing U.S. President Donald Trump's posts.
The world's biggest social network also grappled with an advertiser boycott this summer over its handling of hate speech, the spread of violent rhetoric around the U.S. presidential election in November and a brewing fight with regulators over alleged anticompetitive behavior.
Despite those headwinds, Zuckerberg and other executives who spoke at Tuesday's sessions, including Chief Product Officer Chris Cox and Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, largely tried to keep the focus on technology and product priorities.
Zuckerberg said he would be ""particularly focused"" on technologies that deliver ""a deeper sense of presence,"" like augmented and virtual reality.
He also said the company had a ""unique opportunity around commerce and payments,"" as well as building tools that would enable collaboration between people working remotely. 
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who has played a less prominent public role with Facebook than in previous years, closed the session by thanking employees for adapting to remote working arrangements prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.

She said about 20,000 new employees joined the company this year, including 17,000 hired after the pandemic's start who had never set foot in a Facebook office.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Facebook to move UK users to California terms, avoiding EU privacy rules","By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) will shift all its users in the United Kingdom into user agreements with the corporate headquarters in California, moving them out of their current relationship with Facebook's Irish unit and out of reach of Europe's privacy laws.
The change takes effect next year and follows a similar move announced in February by Google https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-privacy-eu-exclusive-idUSKBN20D2M3. Those companies and others have European head offices in Dublin, and the UK's exit from the EU will change its legal relationship with Ireland, which remains in the Union. 
Initially, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters about the move. Facebook later confirmed it. 
“Like other companies, Facebook has had to make changes to respond to Brexit and will be transferring legal responsibilities and obligations for UK users from Facebook Ireland to Facebook Inc. There will be no change to the privacy controls or the services Facebook offers to people in the UK,” the company’s UK arm said.
Facebook's UK users will remain subject to UK privacy law, which for now tracks the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Facebook is making the change partly because the EU privacy regime is among the world’s strictest, according to people familiar with the company. The EU rules give granular control to users over data about them.
In addition, the U.S. Cloud Act, passed in 2018, set a way for the UK and United States to more easily exchange data about cloud computing users.
Privacy advocates fear the UK may move to an even looser data privacy regime, especially as it pursues a trade deal with the United States, which offers far fewer protections. Some also worry that UK Facebook users could more easily be subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies or data requests from law enforcement. 
“The bigger the company, the more personal data they hold, the more they are likely to be subject to surveillance duties or requirements to hand over data to the U.S. government,” said Jim Killock, executive director of the UK-based nonprofit Open Rights Group. U.S. courts have held that constitutional protections against unreasonable searches do not apply to non-citizens overseas.
UK information industry regulators said they had been in touch with Facebook along with companies keeping European headquarters as Brexit nears.
“We are aware of Facebook’s plans and will continue to engage with the company in the new year,” said a spokeswoman at the Information Commissioner’s Office.
A Twitter spokesman said its UK users will continue to be handled by the company's Dublin office.
Facebook will inform users of the shift in the next six months, a spokesman said, giving them the option to stop using the world’s largest social network and its Instagram and WhatsApp services.
Facebook’s decision comes at a time when the UK is escalating efforts to ban strong encryption, which Facebook is moving to implement on all its products. The UK, like the European Union, is also pressuring Facebook on a number of other fronts, including hate speech and terrorism policies. 

The United States may also pursue new laws on privacy and social media content, and federal and state prosecutors recently launched antitrust lawsuits against both Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. Still, tech lobbyists expect that U.S. tech regulations will remain more industry-friendly than those in the UK.

Rival  Vroom  (NASDAQ:VRM) is also up, by 4%, though it has fallen some 46% since hitting a high in August. The stock went public in June.

(Reuters) - Fox News International, the international streaming service that is part of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp, launches in Chile, Panama and Portugal on Dec. 17 - extending its global reach to 30 countries.
The service, which launched in Mexico in August, is available on platforms including Android, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV and Android TV. It features live streams of Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network in addition to 20 on-demand programs.
Fox News International is part of Fox’s effort to expand its business beyond cable TV, which is experiencing industry-wide decline as consumers cut their cords and migrate to streaming. Next year, the company is launching Fox Weather, a new advertising-supported streaming service - its eighth platform.

Streaming also attracts a younger audience. Americans aged 65 and older account for 37% of those who say their main source is Fox News, compared with 21% of all adults, according to a 2019 survey from the Pew Research Center.

Wintour will also now serve as global editorial director of Vogue while continuing to oversee Vogue U.S. She will lead the company’s editorial teams across all of its global brands, except The New Yorker.
Wintour, 71, is one of the most powerful people in the fashion world. She has been editor in chief of Vogue U.S. since 1988 and became Condé Nast’s global content advisor in 2019. For decades she has been chairwoman of the Met Gala at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, and she inspired the character played by Meryl Streep in the 2006 film ""The Devil Wears Prada (OTC:PRDSY).""

Investing.com --  Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY)'s trading at a record in time for Christmas.
Analysts are largely loving the stock, which has 11 buy ratings and a single sell, according to data compiled by Investing.com -- even with shares up more than 450% from a March low.
Earlier this month, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) reiterated a buy rating on Etsy with a $168 price target because it's a ""primary beneficiary of home nesting"" and beyond, according to analyst John Colantuoni. Shares were up more than 4% on Tuesday, at $177.50.
Its not-so-secret weapon? Unique and handmade goods in a world awash with mass-produced junk.""By offering products consumers can't find elsewhere, ETSY is able to stay relevant even as other e-commerce players like AMZN are making unprecedented investments in logistics and delivery capabilities,"" StreetInsider reported Colantuoni as saying.    
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), the lone sell on the stock, with a Street-low price target, said in October that the stock looked “overvalued for its sustainable level of sales growth/profitability heading into ‘21,” Bloomberg reported.  
And that's when the stock was 30% lower than where it is today. Imagine what Morgan Stanley's thinking now.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Apple aims to make 30% more iPhones in first half of 2021 - Nikkei,"(Reuters) -Apple Inc plans to raise iPhone manufacturing by nearly 30% to up to 96 million units in the first half of 2021, Japanese financial daily Nikkei reported https://s.nikkei.com/3mlVbPC on Tuesday, prompting another jump in the shares of the California-based tech giant.
Citing unnamed sources, Nikkei said the company had asked suppliers to produce around 95 million to 96 million iPhones. That target would include the latest iPhone 12 as well as older iPhone 11 and SE models, but could be undermined by an industry shortage of key components, it said.
Apple, which stopped disclosing iPhone unit sales data two years ago, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, but the report comes at a time when analysts are debating the likely extent of a boost from its launch of 5G handsets.
The company, which in October recorded the steepest decline in handset sales in at least three years, has said it expected iPhone revenue growth to be in single digits in the current quarter, the first of its 2021 fiscal year. 
The company's shares rose 3% to $125.44 in morning trading. 
Nikkei also said Apple plans to build up to 230 million iPhones in total next year, a 20% rise from 2019, though the target will be regularly reviewed and revised in response to consumer demand.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) have soared in the past two years as it successfully diversified its revenue streams toward accessories, services and a broader range of hardware, lessening its dependence on the iPhone.
The phones, however, which have powered a new era of success for the company since their launch by former Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs in 2007, make up just over 40% of revenue. 

The company is currently working on a new Apple TV model and preparing an aggressive 2021 production schedule for its MacBook Pro and iMac Pro, Nikkei added.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","EU moves to rein in U.S. tech giants with threat of fines, break-up","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. technology firms including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Google face fines of up to 10% of their annual turnover and could even be forced to break up under draft European Union rules announced on Tuesday aimed at curbing their powers. 
The rules are the most serious attempt by the 27-country bloc to tame tech companies that control troves of data and online platforms relied on by thousands of companies and millions of Europeans for their work and social interactions.
They also mark the European Commission's frustration with its antitrust cases against the tech giants, notably Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, which critics say did not address the problem.
Regulatory scrutiny has been growing worldwide of tech giants and their power following a string of scandals over privacy and misinformation.
Both European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton also see the rules as a bid to prevent the emergence of anti-competitive dominant companies.
One set of rules, the Digital Markets Act, calls for fines up to 10% of annual global turnover for so-called online gatekeepers that don't comply with the new rules as well as a break-up order as a last resort.
It also sets out a list of dos and don'ts for gatekeepers, defined as companies with an entrenched position, a significant impact on the EU market and with a core platform service which is an important gateway to users.
They will also be required to report merger bids to the authorities, a move aimed at preventing acquisitions that kill off rival companies.
The second set of rules, the Digital Services Act, also targets very large online platforms, such as those with more than 45 million users.
They will be required to do more to tackle illegal content, misuses of their platforms that infringe fundamental rights and intentional manipulation of platforms to influence elections and public health, among other requirements.
The companies will also have to show details of political advertising on their platforms and the parameters used by their algorithms to suggest and rank information.
The draft rules need to be approved by EU countries and EU lawmakers, some of which have pushed for tougher laws, while others are concerned about regulatory over-reach and the impact on innovation.
Tech companies, which have called for proportionate and balanced laws, are expected to take advantage of this split to lobby for weaker rules, with the final draft expected in the coming months or even years.
Differences between the tech giants could dilute the opposition. Facebook for one has urged the EU to rein in Apple.

""We hope the DMA will also set boundaries for Apple. Apple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers, as well as large platforms like Facebook,"" the U.S. social network said in a statement.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday as progress toward a massive government spending bill and COVID-19 relief measures kept spirits high, while investors awaited new economic cues from the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the top boost to the Dow and the Nasdaq, rising 4% to a more than three-month high after a report said it plans to increase iPhone production by 30% in the first half of 2021.
Talks in Congress were underway late on Monday to agree on a bill to avert a government shutdown, with Democrat and Republican leaders appearing more upbeat about including a fresh round of coronavirus aid, the first new relief measure since April.
Markets have moved in tandem with news on a relief bill, which is expected to further offset the economic impact of the virus outbreak and keep liquidity high.
But concerns over the timing of the bill, as well as a spike in the U.S. coronavirus death toll pushed the S&P 500 to a four-day losing streak on Monday, despite optimism over the launch of a nationwide vaccination program.
""There is a likelihood of some amount of stimulus to be passed, but investors are really hopeful of a stronger response to the current situation,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey.
At 9:54 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 133.99 points, or 0.45%, at 29,995.54, the S&P 500 was up 26.03 points, or 0.71%, at 3,673.52. The Nasdaq Composite was up 105.53 points, or 0.85%, at 12,545.57.
Technology stocks were the best performing S&P 500 sector in early trading.
Increased liquidity and ultra-low lending rates have seen investors flocking to stocks for returns through the COVID-19 pandemic, with the technology sector benefiting the most.
""The time-tested big tech names have shown their ability to weather the storm, even during some very tough times with the virus, so investors see them as names that can survive any potential shutdowns and still do well when things go back to normal,"" Meckler added.
The Fed is expected to signal easy monetary policy for the foreseeable future in its two-day meeting starting Tuesday. The recent coronavirus vaccine roll-out is also expected to improve the central bank's 2021 outlook.
Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co rose 2.1% after the company said it would buy Prevail Therapeutics (NASDAQ:PRVL) Inc in a deal potentially valued at $1.04 billion, to expand its presence in the lucrative field of gene therapy. Prevail's shares surged about 83.0%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's shares fell 3.2%, even as U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff members did not raise any new concerns over data on the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine. A report said the vaccine will gain emergency use approval on Friday.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.51-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded eight new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 62 new highs and 10 new lows.
