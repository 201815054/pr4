CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) misled U.S. shoppers by selling organic eggs laid by hens raised in enclosed structures under package labels that said the birds had access to the outdoors, a federal lawsuit alleged on Monday.
The suit highlights uncertainty among consumers about production practices in the $500 million organic egg industry, farmers said, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) last month shelved plans to spell out for the first time what it means for birds to have access to the outdoors.
Wal-Mart sells cartons of eggs to shoppers at a premium under its Organic Marketside brand with labels saying the eggs came from hens with ""outdoor access,"" according to the lawsuit filed by a customer. 
However, the birds are raised by Cal-Maine Foods Inc inside enclosed structures that have screens to let in air, the complaint said.
""Consumers paying more for these eggs have been deceived,"" the lawsuit said. ""The theoretical ability to view the outdoors is not the same as having access to it.""
Wal-Mart said it had not reviewed the allegations, but was taking them seriously.
""We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality products they expect,"" spokesman Randy Hargrove said.
Representatives of Cal-Maine, which is the biggest U.S. egg producer and also named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Enclosed structures, known as porches, meet USDA standards for producers of organic livestock to provide ""year-round access for all animals to the outdoors,"" experts said.
But many consumers expect egg-laying hens will be able to touch the soil and have access to sunshine, said David Bruce, general manager of eggs for Organic Valley, the largest U.S. cooperative of organic farmers. 
""It's very important that consumers get what they think they're paying for,"" he said. ""You can't have holes like this that allow that kind of deception."" 
The USDA in 2016 issued a proposal that would have defined outdoors as an area in the open air with at least 50 percent soil. 
The move was part of an attempt to increase confidence among consumers about organic labels at a time when the USDA said at least half organic egg production came from operations that exclusively used roofed porches to provide outdoor access to hens.
The USDA last year withdrew the proposal.
The case is Donnie Lee Gibson v Wal-Mart Stores et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-00134.

On a net basis, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will drain 130 billion yuan ($20.01 billion) from the money market for the day, equal to the amount of reverse repos due to mature on Tuesday.
The PBOC drained a net 510 billion yuan from the money market last week.

LONDON (Reuters) - Money transfer company TransferWise said on Tuesday it is launching a low-cost ""borderless"" account and debit card in the first quarter of this year, in its latest bid to win customers by undercutting the foreign exchange fees charged by banks.
Users will be able to hold and convert 28 currencies at the real exchange rate with the account, TransferWise said.
Fees to convert funds into foreign currency, send them overseas or withdraw cash abroad have amounted to billions of dollars in income for banks globally, but critics say services are slow and often contain hidden charges. 
A number of smaller firms have rapidly attracted businesses and consumers by offering quicker and cheaper alternatives. 
TransferWise is one of the most successful, growing to become one of Europe's largest financial technology firms. 
It became profitable for the first time last year and was valued at $1.6 billion in its most recent funding round in November.
The group is backed by Old Mutual Global Investors and Silicon Valley venture capital firm IVP. Media reports have said founders plan to float the firm in the coming years.
""For the first time we're bringing true multi-country banking - with real bank details in key currencies - to anyone who needs it,"" Taavet Hinrikus, chairman and co-founder of TransferWise, said.
Until now, consumers using TransferWise could only send money overseas. Users pay into the firm's account at home, and TransferWise pays the sum out of its bank account in the recipient's local country at the real exchange rate.

Operating income rose to 15.1 trillion won ($14.2 billion) in the three months ended December, according to preliminary results released Tuesday. That compares with the 16.1 trillion-won average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Prices for benchmark memory chips have leveled off after a year of strong gains, limiting the growth that had powered Samsung to record earnings in the past two quarters. That has combined with a 5 percent rise in the won against the dollar in the fourth quarter to erode the value of profits earned abroad. Still, rising demand for organic light-emitting diode screens helped to fuel a rise in sales to 66 trillion won in the quarter, compared with the 67.6 trillion won analysts expected.
“The won-dollar exchange rate is worrisome,” Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities, said in a report before the announcement. “The first quarter earnings are expected to be 15 trillion won.”
Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, leads in the next generation of screens called organic light-emitting diodes. It supplies OLED screens for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone X even as the two companies vie for dominance in the global smartphone market.
Samsung won’t provide net income or break out divisional performance until it releases final results later this month.
Samsung’s shares fell 0.2 percent to 2.6 million won in Seoul on Monday. They hit record highs in 2017 before sliding in November after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded the stock citing an expected peak in the memory chips cycle and a slowdown in smartphones.
Samsung is said to be planning to debut its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S9, next month, presenting Apple’s iPhone X with a sooner-than-expected challenger. Samsung is also seeking to release a phone with a bendable display to help fend off challenges from Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo and other Chinese rivals.
The company’s cash cow has been the memory business. Contract prices for 32 gigabyte DRAM server modules nearly doubled last year while prices for 64 gigabit MLC NAND flash memory chips rose 55 percent in the same period, according to inSpectrum Tech Inc.
Samsung underwent a leadership change on the heels of its record earnings in the third quarter, with CEO Kwon Oh-hyun resigning to pave the way for Kim Ki-nam, a seasoned semiconductor engineer. The company’s de facto chief, Jay Y. Lee, has been fighting allegations of corruption in court, appealing a five-year sentence given in August when he was convicted of bribing a presidential confidante to get greater control of the company.
The 49-year businessman denies the charges and is awaiting a ruling on his appeal by an appellate court on Feb. 5. Samsung Electronics, of which he is a vice chairman and board member, is the crown jewel of a conglomerate comprised of about 60 units selling selling life insurance, cargo ships and clothes.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A former Google engineer fired after he asserted in a memo that biological causes were behind tech industry gender inequality sued his former employer on Monday, saying he was discriminated against as a white man with conservative political views. 
James Damore last year caused an uproar in Silicon Valley and beyond when he wrote the internal memo, which later became public. Google said he had perpetuated gender stereotypes and fired him in August. 
In the months since, his firing has become a popular cause among right-leaning U.S. bloggers, and Damore hired a Republican Party official as his attorney. 
Damore and another white male former Google engineer, David Gudeman, filed the lawsuit as a proposed class action in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California. The lawsuit alleges workplace discrimination and retaliation. 
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc based in Mountain View, California, said in a statement: ""We look forward to defending against Mr. Damore's lawsuit in court."" 
According to the lawsuit, the company has failed to protect employees, especially white men, from workplace harassment related to their support of U.S. President Donald Trump or conservative political views. 
""Damore, Gudeman, and other class members were ostracized, belittled, and punished for their heterodox political views, and for the added sin of their birth circumstances of being Caucasians and/or males,"" the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit also accused Google of maintaining a secret blacklist of conservative media personalities who are not allowed inside the company's offices. 
The lawsuit requested an injunction barring Google from discriminating against individuals with conservative political views, as well as for unspecified compensation. 
Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said when Damore was fired that portions of his memo ""violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.""
Gudeman was fired in December 2016 after a confrontation with a Muslim coworker on an internal Google forum, according to the lawsuit. 
The coworker said on the forum that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had targeted him for being a Muslim, and he expressed worry about his personal safety, the lawsuit said. Gudeman responded with skepticism, saying the coworker had provided ""zero evidence"" for the claim and suggesting the FBI may have had justification. 

A human resources employee later told Gudeman he had accused his coworker of terrorism based on religion, and that he was being fired as a result, the lawsuit said.

(Reuters) - Blackstone Group (N:BX) wants to quadruple to $100 billion the assets it manages at its new unit for insurers as it seeks to boost returns for firms struggling under low interest rates, the unit's newly appointed chief said on Monday.
Blackstone recruited Chris Blunt, the former president of New York Life's [NYLIN.UL] investments group, to run Blackstone Insurance Solutions, a new business formed late last year when Blackstone agreed to oversee $22 billion from Fidelity & Guaranty Life [FGLH.UL].
""The target (for assets under management) is $100 billion,"" Blunt told Reuters in a telephone interview. Blackstone declined to give a time frame for the target. 
At the end of the third quarter, Blackstone's overall assets totaled $387 billion. 
Insurance companies invest the bulk of their premiums in low-risk investments and set aside a smaller portion for higher-return and higher-risk strategies, such as hedge funds and private equity. 
Blackstone Insurance Solutions has a dual purpose, firstly giving insurance clients a more dedicated focus to direct their investments across Blackstone's existing businesses, which include leveraged buyouts, real estate, credit and infrastructure. 
Secondly, it will offer new investments at lower returns but at a lower risk in areas like high-grade private credit. 
The new division underscores the willingness among major private equity firms to tweak their investment offerings in order to attract big investor classes. 
Years of low interest rates have created challenges for insurers by reducing the earnings on their investment portfolios, once a key revenue stream for both life and property casualty insurers.
""We're in an environment where insurers are finding it incredibly hard to get quality investments into their portfolio,"" Blunt said. 

""There's very little yield, despite the short-term pickup in short term interest rates.""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 extended its winning streak for 2018 on Monday although its advance slowed to a crawl as the healthcare and financial sectors weighed and investors awaited the start of the quarterly earnings season.
The healthcare sector was the S&P's worst performer on Monday, and investors were cautious about pouring money into bank stocks before the companies kick off the fourth-quarter earnings season later this week. 
""We had a big move last week and everyone knows earnings is coming up. People don't want to chase too much further when you have a round of fundamental inputs in the next few weeks,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 12.87 points, or 0.05 percent, to 25,283, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 4.56 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,747.71, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 20.83 points, or 0.29 percent, to 7,157.39.
The three major indexes kicked off 2018 with their strongest first four trading days in more than a decade, according to Reuters data. The Dow had its strongest start since 2003, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had their strongest starts since 2006.
Historically, the first five trading days of January can be an indicator for the market's direction for the full year, according to the Stock Traders Almanac. 
The S&P 500's healthcare sector (SPXHC) ended 0.4 percent lower. Last week it rose 3.2 percent. 
The Nasdaq biotech index (NBI) fell 1.4 percent, on track for its biggest one-day percentage decline since mid-December, led by a 3.7 percent drop in Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) and a 3.3 percent decline in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN). 
A 0.4 percent decline in the bank subsector <.SPXBK> pressured the broader financials index (SPSY), which fell 0.1 percent. Investors were waiting for more details about the impact of recent U.S. corporate tax cuts in fourth-quarter earnings calls when the reporting season begins later in the week.
 Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  (N:C) fell more than 1 percent while Goldman Sachs (N:GS) declined 1.5 percent. Most big U.S. lenders have estimated one-off charges to their fourth-quarter earnings on account of U.S. tax cuts.
Utilities (SPLRCU) were the S&P's biggest percentage gainers, regaining some ground lost in the previous week along with real estate <.SPLRCREC>.
 Caterpillar  (N:CAT) closed up 2.5 percent to $166.03, just below a record high set earlier in the day, after JP Morgan upgraded the stock saying the tax overhaul could help North America's construction business cycle extend in 2018.
Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) rose 4.7 percent after the department store operator posted far stronger same-store sales for the holidays than its bigger peers. 
 GoPro Inc  (O:GPRO) shares ended down 12.8 percent at $6.56 after the company said it would be open to a sale but is not actively pursuing one. Earlier in the day, the shares lost about a third of their value, hitting a record low at $5.04, after GoPro announced preliminary fourth-quarter revenue that was well below expectations and said it would exit the drone business.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 98 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 124 new highs and 26 new lows.

Volume so far on U.S. exchanges was 6.36 billion shares, compared to the 6.28 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Minimum wage hike has rocky start in Canada's Ontario province,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A steep minimum wage increase that went into effect on Jan. 1 in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, has had a rocky start as some employers cut workers' hours and benefits to reduce its impact on the bottom line. 
Ontario raised the minimum wage 21 percent to C$14 ($11.26), making it the highest in Canada. 
The provincial government, controlled by Canada's ruling Liberal Party, positioned it as a measure to improve the livelihood of workers in Ontario, home to the nation's largest city, Toronto, and its capital, Ottawa. 
Yet some employers responded by implementing hiring freezes, cutting hours of existing workers, eliminating paid breaks and boosting benefits costs.
Those companies include franchisees operating Tim Hortons restaurants, an iconic Canadian fast-food chain that sells low-priced coffee, donuts and sandwiches and is owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR).
Some economists said such measures will reduce the impact of the increase.
The Conference Board of Canada, a nonpartisan economic research institute, had initially estimated that the change would shift about C$5 billion into the pockets of workers and away from business profits. 
Now it believes countermeasures implemented by businesses could result in the loss of 42,000 jobs by the end of next year, said Michael Burt, director of the industrial trends group at the Conference Board. 
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne last week accused the children of Tim Hortons' founders of bullying their workers after they eliminated paid breaks and other employee benefits at two of the chain's restaurants that they own. She called them ""not decent"" and ""not fair.""
Businesses and franchisee groups responded that the wage increase was onerous for businesses, saying it was implemented to score political points for Ontario's ruling Liberals, who face provincial elections in June. They want the province to go back to increases tied to the inflation rate.
The provincial government has not commented on the allegations or responded to businesses' concerns about the extent of the increase.

Some consumers have lashed out at Tim Horton's on social media, pledging a boycott, though it is unclear that the effort will hurt sales at the chain, which is affectionately known in Canada as ""Tim's.""

Eurozone unemployment, German trade balance data
A report on Eurozone unemployment is expected to show the unemployment rate cooled to 8.7% in November from 8.8% in the previous month.
German trade balance data is also expected to come into focus Tuesday as economists forecast the trade balanced rose to 20.9 billion in November from 19.9 billion in October.
EUR/USD fell 0.52% to $1.1967 amid profit taking on the recent rally that saw the single currency rise above $1.20 to a three-year high amid expectations that the European Central Bank is poised to announce plans to rein in accommodative monetary policy measures.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles to show large decline?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday. 
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by about 5 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 29.
Crude oil futures started the week on the front foot amid a fall in the number of US rig counts and ongoing strong OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output.
U.S. labor market data, Fed speak in focus 
Following last week’s nonfarm payrolls report which undershot economists’ forecast, traders look to a monthly report on job vacancies for further clues on the strength of the U.S. labor market.
The U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, is expected to show job openings in improved to about 6.1 million in December.
The dollar bounced off four-month lows against its rivals Monday amid recent comments from Fed Williams, an FOMC voter, who said three rates remained appropriate for 2018 amid expectations that inflation would eventually return to 2%.
Fed Williams comments were said to be somewhat hawkish as he is widely seen as a centrist when it comes to monetary policy.
A speech by Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari is also expected to be closely parsed for an insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking on monetary policy. "

In what a quiet day on the economic calendar, investor focus shifted toward earnings as shares of retailer Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) surged more than 5% after reporting same-store sales during the holidays rose nearly 7% compared to the same period a year ago.
The solid performance over the holiday period prompted the retailer to raise its full-year profit outlook, estimating fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range from $4.10 to $4.20, versus a prior forecast of $3.72 to $3.92.
Shares of  GoPro Inc  (NASDAQ:GPRO) fell more than 10% after the company reported its preliminary fourth-quarter results which fell below consensus estimates.
The company estimated fourth-quarter revenue of $340 million that was lower than its prior estimate of $460 million to $480 million.

Financials, meanwhile, continued to trickle lower ahead of a raft of bank earnings on Jan. 12, when JPMorgan and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) are expected report earnings. Financials are expected to post strong earnings for the quarter as the recent tax reform measures are widely expected to boost earnings growth.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 02:28PM ET</span>",Berkshire may get $37 billion book value boost from U.S. tax cuts: Barclays,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, may see its book value grow by $37 billion because of U.S. tax law changes enacted by President Donald Trump,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital analysts estimated on Monday.
Book value, a key performance measure for Buffett reflecting assets minus liabilities, probably rose by 12 percent in the final quarter of 2017 because Berkshire can lower its tax bill on investments that have risen in value, Barclays analysts led by Jay Gelb wrote.
That would leave Berkshire valued at about 1.39 times book value, which Gelb called ""attractive,"" though it would remain above the 1.2 ratio that could prompt Buffett to authorize share repurchases.
Berkshire has said it ended September with $86.6 billion of income tax liabilities, which were mainly deferred.
Gelb, who rates Berkshire ""overweight,"" also said lower taxes could boost by 12 percent the earnings power from Berkshire's more than 90 operating units, such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance.
Though the tax changes would not add to the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's roughly $109 billion of cash and equivalents, Gelb said any large all-cash acquisition would likely immediately boost Berkshire's earnings per share. 
Trump last month signed into law a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Buffett had told CNBC in October that if the corporate rate changed significantly in 2018, ""it would pay me something.""
Through 2016, Berkshire's book value per share grew at an annualized 19 percent since Buffett took over the company in 1965. That topped the 9.7 percent annualized gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends. Berkshire does not pay a dividend.
Barclays on Monday also raised its price target for Berkshire Class A shares to $357,000 from $322,500, three weeks after the shares reached $300,000 for the first time. It raised its target for Berkshire Class B shares to $238 from $215.
Berkshire usually releases year-end results and Buffett's annual shareholder letter on the last Saturday in February. 

In afternoon trading, Berkshire Class A shares were up $1,575 at $303,100, and Class B shares were up 64 cents at $202.06. Both share classes rose 22 percent in 2017.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler boosted by Jeep growth expectations,"By Agnieszka Flak 
MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA)(FCA) shares hit a record high on Monday on growing expectations that the carmaker's coveted Jeep brand will unlock even greater value this year.
The stock jumped more than 20 percent last week on a bullish outlook for the auto sector and media speculation that Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne's final year at the helm could prompt strategic deals such as spin-offs, technology alliances and disposals.
That investor optimism gathered momentum on Monday, with the share price gaining another 3 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) analysts said that Jeep -- one of the main pillars of Marchionne's turnaround plan and a key profit driver for the group -- could make big strides this year as a global brand.
The Italian-American carmaker declined to comment.
Jeep is one of several brands in an FCA portfolio that also includes luxury Maseratis, sporty Alfa Romeos and mass-market Fiats. 
But it is the Jeep sport utility vehicles (SUVs) that Marchionne sees creating a high-margin brand with global appeal. 
""2018 will feature a number of operational and financial milestones that can accelerate investor appreciation of the commercial power of the Jeep brand in a way that can potentially drive very positive share price movements,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in their report.
The U.S. broker estimates that Jeep could make up nearly 70 percent of the company's profit this year. 
FCA has been retooling some U.S. factories to boost output of SUVs and trucks while ending production of some sedans to boost profitability in North America, its biggest market.
AMBITIOUS TARGETS
The move is slowly paying off and has put FCA on track to reach its ambitious 2018 profit targets, including erasing all debt and generating up to 5 billion euros ($5.99 billion) in net cash by the end of this year.
FCA unveiled a new Jeep Wrangler in November and a new Jeep Cherokee will enter production this quarter.
The popularity of the Jeep brand, which is targeting sales of 2 million vehicles this year, has prompted talk that it could be spun-off from the group, like tractor maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and supercar business  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), or sold off. 
FCA is already planning to separate two of its three components businesses -- Magneti Marelli and Comau -- to simplify its portfolio in a move some analysts said could help to push the shares further into the mid-to-high 20 euro range. 
But while Marchionne acknowledged last year that Jeep and truck brand RAM could stand on their own, he has never said he was considering spinning them off and has repeatedly warned that he has to worry about the ""stump that's left behind"" if he parts ways with FCA's most profitable parts.
FCA has been the subject of merger speculation, especially after its unsuccessful 2015 attempt to tie up with larger U.S. rival GM (N:GM). 
Its share price jumped to record highs in August after reports of interest from China's Great Wall Motor Co (SS:601633) and South Korea's Hyundai (KS:005380).
But besides potential mergers, a stable pricing environment, solid volume growth and the recently announced U.S. corporate tax reform could underpin auto stocks such as FCA this year, J.P. Morgan said last week.
FCA's Milan-listed shares closed up 1 percent on Monday at 18.11 euros, having touched an intraday peak of 18.48 euros.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is set to boost production of narrowbody jets in China as it nears a new multi-billion-dollar deal to supply the world's fastest-growing aviation market during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, industry sources said.
The deal is expected to be unveiled together with a package of agreements coinciding with the French leader's visit, and could include orders for around 100 jetliners, they added.
The final number of jets to be sold has not been determined. China is also said to be shopping for larger jets like the A330.
Airbus declined comment on Monday.
Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) compete for large-scale orders in China and such package deals are typically rolled out during major diplomatic events, but not without last-minute negotiations on the quantity and price of jets.
Boeing announced a deal for 300 aircraft during a visit to China by President Donald Trump in November.
About one in every four planes that Airbus produces is delivered to China, but fewer than 8 percent are assembled at its Tianjin facility outside Beijing - one of four A320 assembly plants including two in Europe and one in the United States.
Airbus is likely as part of any new airplane order to agree to lift the number of aircraft assembled in Tianjin from the current level of around 50 a year, the sources said.
NO A380 DEAL
The European planemaker is not, however, expected to announce a breakthrough in Chinese support for the 544-seat A380 superjumbo, whose future is threatened by poor sales.
The Financial Times reported earlier that Airbus was offering an industrial partnership on the world's largest airliner as part of Macron's visit to China.
Macron is accompanied by industry leaders, including Airbus planemaking president Fabrice Bregier, on his visit.
Industry sources said that Airbus has studied the possibility of selling China a stake in the A380 superjumbo program, but no immediate deal is on the table.
The idea, which has been on the back-burner in Toulouse for some time, would resemble Airbus's decision to take a stake in the Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries, but so far there has been little traction and no deal is imminent, one source said.
""It's not tomorrow,"" another source added, while others stress the A380's fate hinges instead on ongoing talks to sell 36 of the jets to Dubai's Emirates.
An Airbus spokesman said, ""We don't comment on speculation"".
Airbus believes that if the A380's future can be secured into the next decade, then China is likely to come into the picture because of its frenetic demand growth.
Airbus sees untapped demand for 100 Airbus A380s in China, while Boeing argues that traffic is better served by smaller jets. 
The U.S. firm is meanwhile expected to confirm its position as the world's largest planemaker when it announces 2017 deliveries on Tuesday. It has targeted 760-765 deliveries.

Despite a record December that saw Airbus hand over more than 700 jets for the first time last year, the first delivery of its newest model - the A350-1000 - slipped into 2018 and should happen ""early this year,"" a spokeswoman said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) on Monday named a UK-based executive of Czech subsidiary Skoda to replace its former head of U.S. sales whose departure was announced at the weekend as the German automaker's deliveries have plunged in the world's second-largest auto market.
Duncan Movassaghi will start the job on Feb. 1, VW said in a statement. He has been serving as managing director of Skoda UK with full responsibility for the brand in the United Kingdom.
Movassaghi replaces Ron Stach, whose departure VW confirmed on Saturday. It declined to provide a reason for the move. [nL8N1P10C4]
VW said last Wednesday that its U.S. sales rose 5.2 percent to 339,676 brand models last year but plunged 19 percent in December after posting their first monthly drop in 2017 in November.
The world's largest automaker by sales is keen to end losses in the United States by the end of the decade, counting on a series of higher-margin new models and structural changes as it struggles to draw a line under its diesel emissions test cheating scandal which broke in the United States in 2015. [nL1N1O61SZ]

Prior to joining VW in 2010, Movassaghi worked in the pharmaceutical retail and banking sectors, the automaker said.

The company said in December its holiday season was off to a great start, with its highest traffic and largest sales ever on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Lululemon said it now expects fourth-quarter comparable sales to increase in the high single digits, on a constant dollar basis, compared with its previous forecast of a mid-single digit rise.
""We are thrilled with our performance this holiday season that reflects an accelerating trend across all parts of our business, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2018 and beyond,"" Chief Executive Laurent Potdevin said.
The Vancouver-based company said its forecast for a stronger profit excluded the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform, but it expects to take a significant tax charge in the quarter related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings.
Lululemon does not break down revenue by geography, but gets a significant amount of its sales from the United States.
The holiday-shopping quarter is critical for retailers and can account for up to 40 percent of their annual revenue. The National Retail Federation expects U.S. holiday sales of as much as $682 billion, nearly 4 percent higher than last year. Lululemon now expects net revenue of $905 million to $915 million for the quarter ending Jan. 28, implying year-over-year growth of 15-16 percent and higher than the forecast of $870 million to $885 million it gave on Dec. 6. The company expects earnings of $1.24 to $1.26 per share, up from its previous forecast of $1.18 to $1.21. It raised its adjusted earnings forecast to between $1.25 and $1.27 per share. Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of $1.22 per share and revenue of $883.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Lululemon's forecast was based on a 30.4 percent tax rate, and the company said it expects the new U.S. tax laws to be favorable to its effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. The company's shares rose 3.2 percent to a four-and-a-half year high of $81.92, before reversing course to trade down about 1.2 percent on Monday. 
Lululemon will report fourth-quarter results on March 27.

67,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Kohl's outstrips peers in best holiday season in years,"By Vibhuti Sharma and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Kohl's Corp posted far stronger same-store sales for the holidays than its bigger peers, as a revamp of its business model and a strategy to have more stand-alone department stores rather than at struggling shopping malls paid off.
Kohl's shares jumped nearly 9 percent to $59.07 on Monday, their highest since December 2016, after the retailer reported a 6.9 percent rise in same-store sales for November and December, putting it on track for its best holiday quarter in three years.
Analysts said that came courtesy of a revamp of Kohl's beauty departments and an increase in space for Under Armour Inc's sportswear, as well as a direct partnership with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to sell its smart-home products.
Store checks by industry research firm Retail Metrics also showed Kohl's was one of the busiest department chains during the holiday season due to its mix of low price private-label apparel offerings and desirable national brands.
""Even if Kohl's has a very weak January, (it) is poised to turn in its strongest quarterly same store sales gain in at least 3 years,"" said Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins.
Kohl's same-store sales growth topped the 1-4 percent increase posted by J.C. Penney Co Inc and Macy's Inc. Shares of Macy's, among the biggest victims of the shift to online shopping, fell 2.4 percent. Those of JC Penney were up 1.2 percent, reversing from a drop of nearly 1 percent.
""Unlike peers JCP and Macy's, Kohl's enjoyed consistent results in both November and December, with traffic in store positive while digital sales came in well ahead of the year-to-date trend,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said.
The figures follow a MasterCard Advisors report in late December that showed shoppers spent more than $800 billion in stores and online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24, a new record.
Separately, Canadian sportswear chain Lululemon Athletica Inc said the holiday season was better than it had expected and raised its profit and revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter.
Kohl's said it now expects fiscal 2017 earnings per share to come in between $4.10 and $4.20, versus its previous forecast of $3.72 to $3.92.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $3.64, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company also said its guidance did not include the impact of recent changes in U.S. corporate taxes, which are expected to benefit its effective tax rate and generate a favorable non-cash tax benefit.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",$11 billion biotech binge fuels forecasts of 2018 M&A surge,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - An $11 billion burst of biotech bids in just four days has fueled expectations of a 2018 surge in life science deals as large drugmakers shop for promising assets from smaller rivals.
Separate reports on Monday by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predict a significant rise in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) this year, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies' appetite for deals.
Celgene's (O:CELG) up to $7 billion agreed takeover of Impact Biomedicines, Novo Nordisk's (CO:NOVOb) $3.1 billion offer for  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX) and Takeda Pharmaceutical's (T:4502) plan to buy TiGenix (BR:G9U) for $630 million have already got 2018 off to a flying start.
This follows a relatively subdued 2017, when total life sciences M&A totaled around $200 billion, dominated by Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) $30 billion purchase of Actelion and Gilead's (O:GILD) $12 billion acquisition of Kite.
EY is confident this year's deal value will exceed $200 billion, given companies' increased financial firepower and balance sheet strength. There is also substantial pent-up demand, with 60 percent of life sciences executives surveyed in October 2017 planning to actively pursue M&A in the next 12 months, compared with 46 percent in April.
Baker McKenzie, meanwhile, predicts global healthcare M&A could rise 50 percent in 2018, with North America accounting for well over half of transactions.
Driving the demand is the increasingly pivotal role of biotech firms in discovering the drugs of tomorrow.
""I believe you will see a higher proportion of innovation at an industry level -- and also at  Novo Nordisk  -- coming from external resources,"" Novo's Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters.
""Ablynx is an example of strong technology development occurring in a smaller biotech setting, with considerable speed and a lack of some of the bureaucracy you can get at large pharma companies.""
NICHE DISEASES
U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light and a growing share of new products coming from younger biotech companies.
For large drugmakers, as well as big biotech businesses like Gilead and Celgene, small and innovative upstarts are now a vital source of experimental drugs with which to top up in-house development pipelines.
Pricing pressures on established medicines for conditions like diabetes and respiratory disorders, as well as patent expiries on yesterday's blockbusters, are driving big players into niche disease areas where biotech groups often excel, according to Edison analyst and former fund manager Andy Smith.
""The pressures at big pharma look to be increasing and 90 percent of prescriptions in the U.S. are now for generics, so that pushes companies to look at cutting-edge therapies and it takes them straight into the biotech wheelhouse,"" he said.
Whether 2018 will turn out to be a golden year for biotech M&A remains to be seen, but investors like event-driven hedge fund Case Equity Partners have high hopes for the drugs sector, following recent implementation of U.S. tax changes.
""U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now put capital to work in the global M&A market more easily. We hence expect 2018 to be immensely active with multiple competitive auctions at significant premia,"" the fund said in a an end-of-year letter.
Although bankers say the U.S. tax overhaul and particularly a lower tax rate for the repatriation of cash held offshore has so far had limited impact on deal negotiations, they believe companies may decide to allocate more cash to M&A in 2018.

The M&A outlook is likely to be a hot topic at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference starting on Monday in San Francisco, when many biotech deals and alliances are often announced.

GoPro also announced that it would exit the drone market despite having reached a number two market position in its price band with its Karma product.
The company explained that the product faces margin challenges in an extremely competitive aerial market and added that “a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States will likely reduce the total addressable market in the years ahead.”

78,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 09:47AM ET</span>",Wall Street is set up for an abnormal earnings season,"
Wall Street analysts have set the bar high for corporate America when it starts reporting earnings later this week. Or at least, their expectations aren't as low as they usually are.
In the fourth quarter, analysts who forecast earnings metrics for the S&P 500 companies they cover made the smallest cuts to their estimates for any quarter since 2010, according to FactSet.
They lowered the bottom-up earnings-per-share estimate by 0.3%, to $34.90 from $35. That's smaller than the average quarterly decline during the past year (-3.1%) and during the past five years (-4.2%), FactSet's data showed.
The overall estimate was not skewed by one or two sectors in which analysts are uniquely bullish. John Butters, a senior earnings analyst at FactSet, noted that analysts in seven out of the 10 S&P 500 sectors made cuts that were smaller than the five-year average.
However, a big contribution to the S&P 500's fourth-quarter earnings growth should come from the energy sector, as it continues to rebound from the oil crash of 2014.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) estimates 126% earnings-per-share growth from Q4 2015, which dwarfs second-place Materials by about 100 percentage points.
Wall Street's confidence means that companies may have a higher bar to beat in the coming weeks. Every quarter, there's a familiar pattern: expectations for earnings growth plunge into the reporting season. Companies end up beating these lowered expectations, giving investors more reason to bid up their share prices.
And across Wall Street, analysts are counting on earnings growth to keep this bull market going for longer.
That aside, this earnings season marks the end of an era.
That's because the fourth quarter was the last one before the most drastic changes to the US tax code in three decades.
""Given recent tax changes, 4Q17 provides the last apples-to-apples comparison for company results under the prior regime, and will therefore be of particular importance,"" said Jonathan Golub, the chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, in a note on Monday.
Over the next couple of weeks, analysts will be paying attention to guidance around each company's new effective tax rate as they make their final estimates for this year, Golub said. Additionally, they'd be listening out for details from companies on how they plan to spend capital returned from outside the US.
The fourth-quarter earnings season unofficially kicks off on Friday when JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) announce their results."

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has invited banks pitching for roles in its stock market listing, including Citi and Goldman Sachs, for meetings in the kingdom in the coming weeks to make their case, according to three banking sources familiar with the matter. 
The meetings are an indication that preparations for a 2018 initial public offering, which could be the biggest IPO in history, are progressing despite market speculation it could be delayed or even shelved. 
Executives from Citi (N:C), Goldman (N:GS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which are all bidding to be global coordinators for the share sale, are among the teams invited to present their pitches in person, said the three sources, including two bankers who expect to attend the meetings. 
The talks will be held at the end of January or beginning of February in the Eastern Province city of Dhahran, where the state oil company is headquartered, they added.
Two of the sources said the talks would involve members of the banks' equity capital markets teams, executives who would be directly involved in an IPO, rather than top management. 
Saudi Aramco, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment.
The stock market listing of the national champion is a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. 
The government, which aims to float up to 5 percent of the company this year, says Aramco is worth $2 trillion - but several industry experts have questioned whether a valuation that high is realistic. 
Aramco had asked the banks to present written pitches last month, according to the sources. The oil giant told bankers not to come up with a valuation, saying it had not provided enough financial information to do so, two of the sources said.
Preparations for the IPO might be gathering speed just as the price of oil has approached $70 per barrel, the highest since mid-2015, giving Aramco a better chance to achieve its desired valuation and become the world's most expensive company.
CROWN PRINCE
The listing  is a mammoth undertaking, and any banks chosen to be global coordinators will join JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and HSBC (L:HSBA), who were appointed last year. 
With so many banks expected to share the fee pool, the advisory mandates are not viewed in the industry as particularly lucrative. But bankers see such roles as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom's plan to revamp its economy.
In another sign that plans for the IPO are moving ahead, Saudi Arabia has changed the status of Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, according to a cabinet decree published in the kingdom's official bulletin last week. The change of status is a requirement for Saudi companies before they can list, a senior Aramco source told Reuters. 
However the final decision about if and when the listing takes place rests with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to several banking sources. 
The prince led an anti-corruption purge which saw several Saudi royals, ministers and businessmen detained late last year. It was the latest in a series of steps he had taken to assert Saudi influence internationally and amass more power for himself at home.

84,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>","Goldman, Citi Said to Be in Lead for Top Roles in Aramco IPO","(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabian Oil Co. is set to appoint banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). to help manage its initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said, as the state-owned crude producer pushes ahead with what could be the world’s largest share sale.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which have been advisers on the share sale, are also expected to be named as global coordinators, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Some banks pitching for roles on the IPO are tentatively valuing the company at between $1 trillion and about $1.5 trillion, they said.
The mandates could be finalized as early as this week, the people said. The list of banks isn’t final and more could be added, they said.
Aramco, as the company is known, last month asked banks to pitch for roles as coordinators and bookrunners for the IPO, people familiar with the matter said at the time. Saudi Arabia is seeking to sell as much as 5 percent of Aramco as part of a plan by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to set up the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund and reduce the economy’s reliance on hydrocarbons.
The sale could be the largest ever, based on the government’s $2 trillion valuation of the company. Aramco, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan declined to comment.
“This shows that the commitment to push ahead with the Aramco IPO is unrelenting as it’s a core pillar of the government’s economic diversification strategy,” said John Sfakianakis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center.
Sovereign Fund
Saudi Arabia is stepping up plans to diversify its economy away from oil under an economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The kingdom aims to transfer ownership of Aramco to the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund.
The IPO is moving ahead and all options are open on where to list shares of the giant oil producer, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said in December, dispelling reports that the process was delayed. The state-owned company has previously said the share sale is scheduled for later this year.
The November arrests of Saudi princes and officials accused of corruption won’t harm foreign investment or the kingdom’s plan for the offering, Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said that month.

The share sale has drawn interest from international stock exchanges in London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto, which are all competing to host the Aramco listing.
President Donald Trump personally lobbied Saudi King Salman to list Aramco on the New York Stock Exchange during a phone call between the world leaders in November. Later that month, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said London was “extremely well-placed” to win the listing.
The U.K. has already invested considerable political capital to try to secure the business for the London Stock Exchange. The government in November agreed to a $2 billion loan guarantee, an unusually large export credit guarantee that’s designed to finance the purchase of British goods, but that also opened May up to the suggestion she was trying to influence the listing decision.
Britain’s main financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has also drawn criticism for proposed changes to listing rules that would make it easier for Aramco to trade in London.

96,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","Pimco, Citigroup Sound Complacency Alarm for Global Economy","(Bloomberg) -- Two of the biggest hitters in financial markets are sounding warnings against complacency in the global economic outlook.
After the first week of 2018 saw strong data and multiple stock-market records,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Pacific Investment Management Co. told clients in the last few days that there are still reasons to be worried.
While both agree there are some causes for optimism, they cite geopolitical factors, a removal of central bank stimulus and the risk of an inflation overshoot as possible catalysts for an end to the current economic expansion and market exuberance.
Investors are showing few signs of unease with global stocks at record highs and volatility measures still subdued. While riskier assets have recorded further gains in the first trading week of the year, Mark Schofield at Citi warned the potential payoff from such trades is diminishing.
“It is too early to call an end to the bull-market in risk assets but the risk/reward profile is deteriorating as expected returns peak and volatility begins to rise. Asset allocators must weigh up where we are in the business cycle, and what comes next. The ‘Goldilocks’ environment cannot last forever; a plateau in growth would be more bearish than a pick-up in inflation.”
Meanwhile, Joachim Fels at Pimco points to signs that U.S. jobs growth may be peaking as a “a clear sign that we are reaching the later stages of the business cycle” -- a fact that also increases the chance of an inflation overshoot.
Still, the biggest risk is:
“Monetary overkill by central banks that seem more eager than ever to escape from bloated balance sheets and the dreaded lower bound of interest rates. Led by the Fed, the tide of global monetary policy is turning, and when the tide goes out, we will find out who is swimming naked.”"
97,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Investors Should Heed Warning From Treasuries: Komal Sri-Kumar,"(Bloomberg View) -- U.S. equities responded to the Trump presidency with euphoria. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 25 percent in 2017, becoming one of the best-performing global asset classes. It was a different story with U.S. Treasuries: The yield on 10-year notes fell slightly from 2.44 percent at the end of 2016 to close 2017 at 2.41 percent. And the spread in yield between two-year and 10-year notes, often a signal of slowing growth or forthcoming recession, plunged from 125 basis points to 51.8 basis points at year-end 2017.
As they receive different messages from equities and Treasuries, investors should pay particular heed to the bond market in making asset-allocation decisions for 2018. Treasuries have been a better predictor of the two recessions in the 21st century -- the first lasted from March to November 2001, and the second from December 2007 to June 2009. In the case of the latter, yields plunged during the months before the recession whereas equities remained strong well into the first half of 2008 when the economy was already in a downturn.
There is good reason to believe Treasuries are sending a warning now.
The bond market’s sense of caution in 2017 was not assuaged by the successful passage of the tax bill. While the yield on 10-year notes rose to almost 2.50 percent on Dec. 20 when it became clear the measure would pass and get President Donald Trump’s signature, it fell subsequently, closing the month little changed.
The surge in equities stemmed from corporate earnings that exceeded consensus estimates in recent quarters and, lately, the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Nonetheless, the decline in bond yields signals that the surge in equities may not be accompanied by faster economic growth or a significant pickup in inflation.
Narrower spreads between two- and 10-year Treasuries also reflect speculation that the Fed’s stated objective of raising the federal funds rate three times in 2018 may not be met. If the economy slows significantly after an initial burst of optimism over the tax cuts, the 10-year yield is likely to fall further even as the two-year yield rises with Fed tightening, eventually resulting in an inverted yield curve. Yield curve inversion was the harbinger of recessions in 2001 and 2007–2009.
While recessions have always been preceded by the two- to 10-year spread going negative, a negative spread has not always ended in a recession. For example, the inversion of the yield curve in May through June 1998 did not deter gross domestic product from rising in inflation-corrected terms by more than 3 percent in 1999 and during the first half of 2000.
This has led some market watchers to suggest that a potential negative spread should not be a source of concern. There are several reasons I disagree with this sanguine view. 
First, wage growth remains anemic despite the quintupling of the Fed’s balance sheet since the financial crisis and the still-low interest rates almost 10 years later. This may not be offset by the recent tax package. Nonpartisan institutions such as the Congressional Budget Office have calculated that the benefits of the tax cuts are tilted heavily in favor of upper-income earners who are not major consumers. Consumption accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. gross domestic product.
Second, the new regulations incorporate reduced government spending on health care. This will discourage consumption by low-income and elderly Americans even as lower tax rates are intended to increase spending.
Third, a pickup in economic growth is contingent on companies responding to the lower corporate tax rate by hiring more workers and increasing their wages. Global competition from low-cost producers will limit U.S companies’ ability to achieve these goals, and stock buybacks and increased dividends are the more likely outcome. That is why the recent surge in equity prices is a logical outcome even as inflationary expectations remain low, resulting in lower bond yields.
In sum, as investors consider where markets are headed in 2018, they should be especially mindful of the message from the bond markets. From their current lofty valuations, equities cannot keep rising for long if bond yields and the economy do not cooperate.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",U.S. bank gains from tax law start with red ink,"By David Henry and Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. bank executives and investors expect a long-term boost from the new federal tax code, but the biggest lenders will first need to book multi-billion-dollar charges that will muddle fourth-quarter results.
Banks will adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for a lower corporate rate, and also take charges related to other tax changes. But analysts said the overall benefit from lower taxes will make up for any short-term hit.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) could report a quarterly loss of more than $15 billion and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) will likely have lost about $3 billion, based on analyst estimates and recent profit warnings.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) which reports first on Friday morning, could show a 35 percent plunge in net income from a year earlier. Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), which reports the following Wednesday, could show a 50 percent drop.
""It is no doubt going to be a messy quarter,"" said Jason Goldberg, bank stock analyst at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
Citigroup is expected to take a $20 billion charge, largely because its losses during the 2007-2009 financial crisis will offset future taxes less now that the corporate tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Goldman is expected to take a $5 billion charge, mostly due to a new repatriation tax on income kept outside of the United States.
Meanwhile, banks with deferred tax liabilities will be able to write those down thanks to the lower tax rates.
In an extreme case,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is expected to report a $2.5 billion boost to its bottom line largely because it will owe less tax in the future on income from a set of businesses including mortgage servicing.
But most analysts and institutional investors brush aside big one-time items, viewing them as accounting charges that reveal little about underlying financial performance or future profits.
Instead, they are confident that big banks will be largely better off from paying a lower tax rate. Still, just how much each bank will benefit will vary based on where they earn their income. 
Bank of America could earn $4.5 billion, or 19 percent, more in 2019 than it would have without the lower rates, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. That would more than cover an expected $3 billion fourth-quarter charge.
But Citigroup might get a profit pickup in 2019 of only $1.7 billion, or 11 percent, Kleinhanzl said. That would be far less than the $19.7 billion he expects in total fourth-quarter charges. 
Bank of America earns about 90 percent of its income in the United States, according to estimates by analyst Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs. Citigroup, meanwhile, has been getting only about 50 percent of its earnings at home, so will not benefit as much from lower U.S. tax rates.
Analysts plan to push executives in conference calls for clues about whether investors will benefit as much as they hope.
Banks could provide a boon by putting more money toward stock buybacks and dividends. But there is worry they will be too quick to shift those dollars towards trying to beat competitors with lower prices on loans and better services for customers.

""Banks benefit from a lower corporate tax rate,"" said Barclays' Goldberg, ""but what will they do (with the extra money)?""

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares hit their highest level in more than two years on Monday as confidence over global economic growth continued to boost investor appetite for world stocks. 
A buoyant auto sector, fresh dealmaking activity and a better-than-expected update from chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor also buoyed sentiment, lifting the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up as much as 0.4 percent to levels last seen in August 2015. 
The pan-European index pared some of the opening gains and was up 0.2 percent by 1000 GMT. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) added 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE (FTSE) was flat.
The European auto index (SXAP) led sectoral gainers, up 1 percent to its highest since May 2015, extending last week's strong rally on upbeat prospects for the sector this year.
Italian-American automaker  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) rose as much as 3 percent to a new all-time high after a note from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) highlighting the potential of a spin-off of its Jeep brand. 
""2018 is an extremely important year for Jeep from a product and strategic perspective, which we believe can gain investor attention and continue to unlock the discount on the stock,"" analysts at the U.S. brokerage said.
Elsewhere in the sector France's  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) was up 1.2 percent, while Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) rose between 0.3 and 1.7 percent. 
On the M&A front,  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) inched up slightly after the Danish drugmaker said it had made a 2.6 billion euros bid for Belgian biotech group  Ablynx  (BR:ABLX), offering a 32 percent premium to Friday's closing price.

Night shift workers at automotive supplier Kirchhoff in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia walked out on Monday, as did employees of farming machinery maker Claas, according to the union.
""The employers provoked these warning strikes with their behavior at the negotiating table,"" Knut Giesler, head of IG Metall in North Rhine-Westphalia, said.
The country's biggest union is demanding a 6 percent wage rise this year for about 3.9 million workers.
Employers have dismissed the pay claim as excessive and so far offered a 2 percent increase plus a 200 euro ($241) one-off payment in the first quarter.
The union is also demanding a shorter working week.
In Berlin, around 400 workers at elevator maker OTIS are expected to walk out on Monday morning, and other companies are to follow suit later in the day, IG Metall said.
The dispute comes against the backdrop of an economic upswing in Germany that pushed the country's unemployment rate down to a record low in December.
Talks between unions and employers' associations have been set for Jan. 11 for workers in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Porsche, Mercedes-Benz maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and automotive suppliers including Bosch [ROBG.UL].
In Bavaria, where major companies such as premium carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG) and engineering group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) are based, negotiations will resume on Jan. 15. The populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to companies such as Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), is to follow on Jan. 18.

Airline shares surged on Monday amid expectations that the move will boost profits, with the Lunar New Year national holiday approaching in February.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China said late on Friday that it would allow airlines to decide their own prices on domestic routes that have at least five carriers competing. Price increases of no more than 10 percent would be allowed for each travel season.
""Every one percent rise in the domestic ticket price system-wide boosts the Chinese airline sector's earnings by 7 percent based on our estimates,"" said Corrine Png, Singapore-based chief executive of transport research firm Crucial Perspective. 
China Southern Airlines (HK:1055) likely would be the biggest beneficiary as it had the largest domestic market share, she added. 
China Southern shares leapt more than six percent to an over two-year high, while  Air China  (HK:0753) rose more than 8 percent to its highest level since Nov 2010 and China Eastern Airlines (HK:0670) climbed more than 5 percent. 
Beijing has pledged to allow market forces to play a more decisive role in its aviation industry to improve service quality and efficiency. 
It relaxed airfare restrictions for the first time in nearly a decade in 2013, and two years later allowed airlines to set ticket prices on 101 routes. 

The new ruling applies to at least another 306 routes, including the profitable Beijing to Shanghai route, according to the document that was dated Dec. 17 and published by the regulator on its website.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plans this spring to offer a diesel engine version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck, looking to gain a marketing edge as its main rivals ramp up more efficient pickups of their own.
Ford executives said they expect the F-150 diesel model with a 10-speed transmission to achieve 30 miles per gallon highway fuel efficiency, a level comparable to some midsize cars.
""We're confident we'll get there,"" David Filipe, Ford vice president of powertrain engineering, said at a briefing for media ahead of the official launch announcement.
The diesel F-150 will cost between $2,400 and $4,000 more than a comparable gasoline truck, depending on the specific model, Ford executives said. The diesel engine will be manufactured at a Ford plant in Britain.
Ford executives said they expect that once production ramps up about 5 percent of F-150 models will be ordered with the diesel engine. The model will be aimed at people who tow large recreational or work trailers.
Sales of big pickup trucks in the United States have surged in recent years as gasoline prices have stabilized at less than $3 a gallon in most states. Ford in 2017 sold 896,764 F-series trucks, more than in any year since 2005.
Still, Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) and the Ram brand of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) fight for the right to claim that their brands offer the most fuel-efficient large pickup - even when those high-mileage models have limited availability or cost more than conventional gasoline-fueled trucks.
Fiat Chrysler jarred its rivals in 2013 by offering a diesel engine in its light duty Ram pickup models and claiming best-in-class fuel economy. But last year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Justice Department charged that Fiat Chrysler improperly used software to cheat government emissions tests covering 104,000 Ram 2014-2016 models. 
The automaker is negotiating to settle the complaints and received government clearance to offer a 3.0 liter diesel in its 2017 and 2018 Ram trucks. That model is rated at 27 miles per gallon in highway driving.

Ford executives said they are confident their diesel will comply with U.S. emissions rules. Owners will need to refill a 5.4 gallon tank of fluid for the exhaust treatment system roughly every 10,000 miles, Filipe said.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) has won the dismissal of a U.S. lawsuit accusing the coffee chain of overcharging customers by underfilling lattes and mochas to reduce milk costs.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers on Friday found a lack of evidence that Starbucks cheats customers by making its cups too small, using ""fill-to"" lines on baristas' pitchers that are too low, and instructing baristas to skimp on ingredients, such as by leaving a quarter-inch of space atop drinks.
The Oakland, California-based judge also rejected a claim that milk foam added to lattes and mochas should not count toward advertised volumes. She said reasonable customers expect foam to take up some volume, and the plaintiffs conceded that foam is an essential ingredient in their drinks.
""Accordingly, plaintiffs fail to show that lattes contain less than the promised beverage volume represented on Starbucks' menu boards,"" Rogers wrote.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Starbucks did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Lattes contain espresso, steamed milk and foam. Mochas are similar but also contain a chocolate sauce.
Siera Strumlauf and Benjamin Robles, both of California, and Brittany Crittenden of New York had accused Starbucks in their proposed nationwide class action of fraud and false advertising by underfilling 12-, 16- and 20-ounce lattes by about 25 percent, causing unspecified damages.
Starbucks countered that its cups hold more than the advertised number of ounces, and that the ""fill-to"" lines provide guidance to baristas as to how much cold milk, which expands when steamed, to pour into pitchers.
In 2016, two federal judges dismissed separate lawsuits accusing the Seattle-based company of cheating customers who bought iced beverages, finding that reasonable customers would understand that ice counts toward their drinks' contents.

The case is Strumlauf et al v Starbucks Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-01306.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2018 04:56PM ET</span>","Former WTO, Goldman and BP chief Peter Sutherland dies at 71","By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Former World Trade Organization director general Peter Sutherland, who was also a long-serving chairman of oil giant  BP  (L:BP) and the overseas arm of Goldman Sachs (N:GS), died on Sunday aged 71.
The Jesuit-educated barrister, who also served as Ireland's youngest attorney general and then youngest European Union commissioner during the 1980s, had been ill for some time, Irish broadcaster RTE reported, citing a statement from his family. 
""Peter Sutherland was a statesman in every sense of the word; an Irishman, a committed European and a proud internationalist,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement.
""He had a passion for public affairs and made a significant contribution to Ireland, Europe and the world over a number of decades.""
Born in Dublin in 1946, Sutherland was appointed, at the age of 35, as the state's most senior lawyer after little more than a decade at the bar. Four years later he was nominated as Ireland's EU commissioner, holding the competition portfolio as the EU's single market began to take shape.
Sutherland returned from Brussels briefly in 1989 and after a stint as chairman of Allied Irish Banks he became the WTO's first chief in 1995, having previously been head of its precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
Praising his international contribution to business, politics and human rights, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday described Sutherland as ""a giant of Irish, European and international public life"".
A spokesman for the WTO said that Sutherland's leadership, vision and courage were instrumental in the birth of the world trade body and that the lengthy Uruguay Round negotiations that led to its creation were by no means assured until the Irishman took charge.
While spearheading the WTO, Sutherland took up his roles at Goldman Sachs and BP. He was the oil major's longest-serving chairman, from 1997 to 2009, and held that role even longer at Goldman Sachs International, retiring in 2015 after 20 years in the job.
A passionate advocate of globalization and the EU and one of Ireland's best known public figures on the international stage, Sutherland continued in his role as United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration until close to his death.

""He leaves an important legacy through his work as Secretary-General, having brought the importance of migration to the forefront of public thought and policy,"" Irish President Michael D. Higgins said in a statement.

The company said it expects to eliminate 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs in Andover and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Groton, Connecticut, as it redistributes the money spent on research, according to the emailed statement. 
Pfizer is not making any changes to research and development funding for tanezumab, which is marketed as a treatment for joint pain from osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia treatment Lyrica, or its rare disease program. 
""This was an exercise to re-allocate spend across our portfolio, to focus on those areas where our pipeline, and our scientific expertise, is strongest,"" the company said.
Pfizer has invested heavily in research for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, and is one of several drugmakers, along with GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and Eli Lilly (N:LLY), that is part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital fund launched in 2015 by industry and government groups that seeks to develop treatments for Alzheimer's. 
However, some of Pfizer's investments have resulted in disappointment. In 2012, Pfizer and partner Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) called off additional work on the drug bapineuzumab after it failed to help patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's in its second round of clinical trials.
The company said on Saturday that it will launch a new venture fund to invest in neuroscience research projects. 

Pfizer is expected to make a presentation on Monday at the JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, a key annual event for healthcare investors.

The earliest issuance window will be ""toward the end of the first half of 2018,"" to allow time for certain procedures, including the board of governors' approval of AIIB's 2017 financial statements as well as borrowing and swap documentation, Xinhua said citing a statement from Elbech.
Elbech said the minimum size of the bond would be $1 billion, but as demand for the first bond issue from AIIB may be strong, ""we anticipate having to issue a larger size."" 
   In terms of bond's maturity, Elbech said the choice would be between three and five years depending on investor demand at the time, Xinhua said.
He said the bank planned to cap its total borrowing volume at $3 billion in 2018.
In November, AIIB Vice President Thierry de Longuemar told Reuters the inaugural U.S. dollar bond would likely be launched in Europe sometime in 2018.

The government outlined last year plans to sell stakes in order to finance a 10 billion euro ($12.0 billion) innovation fund.
It has since reduced its minority stakes in energy group Engie (PA:ENGIE) and car maker  Renault  (PA:RENA), and there has been speculation that Paris airport operator ADP (PA:ADP) and national lottery firm Francaise des Jeux (FDJ) are in line to be privatized.
""There have already been some (asset sales) and there will be more,"" Philippe said in an interview with Sunday paper JDD.
Asked if the government would present a privatization bill, a necessary step for ceding state control, he said: ""Yes. The question is not taboo.""
He declined to indicate the timetable for asset sales and did not mention any companies.

Last month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government would detail its asset sale program in early 2018, while the head of APE, which manages the state's corporate holdings, said the government had yet to make any decision over whether to privatize ADP.

Higher delivery figures across the group, which includes premium brands Audi (DE:NSUG) and Porsche, helped drive revenue above 220 billion euros ($264.62 billion) for the first time ever after the 2016 record of 217 billion euros, the newspaper said on Sunday.
A spokesman at Wolfsburg-based VW declined comment on the report. VW is due to publish official 2017 group sales data on Jan. 17 and will release core financial results in late February.
In 2016, the first full year after VW's emissions test-cheating ""Dieselgate"" scandal, group sales rose 3.8 percent to a record 10.3 million cars, helped by a double-digit increase in China and gains in Europe.

Toyota said last month it expected to sell 10.35 million cars worldwide in 2017 across its Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino brands, up 2 percent from 2016, and 10.5 million this year.

Kushner Cos was asked by the SEC for information on its use of the visa program, known as EB-5, in May 2017, according to a person the Journal said was familiar with the matter.
The EB-5 visa is a method for eligible immigrants to become lawful permanent residents, or ""green card"" holders, by investing at least $500,000 into a business in the United States that will employ 10 or more American workers. Most holders are wealthy Chinese individuals.
The Journal said the company also received a separate request from New York federal prosecutors in the same month for information on development projects financed in part by the EB-5 program.
Kushner, the White House and New York prosecutors did not reply to requests for comment from Reuters. The SEC could not be reached for comment.
""As we said months ago, we are cooperating with all government requests for information about our past legal use of the EB-5 program,"" a Kushner Cos representative said in a statement to Reuters.
The exact subject of the SEC’s inquiry, or whether it identified particular projects, is not clear, the Journal reported.
The Kushners' use of EB-5 visas to raise cash to finance developments came to broad attention in May last year, when Kushner’s sister, Nicole Kushner, spoke at a publicly advertised event in Shanghai to attract Chinese investment into a two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, called One Journal Square (NYSE:SQ), being developed jointly by Kushner Cos and KABR Group. The company later apologized for mentioning Jared Kushner's name while wooing investors.
The developers were seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the event’s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai, Reuters reported at the time. 
Kushner Cos is not a publicly traded company but the EB-5 is considered a securities offering, the Journal said, hence the SEC's interest. 

Kushner resigned from his role leading Kushner Cos when he was appointed Trump's senior White House adviser early last year but still owns a stake in parts of the business, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure form, the Journal said.

(Reuters) - Former Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) President Tatsuro Toyoda, who helped the Japanese automaker become a global industrial power in the early 1990s, has died at the age of 88, the company said on Saturday.
The son of the company's founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, he took a major role in Toyota's international expansion during the 1980s and 1990s and led the company from 1992 to 1995 as the automaker accelerated its global expansion. 
He was the first president of the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc, or NUMMI, plant in California in the mid-1980s, a joint venture with Detroit rival General Motors Co (N:GM) that demonstrated Toyota's highly efficient production system could be adapted to the culture of operations outside its home base of Japan.
NUMMI paved the way for Toyota's subsequent investments in its own U.S. assembly and component factories. Toyota now has 10 manufacturing operations in the United States.
Toyoda stepped down as company president in 1995. Toyota said in a short statement that Toyoda died of pneumonia on Dec. 30. He is survived by his wife, Ayako Toyoda.

Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, has left the automaker, a spokesman for VW in the United States said on Saturday, confirming a report by Automotive News.
He declined comment on the reason for Stach's departure. A spokesman at VW's global headquarters in Wolfsburg didn't return calls seeking comment. 
Stach, who joined VW's North America operations in 2006 and previously worked at Mazda Motor Corp's (T:7261) division in the region, couldn't be reached for comment.
VW said last Wednesday that its U.S. sales rose 5.2 percent to 339,676 brand models last year but plunged 19 percent in December after posting their first monthly drop in 2017 in November.
The world's largest automaker by sales is keen to end losses in the United States by the end of the decade, counting on a series of higher-margin new models and structural changes as it struggles to draw a line under its diesel emissions test cheating scandal which broke in the United States in 2015.
Stach became vice president of sales in March 2016, the same month that Michael Horn, the carmaker's then-CEO of North American operations, resigned. 
During VW's initial response to the emissions scandal, Horn was the carmaker's public face in the United States, apologizing days after the scandal became public on Sept. 18, 2015 and testifying before Congress.

Stach will be replaced temporarily by Derrick Hatami who joined VW of America last June as executive vice president for sales and marketing, VW said.

Carillion, which is involved in infrastructure projects for the British and other governments including Britain's planned high-speed rail link HS2, has been fighting for its survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business. 
It is also under investigation by regulators over ""the timeliness and content"" of statements it made before it issued a profit warning last year.
Sky News, quoting unidentified sources, said Carillion's rescue plan would involve handing back loss-making contracts, revising the terms of others and possibly accepting government financial support if it cannot secure private funding.
That could be a loan on commercial terms, a deal to reprice some contracts, or to allow Carillion to hand back loss-making work to the government, Sky News said.
A spokesman for Carillion declined to comment on the report.
Analysts have estimated the company has debt including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of about 1.5 billion pounds ($2.04 billion) compared with its market capitalization of about 70 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters data.
In December, Carillion said discussions with stakeholders regarding its options to cut debt and avoid a breach of debt covenants were ""progressing well"". 
Sky News said the company faced a funding gap of hundreds of millions of pounds and the precise size of the shortfall depended on whether it was able to get out of loss-making contracts. The company's lenders included  Barclays  (L:BARC), HSBC (L:HSBA) and Santander UK (MC:SAN), it said.
Carillion, which operates in Canada and the Middle East as well as Britain, last month brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Value stocks are getting a once-over from some U.S. growth fund managers in early 2018 as they prowl for overlooked shares they think have more upside in a market that gained nearly 20 percent last year. 
Value stocks, so labeled because they typically sport lower price-to-earnings valuations, tend to be in more staid or out-of-favor industries and often lag during outsized stock rallies, which is exactly what happened in 2017. 
The S&P 500 Value index (IVX) - a measure of companies such as  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and  JP Morgan Chase  & Co (N:JPM) - gained just 12.6 percent last year. That is a tortoise's pace measured against the far more hare-like S&P 500 Growth index (IGX), which doubled that performance. It clocked a 25.4-percent rise courtesy of its heavy contingent of tech giants like Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
As a result, even some growth funds are moving out of high-flying technology stocks and increasing their positions in stocks they see as more reasonably valued at a time when the American Association of Individual Investors survey shows the greatest exuberance for stocks since November 2014. 
""There is some risk to the technology sector after the big run we've had. Where we see opportunities now are sectors that have attractive valuations and higher visibility into their revenue streams,"" said Matthew Litfin, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.7-billion Columbia Acorn fund (O:ACRNX).
Litfin is now underweight technology and has been adding to its holdings of financial stocks, such as asset management  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ), which trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 15.1 versus 23.7 for the S&P 500 (SPX) as a whole. Lazard shares are up 5.8 percent so far in 2018.
Thyra Zerhusen, a co-portfolio manager of the $4.2 billion Fairepoint Capital Mid Cap fund (O:CHTTX), said she has been moving into the likes of toymaker  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE), whose corporate upheavals overshadow the value of their underlying assets. 
GE, for instance, trades at a trailing P/E of 21.2, and its shares are down 41.7 percent over the last year as new chief executive John Flannery has announced plans to shrink the company and exit some of its sprawling business lines. Shares of Mattel, meanwhile, slid 46 percent over the last 12 months as it suspended its dividend and cited the bankruptcy of Toys ""R"" Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, as a factor in its weak sales. 
""Last year was not a good environment for value, but now is a time when you can find investments that will go up substantially over the next two years,"" she said.
So far so good: Mattel is up 4.3 percent since the new year rang in, and GE is up 6.1 percent. The S&P is up about 2.3 percent. 
NO GUARANTEES
A good year for growth stocks does not necessarily mean that value stocks will bounce back the following year, of course. 
In the 20 previous occasions that the S&P 500 jumped by more than 18 percent in one year since 1951, the index rose by an additional 10 percent or more the following year 10 times, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), with growth stocks leading the way. The other 10 times the S&P on average declined 1.7 percent the next year.
Over the first three trading days of 2018, the iShares S&P 500 Growth index ETF (P:IVW) is up 2.9 percent, while the iShares S&P 500 Value index ETF (P:IVE) is up 1.6 percent. 
Yet Matthew Watson, a portfolio manager at James Advantage funds, said that his firm has been bracing for a significant correction in the so-called FAANG group of large tech stocks, such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) that jumped by 30 percent or more in 2017 and pulled the broad index higher. 
Instead, the firm has been adding to positions in out-of-favor energy stocks such as  Diamond Offshore  Drilling Inc (N:DO) and retailers such as Macy's Inc (N:M) that have under-appreciated assets, he said. 
Macy's, for instance, is trading barely above the value of its underlying real estate portfolio, Watson said, while Diamond Offshore trades at 70 percent of its book value, a measure of the value of the assets on a company's balance sheet. Macy's is down 3.3 percent in the first week of 2018, while Diamond Offshore is up 2.1 percent.
""There may be positive momentum in the stock market right now, but that is only going to make it more expensive,"" Watson said. ""We think that the only choice you have now to find opportunities that will pay off in the long-run is to look for value.""

137,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 07:13PM ET</span>",Businesses cautious in installing patches to fix chip flaw,"By Stephen Nellis and Jim Finkle
(Reuters) - Chances that a fix to a major microchip security flaw may slow down or crash some computer systems are leading some businesses to hold off installing software patches, fearing the cure may be worse than the original problem.
Researchers this week revealed security problems with chips from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and many of its rivals, sending businesses, governments and consumers scrambling to understand the extent of the threat and the cost of fixes. 
Rather than rushing to put on patches, a costly and time-intensive endeavor for major systems, some businesses are testing the fix, leaving their machines vulnerable.
""If you start applying patches across your whole fleet without doing proper testing, you could cause systems to crash, essentially putting all of your employees out of work,"" said Ben Johnson, co-founder of cyber-security startup Obsidian.
Banks and other financial institutions spent much of the week studying the vulnerabilities, said Greg Temm, chief information risk officer with the Financial Services Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry group that shares data on emerging cyber threats.
The flaws affect virtually all computers and mobile devices, but are not considered ""critical"" because there is no evidence that hackers have figured out how to exploit them, said Temm, whose group works with many of the world's largest banks.
""It's like getting a diagnosis of high blood pressure, but not having a cardiac arrest,"" Temm said. ""We're taking it seriously, but it's not something that is killing us."" 
Banks are testing the patches to see if they slow operations and, if so, what changes need to be made, Temm said. For instance, computers could be added to networks to make up for the lack of processor speed in individual machines, he added.
Some popular antivirus software programs are incompatible with the software updates, causing desktop and laptop computers to freeze up and show a ""blue screen of death,"" researcher Johnson said.
Antivirus software makers responded by rolling out fixes to make their products compatible with the updated operating systems, he said. In a blog posting on Friday,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said it would only offer security patches to Windows customers whose antivirus software suppliers had confirmed with Microsoft that the patch would not crash the customer's machine.
""If you have not been offered the security update, you may be running incompatible antivirus software, and you should consult the software vendor,"" Microsoft advised in the blog post.
Government agencies also are watching. The Ohio Attorney General's office is monitoring the situation, a spokesman said by email.
""Intel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time,"" the world's No. 1 chipmaker said on Thursday in a release.
It cited Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) and Microsoft as saying that most users had seen no significant impact on performance after installing the patches.
The cloud vendors are among a group of firms that quickly patched their technology to mitigate against the threat from one of those vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, which only affects machines running Intel chips.
Major software makers have not issued patches to protect against the second vulnerability, dubbed Spectre, which affects nearly all computer chips made in the last decade, including those from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD), and ARM-architecture manufacturers, including  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
However, Google, Firefox and Microsoft have implemented measures in most web browsers to stop hackers from launching remote attacks using Spectre.
Governments and security experts say they have seen no cyber attacks seeking to exploit either vulnerability, though they expect attempts by hackers as they digest technical data about the security flaws.
One key risk is that hackers will develop code that can infect the personal computers of people visiting malicious websites, said Chris Wysopal, chief technology officer of cyber security firm Veracode.
He advised PC owners to install the patches to protect against such potential attacks. Computer servers at large enterprises are less at risk, he said, because those systems are not used to surf the web and can only be infected in a Meltdown attack if a hacker has already breached that network. 
Microsoft has issued a patch for its Windows operating system, and Apple desktop users with the most recent operating system are protected. Google has said most of its Chromebook laptops are already protected and that the rest would be soon.
Apple said it planned to release a patch to its Safari web browser within coming days to protect Mac and iOS users from Spectre. 

While third-party browsers from Google and others can protect Mac users from Spectre, all major web browsers for Apple's iOS devices depend on receiving a patch from Apple. Until then, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users will be exposed to potential Spectre attacks while browsing the Web.

The expense is primarily related to taxes on unremitted offshore earnings, the company said.
Bristol said the charge will affect its previous forecast for net earnings per share and its tax rate, but will not have an impact on its outlook after adjusting for one-time items.
In October, the company said it expected full-year 2017 net earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.46 with an effective tax rate of 25 percent to 26 percent, while adjusted earnings were forecast at $2.95 to $3.05 per share with a tax rate of 22 percent.
Changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act include a permanent reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. It also exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, sets a one-time tax for U.S. business profits now held overseas, and prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. 
Bristol-Myers said it is still evaluating all the provisions of the legislation and currently estimates that the net impact on its adjusted tax rate will be roughly neutral in 2018. 

The drugmaker plans an update when it provides a full-year outlook on Feb. 5.

LINCOLN, Neb. (Reuters) - Opponents of TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL pipeline appealed a decision by Nebraska regulators to approve a path for the project through the state, a lawyer for the opponents said on Friday.
The legal challenge throws up another obstacle to the long-delayed project, which environmentalists have made a symbol of their fight against climate change but which President Donald Trump supports as a job creator.
The Nebraska Public Service Commission in November approved a route for Keystone XL, lifting what appeared to be the last big regulatory hurdle for the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline linking the oil fields of Canada's Alberta province to U.S. refineries, initially proposed nearly a decade ago. 
But the approval was not for TransCanada's preferred path, and was instead for an alternative route that shifted it eastward to an existing pipeline right-of-way. 
Lawyers for opponents of the pipeline - which include landowners along the route - have argued that the commission was not permitted to approve anything but the original route TransCanada had requested in its application.
Attorney David Domina told Reuters on Friday that TransCanada's approval was for a ""route not supported by an application. ... So we appealed."" The appeal was filed on Dec. 29.
A TransCanada official declined to comment.
The proposed pipeline has been a lightning rod of controversy for nearly a decade, pitting environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against business advocates who say the project will lower fuel prices, shore up national security and bring jobs.
The Trump administration granted TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March, reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds. That left Nebraska - the only one of three states that had not approved a route for the line - as the final hurdle.

TransCanada has said it expects enough commercial support to make the project viable, though it has not made a final investment decision.

144,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:15PM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley to take $1.25 billion hit in fourth-quarter from tax bill,"By Diptendu Lahiri
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) said on Friday it would take a $1.25 billion hit in its fourth-quarter earnings due to a cut in corporate tax rate as part of the U.S. tax code overhaul. 
The net blow of the bill to the bank will include about a $1.4 billion net discrete tax provision, mainly due to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lowered corporate tax rate, the company said in a filing. 
It would be offset by $160 million in other positive effects, Morgan Stanley added. The sweeping tax code changes enacted in late December cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and were expected to mean short-term pain, but long-term gain for U.S.-based corporations. Scores of large companies, including big banks such as  Citigroup  (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), have socked away an estimated $2.8 trillion overseas in recent years.  The one-time tax on those earnings is expected to raise $339 billion in federal revenues over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), a nonpartisan research arm of the U.S. Congress. 
Morgan Stanley's arch rival  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) had said on Dec. 29 it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to decrease by about $5 billion due to repatriation tax, the cost of moving money from foreign countries to the U.S., Goldman said in a filing.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 04:54PM ET</span>",Race car driver Tucker gets more than 16 years for lending scheme,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Kansas businessman and race car driver was sentenced to 16 years and 8 months in prison on Friday for crimes related to his online payday lending business, which prosecutors said made more than $3.5 billion as it exploited millions of cash-strapped consumers.
Scott Tucker, 55, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan. He was found guilty by a jury in October of violating federal truth in lending and racketeering laws.
Tucker did not make a statement at his sentencing, referring instead to a letter he submitted to the court in December. In that letter, Tucker said he was ""remorseful"" for ""the misperception that I do not recognize my responsibility to live as a good and fair business man, employer, and American citizen.""
Castel said the letter showed Tucker had not accepted that his conduct was criminal.
""The notion that Mr. Tucker is just an honest businessman doesn't fly with me,"" he said.
Tucker's lawyer, Lee Ginsburg, said he would appeal.
Castel also sentenced Timothy Muir, 46, a lawyer who worked with Tucker and was convicted of the same charges in October, to seven years in prison. Muir's lawyer, Thomas Bath, said he would appeal as well.
Tucker and Muir were indicted in February 2016 amid efforts by the federal government to crack down on abuses by payday lending companies.
Such companies say they help consumers by offering small loans that are to be repaid in a short time, often from the person's next paycheck, but critics say they exploit borrowers through high interest rates and fees.
Prosecutors said Tucker's Kansas-based business, which operated under names including Ameriloan and OneClickCash, routinely charged interest rates as high as 700 percent, exploiting more than 4 million people from 1997 to 2013.
After several states brought lawsuits over the lending, prosecutors said, Tucker entered into sham relationships with Native American tribes. By claiming his companies were owned by tribes, prosecutors said, Tucker was able to shield the companies from lawsuits using tribal sovereign immunity.
Tucker, who has competed on U.S. and European racing circuits, was previously convicted of making a false statement to obtain a bank loan and of running a fraudulent financial services business. He was sentenced in 1991 to a year in a federal prison for the latter crime.

Tucker was also charged in Kansas last month with filing a false tax return. That case remains pending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for the Justice Department and AT&T Inc (N:T) said on Friday that preparations have been smooth for a trial to decide if the wireless and pay TV giant may buy movie and TV show maker  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX). 
""Things have been moving as they ought to,"" said Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath in a pre-trial status conference.
The Justice Department sued in November to stop AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless company, from buying Time Warner for $85 billion because of concerns that it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers and hamper the development of online video.
Conrath said that the government had held depositions on Thursday and Friday.
Daniel Petrocelli, who represents DirecTV owner AT&T as well as Time Warner, said that the Justice Department planned 41 depositions.
Petrocelli said that the government had put 35 potential witnesses on a preliminary list while AT&T had 22. Neither man identified the witnesses or people being questioned in depositions.
The next status hearing was set for Jan. 19.
Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will oversee a trial that begins on March 19 and run about 15 days. The companies recently extended the termination date for the deal to June 21.
The fate of the deal has been widely followed because U.S. President Donald Trump criticized it on the campaign trail in 2016 and has repeatedly attacked the reporting of Time Warner's CNN news network.

Trump recently renewed his opposition to the deal. ""I think your pricing's going to go up. I don't think it's a good deal for the country,"" he said in November.

147,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Take a peek at the top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
US Stocks Sidestep Weak Jobs Report to End Week at All-Time Highs 
The US jobs market ended 2017 on a sour note after data showed the US economy created just 148,000 jobs in December, below the 190,000 jobs forecasted by economists, while wage growth, was in line with expectations, rising 0.3%.
Some participants said the soft jobs report would dampen the case for Fed rate hikes as the central bank would need further evidence of inflationary pressures to hike rates in March.
While others said the report would have limited impact on monetary policy amid a transitionary phase for the Fed as current Fed chair Janet Yellen is expected to make way for incoming Jerome Powell in a few months.
That said, however, falling expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes weighed on interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as financials which fell heavily Friday.
In sharp contrast, however, technology stocks appeared to be picking up from where they left off in 2017, rounding off the week with solid gains driving the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite to close at all-time highs.
WTI Crude Oil Extends Weekly Winning Steak 
Despite closing nearly 1% lower on Friday, crude oil prices notched a fourth straight weekly gain as investors weighed rising US production against the prospect of supply disruptions in Iran and tightening US supplies.
U.S. production rose 28,000 barrels a day (bpd) to nearly 9.8 million barrels a day, Energy Information Administration reported Thursday, sparking fears that US crude production could rise above 10 million bpd.
Investor optimism rose for a faster pace of rebalancing in markets after a Reuters survey underscored OPEC’s commitment to ridding the market of excess supplies as its compliance with the deal to trim output rose to 128% in December from 125% in the previous month.
Crude oil futures settled at $61.44, down 0.92%, on Friday.
Dollar Down in the Doldrums
It was miserable week for the dollar as it struggled to rebound from three-month lows against its major rivals despite a less dovish-than-expected Federal Reserve Open Market Committee minutes released Wednesday.
The central bank cited the possibility of a steeper path of rate hikes should fiscal stimulus boost output beyond its maximum sustainable level.
Gold Shakes off Prospect of Global Monetary Policy Tightening 
Gold prices have remained steady in recent weeks despite expectation for tightening global monetary as both the Bank of England and Bank of Canada are expected to follow the Fed’s lead and raise rates again this year.
The Bank of Canada could raise rates as soon as the end of the January, CIBC’s Nick Exarhos said, as Friday’s bullish labor market report strengthened the central bank’s case to raise rates.
Nomura’s George Buckley – who correctly predicted that the Bank of England would hike interest rates in November – said recently that there is room for more rate hikes, estimating the central would raise rates four times by the end of 2019 to curb inflation, which is running well above target.
Bitcoin Makes Stand Against Small Cap Cryptocurrencies
After days of getting pummeled, Bitcoin rose sharply on Friday above a psychological $16,000 barrier as the popular digital currency attempted to recover recent losses.
On the Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin rose to $16,765, up $1173.5, or 11.83%, as it looks to test its recent all time high of $19,891 set in December.
Bitcoin’s hold over the cryptocurrency market has waned in recent months as investors rotate from large cap cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to small cap cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s market cap accounts for just 36% of the overall cryptocurrency market, compared to about 80% in early 2017.
Ripple XRP was one of the beneficiaries of the “great rotation” after it rose above $3 on the poloniex exchange Thursday amid bullish expectations that RippleNet, the technology behind the cryptocurrency, would continue to garner support from major financial institutions.
XRP fell more than 30% on Friday, however, as Coinbase quashed rumours that it was working on a plan to launch support of Ripple.
There was a shakeup in the top 10 cryptocurrency standings by market cap as Stellar, Cardano, and Tron moved up the ranks. While Ethereum lost its place as the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap as it struggled to hold gains after hitting an all-time high above $1,000 on Thursday."
148,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>","S&P 500, Nasdaq post best week in more than a year","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq notched their best weekly gains in more than a year on Friday as technology stocks helped lift major indexes to records.
It was the strongest start to a year for all three major indexes since 2013.
A U.S. tax overhaul last month that includes hefty corporate tax cuts helped to fuel late-year gains and was the first major legislative victory in President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda since he took office a year ago. 
U.S. stocks this week have been adding to momentum from 2017, driven by a series of strong economic reports from across the globe and expectations for strong fourth-quarter earnings, with all three major indexes hitting milestones in the last few days. 
The Dow broke above 25,000 for the first time on Thursday, while the S&P closed above 2,700 on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 earlier in the week.
""We're up over 2 percent for the first four days of 2018, so that's pretty good. Markets are still working to figure out the implications of tax cuts, and that's provided some of the lift along with already good economic forecasts,"" said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Private Client Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.
Weaker-than-expected December U.S. jobs data also could help the Federal Reserve stick to its policy of gradual interest rate hikes in 2018, which would be good for stocks, Baele said.
U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December amid a decline in retail employment, but a pickup in monthly wages pointed to labor market strength. Non-farm payrolls increased by 148,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 190,000. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 220.74 points, or 0.88 percent, to 25,295.87, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 19.16 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,743.15 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 58.64 points, or 0.83 percent, to 7,136.56.
The S&P technology index's (SPLRCT) 1.2-percent gain led the advancers among the 11 major S&P sectors, with gains in Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple (O:AAPL) and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) boosting the index.
The year's strong start follows a surprisingly sharp rally in 2017 that ended with the S&P 500 up 19.4 percent on the year.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.4 percent. Those were the biggest weekly gains for the S&P and Nasdaq since December of 2016.
Among declining stocks, Francesca's Holdings (O:FRAN) tanked 20.7 percent. The women's apparel and accessories maker said it expected up to 17 percent decline in current-quarter same-store sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, the same as the 6.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) has pulled Bloomberg L.P.'s news network, Bloomberg TV, from 4.6 million of its pay-TV customers after the financial news provider asked the carrier to pay it for its content for the first time ever. 
Verizon said it took down the news network last month because it did not want to pay for it when viewers can access it for free online. It remained unclear whether the companies could come to an agreement allowing the network to return to Verizon's customers. 
""Bloomberg is proposing that we pay for content that they make available to all consumers for free on their website and mobile app,"" the company said in its alert to Verizon's FIOS TV customers about the removal of Bloomberg TV. 
Verizon is advising customers to go to Bloomberg's website and app to watch Bloomberg TV, a Verizon spokeswoman said. 
A spokesman for Bloomberg declined to comment.
Cable and satellite companies have been losing more subscribers, making them much less willing to pay up for television programing that is also available online.
Six U.S. cable providers, including Verizon, lost more than 1.6 million subscribers through the third quarter of 2017.
Verizon is one of a growing number of distributors that are using a new negotiating tactic with programmers by referring customers to the programmers' own streaming services. This week, Altice USA Inc, advised customers to sign up for Starz' online streaming service after it pulled its channels from 3.4 million of its customers.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg has been focused on expanding its online viewership. In December it launched a 24/7 news service with Twitter to reach the microblogging service's 330 million active users. 

The service, called ""TicToc by Bloomberg"" is primarily new content exclusive to the platform, but there is some overlap with Bloomberg TV, according to sources familiar with the situation.

155,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Ex-ArthroCare CFO gets four years in U.S. prison for fraud scheme,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - The former chief financial officer of medical device company ArthroCare Corp was sentenced on Friday to more than four years in prison after pleading guilty to participating in what federal prosecutors called a $750 million securities fraud.
Michael Gluk, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas, after pleading guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and securities fraud, the U.S. Justice Department said.
The sentencing came after Gluk in August testified at the trial of former ArthroCare Chief Executive Officer Michael Baker, who was convicted of securities fraud, wire fraud and other charges and sentenced in November to 20 years in prison.
Both men were convicted at a trial in 2014. But a federal appeals court in January 2016 overturned their convictions after finding that evidence was improperly excluded from the trial.
Gluk had been serving a prison sentence of 10 years when the appeals court overturned his conviction. He is expected, as part of his new sentence of 50 months in prison, to receive credit for the 13 months that his lawyers said he had already served.
Sparks ordered Gluk to pay a $50,000 fine and to forfeit $677,804, the Justice Department said. A lawyer for Gluk did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors said Baker and Gluk, along with others, schemed from 2005 to 2009 to prop up ArthroCare's stock price by artificially inflating sales and revenue through a series of transactions with distributors.
Two other ex-ArthroCare executives, John Raffle and David Applegate, pleaded guilty to felonies in 2013 stemming from their involvement in the scheme. They were sentenced to prison terms of 80 months and 60 months.
ArthroCare agreed in January 2014 to pay a $30 million penalty and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to end a Justice Department probe.
The Austin-based company was acquired later that year by British medical equipment company Smith & Nephew Plc (L:SN) in a $1.7 billion deal.

158,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>","Dow Jones Bags 200 Points, Notches Best Week Since November","Investing.com – US stocks closed at record highs amid risk-on sentiment as a sharp rally in tech stocks offset weakness in banks amid a weak jobs report which reined in expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher at 25,295.39. The S&P 500 closed 0.70% higher, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 7136.56, up 0.83%.
Financials gave up most of Thursday’s gains as expectations for a more aggressive Federal Reserve’s approach to rate hikes were scaled back following non-farm payrolls data which undershot economists’ forecasts.
The negative day for financials comes just a week ahead of a raft of bank earnings on Jan. 12, when JPMorgan and Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) are expected report earnings. 
The Labor Departed reported the US economy created just 148,000 jobs in December, below the 190,000 jobs expected by economists, while wage growth, was in line with expectations, rising 0.3%.
The subdued jobs report reduced investor expectations for a more aggressive path to higher interest rates, said TD Securities, as the Federal Reserve would likely need to see more “convincing evidence” of inflationary pressures prior to raising rates in March.
Technology, meanwhile, continued to advance building on gains earlier this week as FANG stocks – an acronym for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) – closed more than 1% higher lifting the broader market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top staffer for one of the most vocal U.S. congressional critics of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was named on Friday as the watchdog's chief of staff as it undergoes a major transformation under the Trump administration.
Kirsten Sutton Mork, former staff director for the House Financial Services Committee, will assume the role ""in the coming weeks,"" Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs that panel, said in a statement. He is one of the CFPB's most vociferous critics.
The position was last filled by Leandra English, who is now the agency's deputy director. English had been a top deputy of former Director Richard Cordray, who resigned in November and contended English should take over the agency. She sued the administration in November, claiming that Cordray had legal grounds to name his successor until a full-time director was named by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.
Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump's budget director who is CFPB acting director, has vowed to move the agency away from its agenda under President Barack Obama.
The financial industry has long complained the CFPB was too aggressive in its rulewriting and enforcement, and that its single director enjoyed too much power. But consumer advocates have called it a critical safeguard for Americans.
Also on Friday, Hensarling said that Shannon McGahn would return to the Financial Services Committee to fill the staff director role. McGahn most recently was a top advisor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>","Author of Trump book contradicts president, says aides see him as a 'child'","By Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The author of a deeply critical book about Donald Trump's first year in office said on Friday he had spoken with the president while working on it, contradicting Trump's assertion that he had never talked to the writer for the book and had not authorized any access to the White House.
Michael Wolff's book ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" was an instant bestseller on Friday, its release pulled forward after published excerpts this week set off a political firestorm, threats by Trump lawyers of legal action and an effort to halt publication.
The book, dismissed by Trump as full of lies, depicts a chaotic White House, a president who was ill-prepared to win the office in 2016, and Trump aides who scorned his abilities. Standing by his reporting, Wolff told NBC on Friday that Trump aides had all told him they viewed him as child-like. 
""I absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don't know, but it was certainly not off the record,"" he said on NBC's ""Today"" program. Wolff added that he had spoken to people who spoke to Trump on a daily, ""sometimes minute by minute"" basis.
Asked to clarify what he meant when he wrote that Trump's entire circle questioned his fitness for office, Wolff said, ""100 percent of the people around him ... They all say he is like a child.""
On Thursday evening, Trump tweeted, ""I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book.""
""Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don't exist,"" Trump added.
The early excerpts have also caused a public rift between the president and his former chief strategist and top campaign aide, Steve Bannon, over Bannon's comments in the book about Trump and his family.
BEST-SELLER ON DAY ONE
Lawyers for Trump had called on the book's publisher, Henry Holt & Co, to halt the book's release, originally scheduled for Tuesday. Instead, it began sales early and on Friday, its first day in stores, ""Fire and Fury"" was the top-selling book on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In Washington, customers lined up in bitterly cold weather to purchase a copy at KramerBooks, which began selling copies at midnight. Many Washington-area bookstores, including KramerBooks, reported selling out of copies as of Friday morning at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT). 
Justin Bethel, manager of the Politics and Prose bookstore, said its 30 copies sold out quickly. ""It got so we couldn’t answer the phone, it was ringing so much,"" he said.
Politics and Prose customer Daniel Zhang, 22, said he and his housemate read a chapter online on Thursday night and he planned to read the book later on Friday. ""I’m going to finish work, and then I’m not going out tonight; I’m just going to go back and read this book,"" said Zhang.
The reaction was less frenetic in New York, Trump's old home base. Book Culture, an independent book seller in the Upper West Side neighborhood, said on Friday morning four people had bought the book and it had about 160 copies available, with 150 copies available in its other store.
The White House has said the book is riddled with errors, and campaign and administration officials have disputed events depicted in the book. 
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who has called the book trash, said again on Friday that Wolff had talked only briefly to the president and did not have wide access. 
""This is a guy who made up a lot of stories to try to sell books,"" Sanders said in an interview on Fox News Channel.
In a tweet on Friday, Trump called the book another attempt to smear him since any collusion between his election campaign and Russia ""is proving to be a total hoax."" 
Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion as part of a broader probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. He has not announced any conclusions.
""The Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable,"" Trump wrote. 
Charles Harder, Trump's personal lawyer, in a legal notice provided to Reuters, warned on Thursday of possible claims including libel against Wolff and Henry Holt & Co and threatened to try to block publication of the book. Harder also told Reuters that ""legal action is imminent"" against Bannon.

Bannon's reaction to the controversy has been muted. In interviews after the news broke with the conservative Breitbart News website, he called Trump a ""great man"" and pledged continued support for the president's agenda.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Neiman Marcus names Ralph Lauren executive as CEO,"By Richa Naidu and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group Ltd [NMRCUS.UL] on Friday named Geoffroy van Raemdonck, an executive at upscale clothing manufacturer Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL), to succeed Karen Katz as chief executive officer of the debt-burdened luxury retailer next month.
Katz, who has led Neiman Marcus since 2010, will retain her board seat after retiring as CEO on Feb. 12, the company said.
Van Raemdonck, 45, was Ralph Lauren's group president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and head of travel retail. He previously was CEO at St. John Knits International Inc, where he oversaw a turnaround of the luxury apparel retailer.
Neiman Marcus had been hunting for a CEO for some time, but several top executives at other companies spurned its approaches, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources. 
GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders said van Raemdonck's experience at St. John Knits could make Neiman Marcus more attractive to younger shoppers.
""He could be the breath of fresh air that Neiman Marcus needs,"" Saunders said. 
""That said, the biggest challenge is managing Neiman's debt load, which is a millstone around the neck of the company,"" he added. ""There are no easy solutions to this, and it is unlikely van Raemdonck has any tricks up his sleeve to remedy the problem.""
The company is struggling with a nearly $5 billion debt load, due mainly to its 2013 leveraged buyout by Ares and Canadian public pension fund CPPIB from other private equity firms.
Like other retail chains, Neiman Marcus has also suffered as customers move away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of online shopping.
Same-store sales rose for the first time in two years in its latest quarter, when it benefited from Katz's efforts to invest heavily in its online business.
Katz, 60, will be eligible to receive nearly $2.5 million as a lump sum following her retirement as CEO and another $1 million before March 14, 2019, Neiman Marcus said in a regulatory filing.

Van Raemdonck's annual base salary will not be less than $1 million, the company said.

(Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc (N:STZ) missed Wall Street estimates for third quarter revenue on Friday and said wine and spirit sales for the full-year would be at the low end of a previous forecast, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent.
Its stock recouped some of the losses later in the day after Chief Executive Robert Sands said the company was seeing no real impact on alcohol sales from the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in six U.S. states. 
The comments come two months after Constellation said it took a nearly 10 percent stake in Canada's biggest cannabis producer Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED), becoming the first major beer and spirits company to invest in legal cannabis.
""We really can't see any impact in terms of how it's (cannabis) affecting beverage alcohol in general and even in the 6 states, including California,"" Sands said on a conference call with analysts. 
He also said it was too early to tell whether Constellation's investment in the Canadian company would be ""cannibalistic or complementary"".
""There's just not enough information I think to really say how that's going to affect beverage alcohol in general going forward,"" Sands said.
Constellation said that the recent U.S. tax overhaul would reduce its net deferred tax liabilities by $300-$400 million, a non-cash benefit that would be reported in the current quarter. 
The company also announced a $3 billion share buyback program and raised in its full-year profit forecast. 
Its shares, up around 50 percent last year, were down 1.9 percent at $221.5 in afternoon trading. 
WINE AND SPIRITS DISAPPOINT
Wine and spirit sales, which make up a little less than a half of Constellation's total revenue, fell 10.3 percent in the third quarter, due to hurricanes in Florida and Texas, wildfires in California and a drop in demand from retail customers. 
The drop in sales also reflects the divestiture of the company's Canadian wine business in December 2016. 
The company said it now expects sales of wine and spirits, which include Robert Mondavi wines and Svedka Vodka, to be at the lower end of a prior forecast that already called for a decline of 4-6 percent for the full-year.
Rationalization of lower-margin wines and spirit brands alone will cause a 1 percentage point fall, Chief Financial Officer David Klein said on the call. 
Beer sales, the company's biggest business, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Depletions, or distributor shipments to retail customers, rose 9.1 percent due to the Labor Day and Thanksgiving holidays in the quarter. 
Net income rose to $491.1 million, or $2.44 per share, in the third quarter ended Nov. 30, from $405.9 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items the company earned $2.00 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.89 per share. 
Net sales fell marginally to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion. 
The company also raised its full-year profit forecast to $8.40-$8.50 per share. Analysts were expecting $8.43.

“There is some possibility this could light a fire under investment and really drive growth higher,” Bullard, a policy dove who has argued against raising rates, said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Michael McKee on Friday. “If that happens I would certainly take note of that and adjust policy appropriately.”
Bullard, attending the American Economic Association annual meeting in Philadelphia, said the U.S. economy expanded by around 2.5 percent or slightly higher last year.
Trump last month signed into law the most extensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, lowering taxes for corporations and most individuals.
“I have some sympathy for this idea you would get this investment boom coming out of this tax policy,” Bullard said. He noted that many companies are sitting on piles of cash, so could presumably have already stepped up investment if they had a desire to do so.
“As a monetary policy maker, with inflation pretty low, I can afford to wait and see if that really happens or not,” he said.
Bullard has opposed additional interest rate hikes and been the most dovish official on the Federal Open Market Committee, arguing that a low-growth economy with little inflation doesn’t require preemptive policy tightening.
While most of the FOMC predict a tightening labor market will raise wages and inflation, Bullard pointed out unemployment, already at a 16-year low, hasn’t shown any significant link to prices in recent years, and inflation remains below the Fed’s 2 percent target.
“We’ve really made no progress in the last two years toward our inflation target,” he said."

PARIS (Reuters) - The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance is pooling $200 million in a new mobility tech fund, three sources said, in the latest move by major carmakers to adapt to rapid industry change by investing in startups through their own venture capital arms.
The fund, due to be unveiled by Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn at the CES tech industry show in Las Vegas next Tuesday, will be 40 percent financed by  Renault  (PA:RENA), 40 percent by Nissan (T:7201) and 20 percent by Mitsubishi (T:7211).
""It will allow us to move faster on acquisitions ahead of our competition,"" one of the alliance sources told Reuters.
Frederique Le Greves, a spokeswoman for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, declined to comment. 
The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.
Wary carmakers are struggling to embrace changes and technologies that some of their executives are only beginning to grasp. To accelerate the process, many are investing directly in the new services - and gaining access to intellectual property - via their own corporate venture capital (CVC) funds.
BMW (DE:BMWG) has purchased stakes in a plethora of ride-sharing, smart-charging and autonomous vehicle software firms through its 500 million euro ($600 million) iVentures fund, the biggest such in-house facility belonging to a carmaker.
Among others that have been increasingly active are General Motors' (N:GM) GM Ventures, with $240 million, and Peugeot-maker PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) 100 million-euro investment arm.
CVC funds, a familiar feature of innovative sectors such as tech and pharmaceuticals, have become more commonplace among carmakers since the 2008-9 financial crisis. They let companies skip some of the formalities otherwise required for new investments, and pounce more swiftly on promising startups.
The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi venture will also obviate the current need to thrash out the ownership split for each new alliance acquisition.
It represents a further step in the integration of the carmakers as they pursue 10 billion euros in annual synergies by 2022. France's Renault holds a 43.4 percent stake in Nissan, which in turn controls Mitsubishi. Ghosn heads Renault and chairs all three.
The fund is being set up as a Dutch-registered joint venture headed by Francois Dossa, a former banker who led Brazil operations for  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and then for Nissan, the same people said. They declined to discuss specific investment plans.
Despite Nissan's ambitions to market fully autonomous cars by 2022 as well as a robo-taxi service, the Japanese carmaker has largely eschewed startups, preferring partnerships with established players such as software group DeNA Co. (T:2432)
Renault has made several such investments including Marcel, a Paris car-sharing platform, and Jedlix, a Dutch specialist in smart vehicle-charging technology. Renault's RCI Bank & Services arm took control of car-sharing aggregator Karhoo last year and plans to relaunch the business under alliance ownership.
Most or all of the Renault investments will be transferred to the new alliance venture's portfolio, the sources said.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Airbus in talks to sell at least 100 jets to China: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is in talks to sell 100 or more jetliners to China during a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to Beijing next week, people familiar with the negotiations said.
Macron plans to visit on January 8-10, accompanied by 50 company executives including planemaking officials from Airbus.
The value of a deal for around 100 aircraft would be over $10 billion at list prices, but could rise sharply depending on the breakdown between single-aisle and wide-body jets.
The total number of aircraft has yet to be agreed and has historically depended on last-minute commercial negotiations that coincide with such diplomatic visits.
China's central purchasing agency, China Aviation Supplies Holding Company, did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokeswoman for Airbus in China said: ""Discussions with customers are always going on, but we do not comment on speculation.""

In November, Boeing (N:BA) agreed to sell 300 planes worth $37 billion at list prices to China during a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico's attorney general vows to crack down on money laundering,"By Michael O'Boyle
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s acting attorney general said on Thursday prosecutors were already working to improve investigations and cooperation with other countries following an international report that blasted the country for failing to punish money launderers. 
Alberto Elias Beltran, Mexico's acting attorney general, told Reuters in an interview that the country was seeking to work better with the United States and Colombia to target financial networks of multinational drug gangs. 
Earlier this week, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization based in Paris that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, criticized Mexico for not systematically prosecuting money launderers. 
""There are important findings of opportunities for improvement at the attorney general's office,"" Elias said, noting in particular the room to improve the quality of money laundering investigations and the seizure of assets. 
The FATF report highlighted that Mexico has been slipping in successful convictions. The country already lagged regional peers such as Colombia and Brazil, both of which have made strides in setting up independent prosecutors.
The report also noted the ""low level of effectiveness"" in prosecutions and seizures and an ""extremely low level of effectiveness"" in punishing corruption. 
""We are working with the specialized offices (that target money laundering) where we are strengthening protocols,"" Elias said, adding that government agencies were also working to implement so-called parallel investigations. 
The FATF report underscored that Mexico was largely failing to carry out parallel money laundering investigations to match probes of organized crime, drug trafficking and corruption. 
The FATF recommends such parallel investigations, and its report on Mexico underscored haphazard, uneven results of current investigations, noting low conviction rates and tiny seizures of assets compared with the amount of illicit proceeds that are generated in Mexico.
Elias noted that the FATF report recognized Mexico had improved its legal framework to tackle laundering and credited the country for the recent the emphasis on improving investigations. 
Elias pointed to last year's extradition of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Mexico’s most notorious kingpin, to the United States as a success. He said Mexico was continuing to work with the United States in order to identify Guzman's assets north and south of the border. 
He also noted that during the last two months Mexico, Colombia and the United States have been working on developing a new computerized method to share information.
""This will allow us to be much more efficient in investigations and also in the detection of assets, which for us is fundamental to fight the financial structures of all criminal organizations,"" Elias said.
Mexico and the United States have been quietly increasing cooperation to fight heroin trafficking since last year. High-level U.S. state department officials have told Reuters that the United States has offered to help fund Mexico's efforts to eradicate opium poppies.
However, Elias said U.S. aid to Mexico to fight drug trafficking and improve its legal system was small compared with the spending by Mexico. 
""Mexico has indicated that it has sufficient resources to be able to combat these criminal phenomena in a frontal manner,"" he said.

It joins four other exchanges to be granted a waiver until July 2020 from having to comply with an ""open access"" rule under a EU law known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II or MiFID II, introduced on Wednesday. Under the new system, an exchange would have to make available data from a derivatives transaction to any clearing house. At present, investors are effectively locked into using an exchange's clearer of choice, typically owned in-house. Clearing ensures a trade is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust.
A Nasdaq spokesman confirmed it had been given a waiver by the Swedish regulator. It joins ICE Futures Europe, London Metal Exchange, Eurex and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn).

The exchanges say Britain's departure from the EU next year has created uncertainty over how market infrastructure companies will develop after the EU's biggest market leaves the bloc.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","China's yuan gains for fourth week on economic data, higher rates","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese currency, the yuan, was firmer against the U.S. dollar on Friday, capping its fourth consecutive week of gains, aided by China's solid economic data and tighter liquidity as well as expectations of more foreign capital inflows.
In the spot market , the yuan opened at 6.4810 per dollar and was at 6.4851 by the 0830 GMT domestic close, scoring a four-week winning streak against the greenback. 
The offshore yuan was trading 0.10 percent away from the onshore spot at 6.4806 per dollar. 
Confidence in the yuan has been building up on signs of resilience in China's economy. A blizzard of data in coming weeks is expected to show China's economy ended a strong 2017 on a slightly softer note, but activity has likely remained more resilient than expected. Sources told Reuters China will keep its target for economic growth at ""around 6.5 percent"" in 2018, unchanged from last year.
Analysts also attributed the yuan's strength to tighter liquidity conditions in China's financial system, which has kept interest rates elevated. 
China's benchmark 10-year government bond yield  hovered near 4 percent, the highest in three years, compared with 2.45 percent for 10-year U.S. Treasuries , as Beijing's deleveraging campaign helped widen the spread. 
The yuan's recent performance is ""perhaps reflective of the tight liquidity conditions onshore as well as optimism offshore about portfolio inflows,"" National Australia Bank wrote in a note.
""Barring a strong recovery in the USD in pace and extent in coming weeks, capital flows may still be constructive for CNY and CNH and may push USD/CNY towards 6.45 immediate key support."" 
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency's lack of traction was highlighted overnight as the dollar failed to draw support from the stronger-than-expected jobs report.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Orsted versus Orsted: scientist's descendants to sue company over name,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The descendants of Danish scientist Hans Christian Orsted will take legal action on Friday against one of Denmark's biggest companies over its decision to change its name to Orsted (CO:ORSTED), their lawyer said.
DONG Energy, the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, in October renamed itself Orsted as part of its shift to renewable energy from oil and gas. DONG was short for Danish Oil and Natural Gas.
It said the new name, chosen from more than 3,000 alternatives, was inspired by 19th century Danish physicist Hans Christian Orsted, who discovered electromagnetism.
But three direct descendants of Orsted will file a writ of summons with the Danish Maritime and Commercial High Court on Friday, Jens Jakob Bugge, the lawyer for H.C. Orsted's great-great-great-grandchild Soren Peter Orsted told Reuters.
Orsted's descendants believe that the company is in breach of the Danish companies act by using a family name.
Soren Peter Orsted told Danish newspaper Berlingske that the name change was a ""provocation"" and insulting to scientist Orsted who had always made an effort to stay independent and out of commercial business.
""The law must apply for both big and small and since we think we have a good case and that the law speaks to our advantage, I see a scenario where they would have to change the name,"" Orsted told Berlingske. 
Orsted, Denmark's fourth-largest company by market value, said it was confident of its right to use the name and had used the name H.C. Orsted for one of its power stations in Copenhagen for more than 100 years.
""We have conducted a very thorough legal investigation before we chose the name, and in this context we are fully confident that we have the right to use the name Orsted,"" communications director Martin Barlebo said in a written comment.
""We see our choice of name as tribute to H.C. Orsted and we have greatly emphasized using the name in a respectful way in relation to the scientist,"" he added.
According to Statistics Denmark around 400 people in Denmark have Orsted as a surname.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>","Global distressed-debt funds circle China again, eye $256 billion bad-loans market","By Matthew Miller
BEIJING (Reuters) - Global distressed-debt specialists are stepping up their dealmaking in China after a decade, betting that the country is becoming serious about developing a market to tackle its $256 billion of official non-performing loans (NPLs).
Groups such as Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) and Bain Capital Credit LP made their first investments in recent months, amid surging write-offs by banks and indications that China's commercial bad loans market is set to deepen.
 Oaktree Capital Group LLC  (N:OAK) last month agreed to buy a portfolio of distressed loans with a face value of 3.1 billion yuan ($476.70 million), its fifth deal, according to Tony Rao, a partner with law firm Alpha & Leader, which helped provide due diligence on the deal.
More overseas cash is set to enter the market in 2018, said Rao, in spite of rising competition with local buyers that has sent average prices above 50 cents on the dollar. 
Oaktree declined to comment.
NPLs on commercial bank balance sheets officially amounted to 1.67 trillion yuan ($256.80 billion) at the end of September, or 1.74 percent of all loans. Overdue loans - those not yet technically considered bad - reached 3.4 trillion yuan. Many analysts estimate actual amounts are much higher. 
Loan write-offs by commercial lenders, one indication of how deeply banks are cleaning house, jumped 50 per cent to about 1.4 trillion yuan in 2016, according to estimates by UBS analyst Jason Bedford.
An initial wave of foreign interest in China's bad loans a decade ago, led by big western banks, faded as deals failed to materialize and legal uncertainties multiplied.
But China's distressed-debt market has become more commercialized since then. Once the monopoly of the Big Four asset management companies established in 1999 to take over bad loans from the country's biggest lenders, the market today includes at least 55 regional managers while sales channels for bad loans now include online auctions, over-the-counter trades at local asset exchanges as well as NPL securitization.
""The market has broadened,"" said Phil Groves, president of DAC Management LLC, a China-focused alternative investment manager and bad-loan servicing company that was bought by Blackstone last year. ""There's more to buy, bigger portfolios, and different types of credit available.""
Blackstone acquired its first-ever Chinese commercial loan portfolio for $195 million in August - the same month that Bain Capital Credit did its first-ever deal with the purchase of $200 million in mostly real estate backed loans in the coastal province of Jiangsu.
Bain is now looking at other real estate-backed portfolios and building a loan servicing team to handle future deals, said Kei Chua, Bain's Hong Kong-based managing director.
'LOCALIZED BUSINESS' 
Global distressed-debt players said they're encouraged by ongoing legal and structural changes in China - particularly in coastal regions - that has seen the emergence of professional appraisers and brokers, databases to check asset titles and liens, and greater certainty in the courts.
Foreign investors have for now mostly stuck to real estate deals because that market is better established with easily-valued collateral. Oaktree's latest portfolio, consisting of 178 loans in China's Pearl River Delta, is mostly but not entirely property-backed, according to Alpha & Leader's Rao. 
China's bad loans market is, however, dominated by local distressed funds, many of which set up in the last two years, fund managers and advisers said, which has increased competition and raised NPL prices. 
A national industry association set up just two years ago has grown to more than 600 members from 200 initially. 
""There isn't a national market,"" said Deng Yanshan, executive director for investment at Lakeshore Capital, a domestic asset manager which oversees 2.5 billion yuan in funds. ""This is still a localized business that's based in provinces, counties and cities.""
International firms must also deal with currency controls and related government approvals - creating an execution risk, particularly on timing and hedging costs, that their local rivals do not have to bear. 
But Ted Osborn, an NPL specialist partner at PwC in Hong Kong, said the outlook for global distressed asset buyers remains good. ""When China gets serious and needs to start selling big chunks of bad loans, foreigners are still the only ones with organized capital to do it.""

Founded in 2015, Chushou is an online e-sports platform where users can live stream their mobile phone games. The service has roughly 8 million streamers and 250,000 live streams a day, said the companies in a statement on Friday. 
Google will help the Chinese firm expand its services to target more overseas viewers, it said. 
Live stream gaming platforms are a popular form of e-sports in China, part of a growing industry that involves competitive game play viewed by spectators. Google's YouTube launched a specialized service for live stream gamers in 2015, capturing a large chunk of the global market.
The companies did not reveal the size of Google's stake or the valuation of Chushou after the round.
It is Google's second investment in a Chinese startup in recent years, as the search engine giant looks for new avenues into the Chinese market where its flagship search engine has been blocked by censorship authorities since 2012. 
The U.S. firm took a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup Mobvoi in 2015 as part of a $75 million fundraising round. (http://reut.rs/2CtlBsy)
Google's inability to access China's large population of young, tech-savvy internet users poses a challenge for the firm whose search engine has expanded to become the world's largest and most ubiquitous. 
Last year the firm began targeting China as a potential market to expand its AI offerings. In December, it launched an artificial intelligence lab in China, and in May it held a Go match between its AI project Alpha Go and Chinese Go champion Ke Jie. The match was highly publicized in international media but was not widely covered in local media.
Last month, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also spoke at a high-profile event in China organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet censorship in the country.
""Chushou has built an impressive platform, with a dedicated and quickly growing base of content creators and consumers, and smart expansion plans,"" said Frank Lin, who oversees corporate development for Google in North Asia, in the statement.
Google said it joins existing investors Qiming Venture, Shunwei Capital and Alpha X Capital in the latest round.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Hong Kong stock rally gains momentum from China share reform,"By Michelle Chen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese appetite for Hong Kong equities, ample cash supply and optimism over share reforms could propel the city's benchmark stock index up as much as 15 percent this year, after an already bullish run in 2017, fund managers and analysts say.
The Hang Seng Index (HSI) was the best performing stock index among major markets last year, surging 36 percent. It is now 4 percent away from a record high hit in October 2007.
Particular focus is on moves by China to allow shareholders of mainland-incorporated firms listed in Hong Kong to release their locked-up shares and trade them in the open equity market (HSCE). Such reforms would boost share supply but could lead to improved corporate governance and valuations, analysts said.
""In the first half of this year, the Hang Seng Index will continue to test record highs and will have the chance to rise to 34,000-35,000 points,"" said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at securities firm KGI Asia in Hong Kong.
However, it may fall back to the 30,000-32,000 level in the second half as higher interest rates and an expected stronger U.S. dollar trigger profit-taking, Kwong added.
Market watchers expect regulators to be cautious on the pace of H-share reform to avoid the benchmark index - where valuations are still much cheaper than in mainland China - becoming too volatile.
China will initially select up to three companies in the H-share convertibility pilot scheme, but investors see the move as a positive step. 
Optimism over the scheme sent the benchmark index past the 30,000-mark to a decade high this week.
The convertibility reform is expected to align major shareholders' interests with other stakeholders, paving the way for greater scrutiny over corporate governance which has dogged many Chinese companies amid a series of scandals. 
""Right now large shareholders' shares cannot be traded, so the stock price move does not impact them...if their shares can be circulated, they should care about how investors think and then improve corporate governance,"" said Victoria Mio, Asia Pacific equities co-head at asset manager Robeco. ""2018 will be another bull market for the Hong Kong market.""
CHINESE DEMAND 
Southbound fund flows have increased since the stock connect schemes that link Shanghai and Shenzhen to Hong Kong markets were launched in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Total net inflows to the Hong Kong market have climbed to around 12 percent of daily turnover.
""We will probably see southbound trading reach more than 15 percent, or even 20 percent of Hong Kong's market turnover in mid-2018,"" said Ivan Li, a research director at DBS Vickers Securities.
H-share reform is also expected to improve market liquidity and attract more foreign funds as major shareholders of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies pay more attention. 
""Major shareholders will have more incentive to communicate with investors to boost their share price and market valuation as the reform is gradually implemented,"" said Yang Delong, a managing director at First Seafront Fund in Shenzhen.
Yang said it was a good time to invest in Hong Kong stocks, which he forecast have at least a 10 percent upside. 
""A big risk in the second half is the yuan may depreciate, which will cause capital outflows. If that happens, Chinese regulators may take measures to avoid fund outflows and funds flowing into Hong Kong will fall,"" said KGI Asia's Kwong.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 01:57AM ET</span>","Asian shares near record high, dollar weak ahead of job, wage data","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares inched closer to a record high on Friday as U.S. jobs data pointed to firm economic growth although the greenback was soft as the specter of benign inflation capped domestic bond yields.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose nearly 0.4 percent to 585.0, about one percent shy of its all-time peak of 591.5 hit in November 2007, led by gains in Australia (AXJO) and South Korea (KS11).
Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.9 percent to a 26-year high.
Spread-betters see mixed opening in Europe, with Britain's FTSE (FTSE) seen falling 0.1 percent and German's DAX (GDAXI) edging up 0.1 percent.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) has risen 2.11 percent so far this week, putting it on course to log its best weekly performance since a 2.12 percent gain in mid-July.
The U.S. ADP National Employment Report on Thursday showed U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs  in December, the biggest monthly increase since March and well above economists' expectations of a rise of 190,000.
That helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) sail past the 25,000-mark for the first time. S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.40 percent while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.18 percent, both notching record closing highs. (N)
The data also boosted expectations on Friday's payroll data  by the U.S. Labor Department, where economists have forecast nonfarm job growth of 190,000 in December.
Despite signs of a strong U.S. labor market, the dollar was soft, hovering just above its three-month low against a basket of major currencies.
The dollar index (DXY) stood at 91.877, near Tuesday's three-month low of 91.751.
""The dollar looks very weak at the moment. And I think the reason comes down to the fact that U.S. long-term bond yields are very low despite the Fed's rate hikes,"" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield stood at 2.460 percent (US10YT=RR), below its seven-month peak of 2.504 percent touched on Dec. 21. Those levels are little different from about a year ago, even after the Fed hiked interest rates three times last year and market expectations for another three hikes in 2018.
Capping U.S. long-term bond yields were expectations that inflation will remain tame as wage growth has been slower than before the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
In that regard, average hourly earnings data due at 1330 GMT, along with payroll figures, could attract more attention, given wage growth is a key factor behind inflation trends.
Economists expect U.S. wages to have risen 2.5 percent from a year earlier in December, the same as in November.
The euro held firm at $1.2070 , holding its gains so far this week of 0.6 percent and coming within sight of its 2-1/2-year peak of $1.2092 set in early September.
The euro zone's consumer inflation data, due at 1000 GMT, is expected to show an easing to 1.4 percent in December from 1.5 percent in November. 
But stronger-than-expected German inflation data published late last year is fueling speculation of a higher reading, which in turn could encourage expectations the European Central Bank may move faster to wind up its stimulus.
Many emerging economy currencies have gained even more against the dollar this week as investors look for higher yields.
Since the start of 2018, the Brazilian real  gained 2.4 percent, the Mexican peso  1.8 percent, the Indonesian rupiah  1.1 percent and the Indian rupee  0.7 percent.
On the other hand, the yen, which also tends to be used as a funding currency for investment in higher-yielding assets, has lost 0.3 percent against the dollar this week to 113.02 yen .
But some market players also said market moves so far this year have been mostly driven by short-term speculators and many long-term investors were on the sidelines, hampered not least by high valuations of stocks in the U.S. and some other countries.
""As far as I can see, real money investors have been cautious. So I would advise not to read too much into the new year market moves,"" said Kazushige Kaida, head of foreign exchange at State Street Bank in Tokyo.
In commodities markets, oil prices softened marginally but held near their highest levels since May 2015 on concerns about supply risks due to unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.

At least 70 people were arrested in the state of Mexico on Thursday after looting in two cities, a spokesman for state police said.
At least 800 police were deployed to deter looting at stores in the state, according to a Twitter post by state police. 
In the state of Veracruz, two people were arrested for using social media to incite looting in a suburb of the port capital, media reported. 
Mexico's government on Wednesday denounced forecast price rises by fuel retailers and tortilla makers, saying increases were unjustified as it sought to allay public concern about high inflation at the start of a presidential election year.
As inflation hovers near a 16-year high just below 7 percent, officials insisted the forecast price spikes, which have triggered social media outrage and threats of protests, are not warranted.
Early last year, Mexico saw violent protests and looting after the government cut subsidies to gasoline prices as it moved toward a free market from a state-controlled regime.
Mexican authorities have insisted that price increases in recent months have been modest, noting gasoline prices have only risen 1.3 percent compared to average prices at the end of November.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 11:07PM ET</span>",Uber ex-CEO Kalanick selling nearly a third of stake for $1.4 billion: source,"By Liana B. Baker and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as chief executive in June, is selling nearly a third of his 10 percent stake in the ride-services company for about $1.4 billion, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Kalanick's sale is part of a deal struck by a consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp which is taking a 17.5 percent stake in Uber, mostly by buying shares from early investors and employees. SoftBank last week secured agreements from shareholders who were willing to sell, and the deal will close early this year, Uber said.
The SoftBank deal values Uber at $48 billion, about a 30 percent discount from its most recent valuation of $68 billion. However, the investor consortium is also making a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the older, higher valuation.
Kalanick had offered to sell half of his total shares, but because there was a limit on how much SoftBank will buy, he will sell just 29 percent, according to the source. Other investors also did not get to unload as many shares as they had hoped because of such widespread interest to sell.
The former CEO owns 10 percent of the company, which means his sale will unload 2.9 percent of Uber shares and earn him about $1.4 billion, the source added. 
A spokesman for Kalanick declined to comment. SoftBank and Uber could not be reached immediately for comment.
The sale would make the Uber co-founder a billionaire for the first time, not just on paper. Kalanick has never before sold shares of the company he ran for almost a decade, the source said.
The SoftBank deal offers investors and employees what could be their last chance to sell shares in a company-approved transaction before Uber's long awaited initial public offering, planned for 2019. 
The transaction marks a victory for new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who helped broker the deal and who will benefit from a deep-pocketed investor like SoftBank.

Bloomberg first reported Kalanick's plans to sell part of his stake.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) agreed to pay $15 million to settle nationwide antitrust litigation by passengers who accused the four largest U.S. carriers of conspiring to raise fares by reducing seating capacity.
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C. granted preliminary approval on Wednesday for the accord with the Dallas-based carrier.
Southwest denied wrongdoing but said it settled to avoid the cost and distraction of further litigation.
It is the first defendant to settle and agreed to help the plaintiffs with their case against the remaining defendants, which are  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL).
Those carriers have also denied wrongdoing. The litigation began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice began probing possible collusion. It has yet to take any formal action.
The passenger litigation combined more than 100 private lawsuits filed around the country.
Passengers claimed that the airlines' collusion began in early 2009, led to higher fares and reduced flight choices, and together with low fuel prices and higher fees for checking bags and other services helped the industry post record profits.
According to government data, American, Delta, Southwest and United together commanded a roughly 69 percent share of the U.S. domestic air travel market from October 2016 to September 2017.
In statements on Thursday, American spokesman Matt Miller said, ""We will continue to defend against the claims, which we believe are without merit,"" while Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said, ""The simple fact is that Delta has not engaged in any illegal behavior.""
United spokeswoman Erin Benson said the airline will continue to defend against the claims, which it said are without merit.
Kollar-Kotelly called Southwest's settlement ""sufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate"" to justify preliminary approval.
Final approvals typically occur a few months after preliminary approvals are granted and after people are given a chance to object.

The case is In re: Domestic Airline Travel Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 15-mc-01404.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 05:27PM ET</span>",Intel shares fall as investors worry about costs of chip flaw,"By Jim Finkle and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters. -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) shares fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors worried about the potential financial liability and reputational hit from recently disclosed security flaws in its widely used microprocessors. 
The largest chipmaker had confirmed on Wednesday that flaws reported by researchers could allow hackers to steal sensitive information from computers, phones and other devices. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other software makers have issued patches to protect against the vulnerabilities.
Intel may be on the hook for costs stemming from lawsuits claiming that the patches would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, and big customers will likely seek compensation from Intel for any software or hardware fixes they make, security experts said. 
""The potential liability is big for Intel,"" said Eric Johnson, dean of Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. ""Everybody will be scrambling over the next few days to figure out just how big it is."" 
Intel has said that the patches for the bugs would slow its chips down somewhat but that most users will not notice. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), the largest seller of cloud computing services, said in a statement it does not “expect meaningful performance impact for most customer workloads.”
Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google both said in statements on their websites that they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers.
But the incident is likely to spur cloud companies to press Intel for lower prices on chips in future talks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh, which owns shares in Intel. 
“What (Intel’s cloud customers) are going to say is, ‘You wronged us, we hate you, but if we can get a discount, we’ll still buy from you,’” Forrest said. 
Forrest also expects Intel will have to increase its chip development spending to focus on security. 
Government agencies and security experts said they knew of no cyber attacks that had exploited the vulnerabilities.
Financial services firms were studying information on the vulnerabilities to determine how to best respond, said the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a global industry group known as FS-ISAC that shares data on cyber threats.
Banks and other firms are trying to understand what it will cost to respond to the issue, FS-ISAC said in an emailed statement.
""In addition to the security considerations raised by this design flaw, performance degradation is expected, which could require more processing power for affected systems to compensate and maintain current baseline performance,” FS-ISAC said. “There will need to be consideration and balance between fixing the potential security threat vs the performance and other possible impact to systems.” 
Lawyers filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California, federal court on Wednesday that sought class action status and compensation for people who had bought vulnerable Intel chips or computers that came with them already installed. 
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the lawsuit. 
While more lawsuits are expected, Intel's biggest customers are likely to quietly seek compensation for any harm caused by the vulnerabilities, including costs to patch machines or replace microprocessors, Johnson said.
Legal experts said that consumers would have to prove concrete damages and harm to proceed with claims. 
Intel shares fell 1.8 percent, following a 3.4 percent decline Wednesday. 
Shares in rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc climbed 4.9 percent as investors speculated the No. 2 maker of microprocessors would woo customers away from Intel. 

Still, researchers had said some of AMD's chips had one of the two vulnerabilities disclosed on Wednesday, as do processors from ARM Holdings (LON:ARM).

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian shareholders of state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) are petitioning a Brazilian court to be paid on similar terms as those given to U.S. shareholders in a $2.95 billion settlement, a lawyer told Reuters on Thursday.
Petrobras on Wednesday agreed to settle a class action lawsuit in the United States that claimed damages for the oil company's role in a bribery scheme involving company executives and government officials. Petrobras said the settlement was not an admission of guilt and denied any wrongdoing.
""The voluntary act of Petrobras paying $3 billion to foreign shareholders indicates it should pay proportional values to Brazilian shareholders,"" Andre de Almeida, a lawyer leading the shareholder lawsuit in Brazil, told Reuters.
""After all, the same facts, the same defendants, should have the same consequence, independent of the jurisdiction of the investment.""
Petrobras declined to comment.
Wednesday's settlement agreement, which must still be approved by a U.S. court, was one of the largest ever class action settlements in the United States.

For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian cannabis stocks fell on Thursday after the U.S. government said it would resume enforcement of federal laws banning marijuana in states that had legalized pot, disrupting a seven-day rally that boosted shares to record highs. 
The U.S. Department of Justice rescinded an Obama administration policy that discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related crimes in states that had legalized the drug. The action by Attorney General Jeff Sessions could harm the burgeoning marijuana industry in six states including California and Colorado.
The U.S.-listed ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which launched on Dec. 26, closed down 6.2 percent. Canada's Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF ended down 8.7 percent. 
Aphria Inc, which has operations in Florida and Arizona, closed 13.8 percent lower, after falling as much as 22.7 percent earlier in the day. 
CannaRoyalty Corp, tumbled 15.8 percent. The company operates in California, which legalized recreational marijuana sales starting Jan. 1. 
TMX Group Ltd, the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, said in October it might delist stocks of marijuana companies with interests in the United States.
TMX representatives could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday afternoon on the moves by Sessions.
Canadian securities regulators have said companies must disclose any connection to the U.S. marijuana industry but have not prohibited them from listing in Canada. That could leave room for any firms rejected by TMX to move to other exchanges. 
Canadian Securities Administrators could also not be immediately reached for comment.
Jonathan Sherman, a marijuana securities lawyer at Canadian law firm Cassels Brock, said he expects regulators to change that policy, noting that the Canadian Securities Administrators said in October it would review the matter if there was a change in the U.S. government's approach. 
""This would be of significant concern to Canadian cannabis companies with U.S. operations,"" Sherman said in a statement.
Still, the majority of Canadian marijuana companies, which do not have U.S. operations, are unlikely to be harmed by the policy change in Washington, Chris Damas, editor of the BCMI Cannabis Report, said in an interview.
He said investors responded so strongly to the news because Canadian pot stocks just posted a strong rally. 

""They've gone up so much in the last few trading days,"" Damas said. ""This is a reasonable retracement.""

It’s 'Jobs Friday'
Nonfarm payrolls data, arguably one of the most important economic events of the month, is expected to show the US economy created 190,000 jobs in December.
Economists forecast the jobless rate to remain steady at 4.1% while average hourly earnings for December is expected rise to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous month.
Investors will assess the nonfarm payrolls report for clues about the strength of the economy which could provide fresh direction for the dollar, U.S. 10-Year, and gold, as labor market conditions are one the measures the Federal Reserve considers in its monetary policy decisions.
The Federal Reserve minutes Wednesday showed fed members remained optimistic that recent gains in the labor market would continue.
Canada labour market report in focus
Canadian Labor market data for the month of December due Friday will be closely watched by investors after the previous report showed the economy created 79,500 jobs, confounding economists’ forecasts for 10,000 increase. 
The oil sensitive Canadian dollar has benefited from bullish oil prices, and growing expectations that the Bank of Canada will move to hike rates in the first quarter of the year as Governor Poloz said recently that the economy was stronger after making “tremendous” progress over the last year.
USD/CAD traded at $1.2490, down 0.38%.
Baker Hughes rig count
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand, after the number of active drilling rigs steadied in recent weeks.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
At Thursday’s settlement price, crude futures rose 38 cents to settle at a three-year high of $62.01 after data showed US crude inventories fell more-than-expected fuelling optimism for a more rapid pace of rebalancing in oil markets."

The department store operator, which has racked up 24 straight quarters of sales declines, said 64 Kmart stores and 39 Sears stores would be closed between early March and early April this year.
Sears Holdings, once the largest retailer in the United States, said at the end of October that it operated 1,104 stores, nearly half the 2,019 stores it ran in 2012.
The closures announced on Thursday were in addition to 63 stores Sears is closing this month, having also shuttered 330 stores in 2017.
Shares in Sears closed down 4.8 percent on Thursday.
Liquidation sales will begin as early as Jan. 12 at the closing stores, Sears said, adding that ""eligible"" staff at these stores would receive severance. 
Company spokesman Chris Brathwaite declined to disclose the number of jobs that would be cut, but said an overwhelming majority of them were part-time positions. He added that only full-time employees typically received severance packages, but that this would vary depending on local laws.
Sears' billionaire chief executive and biggest shareholder Eddie Lampert said in July that some vendors had reduced their support, placing additional pressure on operations. In October, Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR), one of Sears' biggest vendors, said it would stop supplying some big name-brand appliances to the department store chain.

Lampert is also among Sears' biggest lenders through his hedge fund, ESL Investments.

277,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 03:29PM ET</span>","Tesla Model 3 delay raises cashflow risks, but analysts upbeat","By Munsif Vengattil and Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares recouped some of their losses on Thursday after falling as much as 3.6 percent, a day after it pushed back a production target for its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan yet again.
Analysts stayed upbeat, saying the electric car maker had finally set an achievable target for their mass-market sedan that is priced at $35,000. The delay, however, is likely to impact Tesla's cashflow, a big challenge for many quarters now.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. The company now expects to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.
""With absolute Model 3 sales tracking behind expectations and Model 3 gross margin improvement likely to be pushed out until production reaches greater scale, the expected cash tailwind from Model 3 will take longer to manifest itself than was anticipated,"" Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note.
Tesla, headed by Elon Musk, has been struggling to overcome production bottlenecks and reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss in the July-September quarter.
The company burned through $1.1 billion in cash in that quarter and said in November it would spend roughly the same amount in the fourth quarter. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.
Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja had reassured investors that cash flow would ""improve significantly"" over the next few quarters as Tesla continued to ramp up Model 3 production.
Tesla shares were down at $313.02 in afternoon trading. The median price target on the stock is $310 and eight of 25 brokerages covering the stock rate it ""buy"" or higher. Eight have a ""hold"" rating and the rest a ""sell"" or lower.
""We believe that Tesla may have finally set a beatable production target,"" Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note.
""Importantly, we believe that Tesla is prioritizing quality control. While Tesla's repeated guidance revisions could begin to risk damaging its elite brand, a mass-recall would probably be far more damaging,"" he said.
Tesla's luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory and quality checks have routinely revealed defects in nearly all of these models inspected after assembly, Reuters reported in November, citing sources.
Tesla has maintained that its quality control process is unusually rigorous. 
Analysts said on Thursday they continue to believe that sales of the Model 3 sedan could transform the niche automaker into a mass producer, giving it an edge over a host of rivals such as General Motors Co (N:GM) and BMW (DE:BMWG) who are entering the nascent electric car market.

""Given that TSLA received over 400k Model 3 reservations with essentially no marketing, we believe potential demand for the vehicle is likely underestimated, and think TSLA could significantly increase demand through its own advertising in the future,"" Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average rose above the 25,000 level for the first time on Thursday and other major indexes scaled new records, propelled by strong economic data both in the United States and abroad.
The 30-member blue-chip index crossed five 1,000-point marks in 2017 on the back of President Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda and solid corporate earnings.
It took less than a year for the Dow to add a 5,000-point milestone, which is the fastest since the index was created in May 1896.
Wall Street has started 2018 on a strong note. The benchmark S&P index closed above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and the Nasdaq settled above 7,000 a day earlier.
""We saw Apple doing well, and we're also seeing energy, which was a laggard last year, do well. The integrated names are gaining interest as oil prices are moving higher,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
Also, strong manufacturing and services sector data from the world's largest economies provided a bullish tone on Thursday, while other data showed U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in December. Friday will bring the key U.S. non-farm payrolls report.
""As long as you have economic growth and earnings moving higher, there's still a solid underpinning,"" Krosby said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 154.35 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,077.03, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.73 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,724.79 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 11.83 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,077.37.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) was up 0.5 percent on the day and 3.8 percent for the week so far. Financials led gains on the S&P 500 on Thursday, though, with  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) up about 1.5 percent and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) up 1.3 percent.
Apple (O:AAPL) was up 0.5 percent.
On the downside, Victoria's Secret-owner L Brands (N:LB) slid 11.3 percent on disappointing quarterly earnings forecast.
Macy's (N:M) shares fell 3.2 percent after reporting only modest growth in holiday sales and saying it would close stores and slash thousands of jobs this year.
Other department store operators including J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) also tumbled.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.76-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Some hedge funds deliver double-digit gains for 2017,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A handful of hedge funds ended 2017 with double digit returns, their investors said, at a time the $3 trillion industry took in fresh money and posted its best returns in years, industry data show.
Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management, which waged proxy fights at Buffalo Wild Wings and Deckers Outdoor Corp. last year, ended 2017 with a 25.6 percent gain at its flagship fund while its smaller Encore portfolio climbed 22.6 percent.
Atlantic Investment Management, which focuses on bets that inexpensive stocks will appreciate in value, posted a 16.4 percent gain in its Cambrian Global Fund.
Both firms beat the industry average with industry tracking firm Hedge Fund Research reporting that the average hedge fund gained 7.6 percent through the end of November.
Stock oriented funds posted a 12 percent gain through November. December numbers have not been released as many hedge funds are still tabulating their performance for the year, but so far the industry is on track to post its best returns since 2013, the Hedge Fund Research data show.
Similarly Renaissance Technologies, staffed by nearly eight dozen scientists with doctorates in physics, math and other fields, posted a 15 percent gain in its Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, the firm's oldest portfolio available to outsiders.
Brahman Capital posted a 12 percent gain in its hedge fund while a portfolio that makes only long bets that securities will rise climbed 22 percent.
Activist hedge fund Engaged Capital, which pushed for changes at tea maker Hain Celestial Group rental company Rent-A-Center last year, posted a 10.7 percent gain.
Hedge funds are private and generally guard their performance numbers closely. Representatives for the firms declined to comment.
The gains suggest better times in the hedge fund industry after investors spent years complaining about low returns and high fees. Investors even added $2.9 billion in new money to the industry in the first three quarters of 2017 after having pulled out $70 billion in 2016, data from Hedge Fund Research show.
Some firms even celebrated single-digit gains, signaling a rebound after a difficult 2016 or early 2017. Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, ended the year with a 2 percent gain while Folger Hill, run by former SAC chief operating officer Sol Kumin, ended the year with a 2.6 percent gain in its U.S. fund and a 3.6 percent gain in its Asia fund.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>",Brookfield Business Partners to buy Westinghouse for $4.6 billion,"By Tom Hals and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - A subsidiary of Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) (N:BAM) plans to acquire Westinghouse Electric Co LLC, the bankrupt nuclear services company owned by Toshiba Corp (T:6502), for $4.6 billion.
  Brookfield Business Partners  LP  (N:BBU) (TO:BBU_u) said in a statement on Thursday that it and institutional partners would use $1 billion of equity and $3 billion of long-term debt financing to buy the Pittsburgh-based business, its first investment in nuclear power.
The buyers are also assuming Westinghouse's underfunded pension plan.
New York-listed shares of Brookfield Business Partners were up 3.4 percent in afternoon trading.
The deal is expected to close in the third quarter but will require approval from regulators and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
Westinghouse has said it is aiming to exit bankruptcy as soon as March, which would allow Toshiba to book tax benefits in the current fiscal year.
""Brookfield’s acquisition of Westinghouse reaffirms our position as the leader of the global nuclear industry,” said Westinghouse Chief Executive Officer José Emeterio Gutiérrez.
Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Brookfield group of companies is among the world's largest investors in stable, long-lived assets such as utilities, real estate, energy and infrastructure. 
""Acquiring Westinghouse definitely fits the risk approach they have,"" said Mycle Schneider, an energy and nuclear policy consultant in Paris. ""They buy assets in shaky situations.""
Last year Brookfield Asset Management acquired control of two owners of renewable energy projects, TerraForm Global Inc and  TerraForm Power Inc  (O:TERP), from SunEdison Inc, which had filed for Chapter 11.
In 2016, Brookfield Business Partners converted debt to a large equity stake in a Texas power producer that emerged from Chapter 11 and became  Vistra Energy Corp  (N:VST). And in November, Brookfield Property Partners (N:BPY) offered to buy the remaining shares in  General Growth Properties  Inc (N:GGP), adding to a large stake it purchased to bring the mall owner out of bankruptcy.
Schneider said he was surprised that Brookfield acquired Westinghouse, given that the company has no other nuclear businesses.
Westinghouse is one the world's leading suppliers of nuclear fuel, and it provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world's 450 commercial reactors, according to court records. 
Those two business lines generated combined cash flow of $403 million on revenue of about $3.1 billion in Westinghouse's 2015 financial year, according to court records.
However, the company suffered after it agreed to build two plants in the U.S. Southeast on fixed-price contracts. The project went billions of dollars over budget, and Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March to escape the contracts. 
Construction of new nuclear power plants globally has dropped to the lowest level in a decade following renewed safety concerns after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
One of Westinghouse's unfinished U.S. projects, known as Vogtle in Georgia, will continue with  Southern Co  (N:SO) replacing the company as the project manager. A South Carolina project known as V.C. Summer was abandoned in July.
The lead utility behind the V.C. Summer project, Scana Corp (N:SCG), agreed on Wednesday to a $7.9 billion takeover bid from Dominion Energy Inc (N:D).

Westinghouse has joined a consortium bidding to provide nuclear power in Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest new markets in the world. Bringing Westinghouse out of bankruptcy could help close a proposed deal for six of the company's new AP1000 reactors in India.

(Reuters) -  Western Union  Co (N:WU) will pay $60 million to resolve allegations that it failed for more than a decade to maintain a program to deter and report transactions involving suspected criminal fraud and money laundering, New York’s financial regulator said on Thursday.
The settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) follows the money-transfer company's agreement in January 2017 to pay $586 million to resolve similar claims by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
DFS alleged that from 2004 to 2012, Western Union failed to implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program aimed to deter criminals' use of its electronic network to facilitate fraud and money laundering.
The regulator said senior Western Union executives and managers also ignored suspicious transactions to Chinese Western Union locations by several high-volume agents, including money transfers linked to human trafficking.
DFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement Western Union's executive ""put profits ahead of the company’s responsibilities to detect and prevent money laundering and fraud.""
As part of the settlement, Western Union must submit a written plan to DFS aimed at ensuring the adequacy of its anti-money laundering and anti-fraud programs. It must also submit progress reports to DFS.
Western Union said in a statement it had previously set aside $49 million to resolve the investigation. It also said that it had made substantial improvements aimed at enhancing its compliance programs.
As part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department announced in January 2017, Western Union admitted it violated U.S. laws.

The company also agreed in January 2017 to pay $5 million to various state attorneys general to reimburse investigative, enforcement and other costs in connection with related investigations.

(Reuters) - The global private equity industry raised a record $453 billion from investors in 2017, leaving it with more than $1 trillion to pour into companies and new business ventures, data from industry tracker Preqin showed on Thursday.
The figures underscore the extent to which large institutional investors, as well as family offices, are placing a growing portion of their money with leveraged buyout firms, venture capital groups and growth equity funds, which are promising returns that beat the wider stock market.
The money raised in 2017 surpassed the previous landmark of $414 billion set in 2007. 
However, there were a quarter fewer new private equity funds launched last year than in 2016, with fundraising boosted by so-called mega buyout funds, defined by Preqin as having assets of at least $4.5 billion. 
Chief amount these funds was Apollo Global Management LLC's (N:APO) $24.6 billion Investment Fund IX, the largest private equity fund ever launched.
The buoyant fundraising market has fostered fierce competition for deals to put investment capital to work, driving up acquisition prices that can erode potential returns.
""Entry prices for assets remain very high, and with so much available capital competing for deals, this will only increase the challenge for fund managers looking to deploy capital in 2018,"" a Preqin analyst wrote. 
Nevertheless, David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG), one of the largest private equity firms, has expressed confidence about the industry's ability to put new money to work.
""For the last 15 or 20 years, very often, before firms like ours were publicly traded even, people were worried about whether you could deploy this capital,"" Rubenstein said at a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) conference last month. ""Now it turns out that the capital can be deployed.""
His confidence stems from what he described as investors' willingness to accept returns in the mid-teens as opposed to at least 20 percent in the past. 
Private equity firms are also showing an increasing appetite for taking non-controlling positions in companies, which expands the field of possible investments.
In addition, Rubenstein said firms are making more investments outside of the United States, while putting a greater focus on improving the operational performance of portfolio companies, which should increase their re-sale value.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor renowned for his preternatural optimism for America and its citizens' well-being, on Thursday encouraged those worried about the economic prospects for themselves and their children to shed their fears.
In an essay for the Jan. 15 issue of Time magazine, the chairman of the insurance and investment company  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) tried to allay concerns that innovation and improved productivity might cost jobs and disrupt lives.
Saying the U.S. ""game of economic miracles"" was in its ""early innings,"" Buffett, 87, downplayed polls suggesting broad pessimism for the futures of American children, saying rapid economic growth would not be necessary for people to thrive.
He said that if the economy grew at just 2 percent annually after adjusting for inflation, roughly its pace since the 2008 financial crisis, while population increased 0.8 percent a year, then gross domestic product per capita would increase to $79,000 by 2043 from $59,000 now.
""This $20,000 increase guarantees a far better life for our children,"" Buffett wrote.
The essay is part of an issue titled ""The Optimists"" edited by Bill Gates, the  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder and philanthropist.
Gates, also a Berkshire director and a longtime friend of Buffett, is Time's first guest editor in the magazine's 94-year history.
Buffett maintained that most American children will live ""far better"" than their parents did, but urged the country to focus on closing the gap between the rich and less-rich.
While the wealth of the 400 richest Americans rose to $2.7 trillion last year from $93 billion in 1982, as computed by Forbes magazine Buffett said millions of people were left behind, ""stuck on an economic treadmill.""
He said this can be fixed.
""A rich family takes care of all its children, not just those with talents valued by the marketplace,"" Buffett wrote.
""In the years of growth that certainly lie ahead, I have no doubt that America can both deliver riches to many and a decent life to all. We must not settle for less.""
Buffett ranked third on Forbes' list on Thursday with an $85.8 billion fortune, trailing only Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Jeff Bezos and Gates.

He might have ranked higher had he not donated roughly $27.6 billion of Berkshire stock to charity since 2006, including $30 million to an unnamed charity on Wednesday.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -  Euronext  (PA:ENX) has joined a growing list of exchanges citing Brexit to win a reprieve from a new rule aimed at promoting competition in clearing services for derivatives trades.
The pan-European exchange becomes the fourth exchange this week to be granted a waiver until July 2020 from having to comply with an ""open access"" rule under a European Union law known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II or MiFID II, introduced on Wednesday.
Under the new system aimed at increasing competition, an exchange would have to make available data from a derivatives transaction to any clearing house.
At present, investors are effectively locked into using an exchange's clearer of choice, typically owned in-house. Clearing ensures a trade is completed even if one side of the deal goes bust.
Euronext operates stock and derivatives trading platforms in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon.
Regulators in France, Belgium and Portugal have granted an open access waiver in respect of derivatives, Euronext told Reuters. The exchange is still waiting for the outcome of a waiver request to regulators in the Netherlands.
Euronext said the waivers would ensure orderly markets as Britain, the region's biggest derivatives trading center, leaves the EU next year.
""We need a resolution of the bigger picture before we move into any open access activities in respect of exchange traded derivatives,"" Euronext said.
Regulators in Germany and Britain this week granted the same 11th-hour waiver to Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt, and ICE Futures Europe (N:ICE) and London Metal Exchange (HK:0388).
UK regulators have said they granted waivers in the interests of keeping markets orderly as other aspects of MiFID II, a sweeping reform, are digested by markets.
Deutsche Boerse has said a waiver was needed due to legal uncertainty created by Brexit.
Euronext uses LCH to clear its transactions.
LCH is majority owned by the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) which is one of the region's biggest supporters of open access. It has not asked regulators for a waiver.
""Our open access approach will continue, working in partnership with our customers to promote greater choice, transparency and innovation in financial markets, in order to reduce risk and maximize capital and operational efficiencies,"" an LSE spokeswoman said.

The EU's markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, said on Wednesday that all waivers from open access will be ""one-offs"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong data from the world's largest economies helped global shares climb to new heights on Thursday, while the euro hovered near a three-year high and the U.S. dollar fell against major currencies. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe broke a new record, (MIWD00000PUS) with an advance of 0.79 percent.
On Thursday, the ADP National Employment Report showed that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, marking the biggest monthly increase since March.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 153.65 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,076.33, sailing past the 25,000-mark for the first time. The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.48 points, or 0.42 percent, to 2,724.54 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 9.99 points, or 0.14 percent, to 7,075.53, with both indexes hitting fresh highs.
Separately, China's services sector activity hit its highest level in more than three years, manufacturing data from Japan came in strong, and euro zone surveys showed the bloc enjoying its strongest run in nearly seven years.
London's FTSE (FTSE) set a record on Thursday and was up 0.28 percent, while Tokyo's Nikkei (N225) - Asia's biggest market - had earlier shot to its highest since 1992 and was up 3.26 percent. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) closed up 0.51 percent, scaling a decade-high peak as a fifth day of gains in China helped emerging market stocks (MSCIEF) to a six-and-a-half year high.
Those gains come after Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's mid-December meeting that did little to change a view that it will stick to measured increases in U.S. interest rates.
The minutes showed policymakers expect U.S. President Donald Trump's tax overhaul will boost consumer spending but are still uncertain about the wider impact the stimulus would have on factors such as inflation. 
DOLLAR DIPS
The euro resumed a rally that has taken it near its highest levels in three years, while the U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, failed to hold its previous session's gains after upbeat U.S. data and minutes from the Federal Reserve.
The euro  rose 0.45 percent to $1.2066, while the dollar index was down 0.27 percent.
The stronger-than-expected U.S. private-sector jobs report briefly helped the dollar pare losses versus the euro and extend gains against the yen. But those moves were shortlived.
""The market quickly faded, the mini-rally in the dollar as the trend gave way to what we have been seeing for the past several weeks, which is dollar weakness,"" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.
The Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 112.87 per dollar, while Sterling  was last trading at $1.3545, up 0.23 percent on the day.
U.S. Treasury yields rose, with two-year yields hitting a more than nine-year peak as upbeat December private hiring data boosted expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates at its March policy meetings.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.4743 percent, from 2.445 percent late on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond (US30YT=RR) last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.8042 percent, from 2.783 percent late on Wednesday.
Oil rose above $68 a barrel to its highest since May 2015 after unrest in Iran sparked concerns about supply risks and with support coming from OPEC-led output cuts and demand-boosting cold weather in the United States.

U.S. crude  rose 0.71 percent to $62.07 per barrel and Brent  was last at $68.01, up 0.25 percent on the day.

(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) on Thursday appointed former  Altice NV  (AS:ATCA) CEO Michel Combes as chief financial officer, replacing Tarek Robbiati who had chalked out a turnaround plan for the telecom company that involved sweeping cost cuts.
Sprint's shares were down 4.8 percent at $5.61 on Thursday morning on fears that Robbiati's departure could derail the plan at a time when the company is spending heavily to launch its 5G network.
""We believe this feeds the narrative of concern that Sprint needs to spend on network and continue to aggressively cut costs,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Jennifer Fritzsche wrote in a note.
""Robbiati did a very impressive job as to what he was tasked to do - lower the company's cost of capital,"" she added.
Sprint has sought to strengthen its balance sheet by cutting costs and mortgaging a portion of its airwaves and equipment, but industry analysts have raised concerns about its $38 billion debt.
Combes' sudden exit from Altice NV (AS:ATCA) last November also appeared to weigh on investors' minds, but some analysts were upbeat given his more than 30 years of experience in the telecoms industry.
""While Combes' abrupt departure from Altice last November will be a focal point for investors, it is important to note that Combes has extensive telecom experience including as CFO of Orange, CEO of  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) Europe and of Alcatel,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Simon Flannery wrote in a note.
Combes, 55, was ousted from Altice NV as the company sought to reassure investors after its shares dropped 30 percent within a week. He had been brought to put Altice's ailing French mobile operator SFR back on track. (http://reut.rs/2lTOirC)
The appointment comes a month after Sprint struck a deal with Altice's U.S. business that will allow the U.S. telecom provider to use Altice's cable infrastructure to transmit cellular data and develop a 5G network. (http://reut.rs/2CsAkUR)
""(Combes) has strong Street credibility and comes to Sprint as the company is looking to turn the ship around in a choppy environment,"" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.
He will also be appointed to Sprint's board at a later date and will be responsible for leading the company's financial operations, strategy and continued cost transformation, the wireless carrier said.

Sprint and T-Mobile recently called off their merger talks to create a stronger U.S. wireless company to rival market leaders, leaving Sprint to engineer a turnaround on its own.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (N:GS) paid their top bankers in Britain an average of $1.5 million each in 2016, compared with $1 million for local rivals HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), data released by the banks last year shows.
Data compiled by Reuters from 13 banks' filings, some of which were released only late last month, shows they paid an average of $1.06 million to such staff in 2016, down from $2 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013 when new European Union rules aimed at curbing banker bonuses took effect.
The Wall Street banks' higher pay packages show how they have bounced back more quickly from the financial crisis than their peers in Britain, some of which have faced hefty post-crisis costs that have limited banker pay.
The data also shows that EU rules to rein in banker bonuses, blamed for driving excessive risk-taking in the run up to the 2008 crisis, are having an impact.
JPMorgan paid 672 staff in senior or risk-taking positions a total of $1.02 billion in 2016 for an average of $1.52 million each, while 724 Goldman bankers took home an average of $1.48 million each, according to Reuters' calculations from the filings. 
U.S. banks were also able to capitalize more effectively than European rivals on spikes in volatility in financial markets in 2016 from Britain's June Brexit vote.
Europe's top investment banks' trading in fixed income products fell by 6 percent in the second quarter of 2016, while their five biggest U.S. rivals reported a 21 percent increase to $13.1 billion in revenue from the same business.
The disclosures are among the most comprehensive released on bankers' pay in Britain, which remains a controversial subject ten years on from the financial crisis. 
A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development released on Thursday showed that a median worker salary in Britain is about $38,493. In contrast, the average pay of a senior banker in 2016 was $1.06 million. 
The report highlighted that the average boss of one of Britain's top companies will by Thursday have already earned the same as the typical worker will make in the entire year.
The banks' pay disclosures make no mention of gender pay gaps, but banks in Britain may have to begin reporting such data after the government last April announced employers would have to disclose the difference between what they pay men and women by April 2018.
The average pay levels for bankers in the filings were boosted by a handful of top earners, with 10 Goldman bankers earning the highest band of more than 9 million euros in 2016 while 14 JPMorgan executives took home that lender's top bracket of over 5 million euros each.
The pay disclosures focus on banks' senior executives and 'material risk takers', and show how an EU rule that came into force in 2014 capping variable or bonus pay at 200 percent of fixed pay has cut fat bonuses.
While Goldman Sachs paid senior staff more than five times more in variable pay than fixed in 2013, before the rule took effect, that ratio fell in 2016 to 0.6 times.
Goldman in 2016 paid the top bankers $679 million in cash, and gave them 1.63 million shares in the bank which were worth a total of $389.6 million based on the bank's year-end share price of $239.
Analysis of the filings also shows how regulators have sought to broaden the number of bankers deemed material risk takers, with the total whose pay is captured by the data rising from 2,604 in 2013 to 8,360 in 2016.
The disclosures cover British banks globally and overseas banks' British-based staff, and contain more detail than is found in pay disclosures in other non-EU regions.
Most banks released the details earlier last year, but some banks such as Goldman reported last month just before the year-end deadline.
Goldman declined to comment.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>",Israel proposes ban on trading shares of cryptocurrency companies,"By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel may ban from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange companies whose main business revolves around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), the country's markets regulator, said on Thursday.
The regulator has proposed an amendment to exchange rules that would prohibit it from listing shares issued by companies that mainly invest in, own or mine cryptocurrencies. Such companies also would not be allowed in the exchange's indexes, and if they already trade on the exchange they would be delisted. 
The ban would not apply to companies with equity of more than 100 million shekels ($29 million) and with three years of audited financial statements.
The amendment has been approved by the ISA board and next goes for public comment. 
The proposal for the amendment came after a sharp rise in shares of Blockchain Mining (TA:BLCM), a company that said it would shift its focus from mining for gold and iron to mining crypto currencies. 
""This phenomenon, if it continues, may in the future have serious consequences on the ... fairness of trading in the bourse in general and on investor confidence in the bourse,"" the ISA said.
Share prices of companies intending to operate in the sector are cut off from their real value, the ISA said, and ""the market treats their shares irrationally and unexpectedly.""
Last month, outgoing ISA chairman Shmuel Hauser said he planned to bring such a proposal up, saying bitcoin prices were behaving like a bubble.
The value of a bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, surged in mid-December to nearly $20,000, then dropped to less than $12,000 at the end of the month. It was trading today around $14,500.
Bitcoin is a publicly available ledger of a finite number of digital ""coins"", which backers say can be used as a currency without the support of any country's central bank. It is ""mined"" by computers, which are awarded new coins for working out complex mathematical formulas. Several other cryptocurrencies have also been launched that work on similar principles.

At 9:46AM ET (15:22GMT), the Dow Jones rose 111 points, or 0.45%, to 25,034 points.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 8 points, or 0.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up9 points, or 0.13%.
The break through the 25,000 point level came a day after the S&P also passed its own psychological mark of 2,700 points.
Bullish sentiment continued on Thursday on positive data on the U.S. labor market, one day ahead of the monthly jobs report.
The ADP national employment  report showed on Thursday that the U.S. created 250,000 nonfarm jobs, blowing past estimates for an increase of just 191,000 posts and setting an upbeat outlook for the official government data out a day later.
Weekly jobless claims did miss the mark, rising by 250,000 which topped expectations for a reading of just 241,000. However, most economists consider a number below 300,000 to still be a sign of a strengthening labor market and the jobless rate is expected to remain near 17-year lows.
In mixed economic news, IHS Markit’s services purchasing managers' index clocked in at 53.7, beating forecasts for a reading of 52.4.
Although better-than-expected, the reading did show a softer expansion than November’s reading of 54.5."
347,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Tesla's Model 3 Challenges Leave Little `Wiggle Room' on Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. pushed back a key production target for its pivotal Model 3 sedan again, raising questions about whether the electric-car maker may need to raise more cash.
The Elon Musk-led company now expects to assemble 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June, delaying plans to reach that milestone by another three months. Tesla didn’t come close to achieving an initial goal to manufacture that many of the sedans a week by the end of 2017.
Tesla’s slower ramp up in manufacturing Model 3s led analysts to speculate another capital raise could be coming. The carmaker has been blowing through more than $1 billion a quarter as it’s had trouble scaling up output despite spending heavily on robots, assembly lines and tooling for the sedan that is Musk’s cheapest yet, starting at $35,000.
“Bears will point to this as another missed promise,” Joe Spak, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients Wednesday. While a capital raise may not be required, Tesla lacks “a ton of wiggle room” and should seek more cash to mitigate risks, he wrote.
Tesla shares fell 2.6 percent to $308.90 as of 8:55 a.m., in New York before the start of regular trading. The stock climbed 46 percent in 2017 and the company ended the year with a $52.3 billion market capitalization, placing it ahead of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and behind General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
Tesla reported deliveries of 1,550 Model 3s in the final three months of the year, trailing analysts’ average estimate for about 2,900 units in a Bloomberg News survey.
Including Model S sedans and Model X crossovers, Tesla delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles during the fourth quarter. The company delivered 101,312 Model S and Model X vehicles for the year, exceeding its forecast for 100,000 units. Sales of those more expensive models jumped 33 percent from 2016.
In the months leading up to efforts to get the Model 3 up to speed, Tesla raised at least $1.2 billion through an offering of stock and convertible bonds in March and another $1.8 billion by tapping the debt market in August.
Tesla’s bonds due in 2025 were quoted at 94.9 cents at 8:30 a.m., according to Trace bond price data, the lowest in about a month.
In a statement Wednesday, Tesla thanked customers “who continue to stick by us while patiently waiting for their cars.” The company announced the acquisition of Perbix, a closely held maker of automated machines used for manufacturing, back in November, a week after Musk cited challenges with automating Model 3 production.
‘Lofty Goals’
“Tesla has really lofty goals for automation,” Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla shares, said in a phone interview. “One you have it right you can ramp really quickly, but getting to that phase is the difficult part.”
Tesla ended September with about $3.5 billion cash in hand and projected another $1 billion in capital expenditures during the last three months of the year. By postponing production plans, the company may also defer spending, said Jeff Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Co. who has the equivalent of a sell rating on the shares.
The company may need to raise another $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next six months, Osborne said Thursday on Bloomberg Television.
Tesla reported 860 Model 3 sedans were in transit to customers at the end of December. The company said it made significant progress on speeding up manufacturing of the sedan late last month, producing 793 units in the last seven working days.
Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said during an earnings call in November that cash flow will improve significantly once Tesla ramps up Model 3 output because the company will collect money from customers before paying its suppliers. Cowen’s Osborne wrote in a report to clients Wednesday that the carmaker may need to raise more capital again in the next three to six months.
“Tesla is always a quarter away, and now you have to wait six months to get your report card on your investment thesis,” Osborne said by phone Wednesday. “They’ve kicked the can down the road.”

Niki filed for insolvency in Berlin last month after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian unit, grounding the airline's fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.
Following hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it loses its valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG agreed last Friday to buy the business and make it part of its low-cost unit Vueling.
But Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, which could unravel the sale.
Fairplane argues Niki, which is registered as a company in Austria, had been profitable but lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December.
The Charlottenburg court said on Thursday it still believed that Niki was in its jurisdiction because its ""center of main interest"" was in Berlin, where parent Air Berlin was based, according to a statement by Berlin's civil courts.
""The debtor (Niki) appeared to its business partners in a manner that showed it subordinated its corporate identity to  Air Berlin PLC  & Co. Luftverkehrs KG,"" the statement said.
Also, passengers who booked tickets for Niki flights entered a contract with the parent, Air Berlin, it said.
The higher court, Berlin's regional court, will rule on the matter shortly, the statement said, without being more specific.

IAG declined to comment on the matter.

FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America, according to a report published on Thursday.
German reinsurer Munich Re (DE:MUVGn), in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year's total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan.
Although individual events could not be linked directly to climate change, global warming is playing a role, Munich Re said. It expected more frequent extreme events in future.
""We have a new normal,"" said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re's Corporate Climate Center, which monitors climate change risks. 
""2017 was not an outlier,"" he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. ""We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.""
Last year's hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives. 
The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re (DE:HNRGn) both issued profit warnings. 
That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices.
Munich Re's tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017. 
In December,  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Re's estimates as it includes man-made disasters. 
Reinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense.
A big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years.
Early indications suggest modest increases. Global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages, brokers said this week.

A turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 05:58AM ET</span>","Security flaws put virtually all phones, computers at risk","By Douglas Busvine and Stephen Nellis
FRANKFURT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Security researchers on Wednesday disclosed a set of security flaws that they said could let hackers steal sensitive information from nearly every modern computing device containing chips from  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc and ARM Holdings (LON:ARM).
One of the bugs is specific to Intel but another affects laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets and internet servers alike. Intel and ARM insisted that the issue was not a design flaw, but it will require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix.
“Phones, PCs, everything are going to have some impact, but it’ll vary from product to product,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday afternoon. 
Researchers with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Project Zero, in conjunction with academic and industry researchers from several countries, discovered two flaws.
The first, called Meltdown, affects Intel chips and lets hackers bypass the hardware barrier between applications run by users and the computer's memory, potentially letting hackers read a computer's memory and steal passwords. The second, called Spectre, affects chips from Intel, AMD and ARM and lets hackers potentially trick otherwise error-free applications into giving up secret information.
The researchers said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) had patches ready for users for desktop computers affected by Meltdown. Microsoft declined to comment and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment.
Daniel Gruss, one of the researchers at Graz University of Technology who discovered Meltdown, called it ""probably one of the worst CPU bugs ever found"" in an interview with Reuters.
Gruss said Meltdown was the more serious problem in the short term but could be decisively stopped with software patches. Spectre, the broader bug that applies to nearly all computing devices, is harder for hackers to take advantage of but less easily patched and will be a bigger problem in the long term, he said.
Speaking on CNBC, Intel's Krzanich said Google researchers told Intel of the flaws ""a while ago"" and that Intel had been testing fixes that device makers who use its chips will push out next week. Before the problems became public, Google on its blog said Intel and others planned to disclose the issues on Jan. 9. Google said it informed the affected companies about the ""Spectre"" flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the ""Meltdown"" flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.
The flaws were first reported by tech publication The Register. It also reported that the updates to fix the problems could causes Intel chips to operate 5 percent to 30 percent more slowly. Intel denied that the patches would bog down computers based on Intel chips. ""Intel has begun providing software and firmware updates to mitigate these exploits,"" Intel said in a statement. ""Contrary to some reports, any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time."" ARM spokesman Phil Hughes said that patches had already been shared with the companies' partners, which include many smartphone manufacturers. ""This method only works if a certain type of malicious code is already running on a device and could at worst result in small pieces of data being accessed from privileged memory,"" Hughes said in an email. AMD chips are also affected by at least one variant of a set of security flaws but that it can be patched with a software update. The company said it believes there ""is near zero risk to AMD products at this time."" Google said in a blog post that Android phones running the latest security updates are protected, as are its own Nexus and Pixel phones with the latest security updates. Gmail users do not need to take any additional action to protect themselves, but users of its Chromebooks, Chrome web browser and many of its Google Cloud services will need to install updates. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, a cloud computing service used by businesses, said that most of its internet servers were already patched and the rest were in the process of being patched. The defect affects the so-called kernel memory on Intel x86 processor chips manufactured over the past decade, The Register reported citing unnamed programmers, allowing users of normal applications to discern the layout or content of protected areas on the chips. That could make it possible for hackers to exploit other security bugs or, worse, expose secure information such as passwords, thus compromising individual computers or even entire server networks. Dan Guido, chief executive of cyber security consulting firm Trail of Bits, said that businesses should quickly move to update vulnerable systems, saying he expects hackers to quickly develop code they can use to launch attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities. “Exploits for these bugs will be added to hacker’s standard toolkits,” said Guido. Shares in Intel were down by 3.4 percent following the report but nudged back up 1.2 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading while shares in AMD were up 1 percent to $11.77, shedding many of the gains they had made earlier in the day when reports suggested its chips were not affected. It was not immediately clear whether Intel would face any significant financial liability arising from the reported flaw. 
""The current Intel problem, if true, would likely not require CPU replacement in our opinion. However the situation is fluid,"" Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities in New York said in a note, adding it could hurt the company's reputation.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Wanda mulls sport unit IPO and sale of overseas assets - sources,"By Kane Wu, Clare Jim and Liana B. Baker
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's Dalian Wanda Group is considering a Hong Kong listing for its sports assets as part of efforts to rationalize its portfolio that could also include other sales, according to five people familiar with the situation.
The conglomerate last month tapped investment banks for a potential initial public offering of its sports businesses, three of the sources said. Citic Securities, China's largest brokerage, is one of the banks involved, added one of them.
A spokesman for Citic Securities declined to comment. 
Wanda's businesses range from real estate to football and cinemas but it has been rattled in the past year by a government-led crackdown on overseas deals and high leverage. The company is owned by Wang Jianlin, one of China's richest men.
An IPO of Wanda's sports assets would include Infront Sports & Media AG, a Swiss sports marketing company and World Triathlon Corp, the organizer and promoter of the Ironman race, according to three of the people.
The two were acquired in 2015 for $1.2 billion and $650 million respectively. 
The share offering would also include Wanda's smaller sports assets in China, such as cycling and basketball leagues, one of them said. The public float would not involve Wanda's 20 percent stake in the Spanish football club Atletico Madrid, valued at 67 million euros after a recent capital raise, the source said.
The IPO would most likely take place in Hong Kong, but bankers have also pitched for a U.S. listing, according to the people.
Wanda is separately looking to sell Sunseeker International, a British yacht maker it bought in 2013 for $495 million but whose financial performance it has failed to turn around, two other people said.
Wanda declined to comment. The people could not be named as the plans are confidential.
Wanda's interest in property, sports and entertainment - accounting for more than $13 billion of its deals in the past five years - ran into official opposition last year when Beijing labeled overseas deals in those areas ""irrational"". 
In addition to sports, its holdings also include the cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings and movie studio Legendary Entertainment. 
The company is also considering the merits of a pre-IPO funding round for the sports unit, according to one of the people. All plans are still at an early stage however as Wanda is seeking a chief financial officer for the sports business to lead the fundraising efforts, said another of the people.
Property forms the basis of the Wanda empire - its mixed use Wanda Plaza developments are common across China - but this too has put pressure on Wang's business.
Last year, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding for several of its overseas acquisitions as Beijing looks to curb the conglomerate's offshore buying spree. 

Shortly after, Wanda sold a portfolio of hotels and tourism assets, including 13 theme parks, for $9 billion to Guangzhou R&F Properties (HK:2777) and  Sunac  China (HK:1918). Five flagship overseas developments - in London, Chicago, Los Angeles, Sydney and Australia's Gold Coast - are also available for sale, according to one source.

 Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) was a rare laggard, down 2.9 percent after Investec downgraded the stock, saying Chinese anti-corruption measures could affect consumption of costly status symbol products like cognac.
In the UK small-cap space  Debenhams  (L:DEB) shares sank 19 percent after a profit warning. The stock was set for its worst ever daily fall after the UK department store said price cuts failed to lure shoppers in.
Disappointment at the retailer's performance dented other UK retailers which had rallied strongly on Wednesday after Next's (L:NXT) Christmas trading beat.

Asking rents for retail neighborhood and community centers rose 1.8 percent, while effective rent edged 1.9 percent higher, the real estate research firm said.
On an annual basis, 38 metros have a higher vacancy rate but only seven post a decline in asking or effective rent, the report said.
Construction activity fell 53.4 percent, with 1.48 million square feet of new construction completed, according to the report.
Net absorption for retail neighborhood and community centers, measured in terms of available retail space sold in the market during a certain time period, fell 49.7 percent to 1.85 million square feet.
Mall vacancies have been climbing as retailers, hurt by competition from online retail, have been closing stores and filing for bankruptcy.
Retailer Kmart, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD), saw the most closings in the quarter, according to the report.

More companies including Walgreens Boot Alliance Inc (O:WBA), Toys R Us and GAP Inc (N:GPS) would downsize and/or close stores in 2018 while other retailers, gyms and service providers expand, offsetting the vacancies in some metros, the Reis report said.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 jumped 2.46%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.09%. In Sydney, oil and gas producers mostly notched gains, with Santos up 0.28% and Oil Search rising 1.93% as global crude prices gained.
In Greater China, the Shanghai Composite gained 0.27% and the Hang Seng index edged up 0.22%.
Minutes of the Fed's December meeting showed officials expect reductions in corporate and personal taxes to provide boosts to consumer and business spending, though they remain somewhat unsure of how much impact the recently passed reform effort will have.
The Federal Open Market Committee increased their expectations for 2018 GDP growth from 2.1%, or about trend since the post-financial crisis recovery, to 2.5%. “Most participants indicated that prospective changes in federal tax policy were a factor that led them to boost their projections of real GDP growth over the next couple of years,” the minutes stated.
While generally looking favorably on the rising stock market indexes, some officials have expressed concern that keeping policy overly accommodative could inflate bubbles.
“In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, a couple of participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could, over time, pose risks to financial stability,” the minutes said.
Overnight, markets were buoyed by bullish economic data stoking investor expectations for solid economic growth.
The S&P 500 advanced 0.6% to close at 2,713.06 with tech rising 1.1%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 0.8% to 7,065.53, with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surging more than 5%. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 98.97 points higher at 24,922.68, as it closed in on the 25,000 mark.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 59.7 in December from 58.2 in the previous month. That beat economists for forecast for reading of 58.2.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, well below 50 indicates contraction.
The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% to a record of $1.257 trillion in November, topping economists forecast for a 0.6% rise.

As of Dec. 8, the Wall Street brokerage stopped approving new orders for the Bitcoin Investment Trust due to concerns about the ""suitability and eligibility standards of this product,"" according to the memo sent to roughly 17,000 brokers at Merrill Lynch and Merrill Edge, a unit for clients who manage their own trades.
Bitcoin Investment Trust is run by Grayscale Investments, which is led by Silbert. A former Wall Street investment banker and prominent supporter of cryptocurrencies, Silbert's role in the world of digital coins was the subject of a Reuters special report last month.
""We look forward to speaking with Merrill Lynch and addressing any questions or concerns they have about the Bitcoin Investment Trust,"" Silbert told Reuters in an email. ""We are unaware of any similar policies at other brokerage firms.""
Wall Street has taken a cautious approach to digital currencies, which are unregulated and have very volatile trading patterns. Last month, Chicago-based derivatives exchanges Cboe Global Markets and the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) launched bitcoin futures, but some banks and brokerages remain reluctant to trade them.
Millions of investors have piled into bitcoin and other digital currencies prompting warnings of a bubble from the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has likened bitcoin to a “fraud” that will eventually blow up.
Shares in Bitcoin Investment Trust jumped over 1,550 percent last year, more than the 1,300 percent plus gain of bitcoin. The fund was created for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin and trades ""over the counter"" in less formal exchanges than those used for typical stocks.
Before last month's ban, clients of Merrill Lynch's brokerage and Merrill Edge were able to buy stakes in Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trade at a fraction of a bitcoin. The digital currency is currently valued at around $15,000.
Merrill Lynch brokerage clients with historic positions in the Bitcoin Investment Trust fund can maintain them, but clients with fee-based advisory accounts have to sell their holdings, according to the memo.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The judge overseeing the bankruptcy of Takata Corp's (PK:TKTDQ) U.S. unit on Wednesday cleared the way for the company's creditors to vote on its Chapter 11 plan, which critics say limits the legal rights of those injured by its deadly airbags.
Takata and its U.S. entity TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy in June after more than 100 million of its airbags were recalled because they could inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments.
The airbags have been linked to at least 180 injuries and 18 deaths, including one in Louisiana that was identified last month. 
During Wednesday's hearing, the judge reviewed the adequacy of TK Holdings' disclosures, which attempt to summarize and translate the dense legalese of the company's proposed reorganization plan. 
Critics have said the plan favors automakers over car owners. They used the hearing to test arguments that could be raised again at a Feb. 13 confirmation hearing, when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon in Wilmington, Delaware, will decide if the plan is fair and meets other requirements.
Shannon raised the possibility on Wednesday that he might not approve a proposal contained in the reorganization plan to establish a fund to compensate those with personal injury claims caused by airbags in vehicles made by Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267). 
The trust would pay compensation based on the injury, ranging from $10,000 for bruising to $5 million for death or loss of eyesight, according to court documents. 
Car owners would be barred from suing Honda and other car makers could opt to join the trust arrangement.
Sander Esserman, a lawyer representing car owners seeking to recover costs related to the recall, criticized the trust proposal because it limited the rights of consumers by barring punitive damages and paying compensation in installments.
Honda's attorney, Jessica Boelter of Sidley Austin, said the company was owed $9.4 billion from the recall, which she said was the biggest claim of any automaker. 

Takata plans to sell its viable operations to Key Safety Systems, an affiliate of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp (SS:600699), for $1.6 billion. The proceeds will fund restitution claims for automakers and help pay personal injury and wrongful death claims.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) is nearing a deal to acquire investment firm Fortress Investment Group LLC's stake in U.S. subprime lender OneMain Holdings Inc (N:OMF), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The deal would come after OneMain abandoned a process to sell itself outright last year, because the offers it received failed to meet its valuation expectations. It allows Fortress, which completed its $3.3 billion sale to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) last week, to cash out on its investment in OneMain.
The transaction is expected to value Fortress' stake of around 44 percent in OneMain at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, and could be announced as early as Thursday, assuming talks do not fall apart at the last minute, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.
Apollo declined to comment, while OneMain and Fortress did not respond to requests for comment.
OneMain, which has provided loans and other credit products to more than 10 million customers in 44 states according to its website, was  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) former consumer lending arm, CitiFinancial, until it was renamed in 2011. It specializes in loans to meet unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairs, and to buy small-ticket items. 
OneMain, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 billion, was created in its current form in 2015, when Fortress acquired OneMain from Citigroup for $4.25 billion in cash and merged it with one of its existing portfolio companies, Springleaf Holdings Inc. 
The deal with Apollo would mark the latest exit by Fortress from a portfolio company. Among Fortress' recent divestments are Florida East Coast Railway and bond fund manager Logan Circle Partners.

For Apollo, the deal represents a way to own a big chunk of OneMain without engaging in a full leveraged buyout, given that the company is already saddled with more than $14 billion in long-term debt.

411,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 06:08PM ET</span>","Tesla pushes back Model 3 production target again, despite progress","By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) delayed a production target for its new Model 3 sedan for the second time on Wednesday, disappointing investors even as it claimed ""major progress"" overcoming manufacturing challenges that have hampered the vehicle's rollout.
The electric vehicle maker headed by Elon Musk said it would likely build about 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter, half the number it had earlier promised. Instead, Tesla said it now plans to reach its goal of 5,000 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter.
The delay sent shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company down 2 percent in after-market trading.
The Model 3 is critical to Tesla's long-term success, as it is the most affordable of its cars to date and is the only one capable of transforming the niche automaker to a mass producer amid a sea of rivals entering the nascent electric vehicle market.
Building the car efficiently and delivering it without delays to customers is also critical, as the money-losing company faces high cash burn. Delays increase the risk that reservation-holders will cancel orders. 
""The further delay to (production volume) will leave analysts and investors focused on the implications for cash as we head through the first half of the year,” Evercore analyst George Galliers told Reuters.
The company burned through $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in its third quarter and said in November that fourth-quarter capex would also be about $1.1 billion. 
RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note that he did not believe Tesla will be required to do a capital raise. 
""We have them hovering about $1 billion in cash ... They don't have a ton of wiggle room though in our view,"" Spak said. 
In delivering 1,550 of its new Model 3 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, Tesla fell short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had expected 4,100 Model 3 sedans to be delivered in the fourth quarter, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.
The estimates for Model 3 deliveries by different brokerages varied widely. While Evercore analysts estimated 5,800 deliveries, Cowen analysts expected just 2,250.
Tesla said 860 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the fourth quarter.
The company said it delivered a total of 29,870 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 15,200 Model S vehicles and 13,120 Model X cars. Analysts had expected total deliveries of about 30,000.
PRODUCTION ACCELERATING
Tesla had initially predicted to reach the milestone of 5,000 vehicles per week in December, but in November deferred the target to the end of the first quarter.
Tesla said on Wednesday its production rate had increased significantly despite the delays. 
""In the last seven working days of the quarter, we made 793 Model 3s, and in the last few days, we hit a production rate on each of our manufacturing lines that extrapolates to over 1,000 Model 3s per week,"" the company said in a statement.
That pace of production is still below that of many carmakers. A conventional car factory operating at full speed on two shifts can churn out nearly 1,000 vehicles a day.
The Model 3 - which starts at $35,000, or about half the price of its flagship Model S - was met with great enthusiasm when its prototype was first unveiled in early 2016. Tesla said in August it had about 500,000 reservations for the car and demand was not a constraint.
Production, however, hit snags during a period of ""manufacturing hell"" Musk first warned of in July. Among the issues Tesla faced was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, which required a redesign.
In its third quarter, Tesla built just 260 Model 3s.
Although bullish investors have generally waved off early Model 3 problems, instead focusing on the future prospects of Tesla, critics warn that Model 3 issues could sour demand for Tesla's mass-market vehicle, delay sorely needed revenue and compromise the company's ability to raise cash in the future.

Tesla shares, despite paring some gains from a high of $385 in September, still trade at 46 percent above their price a year ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index rose above 2,700 for the first time on Wednesday and other major indexes hit record closing highs as technology stocks climbed after signs of robust economic growth.
Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year.
""They reiterated gradual rate increases, so that's steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy.
For technology stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers. The S&P 500 tech index, the best-performing S&P sector in 2017 with a 37 percent jump, ended the day up 1.1 percent.
U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016.
""The (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there's still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,"" Hellwig said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.
The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.15, just shy of its record low close of 9.14 on Nov. 3.
Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent.
 Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers.
Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) rose 3 percent.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Crop shares were up 2.3 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded its rating on the business software maker.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

On the day the law started, U.K. regulators granted a 30-month reprieve to Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and London Metal Exchange venues from having to comply with a key provision intended to inject more competition and end discriminatory practices in the market.
The U.K. announcement on exchange-traded derivatives followed a move on Tuesday by Germany’s financial supervisor, BaFin, to grant a similar delay until July 2020 for Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) AG’s Eurex clearing unit. The goal of the requirements is to open access in the market by enabling traders to transact a deal on one venue and have it guaranteed at a separate clearinghouse.
The French markets regulator AMF also granted a 30-month deferral to exchange operator Euronext NV, according to spokeswoman Florence Gaubert.
Steven Maijoor, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority, told reporters on Wednesday that the requirement to improve access between trading platforms and clearinghouses is “very important.” Maijoor said the U.K. and German decisions to delay the requirements, steps allowed by the law, “is an indication of the expected impact of these open access provisions.”
Brexit Impact
The three firms applied for the delay, and some industry executives have said Britain’s decision to leave the European Union may have contributed to the need for the deferrals. The rules say national authorities should weigh the risks to the “orderly functioning” of trading platforms and clearinghouses when considering requests for a deferral of the open-access requirement for 30 months.
ICE Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher told analysts in November that exchanges and regulators were discussing whether the requirement made sense in the context of Brexit.
“If we think of MiFID II as being essentially forced fragmentation of markets in order to stimulate competition, you’ve got this overlay now of a population that voted for fragmentation,” Sprecher said. “And is there still a role right now for government to implement forced fragmentation when the market itself is fragmenting the market in ways that none of us sitting here today can fully comprehend?”
A spokesperson for Eurex said “Brexit is a game changer” and that the open-access rules raised financial stability concerns. The LME said in a statement that the regulatory decisions are a recognition of “the current risks open access applications could pose to the orderly functioning of financial markets.”
The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc has supported open access requirements in recent years. A spokesperson said the company “will continue, working in partnership with our customers to promote greater choice, transparency and innovation in financial markets, in order to reduce risk and maximize capital and operational efficiencies.”

Apple's customers have not been very pleased since the company said last month it intentionally slowed down older iPhones with weakening batteries to prevent the handset from shutting off abruptly.
Following consumer outrage, Apple apologized and slashed the price of out-of-warranty replacement batteries to $29 from $79 for iPhone 6 or later models.
Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz says 77 percent of iPhone customers are using iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE, which means even a small percentage opting for battery replacement over upgrade could have meaningful impact on iPhone sales.

The company faces eight lawsuits filed in California, New York and Illinois over the issue.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 04:48PM ET</span>","Investors ignore U.S. auto sales outlook, bet on pickups and SUVs","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Most major automakers on Wednesday reported lower December U.S. sales and forecast weaker overall sales in 2018, but investors bid up shares in the sector on a bet that high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs will pull Detroit's automakers through any downturn.
The December numbers were above analyst expectations, lifting the shares of General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA). According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in December fell to 17.9 million units from 18.2 million in December 2016. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a SAAR for December of 17.5 million units.
Investors were pleased GM had cut its inventory of unsold vehicles - a concern for the industry earlier in 2017 - at the end of December to 63 days supply unsold vehicles, beating its target of around 70 days supply.
But GM said it expects the industry to sell less than 17 million new vehicles in 2018. According Autodata, 2017 full-year sales hit 17.23 million units, down nearly 2 percent from an all-time U.S. record of 17.55 million units in 2016. 
Automakers' challenges in 2018 include dealing with an ongoing shift in consumer preference away from passenger cars to more profitable pickup trucks and SUVs, and an influx of millions of nearly-new, off-lease vehicles that are cheaper than new vehicles.
Automakers are still assessing the potential impacts of rising interest rates and the sweeping tax overhaul passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress last month. 
Charlie Chesbrough, chief economist at Cox Automotive, owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, said the group expects 2018 sales to hit 16.7 million units and rising interest rates are one of the industry's challenges this year as they increase monthly car payments.
""That's real money to consumers,"" Chesbrough said on a conference call.
Ford chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris said on a conference call that interest rates are a ""headwind, but a very minor one.""
Tax cuts, however, should be a ""net positive"" for the industry, she added. 
Scott Keogh, U.S. head of  Audi AG  (DE:NSUG), said that while tax cuts would help luxury consumers, new federal limits on local and state tax deductions could hurt sales in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest American luxury vehicle markets. 
Consumer discounts also remain a concern for the industry. Discounts of more than 10 percent of a vehicle's sticker price can hurt resale values, in turn weighing on new vehicle sales. In December, auto consultancies J.D. Power and LMC estimated discounts had topped 10 percent for the 17th time in the last 18 months.
Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial consulting at consultancy AlixPartners LLP - which expects U.S. industry sales to drop to 16.6 million in 2018 - said so far high discounts have not hurt automakers too much, but pricing discipline is a real concern moving forward.
""What we're really nervous about is if someone defects and adds $1,000 to the hood... and forces others to respond to protect market share,"" Wakefield said. 
GM reported a 3.3 percent drop in sales in December, driven by a decline in lower-margin fleet sales to government agencies and rental car companies. GM's retail sales were up 1.8 percent. 
The automaker said its average transaction price hit $35,400 in 2017, above the industry average of $31,600.
Ford reported a 0.9 percent increase in sales for December, fueled by a 17 percent increase in fleet sales. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said its retail sales were down 4 percent. 
GM shares closed up 2.4 percent, Ford shares ended up 0.8 percent and Fiat Chrysler closed up 2.4 percent.
Fiat Chrysler posted an 11 percent sales decrease, with retail sales dropping 3 percent. Fleet sales slumped 42 percent, in line with a company strategy over the last year to cut back on this low-margin way to unload product. 
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said its sales fell 8.3 percent in December, with decreases across all segments. 
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) posted a 7 percent drop in sales in December, driven mostly by declining passenger car sales. 

Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) reported a 9.5 percent drop in sales.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) on Wednesday agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit, in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity. 
Petrobras denied any wrongdoing in the deal, which was one of the largest securities class action settlements in U.S. history. With the settlement, it will pay out more than six times what it has received so far under a Brazilian probe into bribery schemes that involved company executives and government officials. 
The settlement, smaller than many analysts anticipated, was an important milestone for the oil firm as it tries to emerge from the scandal that has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country's corporate executives.
But the deal reduces chances the world's most indebted oil company will pay a dividend for 2017, much anticipated by investors who have not seen such a payment since 2014 when the scandal came to light, a source familiar with the matter said. 
For the last four years Brazil has been rocked by the so-called Car Wash investigation into kickbacks from contractors to executives of state-run companies and politicians in return for public projects. 
The settlement put an end to ""extremely high uncertainty"" about the company's potential liability, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a client note, adding that it had expected a figure above $5 billion. Analysts at Brazilian bank BTG Pactual said the market had expected a settlement of $5 billion to $10 billion. 
Petrobras preferred shares closed up nearly 0.91 percent to 16.70 reais. U.S.-traded shares (N:PBR) rose 2.52 percent at $10.97.
Moody's brushed off concerns about the impact of the fine on the company's balance sheet, noting it was expected to generate some $30 billion in cash this year and make capital investments of around $15 billion.
""Petrobras' liquidity position is adequate and the payment of the agreed class action settlement amount is not a material concern,"" it said. 
""EXCELLENT RESULT""
Jeremy Lieberman, an attorney for the investors, called the deal an ""excellent result"" and said it was the largest ever involving a foreign securities issuer in the United States.
The deal came as the U.S. Supreme Court was set to consider on Friday whether to hear Petrobras' appeal of a lower court decision certifying the case as a class action. Petrobras said it and the investors would ask the Supreme Court to put off considering the case while the settlement awaits approval.
If the Supreme Court does take the case, it could delay its resolution for years.
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan must still approve the accord.
Investors had sued Petrobras after prosecutors in Brazil accused executives of accepting more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade, mainly from construction and engineering companies.
In a securities filing on Wednesday, Petrobras claimed it was a victim and denied wrongdoing, adding that it has only recovered 1.475 billion reais ($455.77 million) for itself from the Car Wash investigation. 
But its market value has plunged as its central role in the scheme continues to be unwound by investigators.
Petrobras said it hoped the settlement would resolve all investor claims in the United States where 13 individual lawsuits remain open, following settlements in 20 other cases. 
Some claims involving non-U.S.-based Petrobras securities purchased outside the United States also still remain.
The deal came days after Brazil's securities regulator CVM formally accused eight former Petrobras executives of corruption.
The accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drilling ships, according to a legal filing by the regulator last Friday. 
Among the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras Chief Executives Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli. Neither could be reached for comment.
The largest securities fraud settlements in U.S. history include $7.2 billion stemming from the collapse of Enron, $6.2 billion over an accounting scandal at WorldCom and $3.2 billion over an accounting scandal at Tyco International, according to Stanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.

The company also said it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be below its $5.80-$5.90 per share forecast. The impacts of the tax act in the fourth quarter will reduce American Express' regulatory capital and capital ratios for the fourth quarter, the company said. In the long run, AmEx expects the lower corporate tax rate to be a significant benefit. The company anticipates effective tax rate in the low twenties before discrete tax items in 2018. Congress' U.S. tax overhaul bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month, significantly cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. According to the new law, profits brought back to the United States would not be taxed at the full 35-percent corporate tax rate that would normally be due. Instead, those profits would be taxed at only 15.5 percent for cash assets and 8 percent for illiquid assets. 
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said last week it also expects fourth-quarter earnings to decrease by about $5 billion due to the tax legislation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Think of the stock market right now as a high-school cafeteria. The most popular kids in school are growth investors, high-fiving and riding a multi-year bull run.
Meanwhile, the geeky kids off to the side, eating lunch by themselves, are the value investors.
But those geeks often end up on top as adults. So even in this growth-oriented economy, you would be wise to have a value component to your portfolio.
For a double bargain, look to value-driven exchange-traded funds, which not only offer rock-bottom management fees but in some cases have been matching or even exceeding the broader market in gains.
""Given how strong a bull market we have had, there will be an inevitable rotation to value,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at independent advisory firm CFRA. ""In fact, value has already showing signs of improvement.""
Take the Deep Value ETF from TWM funds. As the name implies, the fund contains in its top 10 holdings the stocks of a number of firms that have been battered, most notably in retail, including Macy's Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Kohls Corp and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). 
Also represented in the Deep Value fund are some long-in-the-tooth tech firms like Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) PLC and  Xerox Corp  (NYSE:XRX), and pharma play  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). The result is an average price-earnings ratio of around 13, well below the S&P 500's collective P/E which is now over 25.
Those beaten-up names might make investors a little queasy, especially since this ETF is so concentrated with just 20 stocks. But you cannot argue with the performance: It boasts one-year returns of 23.1 percent, matching the S&P 500, to add to 2016's 24.8 percent.
Other value ETFs have been picking up bargains, while the rest of the universe obsesses over growth. Another standout is Guggenheim Investments' S&P Pure Value ETF. It sifts through the S&P 500, eliminates all growth stocks and the so-called ""muddle in the middle,"" and comes up with 114 pure value plays.
Among its top holdings is telecom provider  CenturyLink  Inc (NYSE:CTL), Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, agriculture play Archer Daniels Midland Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).
The one-year performance is 17.2 percent, with five-year gains at 16 percent annually - not bad for a supposedly out-of-favor strategy. ""Since we've been in a market where growth has outperformed, many investors are now looking at value's relative appeal,"" said William Belden, Guggenheim's director of ETF development. ""And over time, a value tilt tends to outperform its growth peers.""
The $890-million fund also boasts an affordable expense ratio of .35 percent. In the fund's rebalancing in December financial and utilities were trimmed back, thanks to their recent runups, while consumer discretionary stocks were boosted.
A word of caution for value-minded investors: Such deep-value and pure-value screens tend to make holdings more limited, and therefore more volatile, than broader market indices.
Investors wary of concentrated bets should perhaps look to a larger, steadier ship like Vanguard's Value Index Fund. This fund, five-star-rated by Chicago-based research shop Morningstar, contains 329 total stocks and annualized returns of 15.2 percent over five years.
Its biggest holdings are familiar blue-chippers like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). Perhaps best of all for value-conscious investors, its expense ratio is a microscopic 0.06 percent.

Part of the appeal of value ETFs is that when the next downturn comes, high-flying growth stocks will likely get pounded more than reliable blue chips. Value stocks traditionally provide more downside protection, in part due to their dividend payouts which provide a share-price floor and attract income investors.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 02:11PM ET</span>","U.S. charges ex-Och-Ziff executive with fraud, obstruction of justice","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged Michael Cohen, the former head of European investing at hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group (N:OZM), with fraud and obstruction of justice, according to court documents unsealed on Wednesday.
In an indictment filed in Brooklyn, New York federal court, prosecutors said that Cohen, 46, concealed conflicts of interest from a United Kingdom-based charitable foundation and obstructed a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into corruption involving the fund in Africa.
The government charged Cohen, who lives in London, with 10 counts ranging from conspiracy to commit investment adviser fraud to making false statements.
Cohen, according to the indictment, failed to tell the charitable foundation that one of the sellers of an African mining company's shares owed him millions of dollars on a delinquent loan. The government also alleged that Cohen tried to cover up the facts when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began probing the hedge fund in 2011.
In a statement, Ronald White, Cohen's lawyer, said: ""Mr. Cohen has done nothing wrong and is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be shown that the government’s charges are baseless.""
In September 2016, the New York-based hedge fund agreed to pay more than $400 million to settle charges that it bribed officials in Libya, Congo and several other African countries. A unit also agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges. 
Separately, Och-Ziff's founder, billionaire investor Dan Och, agreed to pay more than $2 million to settle claims with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The bribery allegations hurt the firm as investors quickly pulled out money, shrinking its assets to $32 billion as of Jan. 1, 2018 compared with $39 billion in 2016.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Howard Hughes shares hurt as Ackman trims stake to invest in own fund,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares in  Howard Hughes Corp  (N:HHC) dropped more than 3 percent on Wednesday after billionaire investor William Ackman, who chairs the real estate company's board and called it an attractive buy in May, said his firm would sell 2.5 million shares.
Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management is Howard Hughes' biggest shareholder, is trimming the firm's holdings for tax reasons and insists he hasn't soured on one of his hedge fund's longest-held investments. He needs to make the move in order to invest some $300 million of his own money into Pershing Square Holdings (AS:PSH), his publicly listed portfolio that trades like a closed-end fund. 
But investors' reaction to the news that he is slimming down his Howard Hughes stake illustrates just how much sway the activist investor has in the stock market even after three straight years of losses at his $9.3 billion firm.
In afternoon trading Howard Hughes Corp's stock stood at $128.52, off 3.25 percent. The company, whose real estate assets include master planned communities like Summerlin near Las Vegas and The Woodlands near Houston, helped performance at Ackman's firm in the first three quarters of 2017, the fund manager told clients.
He announced the move -- Pershing Square Capital Management will still own a 17.6 percent economic stake, down from 23.4 percent -- as he tries to fix his lagging portfolio, Pershing Square Holdings. After months of buying back more than $40 million worth of Pershing Square Holdings shares, the shares were still trading roughly 20 percent below their net asset value, marking another disappointment for Ackman.
Sluggish returns -- the Pershing Square Holdings portfolio lost 4 percent in 2017 while Pershing Square International lost roughly 1.5 percent - coupled with investor defections and concerns that Ackman's investment ideas aren't as powerful as they once were, are prompting new moves, including the planned $300 million cash infusion from Ackman and senior associates.
While the move hurt Howard Hughes' stock, it helped Pershing Square Holdings. Its Amsterdam-listed shares rose 3.6 percent.
The cash infusion from Ackman, whose net worth is estimated at $1.4 billion by Forbes, is aimed to ""assist in reducing the discount to net asset value at which PSH's public shares currently trade,"" the release said.

In May 2017, when Ackman tried to convince other investors to bet on Howard Hughes, he said the company wasn't well known and its stock price was inexpensive.

Procon-SP, an agency in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous, said in a statement it notified Apple that it has 10 days to provide the information.
The agency said Apple employees refused to sign the notification, but Procon considered the company notified.
The agency did not say what could happen if Apple does not comply, but it has the power to fine or propose legal action against companies for causing losses to consumers.
Press representatives for Apple in Brazil did not reply to requests for comment. 
Apple (O:AAPL) apologized on Dec. 28 over its handling of the battery issue and said it would make a number of changes for customers. The company said it would cut the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 for an iPhone 6 or later, starting this month.

The company said the jobs and positions it plans to eliminate mostly focus on products and categories where the company has or expects to soon lose exclusivity.
The drugmaker said it expects to take a $125 million charge from the job cuts, primarily due to severance, most of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Allergan said cost savings from this restructuring program

should be around $300 million to $400 million per year.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered on Wednesday from a muted start to the year as a rising dollar boosted exporters and new records on Wall Street lifted spirits on a day devoted to the implementation of the new European MiFID II market rules.
Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) gained 0.6 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index closed up 0.5 percent while trading volumes were slightly up from the previous session despite new financial regulations kicking in. 
A greenback rally triggered by upbeat U.S. manufacturing and construction data ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting minutes helped blue chips in France and in Germany. 
Frankfurt's DAX (GDAXI) and Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) both jumped 0.9 percent. 
""It's a recovery session"", said Pierre Martin, a senior sales at Saxo Bank, noting that apart from the favorable currency effect, oil prices gave a boost to energy stocks and that other sectors, such as retail, industrials, healthcare or technology, had also supported indexes. 
Shares in British retailer  Next  (L:NXT) rose 6.7 percent after it raised profit guidance on better than expected Christmas sales.
Next is the first major listed retailer to give an update on Christmas trading, but its optimistic update lifted other retailers such as Ocado (L:OCDO), up 7.7 percent or Primark owner Associated British Foods (L:ABF), up 2.1 percent. 
""As much as (Next's) update is good news, the constant update-by-update tinkering of guidance and sharp reactions by the share price just goes to show how shareholders are at the mercy of UK consumer trends and whims,"" said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. 
""The retail sector is a very tricky one.""
Europe's retail index (SXRP), one of the major underperformers of 2017, was up 0.7 percent.
Europe's energy sector (SXEP) built on the previous sessions' gains with a 1.25 percent advance, helped by firmer oil prices which rose to the highest in 2-1/2 years as unrest continued in OPEC member Iran.

The case was brought by Waterloo Industries Inc of Sedalia, Missouri, a subsidiary of Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc (N:FBHS), which says it accounts for more than one-half of domestic production of tool chests and cabinets.
In 2016, the value of imports of tool chests from China totalled $990 million, Commerce Department data show.
On Nov. 22, the Commerce Department calculated final countervailing or anti-subsidy duty rates of 15.09 percent for Jiangsu Tongrun Equipment Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002150), 14.03 percent for Zhongshan Geelong Manufacturing Co Ltd, and 14.39 percent for all other producers or exporters in China that responded to its inquiries.
Companies that did not respond to the department's questionnaire were assigned a final subsidy rate of 95.96 percent.
In a separate anti-dumping investigation, the Commerce Department said on Nov. 13 it had made a preliminary finding that certain companies from China were selling tool chests on the U.S. market at 90.40 percent to 168.93 percent below fair value.
As part of that same finding, the department calculated a preliminary anti-dumping rate of 230.31 percent for Vietnam's Clearwater Metal Single Entity.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>","Dominion Energy to buy Scana, assume failed nuclear project costs","By Yashaswini Swamynathan
(Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc (N:D) said on Wednesday it would buy Scana Corp (N:SCG) in an all-stock deal worth about $7.9 billion, offering the utility a way out of dealing with unhappy customers and federal investigations following a failed nuclear project.
Dominion will pay Scana's customers $1.3 billion, averaging about $1,000 for each customer, and has promised to cut bills by 5 percent to appease users who have been overcharged for years as Scana funded the nuclear project.
Shares of Dominion, which will also assume Scana's debt of $6.7 billion, were down 3 percent.
Dominion's $55.35 per share offer represents a premium of 42.4 percent to Scana's last closing price of $38.87. Scana's shares were trading well below the offer price at $47.79, suggesting some investors were skeptical of the deal.
Scana, which owns the South Carolina Electric & Gas Co (SCE&G), has been under pressure ever since it scrapped the V.C. Summer nuclear project in July after spending about $9 billion on it with Santee Cooper.
Scana was funding some of the project's costs from SCE&G, a move that angered customers and led to the utility rolling back electricity rates for residential users.
The nuclear project became a lightning rod for criticism, with local politicians arguing over who should pay for the aborted project.
South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said while the deal is a step in the right direction, it will not resolve all problems for customers.
""The only way to resolve this travesty is to sell Santee Cooper,"" McMaster said, noting that the state-owned utility had racked up debt of $4 billion as it partnered Scana on the project.
As part of the deal, Dominion will also write off more than $1.7 billion in connection with the abandoned nuclear plant.
Guggenheim Securities analyst Shahriar Pourreza said he expects regulators to approve the deal.
""Scana does not have any other option and regulators will be aware of that, so the deal is likely to go through but it will be noisy,"" Pourreza said.
Virginia-based Dominion is offering 0.6690 of its shares for each Scana share, or about $55.35, based on Dominion's average stock price of the last 30 trading days ended Jan. 2.
The deal is expected to immediately add to earnings after its closure in the third quarter, Dominion said.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was the financial adviser for Dominion.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and RBC Capital Markets advised Scana.

Share repurchases may jump by more than 70 percent on an annualized basis to $875 billion amid a tax overhaul that encourages the repatriation of profits held abroad, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence. At least, that was the magnitude of growth in completed buybacks in 2004-2005, the last time the U.S. firms were granted a tax repatriation holiday.
For anyone who thinks repurchases drive share gains, an explosion this big would put to rest concerns that crept up in recent months as the pace fell off. Completed buybacks in the year ending Sept. 30 were $555.4 billion, near the lowest level since 2013, data by Birinyi Associates show.
“The buyback announcements will come in the first half of this year, and most of them will change the buyback policy in the short run, if the money goes to buybacks,” said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “If we see the buyback yield change and move positively in a meaningful way, it increases the appeal of equities relative to other classes.”
Conceivably, it’s another reason for cheer among U.S. equity investors, who last week were the most bullish on U.S. stocks in more than three years, according to a weekly poll of clients by the American Association of Individual Investors.
The tax overhaul implies that the U.S. firms’ overseas income held as cash -- normally taxed at a 35 percent rate upon being brought home -- would be subject to a 15.5 percent rate, while non-cash holdings like real estate would have an 8 percent tax rate.
Tech megacaps that have a large international presence and hoards of cash stashed overseas may spearhead the growth in the rate of buybacks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). may increase its share buyback by $69 billion on top of the $166 billion already spent on share repurchases from June 2012 to September 2017, according to Gene Munster, a co-founder at Loup Ventures co-founder who had previously worked as an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., where he was known for his accuracy in predicting Apple Inc.’s financial potential.
On the other hand, what happened during the time of the U.S. tax holiday in 2004-2005 might not hold true in 2018, and some analysts are voicing concerns.
“I am trying to figure out what the companies are going to do with their tax money, but so is every other analyst on Wall Street,” said Matt Maley, a strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. “I think we are to see a lot of surprises in the next few months. I wouldn’t bet all the money on just buyback or just dividend stocks.”

510,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>",Blackstone's Byron Wien unveils his big surprises for 2018,"
Blackstone vice chairman and investing stalwart Byron Wien is out with his list of surprises for 2018.
Wien defines his surprises as things that have a better-than-50% chance of happening, but which the average investor anticipates a less than 30% likelihood of occurring.
2017 was not the strongest year in terms of how his forecasts played out. When Business Insider spoke to Wien in September, he acknowledged that he had been ""dead wrong"" on the dollar, wrong on inflation, and on the German election (Angela Merkel won a fourth term a few days later).
President Donald Trump definitely did not soften his tone, the euro didn't reach parity against the dollar (it's at a three-year high), and crude oil sneaked above $60 per barrel in the final week of 2017.
But the economy did achieve 3% growth, the S&P 500 zoomed past 2,500 in October, and Japan's stock market had a strong year.
Here's what Wien thinks could happen in 2018:
""China finally decides that a nuclear capability in the hands of an unpredictable leader on its border is not tolerable even though North Korea is a communist buffer between itself and democratic South Korea. China cuts off all fuel and food shipments to North Korea, which agrees to suspend its nuclear development program but not give up its current weapons arsenal.""
""In the United Kingdom Jeremy Corbyn becomes the next Prime Minister. In spite of repressive action by the Spanish government, Catalonia remains turbulent.""
""Real growth exceeds 3% in the United States, which, coupled with the implementation of some components of the Trump pro-business agenda, renews investor interest in owning dollar-denominated assets, and the euro drops to 1.10 and the yen to 120 against the dollar.""

511,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",BAML: Stocks could surge 19% this year because investors are the right kind of cautious," Cautious stock traders are unwittingly helping their own cause by not getting ahead of themselves.
A monthly survey conducted by Michael Hartnett's team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows that while an indicator of investor exuberance has risen for a third straight month, it's still nowhere near extended enough to suggest a downturn is coming.
In fact, when the so-called Sell Side Indicator has been at this level in the past, it has preceded a median 12-month return of 19%, according to BAML data. That would imply a 2018 year-end price of roughly 3,200 for the S&P 500, a target that would be at the top end of Wall Street strategist forecasts.
The chart below shows just how far investors are from getting overly exuberant. Only when the Sell Side Indicator climbs above the red line does it flash a ""sell"" signal — and, as you can see, it's still a long way away.
That this wariness exists at a time when stock indexes are continuing to hit record highs speaks to just how reluctant traders have been to throw caution to the wind when it comes to equities.
As such, the 8-1/2-year bull market, commonly referred to as the ""most hated"" in history, has kept grinding forward as sentiment has stayed largely in check. And that has allowed investors to focus on the fundamentals, which — between earnings growth, steady economic expansion, and easy monetary conditions — look resoundingly positive.
But that's not to say US stock investors are out of the woods. All of these factors working in their favor could certainly push them into ""extreme bullishness"" territory. Also, while the buy and sell signals attached to the Sell Side Indicator are calculated based on a rolling 15-year average, the picture is much starker if you shorten that time frame.
Back in October, BAML pointed out that an alternative methodology based on a four-year mean was flashing a sell signal for the S&P 500. And while clearly no such drop materialized, the firm has long recommended staying hedged against any sort of unexpected shock. Because while historical studies are helpful, there's no telling what will actually happen in real time."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks hit fresh highs on Wednesday with European markets joining the party as early indications suggest 2018 will be another year of synchronized global growth led by a robust European economy. 
After its biggest one-day gain in more than two weeks on Tuesday, and in the wake of its best year since 2009 in 2017, MSCI's index of global stocks (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, pushed on to new record highs. 
The pan-European stock index (STOXX) was 0.2 percent higher following gains for their Asian and U.S. counterparts overnight as manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. U.S. stock futures (ESc1) suggested another higher open on Wednesday. 
The single currency  was holding near a four-month high of $1.2081 hit on Tuesday. 
""Investors have woken up in the new year and looked forward to another firm year for global growth with very muted downside risk,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw. But he warned against reading too much into the first two trading days of the new year.
""The converse is the sell-off in bond markets: the idea that inflation pressures may be firmer than expected and central banks could take a slightly more aggressive approach than previously thought,"" Shaw added. 
ECB rate-setter Ewald Nowotny told a German newspaper that the European Central Bank may end its stimulus program this year if the euro zone economy continues to grow strongly. 
Earlier in the session, Asian stocks struck a range of new peaks: a record high for Philippine stocks (PSI), a 24-year top for Thailand (SETI) and a decade-high for Hong Kong (HSI).
MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.4 percent, having jumped 1.4 percent on Tuesday in its best performance since last March.
This came after Wall Street started the new year as it ended the old, scoring another set of record closing peaks. The Dow (DJI) rose 0.42 percent, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 1.5 percent. 
The gains in riskier assets came as industry surveys from India to Germany to Canada showed quickening activity.
""The breadth of the recovery is extraordinary,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) macro strategist Alan Ruskin, noting that of 31 countries covered, only three failed to show growth while all the largest manufacturing sectors improved.

The U.S. International Trade Commision recommended in November tariffs to keep Samsung and its home rival  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) from flooding the U.S. market with inexpensive washers, a step that would benefit American appliance giant Whirlpool Corp (N:WHR). 
Samsung said at the time that any tariffs would raise prices and impair job creation at its $380 million plant in South Carolina, which was announced in June to produce washing machines and other appliances. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision on the recommendation early this year. 
When asked about whether the plant will begin operations this month, Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Yoon Boo-keun confirmed the plan to reporters on Wednesday. He did not elaborate. 

The plant, Samsung's first U.S. appliances factory in more than three decades, was among a long list of investment pledges by global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 05:26AM ET</span>",Israel's El Al Airlines to start flights to Silicon Valley,"By Steven Scheer
TEL AVIV (Reuters) -  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) said on Wednesday it will begin nonstop flights between Tel Aviv and San Francisco in the fourth quarter, as it continues to expand into North America.
Israel's flag carrier, which is facing increased competition from low cost carriers, said it will fly the route three times a week using new Boeing (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
It will compete with United (N:UAL), which launched flights between the two cities in 2016 to accommodate Israel's flourishing high-tech sector. Passengers on business often fly between Silicon Valley and Israel, which is one of the largest global tech centers.
""The acquisition of the Dreamliner enables us to expand our long-haul network,"" said David Maimon, El Al's chief executive. ""San Francisco is an important strategic city for El Al. Our target is to take the business segment.""
In November, El Al started nonstop flights to Miami from Tel Aviv, after starting flights to Boston in 2015. It also flies nonstop to New York, Los Angeles and Toronto.
Maimon said El Al plans to add more long-haul routes but a decision would likely not be made until later in 2018.
He said El Al would have liked to have started San Francisco flights sooner but it did not have the proper aircraft.
El Al in 2017 started to receive its delivery of 16 new 787 aircraft that will be delivered through 2020 to replace its ageing long-haul fleet, which the airline hopes will win back customers lost to competitors.
Maimon is set to step down in a month after four years in the job. He told reporters that in the past four years, the number of El Al passengers rose to 5.7 million from 4.3 million, while its share price jumped.
He said a new CEO is expected to be named in the coming days.
El Al also said it was unifying all European flights under the El Al brand and retiring its low-cost brand UP that flew to five destinations in Europe.
It plans to refurbish all of its Boeing 737 aircraft to Europe with new seats in economy and in business class. The alterations should be complete in 2019.
It will also change its fare structure on European flights to include a less expensive ""lite"" option for those who wish to travel without checked baggage.

The government on Tuesday said tourism to Israel rose 25 percent in 2017 to a record 3.6 million, buoyed by more 18 new routes flying into Tel Aviv and the Red Sea resort of Eilat.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",German court to decide on Niki insolvency challenge on Thursday,"FRANKFURT/VIENNA (Reuters) - A German court is likely to decide on Thursday whether to reverse the insolvency filing of airline Niki, according to a statement from Berlin's civil courts, which could derail the sale of the Air Berlin (DE:AB1) unit to Britain's IAG (L:ICAG). 
Niki filed for insolvency last month after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) scrapped plans to buy the Austrian unit, grounding the airline's fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.
Following hurried talks to find a new owner for Niki before it loses its valuable runway slots, British Airways owner IAG agreed last Friday to buy the business and make it part of its low-cost unit Vueling. 
But Fairplane, a group representing airline passengers, said on Tuesday it had filed legal cases to have the insolvency proceedings for Niki shifted to Austria from Germany, which could unravel the sale. 
Fairplane argues that Niki, which is registered as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December.
A court in Berlin's Charlottenburg must now decide whether to reverse its Dec. 13 decision opening insolvency proceedings for Niki or to pass on the case to a higher court, the Berlin court's statement on Wednesday said.
At the same time, an Austrian court has received a request to open insolvency proceedings for Niki in Austria, a spokesman for the Korneuburg court said on Wednesday, adding it would take the court until next week to assess the matter.

""We have to look at the jurisdiction first because this is a case currently pending with the Charlottenburg court,"" the spokesman said.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 02:34AM ET</span>",Boeing-Embraer talks have not settled question of control: sources,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Tie-up talks between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) have not settled key questions such as control of the Brazilian planemaker or the possibility of a more narrow joint venture, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters, pushing back against a newspaper report on Tuesday.
Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico had reported that the talks have focused on joint ventures and joint business agreements to share costs and revenue or develop new products without changing control of Embraer.
Such an arrangement could ease approval from the Brazilian government, which holds a 'golden share' giving it veto rights over strategic decisions at Embraer and has expressed reservations about a foreign company taking control.
However, a joint venture may not be an effective way to combine engineering resources, explore new business opportunities and satisfy Boeing's interest in Embraer's portfolio of regional passenger jets, defense programs and business aircraft, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of talks. 
Boeing has worked around concerns in foreign markets before, structuring defense subsidiaries in Australia and Britain to satisfy sovereignty demands, and those cases may serve as a reference in Brazil, the sources said.
Neither Boeing nor Embraer responded to requests for comment.
On Dec. 21, the two planemakers said they were discussing a ""potential combination,"" in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly.
The talks are widely seen as a way for Boeing to strengthen its position in the regional jetliner market, in which Embraer is strong, thanks largely to its 70- to 130-seat E-Jets. 
Less than three months ago, Boeing's European arch-rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) 100- to 130-seat CSeries jet, putting pressure on the U.S. planemaker to seek a similar partnership.
The Boeing-Embraer talks involve Embraer's defense business, as well as its passenger business, sources have said.

In the Tuesday report, Valor said Boeing was confident it could convince Brazil's government that it could safely operate in Brazil's defense sector, partially by pointing to defense deals the U.S. planemaker has made in countries such as Australia.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 02:34AM ET</span>",U.S. blocks MoneyGram sale to China's Ant Financial,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - A U.S. government panel rejected Ant Financial's acquisition of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (O:MGI) over national security concerns, the companies said on Tuesday, the most high-profile Chinese deal to be torpedoed under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The $1.2 billion deal's collapse represents a blow for Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Chinese internet conglomerate  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), who owns Ant Financial together with Alibaba executives. He was looking to expand Ant Financial's footprint amid fierce domestic competition from Chinese rival Tencent Holdings Ltd's (HK:0700) WeChat payment platform. 
Ma, a Chinese citizen who appears frequently with leaders from the highest echelons of the Communist Party, had promised Trump in a meeting a year ago that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.
MoneyGram shares were down 8.5 percent at $12.06 in after-market trading.
The companies decided to terminate their deal after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) rejected their proposals to mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions.
""Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger,"" MoneyGram Chief Executive Alex Holmes said in a statement.
A standard CFIUS review lasts up to 75 days, and the companies had gone through the process three times in order to address concerns. Additional security measures and protocols that the companies suggested failed to reassure CFIUS, the sources said. 
The U.S. Treasury said it is prohibited by statute from disclosing information filed with CFIUS and declined to comment on the MoneyGram deal. 
The U.S. government has toughened its stance on the sale of companies to Chinese entities, at a time when Trump is trying to put pressure on China to help tackle North Korea's nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues.
The MoneyGram deal is the latest in a string of Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies that have failed to clear CFIUS. They include China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC's $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor Corp (O:LSCC), China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd's $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial Inc (N:GNW) and Chinese buyout firm Orient Hontai Capital's $1.4 billion acquisition of U.S. mobile marketing firm AppLovin. 
FINANCIAL SERVICES DEALS 
The MoneyGram's deal demise is also the latest example of how CFIUS' focus on cyber security and the integrity of personal data is prompting it to block deals in sectors not traditionally associated with national security, such as financial services.
Other U.S. financial services deals by Chinese firms are waiting for approval from CFIUS, including HNA Group Co's acquisition of hedge fund-of-funds firm SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration’s former communications director.
Skybridge and HNA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Dallas-based MoneyGram has approximately 350,000 remittance locations in more than 200 countries. Ant Financial was looking to take over MoneyGram not so much for its U.S. presence but to expand in growing markets outside of China.
Ant Financial and MoneyGram said they will now explore and develop initiatives to work together in remittance and digital payments in China, India, the Philippines and other Asian markets, as well as in the United States. This cooperation will take the form of commercial agreements, one of the sources said.
Any arrangements reached by Ant Financial and MoneyGram that do not involve a transaction would not be subject to review by CFIUS.
Some U.S. lawmakers, including Republican Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, had written to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who also serves as chairman of CFIUS, to express concern that Ant Financial's acquisition of MoneyGram could pose national security threats, arguing that the information of U.S. citizens, including military personnel, could be compromised.
Ant Financial had argued that MoneyGram's data infrastructure would remain in the United States, with personal information encrypted or held in secure facilities on U.S. soil. It had also pointed to existing U.S. regulations that call for such protections.
CFIUS had approved a previous deal by Ant Financial, its acquisition in 2016 of Kansas City-based EyeVerify, which designs a mobile eye verification technology.
""What is more likely to happen at this point is that MoneyGram will sell to another company, and one company that has shown interest in the past is Euronet,"" said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
Ant Financial clinched an $18 per share all-cash deal to acquire MoneyGram in April, seeing off competition from U.S.-based  Euronet Worldwide  Inc (O:EEFT), which had made an unsolicited offer for MoneyGram and openly lobbied U.S lawmakers, saying Ant's proposal created a national security risk.
""Euronet continues to believe there is compelling commercial logic to a combination between Euronet and MoneyGram. However, significant developments have been disclosed by MoneyGram since Euronet's offer, and Euronet has not conducted any evaluation of the business in that time. While we continue to view a transaction with MoneyGram as logical, there is no guarantee any offer will be made or any transaction will ultimately occur,"" Euronet said in a statement.
Ant Financial said it paid MoneyGram a $30 million termination fee for the deal's collapse.

Asking and effective rents increased 0.6 percent in the quarter, compared with the third quarter, registering the highest quarterly growth rate in six quarters. Rent growth was 1.8 percent for 2017.
""The year-end numbers showed a consistent deceleration in occupancy but somewhat higher rent and employment growth than in previous quarters. We expect this trend to continue at the start of 2018 as more office construction is expected to come on line,"" Barbara Denham, senior economist at Reis, said in a statement.
Denham believes businesses may feel renewed confidence in 2018 as the recently passed tax bill should return more profits to their bottom lines.
""This could foster more robust leasing activity. Rent growth will likely increase as well, but we are not likely to see an impact until late 2018 or so,"" Denham said.
Net absorption, which is measured in terms of available office space sold in the market during a certain time period, plummeted about 60 percent to 5.21 million square feet in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier.

US stocks made a positive start to the year amid expectations that solid economic growth would continue, raising the prospect of strong corporate earnings. The prospect of another year of bullish growth offset investor concerns over fresh geopolitical uncertainty.
Reports that China was mobilizing forces on its border with North Korea and continued rioting in Iran had briefly halted the rally but the latter raised the prospect of fresh oil supply disruptions supporting an uptick in energy stocks, lifting the broader index higher.

The airlines join a host of other companies such as AT&T (N:T),  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) promising to pay bonuses or invest more in training after the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which cuts the corporate tax rate.

Southwest said in a statement that as well as paying the bonus to all employees in January, it was increasing its fleet investment with Boeing (N:BA) and had donated $5 million to charitable causes.

Major stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers opened the new year by raising U.S. prices on dozens of medicines, but early data showed the increases generally remained within a 10 percent self-imposed limit in response to a backlash from consumers and politicians.
Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. 
""Drug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,"" Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said.
Allergan Inc (N:AGN) raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. 
Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data.
Allergan's chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the company's ""Social Contract with Patients.""
Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits.
Other drugmakers raising prices include  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA) and  Horizon Pharma  (O:HZNP), according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively.
Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period.

Shares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

US macro data on tap
A duo of top tier economic data on monetary policy and manufacturing could provide fresh direction for the dollar after it fell to more than three-month lows on Tuesday. 
The Federal Reserve publishes the minutes of its December meeting at which the central bank voted to raise rates for third time in 2017 and signaled their intention for a further interest rate hikes this year. 
The minutes isn’t expected to offer detailed clues on monetary policy tightening as Fed chair Janet Yellen is set to be replaced by Fed governor Jerome Powell but insight into the central bank’s thinking on the pace of economic growth and inflation is expected to be carefully parsed. 
On the manufacturing front, economist forecast the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index slowed to 58.1 in December from 58.2 in the previous month.
U.S. crude oil supplies to continue decline?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Wednesday . 
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles fell by about 6 million barrels last week.
Crude oil futures have made subdued start to the year as the Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 offsetting the prospect of supply disruptions in Iran amid ongoing anti-government protests.
German Employment Data In Focus
Germany releases its December employment data on Wednesday amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding the progress of talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) to form a coalition. 
SPD deputy leader Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel said a deal on a new coalition was far from certain and it was unclear if the talks scheduled for Jan. 7 could develop sufficient trust.
Economists forecast the number of unemployed workers fell by 14,000 in December, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 5.6%."
580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 04:42PM ET</span>",New U.S. tax law could impact paychecks by February,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The first paychecks of 2018 will be dispatched soon, but it may be weeks or months before taxpayers and payroll processors know how the new U.S. tax laws will affect your take-home pay.
The Internal Revenue Service said it expected to issue guidance in January on how much in taxes employers should withhold based on the new tax rates. Employers and payroll services would then implement those changes starting in February. 
You might not even notice when it happens because the effect on your paycheck could be relatively small, depending on your income and your tax situation. 
""When the taxes are reduced by 1 to 3 percent, that’s not going to be a huge noticeable difference. It’s not going to be hundreds of dollars,"" said Pete Isberg, vice president of government relations at ADP, the largest payroll processor in the United States, servicing the paychecks of one out of every six workers. 
A difference of $1,000, for instance, would be less than $40 a pop for a worker paid biweekly. 
Your paycheck is not actually a clear indicator of whether your overall taxes have gone up or down because of the new tax law. There may be other factors in your tax situation - such as owning a property or having multiple children - that could affect how much you owe Uncle Sam at the end of the year. 
Be prepared for tax uncertainty until you do your taxes for 2018 a year or so from now. You cannot even estimate your taxes until tax professionals and do-it-yourself services like TurboTax update their software. And that cannot happen until the IRS releases the new withholding tables and issues more guidance on the specifics of other tax changes. 
""We will be ready to help our customers. We just need more information,"" said David Williams, executive director of the  Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) Tax and Financial Center. 
WAITING FOR W-4 FORMS
You may be tempted to get a jump on the IRS and change how much tax is taken out of your paycheck by adjusting your W-4 form, but that may be premature, warned Isberg. 
The IRS said in its last note that it would be attempting to work with existing W-4 forms for now. 
The standard federal W-4, which all employees fill out, is based on the notion of ""allowances,"" which you could adjust based on your personal situation. 
In the past, a single person with three children and a home in a high-tax state like New York might have listed themselves as married and claim one allowance per person, plus a few extra because they were likely to itemize their deductions and owe less. A married person with a freelance spouse who owes quarterly taxes might have listed themselves as single to have enough taken out to cover both of them. 
The goal of people adjusting their withholding was to come as close as possible to paying the correct amount of tax - rather than owing money at the end of the year or ending up with a giant refund. 
But it will all be different math for 2018. 
""For first few weeks of January stay put, and see what the IRS comes out with,"" said Isberg, who also cautioned that employees should keep an eye on tax changes at the state level.
Above all, do not panic, said Farsheed Ferdowsi, president and CEO of Inova Payroll, which handles paychecks for more than 3,000 companies. 

""When you have changes in taxes, it usually goes a lot smoother than most people know,"" Ferdowsi said. ""If the first (paycheck) is wrong, it catches up on the next one.""

581,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",U.S. urges railroads to quickly install anti-crash safety system,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged the nation's railroads and transit agencies to take all possible measures to meet deadlines to install a safety system called positive train control (PTC) to prevent crashes.
Letters dated Dec. 27, which were made public on Tuesday, said Chao wanted railroads to ""greatly accelerate"" efforts to meet congressional deadlines. A deadly Amtrak crash last month near Seattle that killed three occurred on a section of track that did not have the PTC system operating.
The system is designed to prevent derailments caused by excessive speed. Investigators have said several deadly U.S. train crashes in recent years could have been prevented if the system was in place.
In 2008, Congress mandated the implementation of PTC nationwide by the end of 2015, then extended that deadline until the end of 2018 when its installation became more complex than anticipated. The government can extend the deadline to 2020 to complete some aspects of the system.
The National Transportation Safety Board said last month the Amtrak train that derailed onto a highway near Seattle was going 78 miles per hour (125.5 km per hour) in a 30-mph zone. 
The letters went to the chief executives of railroads, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway Co, Canadian National Railway (TO:CNR), CSX Corp (O:CSX),  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC),  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) and transit systems in Chicago, Boston, New York, Boston, Newark, Seattle and Los Angeles.
Amtrak said last month it was ""imperative that the rail industry urgently work together to get PTC activated on the national network as soon as possible - and certainly by the December 2018 federal deadline, if not before.""
The Transportation Department said 12 of 41 railroads covered by the requirements report having installed less than 50 percent of the hardware required for their PTC systems as of Sept. 30. The government said the systems are in operation on 45 percent of route miles owned by freight railroads and just 24 percent of passenger railroads
Chao's letter said the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) leadership plans to work with railroads ""to help create an increased level of urgency to underscore the imperative of meeting existing timeline expectations for rolling out this critical rail-safety technology.""
The Association of American Railroads said on Tuesday that railroads are making progress on installing and testing PTC technology and freight railroads are on track to meet the deadlines established by Congress. 

Separately, the Transportation Department wrote to U.S. senators on Tuesday asking them to approve the nomination of Ronald Batory to head the FRA. Batory, a former Conrail president, was approved unanimously by a committee but has been held up due to a dispute over a New York area infrastructure project.

Fairplane, seeking to recover more than 1 million euros ($1.2 million) it says Niki owes to passengers, filed separate legal cases on Tuesday to block insolvency proceedings in Berlin and to open them instead in Austria.
Although the sum sought is relatively small, a spokesman for Air Berlin liquidator Lucas Floether said the complaint could derail the sale of Niki to IAG's low-cost Vueling operation that was agreed last week.
""If the complaint before the Charlottenburg Court (in Berlin) succeeds, the sale of Niki to IAG would be greatly endangered,"" the spokesman said. A ruling by the court on the case was due this week.
British Airways' owner IAG said last Friday it would buy Niki for 20 million euros ($24 million) and provide up to 16.5 million euros in additional liquidity to the company.
The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks to acquire the airline, appeared to mark the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the former No.2 German air carrier that earlier owned Niki.
Fairplane argues however that Niki, which is registered in as a company in Austria, had been profitable but had lost access to bridge financing when insolvency proceedings were opened in Germany in December, grounding planes and stranding passengers.
Spokesman Ronald Schmid said that dragging Niki into the German insolvency process was wrong, and that passengers stood a better chance of getting their money back in the Austrian courts.
""We want to ensure that the insolvency is carried out in Austria - where it belongs - so that there are no conflicts of interest,"" Schmid told Reuters.
IAG declined to comment.

In appointing Floether to liquidate Air Berlin in December, a German insolvency judge was of the opinion that, although Niki was registered as a company in Austria, its center of main interest was in fact in Germany.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giant  BP  (L:BP) will take a one-off $1.5 billion charge to adjust to new U.S. tax rules, but expects a long-term boost from the corporate-friendly tax rates, it said on Tuesday.
BP's rival Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) said last week it would incur a one-off charge of $2-$2.5 billion for the U.S. tax changes.
Like BP, Shell and many other international companies said they expected a long-term positive impact to U.S. earnings from the massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last month. It cuts the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals as well.
But BP said that in the short term, lower tax rates will affect its deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in a one-off, non-cash charge of $1.5 billion to its 2017 fourth quarter results which are due to be announced on Feb. 8.
""The ultimate impact of the change in the U.S. corporate income tax rate is subject to a number of complex provisions in the legislation which BP is reviewing,"" BP said in a statement.
The British company's shares closed down about 1 percent on Tuesday.
The adjustment will not affect BP's cash flow in the fourth quarter.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, declined to comment on how the U.S. tax changes would financially affect it. 
 Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) said it was studying the changes but still plans to invest $8 billion in the United States this year.
Deferred tax assets refer in some cases to a company overpaying taxes in advance and then getting them back in the form of tax relief.
BP has large operations in oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore shale operations as well as refineries that can process up to 746,000 barrels per day of crude oil, according to its website. 

On Dec. 22, Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, cutting tax rates for businesses and offering some temporary cuts for some individuals and families.

LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, breaking company records and meeting its core industrial target for the year, industry sources said.
Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.
Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.
A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.
Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.
Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) over late engines for the company's fastest-selling jet.
It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month's deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.
Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for ""huge collective efforts"" that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.
Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019. 
Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.
Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year's production.
Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce (L:RR) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.

Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world's largest planemaker, Boeing (N:BA), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Property reinsurance rates rise less than expected,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global property reinsurance prices have risen less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages following a record year of losses, brokers said on Tuesday.
Catastrophe bond managers are launching new funds and hedge funds have bought reinsurance stocks to benefit from expected double-digit price rises, following hurricanes in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico last year.
Global prices rose by up to 7.5 percent, Willis Re said in a report, while JLT Re said its property-catastrophe reinsurance index gained 4.8 percent.
""The concerted effort by many reinsurers to seek meaningful ... rate increases across the board has been unsuccessful,"" said James Kent, Global CEO of Willis Re, pointing to ""continued supply of capital"" in the sector.
The reinsurance sector has turned the corner after five years of falling prices, however, after a record year of $140 billion in insurance losses, JLT Re said.
Property reinsurance prices rose 20-40 percent in catastrophe-hit areas in the Caribbean and 5-10 percent in loss areas in the United States and Latin America, Willis Re, a unit of Willis Towers Watson (O:WLTW), said.

Global rates for retrocession, the reinsurance of reinsurance, also came in below expectations, with rises of 10-20 percent, JLT Re said.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 12:05PM ET</span>",Bankers to burn midnight oil ahead of 'MiFID' dawn,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Bankers will work through the night to iron out last minute hitches before Wednesday's launch of a major reform of European Union financial markets that aims to apply lessons from the financial crisis nearly a decade ago.
The new rules are already a year late due to their complexity and regulators have had to issue eleventh-hour guidance to banks and financial firms to avoid trading freezes as well as calming nerves of those not yet fully compliant.
""For the markets facing processes, there will be a very intensive through-the-night activity,"" said David Lawton, a managing director at consultants Alvarez & Marsal and former senior markets regulator at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority.
The new regime shines a spotlight on the innards of stock,bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.
Banks and trading firms have spent millions of euros getting ready for the big day. A report from Expand, part of the BostonConsulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion last year to comply with the rules. Lawton expects the new regime to trigger consolidation as the competition it aims to promote proves too much for some.
Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said there would likely be more losers than winners from the profound changes being ushered in.
The aim is increase transparency and bolster investor protection to avoid some of the problems of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Stock, bond, derivatives, commodity and other trades must all be reported to a repository, giving regulators a trove of data to track trades and try to spot bubbles early after failing to see the last crisis coming.
When the rules go live on Wednesday, fund managers and others must for the first time fill in a transaction report with up to 65 bits of data within 15 minutes of a trade - or risk being fined. The rules, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, represent a revamp of the2007 MiFID law to increase transparency and investor protection and broaden its scope to take in more financial products. MiFID II will be a journey and not a one off event inJanuary, is how one national regulator responded to questions about how trading will unfold on January 3. 
LIQUIDITY WATCH
The European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the roll out, published a flurry of statements just before Christmas to tackle some remaining road bumps. ""ESMA, in close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities across the EU, has carried out a broad range of work ... to ensure that the framework is in place to ensure a smooth transition from MiFID I to MiFID II,"" ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told Reuters. So far, only 11 of the EU's 28 member states have written MiFID II fully into national law. But ESMA has said that all firms can carry on even if their home state has not completed the legislative process.
Germany, France and Britain, home to the EU's top financial centres, are among the 11 EU states whose national laws are upto speed and big banks are likely to be ready. Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) NatWest Markets has conducted a ""soft launch"". From January 2 to January 4, some of its staff will work through the night. ""Day One will hopefully go smoothly and we are as ready as we can be,"" Giovanni Mazzocchi, head of macro distribution inEurope for  Barclays  (L:BARC), said. ""There are a few overnighters going on to make sure everything will work on the day.""
Industry officials predict light trading volumes initially rather than paralysis.
A European bond strategist said trading glitches could become a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" as people feel their way under the new rules.
""Everyone says I want to be careful for that first month of the year, and if everyone does that, we won't have liquidity,"" the strategist said.
DISRUPTIVE ESMA will make use of the new data to set curbs on trading positions in commodities and cap off-exchange trading of shares or so-called ""dark pools."" MiFID II also gives investors more information about which trading platforms offer the best deals, and asset managers will have to show investors who is paying for stock research. A fundamental aim of the original MiFID was to increase competition in share trading by allowing new platforms to take on centuries-old rivals like the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE). Upstarts like Chi-X went on to become among the biggestpan-European share trading platforms and regulators want MiFIDII to bring ""disruption"" to trading in other assets, forcing companies to become more agile. ""There will be interesting times over the next few years with new players entering the market and both clients and banks making full use of the new available data to shape their activities in the market,"" Mazzocchi said. Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at Fidessa, a provider of trading software, said MiFID II did not represent a revolution in share trading, but would have a big impact on bonds, commodities and derivatives, where electronic trading will increase. ""For fixed income and off-exchange derivatives, the wholemindset needs to change as a lot of trades are still done over the phone,"" Voigt said.

Flying rights are currently governed by EU-wide deals and because it is not part of the World Trade Organization, the aviation sector has no natural fallback arrangement to protect flights if there is no deal between Britain and the European Union.
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, follows fellow budget airline Wizz Air in applying for a separate license in Britain via a UK subsidiary.
""A subsidiary company Ryanair UK filed an application on Dec 21 last for an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) with the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK. This may be required for Ryanair's three UK domestic routes in the event of a hard Brexit in March 2019,"" the airline said in a statement.
Ryanair said last year that it planned to pivot its growth away from Britain over the next two years as it fears the lack of clarity over Brexit will cause major travel disruption and hit demand. 

The Dublin-based airline's three intra-UK routes only account for around 2 percent of its business.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators raised net short position on bitcoin futures traded on Cboe Global Markets last week amid a selloff sparked by experts' warnings of a bubble, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released late Friday.
Net short bitcoin contracts rose to 1,801 in the week that began Dec. 26, from 1,507 short contracts the previous week.
During the last two weeks of December, bitcoin in the spot market slumped nearly 28 percent, but still ended the year up about 1,300 percent. 
On Tuesday, bitcoin recovered from recent losses to trade up 3.4 percent at 13,900 (BTC=BTSP) on the Bitstamp platform.
Trading in bitcoin has tended to be volatile. In November, it tumbled almost 30 percent in four days from $7,888 to $5,555. In September, it fell 40 percent from $4,979 to $2,972.
ARK Invest, a New York-based asset manager which oversees exchange-traded funds focused on technology, said in a newsletter that investors had displayed ""irrational behavior"" with respect to bitcoin, including speculators going on margin to invest in the digital currency.
""Historically, these signs have marked the top, either cyclically or securely, for an asset class,"" said ARK Invest.
Still, it said the launch of a futures market for bitcoin by CBOE and CME Group Inc (O:CME) last month potentially heralded another era of financial innovation.

It said that if blockchin technology, an open ledger that has underpinned bitcoin, is as fundamental a breakthrough as the internet was when it was first launched, then institutions will start investing significantly alongside retail investors over the next six to nine months.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 11:13AM ET</span>","LeEco founder defies China return order, stays in U.S. for car fundraising","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The founder of debt-laden tech conglomerate LeEco has defied orders from Chinese regulators to return to the country before the end of 2017, saying he needed to stay in the United States as a fundraising for his electric car business was making progress.
The Beijing branch of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) issued a notice last week ordering LeEco CEO Jia Yueting to return to China to address a mounting debt pile linked to his firms and to protect investors' rights.
Jia said in a statement that he had asked his brother, Jia Yuemin, to meet the regulator face-to-face last Friday to provide a report after the notice was issued. 
""I am deeply sorry and blame myself for the negative impact of LeEco's debt crisis,"" he said in the statement that was posted on his official WeChat account on Tuesday.
""The fundraising for Faraday Future in the United States is making significant progress and there are many tasks I need to push forward in order to ensure the production and timely delivery of the FF91,"" he said, referring to a luxury electric vehicle (EV) that LeEco is developing with Faraday Future. 
Questions have been raised about the outlook for the FF91, given LeEco's spiraling cash problems as well as its decision to pull out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop the RapidE electric car. 
RESOLVING DEBT ISSUES
LeEco, an entertainment, electronics and electric vehicles group, has struggled to pay its debts after rapid expansion into multiple sectors sparked a cash crunch, a plunge in the shares of a listed unit and led to multiple defaults. At its peak LeEco owed creditors 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion).
Its main listed unit Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp (SZ:300104) said in a statement on Tuesday that it was trying to settle its debt problems to resolve liquidity issues and resume normal business operations.
Leshi's Tianjin unit is trying to get 3 billion yuan ($462 million) worth of funding from new and existing investors, as well as creditors, Leshi said in another statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. That unit's main business is marketing smart and Internet TVs.
Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk's  Tesla Motors  (O:TSLA) in premium EV making, Jia has been trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as cutting staff numbers and selling assets.
Jia said he had asked his wife, Gan Wei, and brother to represent him at Leshi in exercising shareholder rights and handling the sale of assets. Jia stepped down as CEO of the group's main listed unit in May last year.
He also cited a single late payment in July as being one of the key causes of LeEco's cash-flow problems, saying it led to the freezing of his assets and prompted a slew of early loan recoveries. He said ""false and malicious"" reports had impacted the business. 
Jia was placed on an official blacklist of debt defaulters in early December, a move taken by Chinese courts to put pressure on people and entities to repay debts.

656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>","For 2018's Best Carry Trades, Wall Street Looks to Latin America","(Bloomberg) -- Investors are targeting Latin America for the most profitable carry trades in 2018, betting a region that lagged behind peers last year is poised for a comeback.
Wall Street firms including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) SA cite the region’s high interest rates and forecasts for faster economic growth. In Argentina, for example, a monetary policy rate of 28.75 percent is the highest in the world.
The banks are expecting a reversal from last year, when currency appreciation was the primary driver for the most profitable currency trades -- long positions in the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna funded by dollars. This time around, they’re anticipating that Latin American interest rates will provide the biggest returns even as forecasts call for most of the region’s currencies to slip.
“Latin America stands out,” said Eric Viloria, a strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. “Even after rate cuts in Brazil, the interest rates are still relatively high.”
Brazil’s real offered the top carry return in 2016, when interest rates were above 14 percent most of the year, handing investors gains of 37 percent. Last year, the central bank slashed borrowing costs to a record 7 percent, resulting in a carry return of just 5.5 percent. Still, the benchmark rate is higher than in peers like South Africa, India or Indonesia.
Viloria also highlights Mexico, where interest rates were lifted to 7.25 percent in December to fight surging inflation and surpassed Brazil’s rate for the first time ever. Traders are wagering Mexico’s rate will climb to 8.5 percent by the end of 2018.
Alejandro Cuadrado, the global head of foreign exchange at BBVA (MC:BBVA) in New York, has the Argentine peso as his top carry pick for 2018, even as he forecasts a small depreciation. The country offered the best carry trade return in 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015, but last year fell to 31rd place in the ranking as the peso’s 15 percent slide trimmed carry gains to 3.4 percent.
“This is backed by the persistent hawkish bias of the central bank,” he said.
Credit Agricole SA strategists led by Sebastien Barbe wrote in a Dec. 22 report that emerging-market currencies are likely to appreciate slightly versus the dollar this year. As interest rates remain relatively high, they see capital flows continuing to head toward developing nations.
“This is not the end of the EM carry trade yet,” the strategists wrote."
657,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 09:24AM ET</span>",Here's what 12 Wall Street pros are predicting for the stock market in 2018,"Almost no one is bearish.
This year is poised to be one of the most profitable for the S&P 500 in this bull market, now entering its ninth year, with a double-digit gain. And all the lead strategists at top Wall Street firms expect many of the same catalysts to lift stocks again in 2018, particularly earnings growth and US economic expansion.
Across the board, Republican tax bill is expected to boost the profits of America's largest companies, and possibly reward shareholders through more buybacks.
But this year may not rival 2017 as one of the most peaceful in the market's history. Some strategists warn that the regular pullbacks that create volatility could resume.
Here's what strategists forecast for 2018, in ascending order of their year-end targets for the S&P 500.
US mergers-and-acquisitions levels ""are down 20% year-over-year,"" Ben Laidler, HSBC's global equity strategist and head of Americas research, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on December 4.
""So I think we're certainly due for a pickup,"" he said. ""We've got a bit of visibility with the tax reform that will allow that to accelerate. US corporates are sitting on a lot of cash. They are sitting on high multiples. I definitely think we're going to see a pickup here.""
He added: ""I also think we'll see something on the capex front, and a little will go a long way given that US capex is the most depressed in the world. But I still think most of it goes on share buybacks.""
""Tax cuts could be quite stimulative to S&P 500 EPS,"" Tobias Levkovich, Citi's chief US equity strategist, said in a note on November 15.
""We suspect that investors may not be willing to accord the same P/E for earnings generated by a lower tax rate versus one for underlying operating performance,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, even if we assumed half the market multiple on the incremental tax-related EPS gains, it will still be additive to the S&P 500's upside potential.""
""Optimism was building this year, and we think 2018 could be the year of euphoria,"" Savita Subramanian, the head of US equity and quant strategy, said in a note on November 20.
""Of our five target models, only our Fair Value model suggests negative returns,"" she said. ""Valuation matters, but is only predictive over multi-year time horizons. We think sentiment will be a more important driver of returns in 2018, and drives the bulk of our market call.""

The government had earlier passed an executive order aiming to ""keep out such persons who have wilfully defaulted, are associated with non-performing assets, or are habitually non-compliant and, therefore, are likely to be a risk to successful resolution of insolvency of a company.""
Replying to the debate in the upper house of parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the proposed changes in rules were expected to help streamline the process of selecting buyers for stressed assets. 
The aim was to exclude wilful defaulters from taking over the management of companies after banks had taken losses on loans.
Several opposition lawmakers expressed concern the new rules could reduce competition for stressed assets and result in lower recoveries for creditors.

In June, India’s central bank ordered 12 of the country’s biggest loan defaulters to be forced into bankruptcy courts as it tries to cut a record $147 billion of soured loans that have accumulated in the country’s banking sector.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 05:51AM ET</span>",New drug approvals hit 21-year high in 2017,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light -- more than double the previous year -- while the figure also rose in the European Union.
The EU recommended 92 new drugs including generics, up from 81, and China laid out plans to speed up approvals in what is now the world's second biggest market behind the United States.
Yet the world's biggest drugmakers saw average returns on their research and development spending fall, reflecting more competitive pressures and the growing share of new products now coming from younger biotech companies.
Consultancy Deloitte said last month that projected returns at 12 of the world's top drugmakers were at an eight-year low of only 3.2 percent.
Many of the drugs receiving a green light in 2017 were for rare diseases and sub-types of cancer, which often target very small populations, although they can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2hGom21)
Significantly, the U.S. drug tally of 46 does not include the first of a new wave of cell and gene therapies from Novartis, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and Spark Therapeutics that were approved in 2017 under a separate category.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has hailed these products as ""a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases"". However, there is debate as to how cash-strapped healthcare systems will pay for them.
Under Gottlieb, the FDA has taken advantage of policy changes implemented in recent years to accelerate the drug approval process. 
Procedures such as the agency's ""breakthrough therapy"" designation have cut review times and helped to stimulate competition by adding multiple new drugs that often work in a similar way. 
A wide choice of medicines with the same mechanism of action can be a double-edged sword for manufacturers, since it gives insurers and governments ammunition to drive down prices.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Merck's new diabetes drug Steglatro, for example, was the fourth product of its kind to win a green light in the United States, while Novo Nordisk's Ozempic was the sixth of its type. Both were approved in December. 
In cancer, AstraZeneca's Imfinzi was the fifth medicine to target a key protein found on the body's immune cells when it won approval last May.
For the current year, companies have more new products waiting in the wings, although the pace of FDA approvals may be tempered by the fact that several drugs that had been expected to be cleared in the first quarter of 2018 were actually approved in 2017.

In Europe, meanwhile, the focus will be on any disruption or delays to the approval process as the European Medicines Agency prepares to relocate from London to Amsterdam as a result of Britain's decision to leave the European Union.

LONDON (Reuters) - The ailing dollar fell to its lowest in over three months on Tuesday, while surprisingly upbeat Chinese manufacturing data ensured there was no serious new year hangover for world shares despite a groggy start for Europe.
Sentiment was also helped by news that North Korea had offered an olive branch to South Korea, with Kim Jong Un saying he was ""open to dialogue"" with Seoul.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares climbed 0.15 percent, having set scores of record highs and risen by one-fifth in value last year alone. http://reut.rs/2zLv6kT
The driver had again been Asia and its emerging markets.
Shanghai blue chips climbed 1.4 percent and MSCIs 24-country EM index jumped over 1 percent after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.
The reading pointed to resilience in the world's second-largest economy even as Beijing cracks down on industrial pollution and engineers a cooling property market.
""Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
In currency markets, the dollar remained out of favor having already hit a three-month low against a basket of its peers on Friday. That brought its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worse performance since 2003.
Its pain was the euro's gain though, with the single currency enjoying its strongest year against the dollar in 14 years.
On Tuesday, it jetted to a three-month top of $1.2045 as data showed that euro zone manufacturers had ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.
It had already sliced through major resistance on the yen in Asia too, reaching highs not seen since late 2015 at 135.45 yen. 
""Forward-looking indicators bode well for the new year,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit which compiled the manufacturing data, pointing to a near record pace of new orders and job creation. 
The pound, Swiss franc and scandinavian currencies were also up solidly against the dollar.
That combined with a two-month high in bond yields in Germany and Italy, two of the euro zone's biggest debt markets, pushed stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris 0.3-0.6 percent into the red. [.EU][GVD/EUR]
A major hurdle for the U.S. currency will be Wednesday's release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting when it raised interest rates. Two policymakers voted against the move amid doubts inflation would accelerate as hoped.
With the market now pricing in a 68 percent chance of a March hike and two hikes for 2018, there will be close inspection to assess just how shaky their confidence is for any pick-up in inflationary trends said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at broker IG in Sydney.
""That said, the U.S. dollar is underloved and oversold and it won't take much to promote a bout of profit-taking from the shorts.""
The skid in the dollar, combined with strength in Chinese demand, has benefited commodities priced into the currency.
Copper dipped back a little on Tuesday to $7,223.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top. Aluminium amassed gains of 34 percent.
Gold was 0.37 percent firmer at $1,310 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.
Brent crude oil futures ended the year with a 17 percent rise, while U.S. crude climbed 12 percent on strong demand and declining global inventories. [O/R]

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks faltered at the start of the trading year on Tuesday as autos stocks fell and an impressive run-up in metals and mining stocks reversed, while strength in oil companies and banks was not enough to stop the slide. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index dipped 0.3 percent in early deals, while euro zone stocks (STOXXE) fell 0.4 percent.
Autos stocks (SXAP) sank 2 percent, set for their biggest daily fall since July last year, dented by weaker car registrations data. 
New car sales in France fell 0.51 percent in December and the share of new diesel cars dipped below 50 percent for the first time since 2000.
A trader also pointed to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph citing forecasts that UK car registrations data, due out on Friday, would show a 5 percent decline in new car sales.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), BMW (DE:BMWG),  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP),  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were all among top fallers, down 2.4 to 2.8 percent.
Basic resources stocks also fell back, with the sector index (SXPP) down 0.8 percent. 
The mining sector had surged to a five-year high at the end of last week, riding a wave of rising copper and other base metal prices, but Tuesday's dip suggested investors were taking profits after a strong run. 
Oil, which marked its highest start to the trading year since 2014, supported benchmarks with oil majors across the region rising in concert with crude.  Statoil  (OL:STL) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) were among the strongest gainers. 
Financials also rose, led by Santander (MC:SAN), Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) among top banking stocks.
In other eye-catching moves, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) slipped 6.3 percent after British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) agreed to buy Air Berlin's insolvent Austrian airline Niki.
The German carrier had backed out of a deal to buy Niki's assets in mid-December due to competition concerns.
""The circa 20 planes not acquired through Niki are a loss but not significant for the Lufthansa investment case from our point of view,"" said Bernstein analysts.
Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) surged 12 percent to the top of the STOXX, despite the firm saying its 2015 results would also have to be restated. The company also said its internal review of accounting irregularities was progressing.
Broker moves also drove trading: an upgrade to ""buy"" from Sydbank sent wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind  (CO:VWS) up 2.4 percent after the company secured several new orders. 
The Danish bank said a flurry of new orders and less uncertainty in the U.S. market indicated activity in 2018 could be higher than expected.

Elsewhere, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un surprised world observers by saying he wished for a ""peaceful resolution"" with Seoul in his annual New Year's Day address.
Financial stocks were broadly higher, as French lenders  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) gained 0.55% and 0.57%, while Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) advanced 0.44% and 1.10%.

 Centrica  (LON:CNA) was also on the upside, with shares amid reports the energy supplier is seeking a second joint venture partner to continue to boost its oil and gas production business after a recent deal with Germany's Bayerngas Norge.
In the mining sector, stocks were broadly lower. Shares in  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) slipped and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) dropped 0.47%, while BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) tumbled 1.50% and 1.94% respectively.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 02:13AM ET</span>","Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors flag slow sales recovery in 2018","By Hyunjoo Jin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270) on Tuesday flagged 4 percent sales growth in 2018, suggesting a slow recovery from a slump linked to their lack of SUVs in the United States and diplomatic tensions with China.
Hyundai and smaller affiliate Kia said demand was expected to soften in the U.S. and Chinese markets as they unveiled a combined sales target of 7.55 million vehicles this year, from 7.25 million vehicles last year. 
""The market environment is expected to be difficult due to a slowdown in major markets like the U.S. and China, prolonged low growth in the global economy and trade protectionism in major countries,” Hyundai Motor said in a statement.
Sales slumped 7 percent last year from 2016, falling well short of the firms' target of 8.25 million vehicles and marking their third consecutive annual miss, as buyers in China and the United States increasingly shunned sedans for SUVs.
A diplomatic row between China and South Korea over Seoul's deployment of a U.S. missile defense system also hit the carmakers' sales in the world's biggest auto market, although two countries recently agreed to normalize ties.
""This year's target for Hyundai and Kia is lower than expected. It seems to be a conservative target, reflecting a slow recovery in China and ongoing U.S difficulties,"" Kim Jin-woo, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities said. 
Hyundai Motor shares ended down 4.2 percent on Tuesday, and Kia Motors stocks finished 2.1 percent lower. The broader market (KS11) rose 0.5 percent. 
The grim outlook came as the Korean won strengthened to a more than three-year high against the dollar on Tuesday, threatening the competitiveness of South Korean exporters as their Japanese rivals benefit from the weakening yen.
The expiration of a tax cut on small-engine cars in China also would be a negative for Hyundai's sedan-heavy line-up, they said.
While Hyundai Motor has plans to offer more SUVs in the United States and China this year, analysts said new models such as the redesigned Santa Fe SUV may come too late in the year to significantly impact sales.
Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong-koo said in a statement it would ""actively venture into"" new markets like Southeast Asia, as protectionism was expected to grow elsewhere.
South Korea and the United States will hold talks on a trade deal on Jan. 5 although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the pact.

Chung, 79, skipped his annual New Year speech to employees for a second year in a row. He has not made any public appearances since December, 2016.

Figures from Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination bureau on Monday showed revenues rose 19 percent for 2017 to 265.7 billion patacas ($33.13 billion).
Analysts had expected 2017 full-year growth of 18-20 percent to $33 billion to $34 billion.
The former Portuguese colony and now special administrative region is clambering back after revenue plunged to five-year lows in 2014.
But revenue is still far off the highs hit ahead of 2014, hovering only around monthly tolls seen in 2011, data from Thomson Reuters Datastream showed.
Monthly gambling revenue in December was up 15 percent to 22.7 billion patacas, slightly lower than analysts' expectations for growth of 17-20 percent.
Winnings have been higher for operators such as  Sands China Ltd  (HK:1928),  Wynn Macau  Ltd (HK:1128), Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HK:0027) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) which have casinos on the Cotai strip - a stretch of reclaimed land which now boasts some of Macau's most opulent properties.
SJM Holdings Ltd (HK:0880) and  MGM China  Holdings Ltd (HK:2282), which do not yet have a presence on Cotai, have seen market share erode ahead of new openings along the strip.
MGM is due to open its new resort in January 2018 while SJM is not expected to open until closer to 2019, analysts said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL], which recently struck a deal to buy about a quarter of U.S. investment firm TCW Group, is scouting for opportunities to buy boutique managers of bonds and alternative assets, its president said.
""Asset management is a business that can generate synergy with life insurance and it needs to be operated globally. We have been looking widely for potential partners,"" Yoshinobu Tsutsui told Reuters in an interview.
The bulking up of asset management overseas by Japan's largest private-sector life insurer comes as the nation's insurers are increasingly shifting money away from Japanese government bonds (JGBs), their main investment, into riskier but higher-yielding ones such as foreign corporate bonds to diversify their returns.
Insurers in Japan have been hurt by diminishing investment returns after the Bank of Japan launched aggressive monetary easing in April 2013.
In December, Nippon Life announced a deal to acquire 24.75 percent of TCW from private equity firm  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG). Nippon Life has about 74 trillion yen ($653.25 billion) in assets.
Tsutsui said potential targets are likely to be asset management companies with bond investment expertise, as the insurer's portfolio has been traditionally made up of fixed-income products.
He also said the company is looking for specialists in alternative investments, whose real estate and other portfolios offer diversification from conventional bond and stock investments.
""As we have to diversify investment assets globally, alternative is a very important field,"" he said. ""The United States has a very big and deep market for asset management. There are huge companies but there are also small but unique boutiques. We would like to keep looking there,"" he said.
Tsutsui said while his company will curb fresh investment in JGBs further, U.S. interest rate rises pose a challenge to its effort to increase foreign bond holdings.
""Hedging costs will rise with U.S. rate increases, that will diminish returns (from U.S. Treasuries),"" he said. Japanese insurers usually hedge against currency swings when they buy foreign assets to protect their yen-denominated value. 
""There is an issue of how to build foreign bond portfolios and French government bonds are in the spotlight now,"" said Tsutsui, 63, who took over the helm of the company in 2011.
Sources with the direct knowledge have said Nippon Life is in talks to buy a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group in an attempt to boost its bancassurance sales.
Tsutsui declined to confirm the MassMutual talks but said his company has been searching for ways to build up domestic sales channels in addition to traditional door-to-door sales representatives.
""For bank branch sales channel, we are thinking about mergers and acquisitions,"" he said.

NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) is on track to deliver its repeatedly delayed commercial jet by mid-2020, the head of its aircraft unit said, despite a risk of an order cancellation.
The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) aircraft has been delayed five times from an original delivery target of 2013, leading to spiraling costs. News this month that an order for the aircraft from Eastern Air Lines was ""likely to be lost"" has spurred more questions about the outlook of the project. 
""We are proceeding pretty much in line with plans,"" said Hisakazu Mizutani, president of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, referring to the mid-2020 deadline. ""We can just about make it.""
He was speaking to reporters in Nagoya on Dec. 8, on the condition that his comments not be published until Jan 1.
Mizutani said the planemaker was at risk of losing Eastern Air Lines' order for 20 MRJ aircraft with an option for 20 more, but that it was ""continuing conversations"" with the airline.
Mitsubishi Aircraft said the order has not yet been canceled.
Overall, the Mitsubishi unit has orders for 233 of the 90-seat aircraft, the company has said previously, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades.
Buyers such as ANA Holdings (T:9202) have said they have no plans to cancel orders despite the delays. 

Mitsubishi Aircraft is majority owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058) also holding stakes.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>","Venezuela’s Maduro is destructive King Herod, warns ex-oil czar","By Alexandra Ulmer
CARACAS (Reuters) - A former oil minister excoriated Venezuelan President NicolasMaduro in a newspaper column on Sunday, accusing the leftist leader of behaving like biblical King Herod and plunging the oil-rich nation into economic devastation. 
Rafael Ramirez, who was the all-powerful head of the oil ministry and state energy company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] for a decade, has long been a rival of Maduro. 
In recent months, Ramirez has grown increasingly critical of Maduro's handling of a fourth straight year of recession that has triggered malnutrition, widespread food and medicine shortages, the world's steepest inflation, and a surge in emigration. 
A furious Maduro ordered Ramirez to resign as the nation's United Nations ambassador in New York last month after an article entitled the “The Storm” was perceived as an attack on his government.
Ramirez fled the United States in December for an undisclosed location before Venezuela’s state prosecutor accused him of corruption during the time he commanded the world's largest crude reserves. 
In his sharpest critique to date, Ramirez on Sunday published a 3,000-word column in local newspaper Panorama, comparing Maduro to Herod, the Roman-appointed king of Judea who was accused of mass infanticide. 
""You are killing the revolution,” Ramirez wrote, without using Maduro's name. 
“With a mix of arrogance, ignorance, incompetence, cynicism, and a lot of irresponsibility, you have brought our people to an unimaginable level of suffering and humiliation,” he added, also accusing Maduro’s inner circle of corruption and authoritarianism. 
""If our Commander (late leader Hugo Chavez) were with us, standing in line for food, or walking the streets of Caracas seeing children looking through garbage, what would he do? And what would you tell him?"" 
The government did not respond to a request for comment about the article. 
The political opposition says Ramirez is a hypocrite who is also responsible for Venezuela's economic meltdown. They say he destroyed PDVSA by filling the company's roster with political loyalists and letting at least $11 billion go ""missing"" during his tenure. 
Insiders say accusations against Ramirez stem from a turf war among ruling Socialists, especially ahead of next year's presidential election, rather than a real desire to root out graft. 
In recent months authorities have spearheaded an anti-graft purge of the oil sector, jailing 69 top managers including two former oil ministers. Critics say the arrests are designed to consolidate the unpopular Maduro’s control of the industry which brings in over 90 percent of foreign currency. 
In the latest development, anti-government union leader Ivan Freites, who frequently gave information about problems at Venezuela's ailing refineries, said on Twitter over the weekend he had been summoned by intelligence agents. Political sources said he had left the country. 
Reuters was unable to verify the information or contact Freites. 

In his article, Ramirez urged top government officials to speak out against Maduro's purge before it is too late. ""Today it's me, tomorrow it will be you,"" Ramirez wrote.

British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG) said on Friday that it would buy Niki for 20 million euros and provide additional liquidity to the company of up to 16.5 million euros, closing the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin . Air Berlin filed for insolvency earlier this year.
""The damages will be borne by creditors and German taxpayers, who will see nothing of the Air Berlin bridging loan in the amount of 150 million euros,"" said Hans Michelbach, deputy leader of the Bavarian CSU party in parliament and financial spokesman for the conservative bloc.
The situation would have been different if Lufthansa had been allowed to buy the airline for nearly 200 million euros, Michelbach said. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) backed out of an agreement to buy Niki after the European Commission indicated it would block the sale .
The German government had also criticized the Commission's position earlier this month, forecasting that only part of the bridging loan from the KfW bank would be repaid.
The Bavarian lawmaker called for a detailed investigation of the Air Berlin and Niki insolvencies and the actions of the European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
He said details that had emerged appeared to show that the EU had carried out secret negotiations and provoked Lufthansa's withdrawal of its takeover offer for Niki in order to ""make possible the takeover by a certain investor at a bargain price.""
""By doing so, the Commission violated its neutrality obligation in the worst sense and acted against the interests of creditors,"" he said. No further details were provided.
No comment was immediately available from the Commission. In December, it said Lufthansa's purchase of Niki would have posed serious risks for European consumers.
Michelbach also called for a detailed examination of whether Niki's landing rights in Germany could legally be sold to IAG.
IAG plans to make Niki part of its low-cost carrier Vueling, employing 740 of Niki's 1,000 former employees. Assets include 15 A320 aircraft and slots at airports including Vienna, Dusseldorf, Munich, Palma and Zurich.

Niki filed for insolvency earlier this month after Lufthansa backed out of the deal to buy its assets.

The listing of a minority of the unit, which makes X-ray and MRI machines, is set to take place in the first half of 2018 and is expected to value Healthineers as a whole at around 40 billion euros ($48 billion).
Siemens is expected to sell 15-25 percent of Healthineers, sources have said, implying stock worth 6-10 billion euros could be sold - Germany's biggest share offering since Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) in 1996.
""Internal preparations are going well and we are still planning the listing in the first half of 2018, if markets play along,"" Joe Kaeser told Frankfurt Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview published on Sunday.
""In any case, we are planning to test the interest of relevant anchor shareholders, including sovereign wealth funds.""
Asked whether this included Norway and China, home to the world's largest and third-largest state funds, respectively, Kaeser said: ""We will probably cover the range of the most important state funds, yes. The advantage would be that we would gain anchor investors. The disadvantage: the free float of shares is not as high.""
The move is designed to enable the unit to raise its own funds for takeovers and investments in the healthcare sector as well as crystallizing its standalone value, removing some of the ""conglomerate discount"" that weighs on Siemens' valuation.

In 2016, utility RWE won BlackRock as an anchor investor in the initial public offering of its Innogy unit. RWE ended up selling a 23.2 percent stake in the networks, renewables and retail unit.

The claim has been lodged with the Zurich commercial court.
SKS said it was assuming damages amounted on average to 15 percent of the initial retail price of the vehicles concerned and that, together with insurance companies supporting the legal action, it wanted to give Swiss-based car owners the possibility to enforce their rights without disproportionate financial risk.
""The cars sold as environmentally friendly were overpriced from the beginning. Due to the manipulation of the exhaust system, they then lost even more of their value on the secondary market,"" SKS (Stiftung fuer Konsumentenschutz) said in a statement on Friday.
Volkswagen said it would examine the details of the claim once it had them but said it saw no fundamental case as industry experts had not been able to establish any significant loss of value for VW diesel vehicles on the Swiss market.
""The trust and satisfaction of our customers are extremely important to us. However, we are of the opinion that there are no legal grounds for claims connected with the diesel issue,"" it said in a statement.
Volkswagen said 98 percent of the 173,000 affected vehicles in Switzerland had already been refitted at no cost to owners.
AMAG, which imports the cars into Switzerland, said in a statement on its website it did not understand why SKS filed the claim because prices on the secondary market for VW diesel cars were at least on the same level or even higher than those of competing models. 
It also said it had not acted with the intention of wilfully deceiving customers.
VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.
Earlier this month, Germany's highest court rejected a bid by Volkswagen to suspend the work of a special auditor appointed to investigate management actions in the emissions scandal.

Fortum has agreed to buy 47 percent of Uniper from Uniper's parent E.ON (DE:EONGn) and offered the same price to the other shareholders, but it faces pressure to raise its offer from hedge funds Elliott and Knight Vinke, who have built up stakes.

""Talks are not going as speedily as we would like,"" he said. ""Fortum is still failing to provide clarity about its goals.""
Just 0.17 percent of outstanding Uniper shares had been tendered to Fortum by Dec. 27, at the offer price of 22 euros per share. The shares closed at 26 euros on Dec. 29. The offer closes on Jan. 16.

Knight Vinke has 5 percent of Uniper and has said it will not tender its stake. Elliott, which has not said how it will respond, has 7.4 percent.

CEO John Cryan, in an interview with the Boersen-Zeitung newspaper published on Saturday, also welcomed plans by Britain to spare European banks costly capital rules after Brexit. But staff were still analyzing any potential costs of U.S. tax reform, he said.
Bonus payments at Deutsche Bank fell to 546 million euros in 2016 from 2.4 billion euros a year earlier after a multi-billion dollar legal fine for the sale of toxic debt.
""We always said that we would return to our normal system of variable compensation in 2017,"" Cryan told the newspaper. ""And we will also raise salaries in some areas,"" he said, without providing more detail.
The still fragile state of Germany's biggest bank was underlined when it reported a drop of almost 25 percent in third quarter investment bank revenue and a drop of more than a third in its bond trading division.
In addition to weak earnings, the bank has been grappling with the uncertainty of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. 
This month, the Bank of England said that it was planning to allow large foreign banks after Brexit to operate as branches in Britain rather than as subsidiaries that would require significant capital. 
The decision ""gives us more planning certainty"", Cryan said. Deutsche Bank has 9,000 staff in London.
The newspaper asked Cryan whether the bank also expects to take a tax write-down like  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) following changes to the U.S. tax system.
Credit Suisse said last week that it expected a write-down of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) during its 2017 fourth quarter.

""We will also be affected,"" Cryan said. He declined to offer a concrete prognosis, saying that the bank was still analyzing the effects of the tax code.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - There were no fireworks on Wall Street for the last trading day of the year, as U.S. stocks closed out their best year since 2013 on a down note, with losses in technology and financial stocks keeping equities in negative territory for the session.
Major indexes hit a series of record highs in 2017, lifted by a combination of strong economic growth, solid corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes for a tax cut from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
The benchmark S&P 500 surged 19.5 percent this year, the blue-chip Dow 25.2 percent and Nasdaq 28.2 percent, as each of the major Wall Street indexes scored the best yearly performance since 2013.
The market has also remained resilient in the face of tensions in North Korea and political turmoil in Washington. The S&P 500 only saw four sessions all year with a decline of more than 1 percent while the CBOE Volatility index topped out at 15.96 on a closing basis, well below its long-term average of 20.
""The real question is what happens as we head into 2018,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
""There is an awful lot of optimism built into share prices right now that could set us up for disappointment.""
Among sectors, the technology index has been the best performer, up 37 percent and led by a gain of 87.6 percent in Micron Technology (O:MU).
Telecom services, down 5.7 percent, and energy, down 3.7 percent, were the only two sectors to end the year in the red.
The rally is widely expected to extend into 2018, boosted by gains from a new law that lowers the tax burden on U.S. corporations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 118.29 points, or 0.48 percent, on Friday to close at 24,719.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 13.93 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,673.61 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 46.77 points, or 0.67 percent, to 6,903.39.
For the week, the Dow lost 0.13 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.36 percent and the Nasdaq lost 0.81 percent. 
Apple (O:AAPL) declined 1.08 percent after issuing a rare apology for slowing older iPhones with flagging batteries. 
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) lost 0.68 percent after saying its fourth-quarter profit would take a $5 billion hit related to the new tax law.
Amazon (O:AMZN) fell 1.4 percent after Trump targeted the online retailer in a call for the country's postal service to raise prices of shipments in order to recoup costs.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.91-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 81 new highs and 20 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 4.94 billion shares, compared to the 6.4 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 06:21PM ET</span>",Apple apologizes after outcry over slowed iPhones,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Facing lawsuits and consumer outrage after it said it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is slashing prices for battery replacements and will change its software to show users whether their phone battery is good.
In a posting on its website Thursday, Apple apologized over its handling of the battery issue and said it would make a number of changes for customers ""to recognize their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple’s intentions.""
Apple made the move to address concerns about the quality and durability of its products at a time when it is charging $999 for its newest flagship model, the iPhone X. 
The company said it would cut the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 for an iPhone 6 or later, starting next month. The company also will update its iOS operating system to let users see whether their battery is in poor health and is affecting the phone's performance.
""We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down,"" Apple said in its posting. ""We apologize.""
On Dec. 20, Apple acknowledged that iPhone software has the effect of slowing down some phones with battery problems. Apple said the problem was that aging lithium batteries delivered power unevenly, which could cause iPhones to shut down unexpectedly to protect the delicate circuits inside.
That disclosure played on a common belief among consumers that Apple purposely slows down older phones to encourage customers to buy newer iPhone models. While no credible evidence has ever emerged that Apple engaged in such conduct, the battery disclosure struck a nerve on social media and elsewhere.
Apple on Thursday denied that it has ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.

At least eight lawsuits have been filed in California, New York and Illinois alleging that the company defrauded users by slowing devices down without warning them. The company also faces a legal complaint in France, where so-called ""planned obsolesce"" is against the law.

732,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:28PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Year,"Investing.com – Take a peek at the top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this year.
Cryptocurrencies Hit The Big Time 
Bitcoin's meteoric rise in 2017 sparked cryptomania as investors desperately attempted to get a piece of the action. Bitcoin showed its resilience in 2017, shrugging off regulatory pressures, competition from rival cryptocurrencies and numerous splits or so-called hard forks.
The popular digital currency boasts a return of more than 1400% since the beginning of the year, dwarfing the returns of the traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500.
Investors also welcomed the arrival of new cryptocurrency as Bitcoin Cash was created in August following a split in bitcoin’s blockchain – the digital ledger which records every bitcoin transaction – in an event know as a ‘hard fork’.
The creation of Bitcoin Cash came as concerns grew over the slow speed of transactions on the bitcoin network. With the ability to process transactions not only faster but also cheaper, Bitcoin Cash has surged more than 1000% from its 52-week low.
As 2017 draws to an end, however, interest in bitcoin has waned giving way to the rise of Ripple XRP as the digital currency soared above $1.9 for the first time in its 5-year history.
Ripple simplifies the way financial institutions like banks process their customers’ payments around the world.
“Ripple connects banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally,” A recent McKinsey study noted.
The native currency of Ripple is XRP – and there’s a finite amount of XRP in existence.
US Stocks Made Multiple Record Highs 
The Dow Jones, NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500 notched multiple record high through 2017 as bullish earnings and the prospect of stock market-friendly legislation lifting US economic growth fuelled the rally.
President Donald Trump scored his first major legislation victory as lawmakers passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which is widely said to be the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in three decades and includes a provision to slash the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. 
The prospect of lower taxes was one of the major catalysts for the move higher in the three main US indexes as investors placed bullish bets on US equities amid expectations that tax cuts would encourage companies to ramp up capital expenditure and buybacks.
WTI Crude Settled Above $60 For First Time Since 2015
WTI crude oil prices gained more than 12% in 2017, settling above $60 for the first time since mid-2015 as OPEC’s strong compliance with the deal to curb output fuelled optimism.
In a sign of commitment to reining in excess supplies of oil, OPEC agreed in November to extend joint production cuts with Russia of 1.8 million barrels per day through 2018. That lifted investor expectations that market rebalancing will gather pace as global demand is expected to rise.
Also adding to optimism on oil prices were recent pipeline outages in the North Sea and Libya.
Rising oil output in the US, however, has capped gains somewhat as market participants expect US shale producers to ramp up output.
Crude futures for February delivery rose 1% to settle at $60.42 a barrel.
The Bank of England Hiked Rates, First Time in Decade 
The Bank of England raised rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in November but tempered expectations for further rate increases, warning that Brexit uncertainties pose risks to UK economic growth.
The Bank of England’s first rate hike in more than decade came as signs of progress on Brexit negotiations prevailed after the UK agreed to pay up to €50 billion to settle the so-called divorce bill. With the divorce bill out of the way, investors look ahead to UK, EU negotiations on a crucial trade deal.
The rate hike and less uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations supported a move higher in sterling as it rose to its highest since June 2016.
GBP/USD rose 0.47% to $1.35.
Gold Prices Notched Best Performance Since 2010
Despite the Federal Reserve raising its benchmark rate for a third time this year in December, gold notched its best year since 2010 as dollar weakness supported sentiment on the precious metal.
Also supporting gold prices through 2017 were a swathe geopolitical crises as North Korea leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump traded numerous verbal blows, while Eurozone political uncertainty continued amid unexpected election results in Germany and Spain.
Gold prices rose to $1,304 on Friday."
733,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:20PM ET</span>","Citigroup follows Morgan Stanley, UBS, quits recruiting pact: bank","NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) became the latest firm on Friday to say it would quit a 14-year-old agreement reached among Wall Street's biggest securities brokerages to not sue each other when a broker switches firms. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UBS Group AG's Wealth Management Americas discontinued the agreement, called the ""broker protocol,"" earlier this year.
""Similar to others in the industry, Citi has decided to exit the protocol"" starting on Jan. 8, said Citi spokesman Drew Benson. 
Benson said the decision was reached because it ""allows us to continue to invest in our growing team of award-winning financial advisors.""
Citi has around 1,000 advisers and relationship managers, according to Bloomberg, which reported the news earlier Friday.
The broker protocol was created in 2004 to bring an end to costly legal battles in which firms would seek court orders to prevent ex-brokers from contacting and recruiting their former clients. Firms that signed the protocol agreed to let ex-brokers to take basic information with them to contact clients and inform them after they moved to a new employer.
But as firms face growing regulatory expenses and greater competition from independent firms and robo-advisers, they are looking for new ways to keep wealthy clients and their assets. 

Nearly 1,700 firms are still party to the agreement, including two of the industry's largest wealth management firms, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Advisors

734,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:20PM ET</span>",Financier Tilton defeats lawsuit by Zohar funds she founded,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lynn Tilton, the colorful New York financier recently cleared of wrongdoing in a U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission fraud case, won another legal victory on Friday as a federal judge dismissed a racketeering lawsuit by the Zohar investment funds she once managed.
U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan said the alleged misconduct by Tilton and her firm Patriarch Partners ""runs headlong"" into a Congressional ban on civil racketeering claims predicated on the purchase or sale of securities.
The three Zohar funds had accused Tilton and Patriarch of ""pilfering"" more than $1 billion of cash and other assets through a ""toxic mix of fraud, theft, and mismanagement,"" leaving the funds unable to meet obligations to their investors.
In his 36-page decision, Pauley said much of the alleged looting scheme appeared ""at least superficially"" not to involve securities.
But he said an ""integral"" component of that scheme ""included pillaging portfolio companies of their equity, re-directing Zohar's equity interests for defendants' benefit, and diverting the equity distributions into defendants' coffers--all actions coinciding with the purchase or sale of securities.""
Pauley also refused to assert jurisdiction over 11 other Zohar claims, noting that the funds had filed a similar lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court.
Lawyers for the Zohar funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A spokesman for Patriarch said the firm is ""extremely pleased"" with the dismissal.
""This suit -- which was filed for no other purpose than to harass and publicly defame Ms. Tilton -- had absolutely no basis in fact or law,"" the spokesman said in a statement.
Known for her flamboyant clothing, Tilton is a private equity veteran dubbed ""The Diva of Distressed"" for turning around troubled companies, and was briefly the subject of a reality TV show with that title.
Her distressed debt empire grew to $2.5 billion before fraud and mismanagement allegations began to mount.
Tilton had created the first Zohar fund in 2003, and gave up management of all three funds in March 2016.
On Sept. 27, an SEC administrative law judge said the regulator failed to prove that Tilton bilked investors out of more than $200 million of management fees by hiding the poor performance of assets underlying the Zohar funds.
In November, Tilton and Patriarch filed a countersuit against the funds and separate claims against other defendants. Pauley directed the funds to respond by Jan. 12, 2018.

The case is Zohar CDO 2003-1 Ltd et al v Patriarch Partners LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-00307.

735,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:01PM ET</span>",BA owner IAG to buy insolvent Austrian holiday airline Niki,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - British Airways' owner IAG (L:ICAG) said on Friday it would buy Niki, Air Berlin's (DE:AB1) insolvent Austrian holiday airline, for 20 million euros ($24.01 million) and provide additional liquidity to the company of up to 16.5 million euros.
The sale to IAG, which had been in exclusive talks for the airline, is the final chapter in the demise of Air Berlin, the No. 2 German air carrier that previously owned Niki and filed for insolvency earlier this year.
IAG said Niki would become part of the low-cost carrier Vueling and would be incorporated in Austria, employing 740 of Niki's 1,000 former employees. Assets include 15 A320 aircraft and slots at airports including Vienna, Dusseldorf, Munich, Palma and Zurich.
""Niki was the most financially viable part of Air Berlin, and its focus on leisure travel means it's a great fit with Vueling,"" said IAG's chief executive, Willie Walsh. 
Niki filed for insolvency earlier this month after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) backed out of a deal to buy its assets on competition concerns, grounding the fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.
Niki's administrators had been racing to find a buyer for its assets before it loses its takeoff and landing slots, its most attractive asset.
""Niki is getting a financially strong partner with a long-term development concept,"" said Lucas Floether, Niki's insolvency administrator. The deal should close in February, he said.
The former Formula One champion Niki Lauda founded the airline in 2003. It was fully acquired by Air Berlin at the end of 2011, according to the company's website, but kept the name.
Lauda made a bid to repurchase Niki, along with several others, but eventually lost out to IAG. 
Air Berlin, beloved among Germans for its flights to the holiday island Mallorca and for the chocolate hearts it gave out after each flight, filed for administration in August. A government loan kept its planes in the air during negotiations on breaking it up.

Air Berlin agreed to sell a large part of its airline assets to Lufthansa. It also clinched a deal with Britain's easyJet (L:EZJ) for some operations at Berlin Tegel.

A German court has ordered Amazon not to lure internet shoppers to its online marketplace when they mistakenly search for ""Brikenstock"", ""Birkenstok"", ""Bierkenstock"" and other variations in Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The ruling is a victory for the German sandal maker, whose relationship with Amazon has grown increasingly antagonistic. It convinced a district court in Duesseldorf that Amazon booked variations of ""Birkenstock"" as keywords through Google AdWords.
Any of those variations would produce search results for Birkenstock shoes sold on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the court said in a ruling dated Dec. 20. Birkenstock sought the injunction because it feared unsuspecting shoppers might buy low-quality counterfeits through Amazon that would erode its reputation. 
Earlier this month, Birkenstock said that it would end the sale of its products over Amazon in Europe after Amazon ""failed to proactively prevent"" the sale of counterfeit Birkenstock goods. A year ago, Birkenstock ended its relationship with Amazon in the United States.
The injunction was first reported by the German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday. 
""For us, Amazon is complicit,"" Birkenstock's chief Oliver Reichert told Der Spiegel.
A spokesman for Amazon declined to comment on the court proceedings but said: ""Amazon prohibits the sale of fraudulent products.""
""We work diligently with vendors, sellers and rights owners to detect and prevent fraudulent products reaching our marketplace,"" he added.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 04:26PM ET</span>",Stock performance in 2017 points to wealth for many nations,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - Markets bid 2017 goodbye on a modestly defensive note on Friday, but the year will be best remembered for leaving global investors wealthier.
A pick-up in global growth boosted corporate profits and commodities during the year, while tame inflation kept central banks from snatching away the punch bowl of easy monetary policy.
MSCI's world equity index shed 0.12 percent on Friday, leaving it short of an all-time intraday high reached earlier in the session but nonetheless enough to give the index an unparalleled record of gains each month this year.
The large and mid-size companies in the index of 47 countries added more than $8 trillion to their market value during the year.
""By all accounts 2017 has been a great year for the market,"" said Arian Vojdani, investment strategist at MV Financial in Bethesda, Maryland.
Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, said of the 73 bourses the firm tracks globally, all but nine recorded gains in local currency terms this year. Major indexes from Japan to the United States and emerging markets are up double-digit percentages for the year, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 7 percent.
CAUTION SIGNS
U.S. markets offered caution signs for the new year in the year's final hours of trading on Friday. Wall Street stocks and the U.S. dollar drooped, helping safe-haven bonds and gold, and a reminder that after a run-up with so few obstacles there may be little room for error.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 118.29 points, or 0.48 percent, to 24,719.22, the S&P 500 lost 13.93 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,673.61, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 46.77 points, or 0.67 percent, to 6,903.39. (N)
""The key issue is whether the low growth rates of prices and wages will continue, thus prompting central banks to remain on the monetary policy sidelines,"" said CommSec's James.
""Globalization and technological change have been influential in keeping inflation low. In short, consumers can buy goods whenever they want and wherever they are,"" he said.
One of the early issues for 2018 will be the March 4 Italian election. As things currently stand the vote is expected to produce a hung parliament that could ultimately catapult four-times premier Silvio Berlusconi back to center stage.
Ten-year Italian government bond yields rose to two-month highs on Friday at just over 2 percent. Bond prices fall as their yields rise.
The dollar is suffering, too, despite the widely held assumption at the start of the year that, with the U.S. Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates and lawmakers poised to cut taxes, the only way for greenback was up.
Three rate hikes and a tax bill later, the dollar hit a losing streak in which its value sank by 9.7 percent, in the dollar's biggest annual decline since 2003.
The dollar's loss has been a gain for emerging markets and the euro, which charged ahead 14 percent for the year.[FRX/]
The wilting dollar has also lifted commodities priced in the currency, which have also benefited from a synchronized pick-up in global trade and surprisingly strong demand from China.
Everything from coal to iron ore has reaped gains. Copper has been a stand-out performer in part due to expectations of rising demand for the mass production of electric vehicles.
The industrial metal is turning in its largest annual gains since the global financial crisis ebbed in 2009, but it slipped off its four-year highs on Friday. Copper futures lost 0.51 percent to $7,251.50 a tonne on Friday. [MET/L]
Gold turned in a banner year, too, despite not being needed for its role as a guard against inflation, which has been tame. At $1,303.22 an ounce, the shiny metal saw its biggest annual gain since 2010. [GOL/]
Oil ended the year around its highest prices in 2-1/2 years after data showed strong demand for crude imports in China and a surprise fall in U.S. production. [O/R]
U.S. crude rose 0.47 percent to $60.12 per barrel and Brent was at $66.62, up 0.7 percent on the day. 

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.405 percent, down a bit from the 2.439 opening figure for the year despite the Fed's rate hikes as weak inflation and strong demand for bonds kept rates in check and financial conditions easy. [US/N]

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's securities regulator formally accused eight former executives of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA of corruption on Friday, as the world's largest graft investigation stretches deep into its third year.
According to a legal filing by the CVM, Brazil's equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the accusations relate to possible irregularities in the contracting process for three drill ships. The accusations stem from an investigation started in March 2016, and include two former CEOs of Petrobras (SA:PETR4), as the company is commonly known.
Petrobras is at the center of the so-called Lava Jato or ""Car Wash"" scandal, a massive corruption investigation that has sent dozens of top ranked executives and politicians to jail. The company, which is the target of 14 separate CVM inquiries, did not immediately respond to en e-mail requesting comment.
Among the accused in CVM's filing are former Petrobras chief executives Maria das Graças Foster and José Sérgio Gabrielli; former services head Renato Duque; former supply chain head Paulo Roberto Costa; former international business head Nestor Cerveró; former CFO Almir Barbassa; former exploration and production head Guilherme Estrella; and former gas and energy head Ildo Sauer.

Several of the accused, including Duque and Roberto Costa, have already been convicted of separate corruption-related offenses. There was no public information immediately available regarding the timeline for the next steps in the legal proceedings.

The repatriation tax, a levy on overseas earnings, was said to responsible for the bulk, roughly two-thirds, of the $5 billion figure.
""The tax legislation significantly revises the US corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries,"" Goldman Sachs said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) said on Friday it would take a $5 billion earnings hit in the fourth quarter for the new U.S. tax law, becoming the first major U.S. bank to detail the law's one-time impact on corporate profits held overseas.
Set to take effect on Monday, the sweeping tax code changes enacted a week ago by President Donald Trump were expected to mean short-term pain, but long-term gain for U.S.-based corporations, like Goldman, that do business worldwide.
Like many such companies, Goldman has stored away billions of dollars in profits abroad. It did so under a law that lets multinationals avoid the present 35-percent, U.S. corporate tax rate as long as those profits did not enter the United States.
The new law encourages companies to repatriate those earnings and slaps a mandatory tax on them of 15.5 percent on cash and liquid assets, or 8 percent on illiquid assets, regardless of whether the earnings come home or not.
Scores of large companies, including other big banks such as  Citigroup  (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), have socked away an estimated $2.8 trillion overseas in recent years. The one-time tax on those earnings is expected to raise $339 billion in federal revenues over the coming decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), a nonpartisan research arm of the U.S. Congress.
That will hurt multinationals for a while, but they will have eight years to pay the taxes due. Some other tax breaks for banks will be eliminated or narrowed, under the new law, ranging from limits on deducting interest to curbs on deducting premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Some U.S. financial companies have disclosed hits related to deferred tax assets from losses they suffered during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Citigroup has said it expects as much as a $20 billion charge to earnings for this, while Bank of America (N:BAC) has detailed a $3 billion charge to fourth-quarter profit.
But these negatives should be more than offset in the long run by other changes under the law, analysts said.
Foremost among these profit-enhancing changes will be a deep cut in the overall U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. That will cut U.S. corporations' federal tax bills by more than $1.3 trillion over the next decade, based on JCT research.
WORLDWIDE TO TERRITORIAL
The new law will also shift U.S. corporate taxation to a “territorial” system. Under the present, “worldwide” system, Washington taxes active foreign profits, if they are repatriated, at the same rate as domestic profits.
Under the new territorial system, domestic profits will still be taxed, but profits earned abroad by U.S.-based multinationals, within some limits, will no longer be taxed.
This was expected to reduce federal tax revenues by $224 billion over a decade, the JCT estimates. A collection of new minimum and anti-base erosion taxes will offset those losses, but for the most part, the territorial system represents a major win for corporate lobbyists who have been pursuing such a change for decades.
The new law, passed by Republicans in the U.S. Congress over the united opposition of Democrats, marked Trump's first significant legislative victory since taking office in January.
Multinationals had pushed for many years for a discounted rate on tax-deferred foreign profits. Under the Republican bill, they finally got it. Analysts expect repatriated earnings to go mostly to stock buybacks and shareholder dividends.

JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Pershing Square said it decided to raise its share of the settlement to 66.8 percent, or $193.75 million, in a bid to quickly wind up the litigation, which it claimed had ""no merit"". 
""We decided, however, that it was in the best interest of our investors to settle the case now instead of continuing to spend substantial time and resources pursuing the litigation,"" said Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman. 
The hedge fund said Valeant will now pay around 33 percent, or $96.25 million, of the settlement costs. Valeant had previously agreed to pay 60 percent of the costs.
""We believe this agreement to resolve the legacy litigation is in the best interests of the Company, because it enables us to focus our attention and resources on the transformation of Valeant,"" said Valeant's Chief Executive Joseph Papa.
Papa, who took over the reins of Valeant in April 2016, has been trying to reshape the company and regain investor confidence, after a flurry of investigations into the Canadian drugmaker's accounting and pricing practices hit its shares.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of investors who sold Allergan shares in the two months before Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant made an unsolicited $51 billion bid for Allergan. http://reut.rs/2DwW6XN

748,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 02:09PM ET</span>",Airbus sprints from behind in bid to upset Boeing order lead,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is pulling out the stops to try and take the lead in its annual order contest with Boeing (NYSE:BA), lining up a spree of multi-billion-dollar deals to close a traumatic year haunted by management upheaval and corruption investigations.
Deals announced this week include confirmation of a record 430-jet order brokered by U.S.-based private equity firm Indigo Partners on behalf of four airlines. But some analysts said Airbus may have to offer large discounts to close the gap.
The Indigo deal and up to 275 other last-minute orders are seen as a grand finale for Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who is due to retire in January after roughly trebling Airbus's market share in his 23 years at the helm.
Airbus has endured what insiders describe as a painful year, falling sharply behind Boeing and seeing its sales teams demoralized by the impact of UK and French probes into the use of middlemen by a now-disbanded headquarters unit.
Its share price is nonetheless near record highs as the planemaker recovers from recent production problems.
Looking to retire on a high, Leahy is seen keen to sell at least as many aircraft as the 700 jets Airbus expects to deliver in 2017 - after revising the internal target up from 400 earlier this year when the industry was slowing sharply.
But many observers expect the New Yorker to go further and try to match Boeing, which reported 844 net orders up to Dec. 19 and is believed to be closer to the 900 mark now.
Airbus has announced deals for a total of 705 narrowbody jets since the end of November, including over 500 in 24 hours - an industry record, according to Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris, who did not rule out Airbus eventually raising narrowbody output towards 70 jets a month from record output plans of 60.
The latest orders lift Airbus's potential catch for the year above 1,000 before adjusting for cancellations. 
Deals also include 100 jets to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), 50 each to lessors AerCap and China Aircraft Leasing (CALC) and 75 spread between two other airlines.
ORDER DASH
Whether Airbus completes a surprise comeback depends on how many of the latest orders are net additions to the order book.
Hungary's Wizz Air said its share of the Indigo order, comprising 146 jets, needed shareholder approval.
If all deals announced by Airbus since the start of December are included in the end-year total, then two thirds of the year's business will have been done in the final month, compared with an average of 20 percent in the previous 10 years.
Some analysts and industry sources said such a spree could hurt profit margins as the planemaker offers concessions to get deals across the line. The impact is not easy to gauge, however, since higher volumes also help jetmakers cut costs.
""Indigo is a sign of investors boxing up plane orders for airlines, but that's not good for margins as it increases buyers' power,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.
Another analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity because of company rules, said concessions need not involve price cuts.
Airbus sources said pricing was driven by the size of the deals and denied making unusual concessions.
Both Airbus and Boeing have deep pockets to offer discounts on best-selling narrowbody jets, where they make most profit. Both sides have accused the other of heavy discounting. 
By contrast, it has been a poor year for orders of Airbus wide-body jets. With 46 orders so far, Airbus has been outsold more than three to one by Boeing, whose Dreamliner sales are at their highest since 2013.
Despite doubts over the future of the world's largest airliner, the A380, Airbus still hopes to clinch an order for 36 from Dubai's Emirates. Talks broke down at last month's Dubai Airshow, but have since resumed, industry sources say.
That hasn't prevented Airbus making contingency plans to phase out A380 output if the Emirates deal is abandoned, Reuters reported this week. Yet Airbus is also betting that if Emirates does buy, this will be a catalyst for other sales.

Airbus described the report as ""speculation"".

770,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 11:20AM ET</span>",AT&T says all U.S. states will use its public safety netwowrk,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) said on Friday that all 50 U.S. states had decided to participate in the nationwide broadband network it is building for first responders as part of a $6.5 billion government contract. 
In March, the U.S. government awarded a contract to AT&T to build the network, years after a federal commission recommended setting up such a system following the 9/11 attacks.
The No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier will receive 20 megahertz of wireless airwaves and success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years as part of the project known as FirstNet. AT&T expects to spend about $40 billion over 25 years to build and maintain the network.
States had until Thursday to opt out of AT&T's network and build their own public safety networks. In addition to the states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also opted for FirstNet, AT&T said. Decisions from the three Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands are not due until March 12, 2018. 

Wall Street analysts have said FirstNet is a way for AT&T to add to its portfolio of wireless airwaves, or spectrum, at a time when consumers are using more data on their cell phones. The company can use the spectrum it receives from the U.S. government to provide more network capacity for wireless customers when it is not in use by emergency responders.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>",London Stock Exchange's company floats hit 3-year high at 15 billion pounds,"LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) raised 15 billion pounds ($20.28 billion) from 106 initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2017, a 63 percent increase compared to last year and the highest level for three years.
Money raised from the exchange's listings was up 164 percent compared to 5.7 billion pounds in 2016, the LSE said in a statement on Friday.
It added that 20 North American companies chose London for their listing, including Dallas-based oil and gas company Kosmos Energy (L:KOS). 
London has seen a pick-up in listings this year after uncertainty around Britain's future outside of the EU single market in 2016 dampened investor confidence and caused a number of initial public offerings (IPO) to be postponed or canceled. 
""Despite the debates about Brexit, London's highly global, deep and liquid capital markets continue to be the ideal partner for funding the world's growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Nikhil Rathi said.
""It is particularly significant that the number of international listings in London is up, with North American listings up nearly seven-fold on last year,"" Rathi said.
The listing of 35 investment companies drove total IPOs value higher, with 5 billion pounds raised from vehicles including real estate investment trusts or special purpose acquisition firms, compared to just 644 million pounds in 2016.
However, the average share performance of newly listed companies in 2017 was down 34 percent year on year, the LSE said. 
Raising $1.5 billion, the largest single London float in 2017 was Russia's En+ Group (L:ENPLq), which manages tycoon Oleg Deripaska's aluminum and hydropower businesses.
Broadcasting masts company Arqiva abandoned plans to raise 1.5 billion pounds and business services firm TMF scrapped a planned float of up to 1.3 billion pounds in favor of an outright sale to a private equity firm.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 10:30AM ET</span>",Germany's top court rejects VW's bid to suspend emissions audit,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's highest court has rejected a bid by Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend the work of a special auditor appointed to investigate management's actions in the ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal.
A three-judge panel did not give an opinion on the merits of the case, in which VW argues that the naming of the auditor by a lower court violated its fundamental rights, but did dismiss the firm's request for an injunction.
""The constitutional complaint that has been filed is neither a priori inadmissible nor is it obviously ungrounded,"" the Constitutional Court panel said in the five-page ruling, dated Dec. 20, that was seen by Reuters.
It added, however, that VW had not ""convincingly made the case for an immediate decision"".
A regional court appointed the auditor in November, in a victory for shareholder groups that want to establish whether VW bosses withheld market-moving information about the manipulation of vehicle-emissions tests.
The court in the town of Celle ruled that VW could not appeal against its decision. The auto maker views the appointment of the auditor as a violation of its fundamental rights, a company spokesman said on Friday.
VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.
Shortly after the Dieselgate scandal broke, VW hired U.S. law firm Jones Day and advisory firm Deloitte to investigate the circumstances of its wrongdoing and who was responsible.
Although VW had pledged to improve transparency, it never published the findings that were used as the basis for a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.
Investor groups seeking billions in damages from VW are trying to establish when VW's executive management board first became aware of cheating in the emissions tests and whether it disclosed possible financial damage to investors promptly.
German securities law requires companies to publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion. The matter is also being investigated by German prosecutors.

VW has said it believes its management complied with obligations under German disclosure rules. The spokesman referred to the Jones Day investigation, as well as a statement of facts published by the U.S. authorities in which VW admitted manipulating the emissions tests.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks are expected to keep rising in 2018 because a massive drop in the corporate tax rate is seen boosting the economy and corporate profits, but strategists say sizable gains could either be short-lived or elusive.
The bull market is on track to mark its ninth birthday in March, with the S&P 500 climbing 20 percent for 2017 - its biggest increase since 2013. The drop in the corporate tax rate in 2018, to 21 percent from 35 percent, is seen by many as the biggest factor for the stock market next year.
Yet 2018 share gains are expected to be smaller than 2017 with the S&P 500's price/earnings ratio - a measure of stock prices against expected profits - is around its highest level since June 2002. Many on Wall Street cite potential pitfalls even though they see no signs of a recession. 
“We've had six years in a row where stocks have (outperformed) earnings, and I think we break that streak with stocks going up but not as much as earnings,"" said Robert Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Princeton, New Jersey.
Some say the tax bill's benefit will be short lived. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management described the bill as ""more carbs and less protein,"" because the tax overhaul will improve spending but does nothing to boost productivity. 
""It'll be a one-year wonder,"" said Kelly. ""People should enjoy the party while it lasts but just make sure you know where your coat is.""
Several strategists cite the risk that faster economic growth could cause inflation to increase at a pace that would lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than expected.
Wall Street's rosy forecasts seem ""well supported by the tremendous string of good news which the economy has delivered,"" according to Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist with Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. 
But he said, the news is too good: ""The problem with getting good news is that at some point you can't be positively surprised any more."" 
Paulsen does not expect a recession. But when the economic surprise index - which compares economic data to consensus expectations - is at high levels, equity performance tends to be weaker, according to Paulsen. 
The Citi Economic Surprise index <.CESIUSD> was at 77 on Thursday, not far from its almost six-year high of 84.5 reached on Dec. 22. 
""We're going to have a 10-15 percent correction at some time in 2018. I wouldn't be surprised if we're down for the year,"" Paulsen said. ""If we get a correction and people get scared I'll probably be buying again.""
Investors will keep a close watch on the on U.S. mid-term elections in 2018 because a Republican loss of control of the Senate or the House of Representatives could stall the party's agenda. In 10 of the last 17 U.S. mid-term election years, equity price moves for the full year followed January's direction, according to Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac. 
Investor moods in January may depend on whether the U.S. Congress reaches an agreement to raise the country's debt ceiling. Investors will also be hoping Congress can reach a 2018 budget pact by Jan. 19. These are just some of the worries traders are contending with.
But the market has history against it. The S&P 500 rises on average 1.3 percent in the so-called Santa Clause rally - the period between Dec. 22 and Jan. 3 - according to Hirsch. This year, five days in, the S&P has risen just 0.1 percent.

""The failure of stocks to rally during this time tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year,"" Hirsch wrote in a blog post.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 06:40AM ET</span>",China regulator penalizes 13 financial institutions over illegal bank guarantee case,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking regulator said on Friday it has penalized 13 financial institutions for providing funds to China Guangfa Bank, imposing fines and confiscating illegal income totaling 1.34 billion yuan ($206 million). 
The regulator has confiscated a total of 661 million yuan of illegal income and handed out fines totaling the same amount, according to a statement posted on the website of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).
Guangfa Bank had provided illegal guarantees for corporate bonds issued by Chinese phone maker Cosun Group, and sought to conceal the extent of the bank's debts. 
When the high-yielding bonds defaulted in December 2016, the online platform on which the securities were sold wanted Zheshang Property and Casualty Insurance Co, the insurer of the bonds, to repay investors. 
Guangfa Bank then said the documents the Guangzhou-based bank had given to the insurer to back the bonds were all fake. 
CBRC previously said the case was one of the most grievous instances of collusion. Earlier this month, the banking regulator imposed a record financial penalty on Guangfa Bank and said the fraud had involved 12 billion yuan and more than 10 financial institutions.
Among the 13 financial institutions that had supplied funds to Guangfa Bank were the Postal Savings Bank of China Co (HK:1658) and the Zhengzhou and Qingdao branches of Industrial Bank Co (SS:601166), the CBRC said in a statement on Friday.
Five rural commercial banks and a credit cooperative in the northeastern province of Jilin were also punished by CBRC.

794,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Demand soars for Russian bond issue seen aiding repatriation,"By Darya Korsunskaya, Tatiana Voronova and Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Demand has soared for a planned Eurobond that sources said is meant to help Russians bring money back home in a way that would protect them from being damaged by potential new sanctions.
Initial bids from wealthy Russians for the sovereign Eurobonds, due to be issued next year, had come in at $200 million, a source in a state bank and another from the Finance Ministry told Reuters.
But demand has now topped $3 billion, the Finance Ministry source said, declining to speculate on the reason. 
Sources told Reuters in early December that wealthy Russians facing the prospect of targeted U.S. sanctions next year had floated the idea of a special treasury bond to help them repatriate assets. Crucially, unlike with bank accounts, holders would remain anonymous under the proposal, they added. 
Two weeks later, authorities said they planned to adjust the terms of a Eurobond planned for next year, in a way that would help Russians repatriate financial assets. 
Russians would be given preference over foreigners during the sale, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov later told reporters. 
The ministry would be ready to increase the Eurobond offer and to cut the domestic borrowing plan to accommodate the demand if needed, Siluanov said.
Asked about the level of interest in the bonds, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that it was too early to say because they had not yet been launched. 
""Wait for a while, nothing was launched yet so its too early to talk about the (degree of) interest,"" Peskov told a conference call. 
""REQUESTS BY BUSINESSMEN""
The issues would be issued via the Russian National Settlement Depository - a local version of Euroclear, the Finance Ministry said earlier, a move which would allow the holders to keep anonymity.
The ministry said in the emailed comments to Reuters on Thursday that the proposed special conditions of the Eurobond issue were ""a step towards a number of requests by businessmen"". It declined to elaborate further. 
The ministry source said the adjusted Eurobonds had been nicknamed ""Beryozki"", after the oligarch Grigory Berezkin, who the source said was a driver behind the original proposal to launch a special treasury bond.
Berezkin, whose assets range from power transmission to the media, said on Thursday the idea for a special instrument had first come from the Finance Ministry but acknowledged he had supported it and discussed it with other business leaders.
""We have supported this idea within the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), and I was among whose who took part in the discussions on the different levels, including in the government,"" he told Reuters.
Berezkin, asked by Reuters whether he would buy the new Eurobond, said: ""I will study it when the issuance documents are ready ... If it is a standard Eurobond, then it is a very good tool.""
Peskov, asked whether Berezkin was behind the original idea, said on Friday: ""As far as I am aware, the proposal was drawn up within the RSPP ... and Berezkin took part."" 
There is no reliable data on how much money Russians have abroad. According to a rough estimate by Gabriel Zucman, an assistant professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, Russians had about $200 billion worth of financial assets in offshore tax havens as of 2014, equivalent to 10 percent of Russia's GDP that year.

The U.S. government is due to draw up a blacklist of individuals early next year under a sanctions bill passed overwhelmingly by Congress soon after Donald Trump became president and signed by him in August.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) told a press conference in Beijing that so-called H-share companies can apply to participate in the pilot scheme, and the regulators will initially select up to three qualified companies.
Under current rules, shares held by founders or major shareholders of Hong Kong-listed mainland firms are not eligible for trading on exchanges.
The reform was first reported by China's Caixin news outlet in November.
Although the scheme would potentially increase share supply in the market, which could hurt valuations, analysts say that allowing founders or major shareholders to float their shares could help improve corporate governance.
CSRC said on Friday that participants in the scheme can choose the proportion of shares they would like to float.

China Construction Bank, which debuted in Hong Kong in 2005, is the only Chinese firm whose shares are fully convertible.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:22AM ET</span>",European shares set for best year since 2013 on tech and mining surge,"By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks steadied on Friday, the final trading day of 2017, and were set to record their strongest year of gains since 2013 thanks to a surge among tech stocks and a robust resources sector.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.1 percent in thin volumes on the day, while euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) declined 0.2 percent.
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) hit a new record and was 0.2 percent higher in a half-day of trading for the index, while Italian equities (FTMIB) declined 0.4 percent after the president dissolved parliament on Thursday and an election day was scheduled for March 4. 
Overall 2017 has been a positive year for European stocks, fueled by strong company earnings, a supportive economic backdrop and an absence of major political upsets.
The STOXX is set to end 2017 with a gain of 7.7 percent, its strongest year since 2013. Germany (GDAXI) and Italy's (FTMIB) benchmarks have been standout performers, rising 12.8 percent and 14.5 percent respectively this year.
Periphery markets have also had a strong year, with Greece's benchmark (ATG) up 23.5 percent while Portugal (PSI20) has gained 14.7 percent.
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) has lagged slightly, rising 7 percent in 2017, as has Spain's IBEX (IBEX), which is up 7.6 percent as the crisis in Catalonia curbed enthusiasm for Spanish equities in the latter part of the year.
Brexit uncertainty has dented sentiment towards UK equities, while a recovering pound has also put pressure on the blue chips' large proportion of overseas earners. 
Looking ahead to 2018, investors remain upbeat about the region's stock market although there are concerns that a further rise in the euro could erode earnings and political risks could slow the economy. 
“Brexit is going to be very much the same story as last year ... that’s just going to weigh constantly on the markets,” Jasper Reimers, senior analyst at Vertex Capital, said.
Among sectors, this year has been dominated by a near-20 percent rise among Europe's tech stocks (SX8P), closely followed by basic resources (SXPP). Chipmaker AMS (S:AMS) has been the top-gaining firm on the STOXX, surging 208 percent in 2017.
Telecoms (SXKP), retail (SXRP) and media (SXMP) have brought up the rear, with year-to-date losses ranging between 2.4 to 3.7 percent. 
Furniture retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) is the worst-performing individual stock this year, down 93.6 percent in 2017 after its CEO resigned amid an accounting probe.

Sources told Reuters on Thursday that initial bids for the Russian sovereign Eurobonds, which have special conditions for wealthy Russians and are due to be issued next year, had come in at $200 million, but that demand already topped $3 billion. 

One of the Reuters sources said that the adjusted Eurobonds had been nicknamed 'Beryozki', after the oligarch Berezkin, who the source said was a driver behind the original proposal to launch a special treasury bond.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 12:11AM ET</span>",SoftBank succeeds in tender offer for Uber shares,"By Liana B. Baker and Heather Somerville
(Reuters) - A consortium led by SoftBank Group Corp will buy a large number of shares of Uber Technologies Inc in a deal that values the ride-services firm at $48 billion, Uber said on Thursday, in a victory for new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi.
The price is a roughly 30 percent discount to Uber's most recent valuation of $68 billion. The deal will trigger a number of changes in the way the board oversees the company, which is dealing with federal criminal probes, a high-stakes lawsuit and an overhaul of its workplace culture.
SoftBank and the rest of the consortium, which includes Dragoneer Investment Group, will own approximately 17.5 percent of Uber, a person familiar with the matter said. That stake includes a share purchase, through a tender offer, from earlier investors and employees at the $48 billion valuation, as well as a $1.25 billion investment of fresh funding at the $68 billion level.
Uber said the deal will close early next year. On Thursday it said that existing investors had agreed to sell enough shares for SoftBank to go through with the transaction.
SoftBank itself will keep a 15 percent stake, while the rest of the consortium will own approximately 3 percent, according to a second person familiar with the matter.
Private equity group TPG was part of the consortium of buyers, a source familiar with the matter said.
Khosrowshahi, who took the top job in August after Travis Kalanick was forced to step down in June, helped negotiate the deal. Uber is losing more than $1 billion each quarter, and a new cash infusion is critical. The company is also planning an initial public offering in 2019.
Uber will use the investment ""to support our technology investments, fuel our growth, and strengthen our corporate governance,"" a spokesperson, who declined to be named, said.
When the deal is completed, the company will make governance changes, expanding Uber's board from 11 to 17 members including four independent directors, limiting some early shareholders' voting power and cutting the control wielded by Kalanick, who remains on the board and is still one of the largest stakeholders.
'SMART THING'
""The stockholders did the smart thing. The price is less important than locking in the governance changes and securing the support of the world's most powerful technology investor,"" said Erik Gordon an entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
Rajeev Misra, chief executive of SoftBank's Vision Fund, a $98 billion tech investment vehicle, will join the Uber board, The Wall Street Journal reported. (http://on.wsj.com/2ChJNyS) SoftBank will get two seats on the expanded board, a source told Reuters.
Misra said in a statement that SoftBank has ""tremendous confidence in Uber's leadership and employees."" Uber board members agreed in early November to governance changes to pave the way for the SoftBank deal. 
Some initial investors in the consortium, including General Atlantic, dropped out over disagreement about the price offered to shareholders, Reuters previously reported.
SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has taken a keen interest in ride-hailing companies around the world, and already has sizeable stakes in China's Didi, Brazil-based 99, India's Ola and Singapore Grab, all of which have competed with Uber. Didi last week raised $4 billion, including some investment from SoftBank.
The Uber investment comes after a year of troubles for the company, including a lawsuit by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's self-driving car unit Waymo that alleges trade-secrets theft and federal investigations that span possible bribery of foreign officials in Asian countries and the use of software to evade regulators. 
Over the past year, a former employee's charges of endemic sexual harassment led to an internal review, London said it is stripping Uber of its license and Uber revealed it had covered up a major hack.

Venture capital firms Benchmark, which owns 13 percent of Uber, had indicated that it would sell a portion of its shares, SoftBank said last month. Menlo Ventures, another large shareholder, would tender shares, Managing Director Shawn Carolan said at the time. Carolan on Thursday praised the deal without describing Menlo's participation. Benchmark did not respond to a request for comment.

Japan's No.3 steelmaker, which supplies the makers of cars, planes and trains across the world, said in October that about 500 of its customers had received products with falsified specifications. The producer's quality certifications at some domestic plants have already been suspended.
According to the Xinhua report, Kobe shipped in 451,000 tonnes of metal products to China through its Shanghai units over September 2016 to August 2017. Of that, data on 1,420 tonnes of aluminum sheet and 116 tonnes of copper sheet had been tampered, it added, citing the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau.
While Kobe's Shanghai units have been in touch with their customers to check on safety of the products, the inspection bureau has said it will continue supervising the units to protect interests of Chinese consumers, Xinhua reported.
The bureau will conduct checks on all products made in Japan by Kobe Steel and set up a special technical investigation team to check its products that are involved with data falsification and release results on a routine basis, the report added.
The bureau will also conduct regular checks on Japan-made metal products imported through the Shanghai port and has already made a full retrospective investigation on related operations by Kobe Steel's units in the city.

Kobe Shanghai could not immediately comment on the report.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 08:31PM ET</span>",CEOs go M&A hunting as booming markets unleash dealmaking spirits,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017, reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis, as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals, even when their targets resisted.
Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U.S. tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump's Republican party would become law, as economic growth around the world, including in Europe, accelerated.
Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited. In some instances, as with chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd's $103 billion cash-and-stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, the target companies refused to engage in talks.
""In cases where companies have been sold, close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell,"" said Michael Carr, global co-head of mergers & acquisitions at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
""Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition, which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public,"" Carr added.
Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M&A to $3.54 trillion in 2017, roughly in line with last year's $3.59 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The peak M&A year since 2008 was 2015, when M&A totaled $4.22 trillion.
The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence. Geopolitical turmoil, including a potential confrontation over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany, failed to dampen M&A spirits.
""Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year,"" said Cyrus Kapadia, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd.
""Boards are supportive of deal-making where there is clear strategic rationale, and even in Britain, where Brexit is causing some uncertainty, companies are still pursuing large-scale deals to enhance organic growth,"" he added.
EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC M&A UP
A 16 percent year-on-year drop in M&A in the United States to $1.4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M&A in Europe to $856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia-Pacific M&A to $912 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Among this year's biggest acquisitions were U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp's $69 billion agreement to buy health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET); Walt Disney Co's $52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and aerospace supplier United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) Corp's $30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE:COL).
Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price, with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations, as opposed to offering just cash.
""We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made, perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative, and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions,"" said Stephen Arcano, an M&A partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. 
Private equity-backed M&A activity totaled $322.6 billion globally in 2017, a 27 percent increase compared to last year, as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work.
Dealmakers say the prospect of the U.S. tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations.
""If you are an acquirer, you are likely modeling a deal where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium, not an assumption on the underlying tax rate,"" said Chris Ventresca, global M&A co-head at ‎JPMorgan Chase & Co.
""If you are considering selling the entire company, as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price, you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock,"" Ventresca added.
Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M&A in 2018 following the implementation of the U.S. tax changes, however.

""U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now more easily put capital to work in the M&A market, while Europeans may try to take advantage of favorable tax policies to do more deals in the United States,"" said Dietrich Becker, co-head of European advisory at Perella Weinberg Partners LP.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity raising rose by almost a fifth in 2017 and bankers expect issuance to increase further in 2018 as the improving global economy and buoyant stock markets drive larger flotations and rights issues to finance acquisitions.
Companies raised $780.2 billion in equity in 2017, up 19 percent from $656.4 billion last year, Thomson Reuters Equity Capital Markets (ECM) data up to Dec. 26 showed.
Global proceeds from initial public share offerings (IPOs) rose by 35 percent to $178.6 billion in 2017. However, overall issues and the global IPO market fell short of 2014-15 cycle peaks.
European bank rights issues continued to dominate equity capital raising in 2017, with UniCredit (MI:CRDI),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) collectively raising almost $35 billion. The biggest 2017 IPO was  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) in the United States which raised $3.9 billion in March.
""We expect volume to be higher in 2018 but the composition will probably be different. The cycle of balance sheet repair is coming to an end and instead we're going to see larger IPOs, spin-offs and some rights issues to finance acquisitions,"" said Craig Coben, head of global Equity Capital Markets (ECM) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Among the big ticket issues, bankers continued to look to the potential listing of U.S. tech unicorns - companies that have achieved a $1 billion valuation without tapping the stock markets - such as Uber  and Airbnb.
In Europe, a large rights issue to help Bayer (DE:BAYGn) fund its planned $66 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (N:MON) was anticipated.
""There could be other geopolitical shocks but those things aside and assuming continued low volatility, we expect issuance to be higher next year,"" Coben said. 
Shrugging off tensions between the United States and Russia and North Korea, as well as protracted conflicts in the Middle East, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX (VIX), continued to hover around all-time record lows at the end of 2017. 
Buoyant commodity prices alongside a pullback in U.S. bond yields and the dollar propelled world stocks to new record highs on Thursday, signaling the rally would likely extend into 2018. [MKTS/GLOBAL]
Investment bankers also said they expected the return of emerging market issuance, highlighting Brazil, Turkey and Russia among resurgent markets. 
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) rose to the top of the league table for global ECM issuance overall and global IPOs, despite JP Morgan (N:JPM) coming top in Europe and Americas. 
Growth in equity raising for British companies lagged behind their European counterparts in part because of worry over Britain's future economic relationship with Europe. 
British companies raised 2.5 percent more equity in 2017 compared to 2016, while German companies, for example, more than doubled their issuance. 
Against a backdrop of record highs for the main London (FTSE) index, a series of canceled listings contributed to investor angst.
""Investors are approaching U.K. domestic businesses with a note of caution. But it's a case-by-case issue,"" said Ken Robins, head of ECM in Europe, Middle East and Africa at ‎Citi (N:C). 

""There is going to be scrutiny. But the U.K. is going to see multinational listings,"" Suneel Hargunani, Citi's head of syndicate ECM in the region, added.

Oklahoma-based SandRidge, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, had said in November that it would pay $746 million for Bonanza Creek to expand its presence in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado.
Icahn, who is the single largest shareholder with a 13.5 percent stake, had called the offer ""value-destroying"" and said it provides ""no obvious synergies nor economies of scale"".
Private investment firm Fir Tree Partners, which owns about 8.3 percent, had said the purchase would drain all of the oil and gas producer's cash.
After talking to its top shareholders, SandRidge board on Thursday concluded that it would not receive approval for the transaction.
As part of the mutual termination agreement, Bonanza will receive up to $3.7 million for transaction related expenses, SandRidge said.

Shares of SandRidge were up 1.9 percent, while Bonanza Creek were down 1.8 percent in after market trading.

FRANKFURT/VIENNA (Reuters) - British IAG (L:ICAG) is in exclusive talks to buy Niki, Air Berlin's (DE:AB1) insolvent Austrian airline, a source close to the process said on Thursday, after Niki's administrator said that one bidder out of four remained.
Besides IAG, the owner of British Airways and low-cost carrier Vueling, bidders for holiday airline Niki included tour operators TUI (L:TUIT), Thomas Cook (L:TCG) and former Formula One world champion Niki Lauda.
""IAG is the last remaining bidder and is still negotiating now,"" the source said, adding that the company had put in the highest offer - a double-digit million-euro amount. German newspaper Bild put the figure at around 40 million euros ($48 million).
Niki Lauda, Niki's founder, was quoted as saying on the website of newspaper Die Presse that he was out of the running. A source said Thomas Cook was also out of the race.
Die Presse also reported, without citing sources, that IAG was likely to be the last bidder. IAG and Thomas Cook's Condor subsidiary declined to comment on Thursday. TUI was not immediately available to comment.
""The provisional creditors' committee for Niki (...) today decided to continue sales negotiations for the business operations of the company exclusively with one bidder for now,"" the spokesman of administrator Lucas Floether said in a statement.
""(The committee) tasked the provisional administrator Floether to conclusively negotiate the purchase contract over the coming days,"" the statement added.
The spokesman declined to give further details.
Austrian news agency APA quoted an internal letter sent by Floether and the Niki management to its employees that the new investor would not split up the company's business and would keep most of its employees.
The new owner will have to pay Niki's running costs, including salaries for its roughly 1,000 employees in Austria and Germany, from the beginning of January, Floether said on Wednesday. 
Niki was part of collapsed Air Berlin. Niki filed for insolvency after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) dropped a plan to buy the assets of the Austrian airline on competition concerns, grounding the fleet and stranding thousands of passengers.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 05:43PM ET</span>",VW to try to block emissions audit in constitutional court,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG said on Thursday it would petition Germany's constitutional court in an effort to overturn the appointment of a special auditor to investigate the actions of management in the ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal.
A lower court appointed the auditor in November, in a victory for shareholder groups that want to establish whether VW bosses withheld market-moving information about the manipulation of vehicle-emissions tests.
The court in the town of Celle ruled that VW could not appeal, which the auto maker views as a violation of its fundamental rights, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in a report released in advance of publication on Friday. 
The car maker will try to get the work of the auditor suspended before the constitutional court hearing, said the newspaper, which researched the report together with public TV channels NDR and WDR.
A company spokesman confirmed that VW would go to the constitutional court but did not elaborate. It was not immediately clear whether or when the constitutional court would take up the case.
Shortly after the Dieselgate scandal broke in September 2015, VW hired U.S. law firm Jones Day and advisory firm Deloitte to investigate the circumstances of its wrongdoing and who was responsible.
Although VW had pledged to improve transparency, it never published the findings that were used as the basis for a $4.3 billion settlement with the U.S. Justice Department.
Investor groups seeking billions in damages from VW are trying to establish when VW's executive management board first became aware of cheating in the emissions tests and whether it disclosed possible financial damage to investors promptly.
German securities law requires companies to publish any market sensitive news in a timely fashion. The matter is also being investigated by German prosecutors.
VW has said it believes its management complied with obligations under German disclosure rules.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 05:35PM ET</span>",Noosa founder Koel Thomae found her dream in a spoon of yogurt,"By Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It took just a spoonful of a simple tub of yogurt with passion fruit puree on a trip home to her native Australia to nudge Koel Thomae into a new career.
Thomae, who had worked in various food companies such as IZZE Beverage Company, had no dairy experience before founding her noosa brand of yogurt in 2009, based on that taste from home. But since then, she has managed to grow her Bellvue, Colorado business into a $170 million company that sells yogurt in major grocery stores across the United States.
The path has not always been smooth, however - and Thomae shared some of the lessons she has learned along the way with Reuters.
Q: How did you learn the value of money?
A: From the time I was 9, I was raised by a single mother and given a high level of responsibility and autonomy with respect to money. My mother provided me an allowance and I had to manage all my expenses. From that I learned to budget and prioritize what was important to me, a skill that allowed me to hit the ground running as a young adult. 
Q: Did your family teach you anything about running a business?
A: While my mum and dad were not in the food business, they both were successful entrepreneurs in their own right. My dad was a biologist by education and started his own wildlife guiding business and my mum was in deaf education for most of her career. She started a craft business in my hometown later in life. 
Q: What was your first job and what did it teach you?
A: My first job at the age of fifteen was working in an ice-cream shop. Most of my jobs through high school into university were service related and they taught me to think laterally, be a good listener and interact with many types of people. 
Q: How did you spend your very first paycheck? 
A: On a heart shaped telephone. I coveted this and it made me eternally happy when I would spend hours chatting to my friends on it! I believe in investing in things or experiences that bring you joy! 
Q: Was there a mistake you made that taught you something?
A: During the early stages of noosa, we ran into a problem not realizing our initial plan wouldn’t work the way we ultimately thought it would. Without a defined sales expansion strategy in place we viewed any new distribution outside of Colorado as a good opportunity. We didn’t have a critical eye on how complex that could be, especially going into the New York market where we had zero brand awareness as an 18-month-old brand. 
We ultimately launched with a local retailer who wasn’t the right fit for the stage we were at and less than 12 months later we were off the shelf and $100K in the hole. Without outside investment, this was a huge hit to our cash position and also left us wondering if we could be successful in one of the biggest markets in the country. 
Q: How important is giving to you and what causes do you support?
A: We feel strongly that it is important to allocate your money to a good cause that aligns with your brand and for us it’s helping bees thrive! Honey is such an important ingredient in our yogurt, so we decided to launch our noosa Blooms for Bees philanthropic program in 2016. 
This is a long-term commitment to support honey bees through an alliance through Bee Friendly Farming, a program that provides guidelines for farmers and growers interested in promoting pollinator health on their land​. This multi-year investment will help expand Bee Friendly Farming, a program of the Pollinator Partnership, created to help pollinators thrive in agricultural landscapes. 
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass down to your children? 

A: My daughter Matilda is five years old and just now starting to grasp the concept of money at a high level. My goal is to instill the same values my mother taught me, to live within your means and invest in experiences over “things.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher in light trading on Thursday, buoyed by gains in financial stocks and as technology stocks continued to slowly recover from a losing skid.
Tech stocks added 0.1 percent and notched their second straight gain on the heels of a five-session losing skid. The index has struggled somewhat to close out the year but remains the best-performing sector in 2017, up more than 37 percent.
""This needs to and has been an earnings-driven market and that is where you’ve seen a tremendous amount of the earnings momentum and visibility, we would expect that to continue into next year,"" said Bill Northey, senior vice president, U.S. Bank Wealth Management, in Helena, Montana.
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed 0.3 percent higher after relinquishing earlier gains and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) edged up 0.3 percent after Reuters reported the companies are in licensing discussions with Riyadh on investing in Saudi Arabia.
Volumes remained thin due to the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day. The prior two sessions showed the lowest full-day trading volumes of the year.
""Clearly light volume, low volatility has been the flavor of the week, post holiday, and don’t expect that to change going into the close tomorrow,"" Northey said.
A 0.6 percent gain in copper prices helped lift the materials sector 0.4 percent, led by a 3.1 percent gain in Freeport-McMoRan.
The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed nearly 20 percent this year, on track to record its biggest annual gains since 2013, boosted by robust economic growth and solid corporate earnings.
The rally is widely expected to extend into 2018, boosted by gains from a new law that lowers the tax burden on U.S. corporations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.21 points, or 0.26 percent, to 24,837.51, the S&P 500 gained 4.92 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,687.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.82 points, or 0.16 percent, to 6,950.16.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 04:07PM ET</span>",GM wins ruling that could narrow ignition switch litigation,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Thursday won a court ruling that could reduce the private litigation it faces over flawed vehicle ignition switches, which have been linked to 124 deaths and triggered a big recall.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the plaintiffs in two bellwether cases, involving accidents where airbags had deployed, could not introduce expert testimony to show how defective ignition switches might have played a role in the crashes.
The plaintiffs said their GM ignition switches might have rotated from ""run"" at the moment of impact to ""accessory"" or ""off,"" causing the accidents or making them worse, and then back to ""run"" before the airbags deployed.
But Furman, who oversees multi-district litigation (""MDL"") over the ignition switches, including 213 cases where airbags deployed, called the expert testimony ""unreliable"" because there was no evidence that ""double switch rotation"" occurred anywhere.
""The court recognizes that these conclusions may have a significant impact on a swath of cases now pending in the MDL and, thus, does not reach them lightly,"" the judge wrote. 
Furman said his role is ""to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony,"" and the opinions of the plaintiffs' experts ""do not pass muster.""
Bob Hilliard and Tamar Lusztig, two lawyers for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
David Caldwell, a spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said the decision ""reinforces our approach to contest cases that lack merit, while being open to fair resolution of cases that have more merit according to the facts and the law.""
GM has paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case, over ignition switches that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying.
The largest U.S. automaker has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles over the defect since February 2014.
As of Nov. 30, there were 1,723 unresolved personal injury and wrongful death claims in the multi-district litigation, including the 213 where airbags deployed, a court filing shows. GM has also settled claims related to more than 1,700 claimants.
Thursday's decision dismissed claims by Vivian Garza, who was 19 when her Chevrolet Cobalt crashed on an icy highway in Alice, Texas, in February 2011.
It also dismissed claims by the son of Ruby Greenroad over the January 2013 crash of her 2007 Cobalt in the Houston area. Greenroad died at age 90 the following year.

The case is In re: General Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-md-02543.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 03:40PM ET</span>","With lineup widening, Apple depends less on iPhone X","By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In years past, demand for Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) latest flagship phone was critical to the company's results over the holiday shopping quarter.
That dynamic might be changing, however, as Apple's widening lineup of devices and services more than makes up for any tepidness in demand this quarter for its lead product, the $999 iPhone X.
On Tuesday, Apple's stock fell 2.5 percent to $170.57 after Taiwan's Economic Daily and several analysts suggested iPhone X sales in the fiscal first quarter would be 30 million units, 20 million fewer than initially planned by the company.
The cut in the forecast was not confirmed, and the stock regained ground on Thursday, hitting $171.82 by midday. The mean revenue estimate for the holiday quarter among 30 analysts remains at $86.2 billion, near the high end of Apple's forecast of $84 billion to $87 billion.
Apple declined to comment.
Part of the support for Apple may reflect a change in its business strategy.
Releasing two new models and keeping older ones have made Apple less dependent on its flagship product. Apple shareholder Ross Gerber, chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management in Santa Monica, California, said the higher price and better margins on the iPhone X will reduce fears of a sales decline.
""We know that Apple's strategy was different this quarter by releasing two phones, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, and I think combined sales will be in line with what people expect,"" Gerber said.
Apple also has fattened its portfolio of accessories and other devices, from its AirPods wireless headphones to a new Apple Watch with cellular data features.
While none is a runaway hit, collectively they are an important contributor, with Apple's ""other products"" segment growing 16 percent to $12.8 billion last year. Customers who buy those add-ons are also likely to buy services from the App Store and Apple Music, part of Apple's services segment, which grew 23 percent to $29.9 billion last year.
""Ultimately, it will be this multi-device ownership"" that will generate further revenue, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies.
IPhone X sales still matter. Each unit generates nearly twice the revenue of an iPhone 7 and contains technologies like facial recognition that burnish Apple's brand.
Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research, said ""hit products"" still represent ""an enormous amount of the company's overall value.""

""Will it take hold in the mainstream? That's the question that still remains,"" he said.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 12:29PM ET</span>","Citigroup to pay $11.5 million fines, compensation over errant stock ratings","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) will pay at least $11.5 million in fines and restitution to settle charges it displayed the wrong research ratings on more than 1,800 stocks, causing many customers to own shares they never would have bought, a U.S. regulator said on Thursday.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Citigroup $5.5 million and ordered it to pay at least $6 million to retail customers over errors that occurred between February 2011 and December 2015, and involved more than 38 percent of the equity securities that the New York-based bank covered.
Citigroup did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but the sanctions reflected its cooperation, including its decisions to report the rating issues and compensate customers, FINRA said.
The regulator said Citigroup would sometimes display to customers, brokers and supervisors the wrong ratings, such as ""buy"" instead of ""sell,"" while in other cases it would display ratings for companies it did not cover, or no ratings at all.
As a result, brokers solicited thousands of transactions and negligently made inaccurate statements premised on wrong ratings, and many customers ended up owning stocks with ""sell"" ratings despite a prohibition on such ownership, FINRA said.
FINRA said the errors stemmed from problems with an electronic data feed, and Citigroup failed to timely fix the wrongly displayed ratings despite ""numerous"" red flags. The bank's actual research reports and ratings were not affected.
""The display and use of incomplete and inaccurate research ratings can have widespread, adverse consequences to customers,"" FINRA enforcement chief Susan Schroeder said in a statement. ""Firms should react quickly to address those errors.""

Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said the bank was pleased to resolve the matter.

Boeing and Embraer said last week they were discussing a ""potential combination"", in a move that would consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly provided Brazil's government gives its blessing. The companies have given no further details. 
Defense Minister Raul Jungmann said on Thursday the ministry was concerned that the negotiations between the aerospace companies had advanced without its knowledge.
""No country in the world would release its grasp on control of a company like (Embraer). It has a nucleus of defense that is inalienable,"" Jungmann told reporters in Brasilia.
He said the ministry viewed favorably any deal that maintained local control of the company and would direct its representative on the Embraer board to seek further information. The Brazilian government holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer. 
President Michel Temer has also said he opposes Boeing taking control of Embraer and that the government could use its golden share in the company to block foreign control. He added he would welcome an injection of foreign capital into Embraer.

The companies said in joint statements that AerCap had exercised an option to buy the 50 planes, with deliveries starting from 2022.
Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) are pairing with smaller regional rivals to add sales at the lower end of their $100 billion-a-year commercial plane duopoly, but the two market leaders are also laying the foundation for a longer-term strategic contest against more powerful threats such as China.
Deals with their smaller cousins may give Airbus and Boeing more options when they develop the successors to the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, perhaps allowing them to offer a trio of large jets coupled to a pair of smaller ones.

Sources also told Reuters this week that Airbus was drawing up contingency plans to phase out production of the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo, if it fails to win a key order from Dubai's Emirates.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - In March 2013, retired chemical company employee Anne Xing, her older sister and their husbands visited a China Everbright Bank branch on the outskirts of Shanghai. A private wealth manager at the bank had a special deal to offer them.
""He said there is a high-quality product,"" Xing recalls. ""Only elite customers can buy it. We asked him if there was any risk. He said there was no risk.""
The two couples sank about 5 million yuan (about $762,000) into the investment product, which offered 9.5 percent annual interest over two years - substantially higher than the 3.75 percent they could earn on a fixed, two-year deposit at the same bank. Xing's sister said she sold a property for 3 million yuan to fund her investment. The two families say they didn't know exactly where the money was going at the time. When the contracts arrived weeks later, it turned out they had entered China's $9.8 trillion shadow banking industry.
By December 2015, the interest payment for the second year was already well overdue and the couples were worried. ""Then the sky came crashing down,"" Xing said. ""The money was gone, a couple of million.""
Everbright had actually sold the two couples a stake in Chang'an Trust Coal Industry Resource Investment Fund Three – A Collective Investment Fund Plan. Their money had been lent to a coal miner that soon went bust. The Chang'an Trust product was one of countless so-called wealth management products sold to investors to help raise money for a massive wave of lending in China that began in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The widely publicized default burned Anne Xing and other investors who now are suing Chang'an. ""I've become like the mentally ill, really,"" says Xing. Amid the acrimony over the loss, Xing says, her sister divorced her husband.
Everbright did not respond to several requests from Reuters for comment. In a written response, Chang'an said: ""This case is currently being processed by the courts. Please wait for the judgment.""
Conducted outside the normal banking system, lending like this is at the heart of China's massive shadow banking industry. For China's rulers, the fear is that there may be more bad loans in the shadows of the financial system. The danger is that a big default or series of loan losses could cascade through the world's second-biggest economy, leading to a sudden halt in bank lending.
Top leaders in Beijing have acknowledged that the colossal volume of complex and potentially risky lending obscured in shadow banking compounds the threat posed by the economy's tremendous accumulation of debt since the global financial crisis. So far there have been relatively few defaults like the Chang'an product. Some regional banks have been restructured after a spike in shadow loan failures.
Financial risk also poses a formidable challenge for the Communist Party. At a top level conference in July, party leader Xi Jinping declared that financial security was vital to national security.
Economic pain from shadow banking could also test the political climate for an authoritarian regime that justifies its one-party rule as the price the country must pay for stability and prosperity. Middle-income and high-income earners, the core of support for the Communist Party, have invested heavily in wealth management products, according to surveys of investors.
REGULATORS TAKE ACTION
Inside and outside China, alarms are now sounding about mounting debt. Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has openly warned that authorities need to curb financial risks that might lead to a ""Minsky Moment"" - a sudden collapse of asset prices, sparked by debt or currency pressures, after a long period of growth. Zhou said corporate debt levels were relatively high and household debt was rising fast, in remarks in October on the sidelines of the Communist Party's 19th congress in Beijing. ""We should focus on preventing a dramatic adjustment,"" he said.
Earlier this year, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's downgraded China's sovereign rating, citing concerns over the nation's rising debt.
Countries with close trading ties to China are monitoring efforts to restrain shadow banking and the accumulation of debt. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) warned in its October Financial Stability Review that ""financial stability risks in China remain high."" The RBA acknowledged that Chinese authorities were taking steps to curb risk. ""But the more that leverage and risky lending grow, the more likely that China's economic transition will include a significant disruption of some form,"" the bank said.
A blizzard of regulations, high-profile arrests and official warnings over the last 18 months have sent a clear signal that authorities are attempting to reign in excesses. A veteran of the country's financial reforms, Guo Shuqing, was appointed in February to head the China Banking Regulatory Commission. Guo almost immediately issued a flurry of directives aimed at forcing banks to improve risk management and curb the sale of complex, high-yielding wealth management products to investors.
In November, Beijing set up the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a top-level panel of regulators tasked with policing tougher rules and closing loopholes that allow risky lending. Days later, the People's Bank of China and financial regulators jointly issued new draft rules to govern the wealth management industry.
There are signs it is working. The growth of shadow banking, particularly the sale of wealth management products, slowed over the first half of 2017, according to reports from Moody's and Fitch Ratings.
But this too presents a political challenge: An overzealous crackdown could lead to financial and economic disruption, economists say. Shadow lending plays a major role in maintaining the 6.5 percent annual growth target that Xi Jinping has set for China's economy. Slower growth may also expose less profitable borrowers to a higher danger of default, potentially creating the conditions for an upheaval. And smaller banks, which have benefited from the explosion of shadow banking, are resisting the new wealth management rules.
China's banking regulator and the central bank did not respond to questions from Reuters about the risks of shadow banking.
In the case of the product sold to Xing and her relatives, the money raised through the Chang'an Trust fund had been lent via a complicated series of transactions to Shanxi Loujun Mining, a subsidiary of coal miner Liansheng Energy. Liansheng went bust in late 2013, before the loan matured. The Liansheng failure was one of the first defaults that exposed the risks in shadow banking. It was widely covered in China's state-controlled media.
At first, Anne Xing says, they thought they were buying an Everbright Bank product. If she had known what she was really getting, she said, ""I one hundred percent would not have bought it.""
Before the 2008 financial crisis, there was very little shadow banking in China. In the aftermath of that shock, Chinese authorities launched a massive effort to stimulate the economy, mostly through a huge increase in lending. This led to a boom in property and infrastructure spending that continues today. Demand for credit increased sharply, especially from local and municipal government-owned companies.
To meet this demand, banks began selling wealth management products offering higher interest rates than normal deposits. Many investors believed these products were implicitly guaranteed by the issuer, even if it was not expressly stated in the contract. Banks also borrowed cash from other banks and companies.
For banks, these funds can then be lent to borrowers prepared to pay higher rates. But the banks want to sidestep rules designed to restrict lending to overheated sectors including property, mining and other resources. So, people in the shadow banking industry say, these loans are often disguised by directing them through a complex chain of intermediaries, including trusts, securities companies, other banks and asset managers.
To earn interest on these loans, a bank will buy a financial product from one of the intermediaries, which directs earnings back to the bank. That allows the bank to describe what is really a loan as an investment on its books. This type of lending can be more profitable because banks can set aside much less capital than they are required to hold for regular loans as a safeguard against defaults.
""WE WANT TO GROW QUICKLY""
By the end of 2015, shadow lending was growing faster than traditional bank lending, and was equivalent to 57 percent of total bank loans, according to a 2016 report from investment bank CLSA. This dramatically accelerated the speed at which overall debt expanded in China's financial system. Moody's said in a November report that China's shadow banking assets grew more than 20 percent in 2016 to 64 trillion yuan ($9.8 trillion), equivalent to 86.5 percent of gross domestic product.
To fund this lending, there is intense pressure on staff selling wealth management products who earn small salaries and rely on commission for most of their income. A typical base salary would be about 5,000 yuan ($763) a month, according to an employee of a Shanghai-based trust, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The employee said sales staff needed to sell 100 million yuan worth of these products a year, at a commission of about 0.6 percent, to meet targets. And, he said, while the marketing was slick, the quality of many of the products was poor.
At the center of shadow banking are the 12 nationally licensed joint stock banks and many of the more than 100 city commercial lenders which hold about a third of China's commercial banking assets. From 2010, these mid-tier banks and regional lenders set about competing with the country's so-called Big Five lenders, the state-controlled behemoths that dominate the economy. The key to the upstarts' growth is selling wealth management products and borrowing from other banks, allowing them to create loans wrapped in financial instruments to give the appearance of investments.
In the northeastern province of Liaoning, Bank of Jinzhou Co nearly doubled its profits to 12.2 billion yuan ($1.87 billion) in the 18 months through the end of June, according to the company's accounts. Driving this growth has been a swelling balance sheet of shadow loans, which have been growing at 30 percent annually over the last three years, according to the accounts.
In an interview in September, 2016, the bank's vice president, Wang Jing, asked by Reuters about these loans, compared the bank's appetite to that of a growing teenager who isn't afraid to eat fatty meat. ""We want to grow quickly,"" Wang said. ""Once we have a certain body mass, we'll be able to do more things, provide better customer service, and there'll be more opportunity to work together with the big banks.""
One of the biggest dangers is that banks must repay investors in many of the wealth management products and other creditors in three or six months. But the loans the banks make to potentially risky borrowers in real estate or mining are usually for terms of a year or more. So, lenders need to keep raising funds from new wealth management products and interbank borrowing to back their loans.
Patricia Cheng, head of China financial research at CLSA, describes how a financial crisis might unfold. In the event of major shadow banking defaults, a loss of investor confidence could mean banks find it difficult to raise funds from new wealth management products. ""Then, the funding chain would collapse,"" said Cheng. That in turn could lead to panic and a liquidity crunch, she added.
In the event of widespread defaults, the government would be forced to bail out investors because so many are middle and high-income earners, commentators say. Many investors also believe the banks would guarantee these products even though there may be no contractual obligation to do so. ""This is a kind of untested assumption,"" says Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research and author of ""Shadow Banking and the Rise of Capitalism in China.""
In the short term, though, Collier and many leading economists familiar with the Chinese banking system think Beijing has the financial tools to avoid a crash if excessive risk can be controlled in shadow lending. They argue that a grinding, protracted economic slowdown that curbs the availability of credit to the more vibrant sectors of the economy would be a more likely threat from a series of shadow banking failures.
The Reserve Bank of Australia and other observers suggest a banking crisis in China would be unlikely to lead to global contagion because the country has limited direct financial links with other countries. But global growth would suffer. China vies with the U.S. for the title of the world's biggest trading nation.
For Anne Xing and her family, the immediate challenge is to get their money back. In May 2016, they went to Everbright's Beijing headquarters where they met officials from the bank and Chang'an Trust. Xing said the bank proposed lending Chang'an the money to pay out investors. Chang'an rejected this, she said.
In July 2016, Xing visited Chang'an Trust's headquarters in Xi'an. Xing said that Chang'an told her it was Everbright that had sought to set up the wealth management product. She said Chang'an also told her that there was an agreement that Everbright would take responsibility for repayment of the principal and Chang'an would handle the interest payments. Chang'an said there was no written agreement, only an oral undertaking, Xing said.
The following month, Xing and other investors sued Chang'an, claiming the wealth management product had not been legally created.
In May this year, they directed their frustrations at Everbright, the bank. Along with other investors they took to the street, staging a 12-day protest outside Everbright's headquarters in Beijing.
They are still waiting for their money.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were broadly steady on Thursday with company news and macro events scarce in holiday-thinned trading, while Britain's FTSE 100 hovered just under a record high.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was flat in percentage terms by 0952 GMT, while blue chips (STOXX50E) slipped 0.2 percent.
A rally in commodity prices continued to support the resources-heavy FTSE 100 (FTSE) index, which was also flat. Europe's basic resources index (SXPP) was the best-performing sector, up 0.6 percent.
Tech stocks (SX8P) extended the previous session's losses, when chipmakers were hit by concerns over demand for Apple's iPhone X. Shares in Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and AMS (S:AMS) both rebounded on Thursday, however.
The tech sector was down 0.4 percent on the day, but has gained more than 20 percent so far this year, the standout performer in Europe.
More broadly, volumes have been muted and liquidity in short supply over the festive season in Europe, with little by way of company news to spur significant moves among single stocks.
Shares in BT (L:BT) fell 2 percent after the telecoms stock traded ex-dividend, while volatile Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) was the top gainer, up 4.6 percent. 
Serviced office provider IWG (L:IWG) was the biggest faller, down more than 2 percent and giving up some of its 27 percent gains from the previous session when it confirmed a bid approach from a Canadian private equity firm.
Nearing the year-end, European stocks have enjoyed a positive year, with the STOXX 600 up around 8 percent in 2017 as buoyant company earnings and a brighter economic backdrop have fueled the region's equities.
Analysts also highlighted broader drivers of equity markets over the year.
""I think predominantly U.S. sentiment and tax reforms have really driven (stock markets), as well as central banks starting to get a lot more hawkish - the ECB joining the U.S. in some quantitative tightening, the opposite of the easing that we've had for years and years,"" Henry Croft, research analyst at Accendo Markets, said.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and Italy's benchmark (FTMIB) are among this year's winners, up 13.7 percent and 15.4 percent respectively, while Britain's FTSE has managed to gain 6.7 percent.

LONDON (Reuters) - Buoyant commodity prices alongside a pullback in U.S. bond yields and the dollar propelled world stocks to new record highs on Thursday, signaling the rally would likely extend into 2018.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, has risen about 22 percent this year and looks set for a record 14th straight month of gains. 
U.S. stock futures too rose, indicating a stronger day ahead on Wall Street (ESc1) (1YMc1) (NQc1).
This year's equity rally has been led by the bumper performance in Asia, which is on track for its best year since 2009, with MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) approaching late-2007 highs.
Equity markets have fed off this year's recovery in world trade and economic growth, which have in turn lifted company earnings and commodity prices, with copper futures at new four-year highs  for an annual gain of over 30 percent.
Oil prices meanwhile are near 2-1/2-year highs (LCOc1) and gold climbed to a one-month top .
Traders anticipate the equity rally continuing into next year, especially if U.S. tax cuts further boost growth in the world's largest economy.
""Commodities are driving trade in the final days of 2017,"" analysts at London Capital Group said in a note. 
""(Copper) has rallied 25 percent since the beginning of June, and with this in mind Dr Copper is telling us we could be in for a strong 2018,"" they added, referring to the perception of copper as a key barometer of economic growth.
Another tailwind for world stocks is the fact that U.S. tax cuts, which will lead to significantly higher borrowing in coming years, have not so far translated into higher borrowing costs. 
In fact, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have retreated after briefly last week breaking above the key 2.50 percent level, falling as much as seven basis points on Wednesday.
Two-year yields too are off nine-year highs (US10YT=RR) (US2YT=RR) after showed U.S. consumer confidence tumbling from 17-year highs. 
Brokerage FXTM noted that 10-year yields had reversed almost half the gains they had made since mid-December.
The dollar index (DXY) skidded some 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies, to a near one-month lows.
""The dollar bears are getting their last licks in for 2017, perhaps foreshadowing of things to come in 2018,"" said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at OANDA.
With the dollar on the backfoot and commodities flying, currencies of commodity exporting countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa , New Zealand    hit multi-week highs..
Emerging equities surged almost one percent to approach one-month highs (MSCIEF). The index is up 34 percent this year.
However, bitcoin (BTC=BTSP), the digital currency which many would consider one of the most risky bets out there, failed to benefit from the risk-on mood - it fell more than 10 percent to under $14,000.
Bitcoin has declined from record highs of nearly $20,000 earlier this year but is still up about 39 percent this month and has gained 5,000 percent in 2017.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 04:23AM ET</span>","Airlines can't blame computer models for higher fares, German cartel chief says","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airlines shouldn't be allowed to hide behind computer-based models when justifying higher fares, the head of the German cartel office said in an interview published on Thursday, as authorities review allegations of a recent spike in prices.
In November, the cartel office asked national airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) for information on prices after receiving complaints about rising fares following the collapse of Air Berlin (DE:AB1), Germany's second largest carrier.
Lufthansa said at the time it was cooperating fully with the cartel office and had not changed its pricing structures, which comprise up to 26 different fares per flight and were automatically determined by software. 
""Such algorithms aren't written by god in the heavens,"" Andreas Mundt told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""Companies can't hide behind algorithms."" 
A Lufthansa spokesman said on Thursday the airline hadn't increased fares on domestic flights or flights within in Europe in more than a year. 
He added the insolvency of Air Berlin had eliminated 100 planes and 60,000 seats a day. 
""As a result, available flights are booked more quickly,"" he said. ""It can be the case that with booking at short notice on some routes that only relatively more expensive booking classes are available.""
Lufthansa's chief executive, Carsten Spohr, addressed the cartel office investigation in a recent interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, saying the airline would be absolved of any wrongdoing. 

""It is good because in the process of the investigation it will be determined that we aren't taking advantage of any short-term dominant market position,"" Spohr was quoted as saying.

Trust firms, which are some of China's largest shadow bankers, are in retreat as Beijing takes aim at leverage in the financial system to curb risk. 
China's banks use trust companies as a conduit to lend to borrowers which they would otherwise be prohibited from lending to such as risky developers. It is also a way to avoid regulations that require risks to be properly recognized and adequate provisions to be set aside for them. 
Last week, the China Banking Regulatory Commission banned lenders from using trust firms to skirt regulations and cover up risk in Beijing's latest effort to crack down on shadow banking.
CITIC Trust, a unit of conglomerate CITIC Ltd, was not immediately available for comment.
The trust plans to work with their banking partners to terminate some parts of their business ahead of schedule, the two sources said.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 03:58AM ET</span>",Japan's Nomura poised to start China retail brokerage business: CEO,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) is ready to serve wealthy Chinese as soon as the world's second-largest economy allows foreign financial institutions to open securities brokerages, the chief executive of Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank said.
""We have been preparing to start business in China for years. We are waiting first in the queue for when the country eventually opens up,"" Koji Nagai told Reuters.
Nomura already serves wealthy Chinese from retail operations in Hong Kong, and offers wholesale - or business-to-business - services in mainland China.
""But we want to do retail business (in mainland China) as well, like we do in Japan,"" Nagai said in an interview.
China has been gradually opening up in recent years, and stunned the finance industry in November when it unveiled plans to allow foreign control of domestic financial institutions.
Banks such as  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) could take advantage of the change by taking majority control of joint ventures they operate with local partners, industry insiders said.
For its part, Nomura aims to establish a retail brokerage targeting China's growing affluent class, said Nagai, Nomura's chief since 2012.
""In terms of per-capita GDP, China is nearing the stage where mass consumers start needing brokerage services,"" Nagai said, referring to gross domestic product.
Still, he said Nomura is taking a long-term view toward Chinese market. ""It will take time to make it a real business. We are hoping to become profitable in five to 10 years at the earliest.""
More immediately, he said Nomura needs to build up investment banking operations in the United States, noting its size does not match a market which generates over half of the global investment banking industry's fee revenue.
""We have strong sector coverage in Japan, Asia and Europe. There is a missing link in the United States and we need to fill that,"" he said.
He also said Nomura could pursue both organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the United States. ""If we see good opportunities to hire bankers, we will do so, and if there is a good boutique house, we might buy it.""
""Anyway, we are not aiming to compete squarely with bulge brackets. We are an investment bank with strength in Asia and we will connect that with Europe and the United States,"" he said. Bulge brackets refers to global financial institutions such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS).
On bitcoin, Nagai said his bank is ""studying"" the cryptocurrency but has no plans, for instance, to enter the platform business such as by running an exchange.
Bitcoin has shot up in value in recent months, conjuring fear of a mostly speculation-driven price bubble destined to collapse. In September, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud.

Nagai said while the cryptocurrency's recent price movement appears to be highly speculative, ""I wouldn't brand bitcoin as bad or the situation akin to the tulip bubble"" of the seventeenth century, when the price of tulips famously sky-rocketed before spectacularly crashing.

CFTC trade union representative Franck Don said the collective bargaining option would be on the agenda at a Jan 9 works council meeting, while CGT trade union official Jean-Pierre Mercier said such a move could make it easier for PSA to sack workers.
PSA is looking to cut costs in order to boost its overall financial performance.
The French company has given its Opel arm until 2020 to return to profit as part of a recovery plan aimed at shifting the brand's model lineup onto PSA's architecture, with PSA pursuing 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in savings from its purchase of Opel.

885,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 02:50AM ET</span>",Five large banks in Russia saw outflows from corporate accounts in November,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian households retained faith in the country's largest banks in November, while companies withdrew funds from banks rescued by the central bank, according to an analysis of the central bank data.
Banks' financial health is on the radar as the central bank proceeds with its clean-up program. The central bank took over three major private lenders, Otkritie , B&N Bank and Promsvyazbank (PSB), in recent months.
The Russian banking sector also remains under scrutiny as banks that are not rescued by the central bank lose their licenses. Since the beginning of the year, the central bank has revoked 62 banking licenses, reducing the number of banks in Russia to 519 from more than 1,000 a few years ago.
In November, Otkritie, once Russia's largest private lender, lost 101.2 billion roubles ($1.75 billion), or 25 percent of corporate funds it held in current and deposit accounts, according to data collated by Reuters using web-based aggregator kuap.ru, a financial analytical tool used by Russian credit analysts.
Otkritie said in an emailed comment the drop was attributed to a write-off of its subordinated bonds, required by the central bank's bail-out program.
B&N, which was bailed out within a month after Otkritie, saw its corporate funds shrink by 19 billion roubles, or 16 percent in November, the data showed.
B&N said the decline was due to expiration of some corporate time deposits.
Credit Bank of Moscow (MCB) followed with a drop of 4.9 percent in corporate current and deposit accounts in November.
CBM said it saw an outflow as it has not raised deposit rates unlike other banks that sought liquidity from corporate clients.
PSB, rescued this month, lost 28 billion roubles from corporate current and deposit accounts in November, or 4.7 percent.
PSB said outflows from its accounts came after its credit ratings were reviewed in early November.
UniCredit was another major bank that saw an outflow of one percent from its accounts held by corporates. The Moscow office of the Italian banking group did not reply to a request seeking a comment.
While legal entities were withdrawing funds from banks, retail clients increased funds held in major banks' current and deposit accounts by up to two percent in November, the data showed.

Mitsubishi Materials said in November that its subsidiaries falsified data about products, including parts for aircraft and automobiles. Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co (T:9503) said earlier this month that two of its nuclear plants used parts with possibly falsified data supplied by Mitsubishi Cable Industries, one of the units.
Mitsubishi Materials said a committee looking into the case had found that Mitsubishi Shindoh, which was late to enter the market for metal products used in device connectors for cars, had taken orders even when they could not meet customers' product specification.
It also cited an urge to approve products to prevent losses, and a lack of awareness about compliance and quality assurance among its staff.

Other companies that have admitted to product data falsification including Kobe Steel (T:5406) and Toray Industries (T:3402) have also blamed a focus on profit, lax quality controls and staffing shortages.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 09:18PM ET</span>",Ex-lawyer for pharma executive Shkreli convicted of aiding fraud scheme,"By Jan Wolfe and Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - A New York lawyer who once advised Martin Shkreli was convicted on Wednesday of helping him defraud a pharmaceutical company, a charge a different jury cleared the drug executive of when it found him guilty of securities fraud earlier this year.
Evan Greebel, who was outside counsel to Shkreli's former company Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX), was found guilty by a federal jury in Brooklyn of charges he conspired to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, prosecutors said.
""We are shocked by the verdict,"" said Reed Brodsky, a lawyer for Greebel. ""We will continue to fight for justice for Evan Greebel and his family.""
Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde in Brooklyn said the verdict sent a message to lawyers that they will be held accountable when they ""use their legal expertise to facilitate the commission of crime.""
The verdict came after a different jury in August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding hedge fund investors, but not guilty of conspiring with Greebel to steal from Retrophin. He has denied wrongdoing.
Greebel, 44, was a partner at the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman when he was working for Retrophin. He later joined the firm Kaye Scholer, but resigned after his arrest in December 2015.
Shkreli, 34, became notorious in 2015 when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50, as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The price hike is unrelated to the criminal case.
The charges he and Greebel faced related to Shkreli's management of his previous drug company, Retrophin, and of two hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, from 2009 to 2014.
Prosecutors have said that Shkreli lied about the funds' finances to lure investors and concealed devastating trading losses. They said he paid investors back with money and shares stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.
Prosecutors said Greebel assisted Shkreli in defrauding Retrophin through a series of settlement and sham consulting agreements.
In September, following his conviction, Shkreli was jailed after he offered a $5,000 reward in a posting on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for a strand of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's hair. That prompted U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto to revoke his bail.
Greebel denied wrongdoing, and at trial, his lawyers sought to distance their client from Shkreli, whose provocative public behavior earned him the nickname ""pharma bro.""
Brodsky told jurors during his opening statement that Shkreli lied to Greebel just as he lied to investors.

Greebel was also accused of conspiring with Shkreli to exercise secret control over Retrophin shares belonging to several other shareholders. Shkreli was found guilty of that charge during his trial.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 04:43PM ET</span>",U.S. holiday sales set to break records in surprise boon to retail,"By Eric M. Johnson and Richa Naidu
SEATTLE/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. holiday shopping season is on track to break sales records on the back of surging consumer confidence and increased use of mobile devices, presenting an unexpected boon for retailers and the delivery companies they rely on.
The holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retailers that can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales, brought record-breaking online and in-store spending this year of more than $800 billion, according to Mastercard Inc's analytics arm.
Stakes are particularly high this year for traditional retailers that have invested heavily in technology and free delivery and returns, determined to stay relevant in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""It has been an extremely positive holiday season in terms of sales both for brick-and-mortar and for online businesses,"" said Shelley Kohan, a Retail Fellow at analytics firm RetailNext. 
Preliminary numbers show total holiday sales will exceed RetailNext's initial forecast of a 3.8 percent increase from last year. ""All the economic indicators were very strong, and so I think consumers were more willing to open up their wallets and purses and spend more,"" Kohan added.
RetailNext and most other analytics firms and industry groups - including Adobe Analytics and the National Retail Federation - are due to publish holiday sales data in January.
Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) said on Tuesday that a late-season rally had driven an 18.1 percent rise in online sales. Department store chain Macy's Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) both noted increased activity during that time.
Target spokesman Joshua Thomas told Reuters that during the week before Christmas the company had seen a marked increase in shoppers picking up online orders in stores, while Macy's spokeswoman Blair Rosenberg said last-minute shoppers boosted fragrance sales during that period. 
The S&P retail index was flat on Wednesday. 
SANTA'S LITTLE HELPERS
Package delivery companies that handle returns for retailers have benefited from booming delivery volumes in recent years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope as e-commerce purchases surge to new heights.
Delivering individual packages to shoppers - and picking up returns - is a lower margin business for delivery companies, which make more when they deliver in bulk to businesses. 
 United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), the world's largest package delivery company, said on Wednesday it was on track to return a record number of packages this holiday, having handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December.
That pace is expected to continue into early January, UPS said, and would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year. 
Rival FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Rajesh Subramaniam told analysts last week about 15 percent of all goods purchased online are returned, with apparel running at about 30 percent.
UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. 
The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year's Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year. 

UPS and FedEx shares both ended up slightly on Wednesday.

907,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Flattening U.S. Yield Curve Nears Decade Lows in Final 2017 Push,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. yield curve is getting one final flattening push before calling it a year.
The spread between the yields on 2-year and 10-year Treasuries narrowed to just 50.6 basis points Wednesday, close to the decade low reached on Dec. 6. While a small part of the more than six-basis-point narrowing is a function of the market shifting to a new benchmark 2-year note, the move is nonetheless one of the biggest single-session shifts of 2017. Indeed, the gap between rates on 5-year and 30-year debt has also shrunk as long bonds stage their biggest advance since September.
The culprits behind this final flattening push appear to be money managers who need to tidy up their portfolios before 2017 finishes, with month-end duration extensions and quarter-end rebalancing both supportive of long-end Treasury buying.
The duration on the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Treasury Index will increase by 0.07 years next month, marginally higher than average for January, and fixed-income investors that track such benchmarks will likely follow suit by buying longer-dated securities.
For investors who want a mix of stocks and bonds, this quarter’s combination of a 6.4 percent rally in the S&P 500 Index and, as of Tuesday, a slight decline for Treasuries means that equities now make up a greater share of their portfolio and some adjustment toward fixed income may be necessary.
Add to all this the fact that the week is shortened by Monday’s Christmas holiday and a slightly earlier than normal close recommended on Friday, and it’s little wonder that the market’s seen a bump in activity at the moment. That’s certainly evident in bond futures volumes, which were 10 percent bigger than their 10-day average between 5 a.m. and 2 p.m. New York time."

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) is on track to return a record number of packages this holiday shipping season, a sign that e-commerce purchases surged to new heights over the past month.
The world's largest package delivery company and rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) get paid by retailers like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) for handling e-commerce deliveries. 
Both have benefited from booming delivery volumes over the past few years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope.
UPS said on Wednesday it handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December, a pace expected to last into early January. It said returns would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year. 
The returns follow what could be the strongest holiday shopping season on record for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers, once stores publish sales data. Mastercard Inc (N:MA) said on Tuesday U.S. shoppers spent over $800 billion during the season, more than ever before.
FedEx said on Wednesday it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Rajesh Subramaniam told analysts last week about 15 percent of all goods purchased online are returned, with apparel running at about 30 percent.
UPS said record-breaking e-commerce sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in late November jolted the returns season, with a larger flood of packages going back to retailers even as many gifts sat under Christmas trees.
UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. 
The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year's Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>",GE raises stake in Sweden's Arcam by buying shares from hedge funds,"(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Wednesday it would raise its stake in Swedish 3D printer maker  Arcam AB  (ST:ARCM) to around 95 percent from 77 percent after buying shares from hedge funds Elliott and Polygon.
GE said it would buy Elliott Management and Polygon Investment Group's outstanding shares for 345 Swedish crowns ($41.44) each.
GE also said it planned to acquire all remaining shares of Arcam in a compulsory buyout procedure and to request that the company delist its shares from the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange.
Activist Elliott built a 10 percent stake in Arcam in October 2016 after GE announced an initial tender for the 3D printer maker, which the hedge fund rejected. 
GE later offered a 5 percent bump on its first offer, raising it to 300 crowns per share, and Arcam said GE's offer was completed in November 2016.
A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment while Polygon did not respond to requests for comment.
Arcam shares rose 11 percent to 346.50 Swedish crowns.
3D printing has been used to build prototypes for decades but has become more widespread for industrial mass production in recent years, with uses including the production of dental crowns, medical implants and light aircraft parts.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>",Creditors seek bankruptcy for U.S. media entrepreneur Sillerman,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Creditors of American media entrepreneur Robert F.X. Sillerman are seeking to force the onetime billionaire into bankruptcy to try and collect on a $7.36 million judgment against him, according to court documents.
Two Chicago-based concert promoters on Wednesday filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against Sillerman in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
They are seeking to collect a judgment they won last month against Sillerman over a promissory note he guaranteed on behalf of SFX Entertainment Inc.
Sillerman founded the company in 2012 to promote electronic dance music festivals, and in 2014 acquired React Presents Inc and Clubtix Inc from Jeffery Callahan and Lucas King. Part of the payment for the deal was in the form of a $10 million promissory note.
SFX Entertainment acquired festivals such as TomorrowWorld but had trouble bringing them together in one corporate family and filed for bankruptcy in February 2016. A month later, King and Callahan and the their two companies sued Sillerman in Chicago federal court to collect on the promissory note.
The creditors are represented by Michael Edelman of Vedder Price in New York, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sillerman could not be reached for comment.
Forbes Magazine in 2008 included Sillerman on its list of ""poor billionaires,"" or those who failed to crack the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. He appeared on the list in 2005.
Sillerman built his fortune over decades of well-timed deals consolidating the entertainment industry, involving radio stations, concert promoters and even Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion.
Sillerman can respond to the creditors' involuntary bankruptcy petition by seeking to have the case dismissed or converting the filing to a voluntary bankruptcy, which would give him greater control over the case. 
The involuntary bankruptcy is the latest legal headache facing Sillerman.
In September, ESFX Holdings LLC asked a New York state judge to issue an order permitting the forced sale of a property owned by Sillerman and his wife on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to satisfy a $14.6 million judgment.
ESFX obtained the judgment after a default on a promissory note that had been guaranteed by Sillerman. 
Sillerman has asked the court to dismiss the case and said the filing was an attempt to pressure him by threatening him and his wife with the loss of their home.

A hearing is scheduled for March in the case.

936,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 12:31PM ET</span>",Betting Against Boredom: A Field Guide to 2018 Volatility Trades,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s pretty simple: in three decades since the Cboe Volatility Index was invented, 2017 will go down as the least exciting year for stocks on record. There are three trading days left and the VIX’s average level has been 11.11, about 10 percent lower than the next-closest year.
It’s tempting to say nobody thinks it will last, but that would be to ignore the walls of money that remain stacked up in bets that it will. Going just by the sliver represented by listed securities, about $2.4 billion is in the short volatility trade as of this month, the most on record. Hundreds of billions more are betting against beta in things like volatility futures.
Still, that doesn’t mean investors are ignoring the possibility of a resurgence, or at least a reversion to the mean. Here’s a look at volatility positioning as it stands now.
Surging Cost of Protection Against VIX Upside
Nervousness about next year is visible in the relative cost of betting on an increase in volatility, which has surged to a peak compared with wagers on a decline. (The spread is based on three-month VIX skew in data compiled by Bloomberg.) Someone, somewhere is spending money to capitalize on a rebound in the gauge.
But it’s the furthest thing from a one-way bet. The global short volatility trade currently has more than $2 trillion in various strategies, according to an October report by Christopher Cole, the founder of Artemis Capital Advisers hedge fund. He compared the strategy of betting that volatility, already near record lows, will fall even further, to a snake “blind to the fact that it is devouring its own body.”
Reptilian autosarcophagy aside, as of December 2017, betting against volatility has been the trade that worked. An analysis on the ETF.com website Tuesday said that seven of the 20 worst-performing exchange-traded securities this year were long VIX and other volatility measures.
Investors see a 74 percent probability that equity price swings will widen next year as the current levels of volatility are “unsustainable,” according to a survey of 229 investors representing $6 trillion in managed assets conducted by Absolute Strategy Research. The VIX rose for a second day to 10.25 on Tuesday after hanging below 10 for about 20 percent of the time this year.
Record Number of Investors See Stocks as Overvalued
Between rising corporate profits, a pick-up in global growth and laudable message-management by central banks, volatility has had few catalysts. But as the S&P 500 Index has reached 62 all-time highs this year, a record number of investors see stocks as overvalued, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey last month.
Perhaps as a result, smart-beta exchange-traded funds purporting to offer a haven from chaos have taken in more than $3.5 billion in 2017.
Anyone in a short-volatility position should be aware that when the end comes, it usually comes fast.
“Look at what happened in January 2016, a drop of more than 5 percent in the S&P -- and a spike in volatility -- came out of the blue,” said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader and managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. “When vol goes up, it moves quickly, making it hard to exit when you’re short volatility in a significant amount.”
Earnings Dispersion and Volatility Pick-Up
For Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, the death knell for dormant volatility next year will come from less benign global macro conditions. A more challenging global growth environment, the Federal Reserve tightening coupled with the tax uncertainty will lead to a wider dispersion in economic data and earnings data, resulting in more volatility.
Another hint that the low VIX doesn’t bespeak a dumbfounded unanimity is the volatility curve.
In a blog post last month, New York Federal Reserve economists pointed out that investors are paying noticeably more to hedge against price swings a year from now than for shorter-term volatility. Their analysis found that the difference between one-month implied volatility and one-year was about three times as steep as it normally is.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) will pay $2.8 million to settle charges that a broker-dealer unit lacked sufficient controls to safeguard customer securities from several countries over more than eight years, a U.S. regulator said on Wednesday.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said JPMorgan Clearing Corp created hundreds of millions of dollars of deficits by violating U.S. rules designed to thwart the improper commingling of assets.
Such rules are intended to avoid delays in returning customer securities, or the inability to make customers whole, when broker-dealers fail.
FINRA said the violations occurred from March 2008 to June 2016, and stemmed in part from defective electronic systems that JPMorgan inherited from Bear Stearns Cos, the investment bank it bought in May 2008 in a government-arranged fire sale.
JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, in an email said there were no findings that any client accounts were harmed.
According to settlement papers, JPMorgan failed to properly segregate customer securities from its own assets because of systematic coding and design flaws and a lack of supervision.
FINRA cited as examples how the improper safeguarding of Italian securities for nearly two years and Nigerian securities for four years created respective deficits of $146 million and $120 million.

The fine reflected JPMorgan's ""extraordinary"" cooperation in addressing the violations, and its practice of setting aside excess deposits to protect customers from losses, FINRA said.

Boston-based GE in August was reportedly planning to close the plant by June 2018, and move the work to China. The plant, part of GE's troubled power business, assembles electronic boards and employs about 100 people.
As part of an ""exhaustive review"" of GE Power's operations ""we have determined that, at this time, we are best able to serve our customers by keeping manufacturing and assembly operations for our industrial communications product line in Rochester,"" GE said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.
GE added that it was not offered any incentives by the state government to stay in Rochester.
Earlier this month, GE said it would axe 12,000 jobs at its power business, which sells electrical generation equipment.

GE launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018 at the power unit, as it expects dwindling demand for fossil-fuel power plants to continue.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Airbus ready to phase out A380 if fails to win Emirates deal: sources,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is drawing up contingency plans to phase out production of the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo, if it fails to win a key order from Dubai's Emirates, three people familiar with the matter said.
The moment of truth for the slow-selling airliner looms after just 10 years in service and leaves one of Europe's most visible international symbols hanging by a thread, despite a major airline investment in new cabins unveiled this month.
""If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production,"" a person briefed on the plans said. A supplier added such a move was logical due to weak demand.
Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. Airbus also declined to say how many people work on the project.
Any shutdown is expected to be gradual, allowing Airbus to produce orders it has in hand, mainly from Emirates.
It has enough orders to last until early next decade at current production rates, according to a Reuters analysis.
The A380 was developed at a cost of 11 billion euros to carry some 500 people and challenge the reign of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747.
But demand for these four-engined goliaths has fallen as airlines choose smaller twin-engined models, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain. 
Emirates, however, has been a strong believer in the A380 and is easily the largest customer with total orders of 142 aircraft, of which it has taken just over 100.
Talks between Airbus and Emirates over a new order for 36 superjumbos worth $16 billion broke down at the Dubai Airshow last month. Negotiations are said to have resumed, but there are no visible signs that a deal is imminent. 
Although airlines such as British Airways have expressed interest in the A380, Airbus is reluctant to keep factories open without the certainty that a bulk Emirates order would provide.
Emirates, for its part, wants a guarantee that Airbus will keep production going for a decade to protect its investment.
A decision to cancel would mark a rupture between Airbus and one of its largest customers and tie Emirates' future growth to recent Boeing orders. European sources say that reflects growing American influence in the Gulf under President Donald Trump, but U.S. and UAE industry sources deny politics are involved.
There are also potential hurdles to a deal over engine choices and after-sales support.
SAFETY NET
Yet if talks succeed, European sources say there is a glimmer of hope for the double-deck jet, which Airbus says will become more popular with airlines due to congestion.
Singapore Airlines, which first introduced the A380 to passengers in 2007, showcased an $850 million cabin re-design this month and expressed confidence in the model's future.
Airbus hopes to use an Emirates order to stabilise output and establish a safety net from which to attract A380 sales to other carriers, but has ruled out trying to do this the other way round, industry sources said. 
As of the end of November, Airbus had won orders for 317 A380s and delivered 221, leaving 96 unfilled orders.
But based on airlines' intentions or finances, 47 of those are unlikely to be delivered, according to industry sources, which halves the number of jets in play.
Airbus needs to sell at least another 30 to keep lines open for 10 years and possibly more to justify the price concessions likely to be demanded by any new buyers.
To bridge the gap, Airbus plans to cut output to six a year beyond 2019, from 12 in 2018 and 8 in 2019, even if it means producing at a loss, Reuters recently reported.
Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed this month Airbus was looking at cutting output to 6-7 a year.
If Airbus does decide to wind down production, some believe Emirates will ask Airbus to deliver the remaining 41 it has on order and then keep most A380s in service as long as possible.

Even so, some A380s are likely to be heading for scrap.

The numbers indicate that the electric carmaker may still not be out of its self-described ""manufacturing hell"" for the production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.
KeyBanc analysts based their projections after conversations last week with sales people at 18 stores in the United States.
""We talked to stores in California doing as many as a dozen per week with around 10 being the average, and we estimate stores outside of California were doing something closer to half a dozen per week,"" the analysts wrote.
Tesla's shares fell 0.5 percent to $315.74 in premarket trading on Wednesday.
Palo Alto, California-based Tesla made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter against its own target to build more than 1,500 due to what it called ""production bottlenecks.""
The company said in November it expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.
A further delay in Model 3 production could lead to postponed sales and exacerbate Tesla's cash burn. Over 500,000 customers have put down a refundable deposit for the car.
Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment. 
However, KeyBanc maintained its ""sector weight"" rating on the stock. 

Bullish investors in particular remain more focused on that the car is being produced with minimal defects and that consumer reviews and response are favorable, the brokerage said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies , the world's third-largest smartphone maker, said on Wednesday that Chinese police are conducting an investigation, after the China sales head of its smartphone unit was detained on suspicion of accepting bribes.
Huawei, which in recent years has overtaken Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and others to take the top share of China's smartphone market but is now under pressure from fast-growing domestic rivals, declined to disclose details of the case.
""The authorities are investigating the matter, and we defer to their discretion as to what can be disclosed,"" the company said in e-mailed comments to Reuters when asked about the case. 
""We take our business ethics extremely seriously, and have zero tolerance for corrupt behavior."" It gave no further comment.
In an internal memo to staff, however, Huawei said Teng Hongfei, the Greater China sales head for its consumer business division, had been detained for ""the suspected crime of accepting bribes as a non-state functionary"".
Reuters was unable to immediately reach Teng or a representative for comment. 
According to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, he worked at Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) before joining Huawei in June 2014.
Since then, Huawei has moved past Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi  and Lenovo Group (HK:0992) to become China's largest smartphone seller.
But its top spot in the world's biggest smartphone market has come under threat over the past year from competitors such as OPPO and Vivo, and its profits have suffered as a result.
Huawei has a 22.3 percent share of China's smartphone market, followed by OPPO at 21.6 percent, according to third-quarter data from industry tracker IDC.
Founded by Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer, Huawei has more than 180,000 employees and has taken a number of high-profile actions in recent years to counter corruption.

In January, Ren held a vow-taking ceremony with senior managers who swore not to engage in corruption, and in 2014 an internal inspection found 116 employees in violation of its anti-corruption policies.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>",Japan manufacturing scandals haven't hurt image but have been powerful lessons: ministry official,"By Malcolm Foster and Kentaro Hamada
TOKYO (Reuters) - A string of data-tampering scandals at Japanese manufacturers has not tarnished Japan's image, though it has been a powerful reminder to avoid sacrificing quality when under cost or delivery pressure, a senior economic official said on Wednesday.
Since October, Japan has seen revelations of data tampering and compliance failures at Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711), Toray Industries Inc (T:3402), Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and Subaru Corp (T:7270).
The scandals have hit stocks of those companies and come at a time when Japanese manufacturers, long known for high-quality products, are facing intensifying competition from Asian rivals.
But the problems do not reflect systemic flaws in Japanese manufacturing, said Akihiro Tada, director-general of the manufacturing industries bureau at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Rather, they were separate problems at individual companies.
And while the problems were clearly ""unfortunate,"" he said in an interview with Reuters, ""if you look at it objectively, this only happened at a few companies.""
""This has impacted individual companies' reputations, but I don't think that Japanese manufacturers' overall brand image has been hurt,"" he said.
While the share prices of those companies have fallen, ""it's not like the entire Japanese stock market has declined,"" he said. ""I haven't seen any news that lots of orders from Japanese manufacturers have been canceled.""
Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Materials and Toray - all suppliers to global manufacturers - have admitted to product data fabrication. Nissan and Subaru have admitted to inappropriate final inspection procedures for domestic-market vehicles.
Most of these companies have used third-party investigators to compile reports on the extent and causes of the malfeasance, as well as measures to improve governance.
They have blamed a focus on profit, lax quality controls and staffing shortages, though most said product safety was never compromised.
Tada also pointed to cost and delivery pressures as possible factors. ""Quality cannot be sacrificed to delivery and cost. That's the top priority among those three elements. So that's been a good lesson for all of corporate Japan.""
These companies ""have realized to a painful degree that these kind of problems will affect their competitiveness,"" he said.
Last week, the ministry announced a series of steps aimed at preventing falsification, including a proposal to raise fines for breaking the Industrial Standards Law and encouraging manufacturers to use information technology to ensure quality control.
On Wednesday, Toray, which in November said materials-making subsidiary Toray Hybrid Cord Inc (THC) falsified quality data for eight years, in a report said, ""it was perceived within THC that so long as product safety was ensured, slight deviations from the quality standards agreed to in contracts with customers were not problematic.""
To prevent recurrence, the company said it would tweak its organizational structure and bolster its quality assurance section, appointing a general manager to oversee the division.

""Winning trust takes a long time, but it can be lost in an instant,"" Tada said. ""That's a big lesson from this.""

960,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 07:13AM ET</span>","In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbines","By Drazen Jorgic and Henning Gloystein
ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives.
GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called ""horrible"" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring. 
There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.
But so far the Pakistani plants, which began running this year, are producing power at levels well below their capacity and the problem was acute in the crucial summer months, when temperatures in the country frequently exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104°F).
Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August. 
A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.
""It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer,"" Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters. ""It is now up to  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts,"" he said.
In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said ""every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency"". On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: ""We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase.""
GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a ""meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan.""
The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year.
Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) and Hitachi (T:6501) - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia.
Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that ""resolving initial launch issues"" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority.
TOUGH YEAR
GE's shares have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and the 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs.
Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was ""challenged"" but could be turned around in one or two years.
Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed. 
GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity. 
The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing. 
The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer.
The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections.
One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said. Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant. 
To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted all the units to France for repairs.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems. ""They found the problem, they took out the part, they went back to the vendor, they re-machined them, they came back – all on dedicated transport flights,"" Abbasi said. 
TURBINE DAMAGE
But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August. 
In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said. 
At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine. 
""Both didn't work,"" said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations. 
The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment. 
""GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system,"" GE said in a statement. 
A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays and outages had cast GE in a bad light. 
""Frankly speaking, they have lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these plants,"" the official said.
In September, Pakistan awarded its most recent power contract to Siemens, after bidding by several companies, including GE.
Stephen Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York, wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors that the Pakistan problems have been resolved, they could re-emerge in other plants around the world.
""The risk is that if these issues are not remedied, GE has already 'sold' another around 30 units (around 10 plus of which are in operation), some of which are at higher output ratings,"" he wrote.
""Remedies would have to be applied up the curve, something we view as a challenge, especially as senior management tries to cut costs aggressively. Stay tuned.""
FORCED OUTAGES
Not everyone is complaining, even when performance isn't perfect.
In France, the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months ending November, according to data published by operator Electricite de France (EDF) (PA:EDF). 
Despite these unplanned outages, GE and operator EDF, with whom GE has a long-standing alliance, say they are satisfied.
""The cause of these events varies, and in certain cases a single event has been interpreted as multiple events. It would not be accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of these events were related to the gas turbine,"" GE and EDF said in a joint statement.
In a another joint statement, the two said ""the Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best"". They added: ""During the commissioning and early operations phase, we encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you'd expect with a project of this size, but we worked together to quickly resolve them.""

1MDB was required to pay IPIC about $600 million by Dec. 31, as part of a settlement agreement reached in April after 1MDB defaulted on its bonds, causing the Abu Dhabi company to ask a London court to arbitrate over a claim totaling some $6.5 billion.
1MDB had originally agreed to pay $1.2 billion in two instalments to IPIC, with the first of about $600 million due by July 31. 1MDB however missed the deadline due to the need to get ""regulatory approvals"" and made the payment in August instead.
""IPIC has now received all the funds required to be paid to IPIC by Dec. 31 under the Settlement with the Minister of Finance (Inc) Malaysia and 1Malaysia Development Berhad and the Consent Award made on 9 May 2017,"" IPIC said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
1MDB later on Wednesday said it has remitted in full to IPIC all funds required to be paid by Dec. 31.
""All funds were paid from proceeds of the on-going rationalization program,"" 1MDB said in a statement.
1MDB is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. In civil lawsuits, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. 

The Malaysian fund has denied any wrongdoing and Prime Minister Najib Razak, who founded 1MDB, has denied all allegations of corruption against him.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 06:08AM ET</span>","No Trump windfall for private prisons yet, but some bet on gains","By Sinead Carew
(Reuters) - Investors who bet on private prison operators as big winners from Donald Trump's tough line on crime and illegal immigration are looking back at a bruising year of high hopes and disappointment. Some, however, say the stocks still offer good value even though an anticipated windfall under the Trump administration so far has failed to materialize.
They say the two listed operators -  Geo Group Inc  (N:GEO) and CoreCivic Inc (N:CXW) - stand to win contracts from states struggling with prison overcrowding, such as Kansas and Oklahoma, and have plenty of room to accommodate new demand. 
Valuable properties owned by the two companies, which operate as prison real estate investment trusts (REITs), and long-term federal contracts with minimum revenue guarantees also make them attractive, they say. 
The administration's proposals to bolster the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency could help in the future though it is still unclear how much new money it will bring.
""People are focusing on ICE and ignoring the state level opportunities,"" said Jordan Hymowitz managing partner Philadelphia Financial Management in San Francisco. 
Geo and CoreCivic shares soared after Trump won the White House, partly on expectations that detention centers they run for ICE would fill up thanks to an anticipated surge in arrests along the Mexican border.
Yet the opposite happened - arrests declined for months after Trump's inauguration because fewer people attempted to cross the border and shares in CoreCivic and Geo reversed course after peaking in February and April respectively. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BUZlfe)
While detentions have been rising from month to month since hitting a year-low in May, the stocks have not yet recovered. CoreCivic now trades 37 percent below its post election high, while Geo is about 32 percent below its 2017 peak. 
Investors say lack of clarity on how much business they will get from ICE, the companies' biggest client, is holding the shares back.
""People can't figure out if immigration reform is good or bad for private contractors,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and head of research at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. Hodges sold its CoreCivic shares after the post-election rally but still owns Geo.
CoreCivic and Geo declined comment on their performance and outlook beyond their comments in earnings calls and statements.
MAIN CUSTOMER
The immigration enforcement agency, which cites its average cost per bed at $129 per day, accounted for about a quarter of CoreCivic's and Geo's revenue in the first nine months of 2017. 
Federal, state and local prisons make up most of the remaining revenue. 
ICE asked Congress for a $1.2 billion funding increase, but the latest budget proposal offered $700 million, according to Geo, and its 2018 funding remains unclear.
GEO and CoreCivic make up two-thirds of the roughly $5.3 billion per year U.S. private prison business, according to market research firm IBISWorld.
However, potential state contracts promise to boost prison companies' earnings and make them less controversial.
Both the sheer size of the U.S. prison population, by far the world's largest, and the use of privately-run prisons have been a subject of political debate. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BFI8Sz)
As a result, Barack Obama's administration laid out plans, abandoned under Trump, to phase out outsourcing, citing, among others, safety concerns.
Investors said a pending Kansas Department of Corrections proposal for CoreCivic to build a new prison which the state would manage, would address some investor concerns by making the company a landlord rather than a prison operator. If copied by other states, such approach would open new opportunities for the companies, which mostly derive revenue from running their own prisons or government facilities.
""There's a lot of noise around being a private prison operator"" said Jamie Cuellar, co-portfolio manager of the Buffalo Small Cap Fund based in Mission, Kansas.
""If people start thinking of them more like a government agency REIT than a prison operator it could be helpful to the valuation,"" he said. 
Cuellar noted that  Easterly Government Properties  (N:DEA), a REIT which leases office buildings to government agencies, trades at a multiple of 15.8 times earnings estimates. In comparison, CoreCivic's forward multiple is 10.0 and Geo's is 11.8, according to the latest data.
Thousands of vacancies at CoreCivic and Geo facilities should also be viewed as a positive, because they could lift earnings with little extra investment, investors say.
Hymowitz estimated that CoreCivic, which has around 15,000 empty beds, could boost by a fifth its funds from operations (FFO) per share if it could fill just a quarter of them. CoreCivic said in November it could add $1 to annual earnings per share (FFO) if it can open its eight idle prisons and boost inmate numbers in partially vacant facilities.
Geo said in October that filling 7,000 empty beds could add $50-$60 million to its annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a roughly 11-13 percent increase to 2018 analyst estimates. 
Buffalo Funds' Cuellar has a $45 long term price target for CoreCivic, which last traded around $22. While it would take new business to get there, Cuellar says he can afford to be patient given its steady dividend payouts.
""I don’t believe there is a lot of downside from here. Meanwhile, I get paid a 7.6 percent dividend to wait.”

LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) expects to take a writedown of about 1 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) on its annual post-tax profit as a result of the U.S. tax overhaul, the bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
The reform to the tax system signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 22 will force the British lender to reduce the value of its deferred tax assets, prompting it to take a one-off charge in its results for the 12 months to the end of December. 
It will also lead to the bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, falling by about 20 basis points, the lender said.
Since taking the helm at Barclays in December 2015, Chief Executive Jes Staley has streamlined the bank into a transatlantic lender focused on the United States and Britain. 
The restructuring has led it to exit a raft of non-core operations, such as its business in Africa and units in Asia, in a bid to simplify its structure and boost returns to shareholders.
Barclays already slumped to a 628 million pound attributable loss in the nine months to the end of September following write-offs in the wake of its exit from Africa. The 1 billion pound charge to account for the U.S. tax changes is expected to push it further into the red. 
The $1.5 trillion tax overhaul is the biggest reform of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s and will see that corporate tax rate slashed to 21 percent from 35 percent.
While Barclays said the reduction in the tax rate is expected to ""positively impact"" its future post-tax earnings in the United States, it also cautioned that the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), which was included in the legislation and designed to prevent multinational firms from abusing the tax code, could significantly offset that benefit.
""Due to the uncertain practical and technical application of many of these provisions, it is currently not possible to reliably estimate whether BEAT will apply and if so, how it would impact Barclays,"" the lender added.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 05:26AM ET</span>",World stocks rise as metals surge mitigates iPhone X woes,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher on Wednesday as a strong rally in commodities buoyed expectations for a strong year for the global economy in 2018 and helped mitigate concerns over the technology sector triggered by reports of soft iPhone X demand.
Oil and copper prices rocketed to multi-year highs, pushing the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, 0.1 percent higher. 
While oil prices were strengthened largely because of an attack on a crude pipeline in Libya, the surge in copper was particularly eye-catching as the metal is seen as a proxy for global growth.
""The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth,"" said Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader.
London copper rose to its highest in nearly three-and-a-half years on expectations of stronger demand from top consumer China in 2018. 
Asian shares climbed 0.3 percent to near a recent one-month high, though it was more of a mixed picture in European stock markets. 
While mining and oil stocks strengthened, the pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.1 percent as European tech stocks tumbled on reports that demand for Apple's iPhone X may be weaker than expected.
According to Taiwan's Economic Daily, citing unidentified sources, Apple will slash its sales forecast for its flagship phone in the current quarter to 30 million units, down from what it said was an initial plan of 50 million units.
The report, along with some recent brokerage calls on tepid iPhone X demand, made Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) sink 2.5 percent, their worst single-day percentage fall since Aug. 10.
Meanwhile, rising oil prices -- U.S. crude hit $60 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 -- boosted currencies that trade in line with commodities prices. 
The dollar eased against a basket of currencies and fell against the euro on Wednesday in thin holiday trading, while a rally in commodity prices helped push the Canadian and Australian dollars to their highest levels in two months.
SAFE-HAVEN FLOWS
Though world stocks were up on the day, there was still an undercurrent of nervousness in the market which saw some safe haven flows into high-rated euro zone government bonds, pushing their yields a touch lower. 
""Geo-political risks have notched a little higher, supporting rates markets,"" said Mizuho's head of rates Peter Chatwell, referring in particular to a renewal in tensions around North Korea. 
The United States announced sanctions on two North Korean officials behind their country's ballistic missile program on Tuesday after the U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea last week.
""The North Korean statement that U.N. sanctions are an act of war is, as tends to be the case, an exaggeration, but nevertheless the market has no choice but to price it. Some safe haven positioning is a natural reaction,"" said Chatwell.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2017 04:46AM ET</span>",South Korea prosecutors seek 12 years jail for Samsung heir Lee in corruption case,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors sought a 12-year jail term on Wednesday for Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, in a corruption case that led to the ouster of the nation's president earlier this year.
They made their demand in the Seoul High Court which is hearing an appeal by Lee against a five-year jail term handed out to him in August by a lower court in the case that has gripped the country. 
The 49-year-old billionaire heir to South Korea's Samsung Group was convicted by the lower court of bribing the country's former president Park Geun-hye. Besides Lee, who has been in detention since February, four former Samsung executives were also charged in the case. 
The lower court had ruled the bribe helped Lee strengthen his control of Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel in the country's biggest conglomerate and one of the world's top technology firms. 
""The defendants say they are concerned about the future of Samsung Group. However, what they are really concerned about is Lee's loss of control and subsequent economic losses,"" special prosecutor Park Young-soo told a packed court of about 150 people.
Lee, in a dark suit and white shirt without a tie at the appeals hearing, earlier on Wednesday denied the bribery charge and also denied recent allegations by prosecutors that he had met Park one-on-one four times, instead of the previously disclosed three times. 
The Seoul High Court is expected to rule on the appeal in late January. Whichever side loses could take the case to the Supreme Court, the final court of appeal in South Korea. 
The lower court had ruled in August that while Lee never asked for Park's help directly, the fact that a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates did help cement Lee's control over Samsung Electronics implied he was asking for the president's help to strengthen his control of the firm.
His lawyers have strongly challenged this logic since appeals hearings began in October.
""The defendants have not once tried to solve issues by colluding with political power and gaining its help. The special prosecution has severely distorted the truth, and that distortion is reflected in the jail term they sought,"" said Lee In-jae, Lee's lawyer, responding to the 12-year jail term demand. 
FALLOUT
The scandal played a big part in the downfall of former president Park, who was dismissed in March after being impeached, and the case cast a critical eye over the ties between South Korea's chaebols - big family-owned corporate groups - and its political leaders. 
Faced with investor worries of a leadership vacuum as Lee remains detained, Samsung Electronics appointed a new generation of top managers at its three main businesses including semiconductors in October.
Lee has been widely expected to follow in his father, Lee Kun-hee's, footsteps in the future. Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of the group, has been hospitalized since 2014.
Answering a prosecutor's question about his future as Samsung heir, Lee said: ""I had been privately thinking that Chairman Lee Kun-hee will be the final person to have the title of Samsung Group chairman.""

""I have often said that I want to be a businessman who is recognized for capability, not just for being someone's son, or for having a lot of shares.""

PARIS (Reuters) - European tech stocks tumbled on Wednesday as the region emerged from a two-day trading holiday and investors reacted to reports that demand for Apple's iPhone X may be weaker than expected.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) slipped by 0.1 percent, reversing earlier gains as a downturn in the high-performing tech sector outweighed strong mining and oil stocks.
Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) also fell 0.1 percent, with the index slightly down on the month and set for its second straight month of losses.
Tech stocks (SX8P) fell 1 percent, the worst-performing sector as the market followed a downturn in Asian iPhone suppliers after brokers cut forecasts for iPhone X shipments, saying sales of the new model may undershoot expectations.
Austria Microsystems (S:AMS), the best-performing European tech stock this year, sank 10 percent while fellow iPhone supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) dropped 5.5 percent, the biggest falls on the STOXX.
Chipmakers Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and STMicro (PA:STM) fell 1.5 and 2.3 percent respectively to the bottom of the German and French benchmarks. Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) and BE Semiconductor (AS:BESI) also featured among top European fallers.
Despite recent weakness, tech stocks have retained a significant lead over all other sector indexes, up by about 21 percent this year. 
Retail stocks, meanwhile, were set to bring up the rear as the worst-performing, down 3 percent since January.
Strength in commodities helped to cap losses across the major benchmarks as liquidity remained thin with many investors still on holiday.
Mining stocks rose after metals prices hit 3-1/2 year highs thanks to a strong outlook for growth in China.
 Glencore  (L:GLEN),  Randgold Resources  (L:RRS) and  Anglo American  (L:AAL) contributed the most to index gains. 
Oil majors also provided support, with  Total  (PA:TOTF) up 0.6 percent and Shell (L:RDSa) rising 0.8 percent as crude prices held near 2015 highs.
German carmakers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) gained 0.3 to 0.6 percent after they said late on Friday that the U.S. tax reform would boost 2017 profits to the tune of 1.55 billion euros ($1.84 billion) and 1.7 billion euros respectively.
""As only net profit is benefiting and there will be no positive impact on cash flow, we see only a minor impact on valuation of both companies,"" DZ Bank equity strategists wrote in a note.
Merger activity continued to spur big stock moves, with British workspace company IWG (L:IWG) leaping by 28 percent after it confirmed a bid approach from Canadian private equity firm Onex and Brookfield Asset Management.

""Deutsche Bank is a core, high-prestige investment for HNA,"" Alexander Schuetz, said in an interview published in Wednesday's Handelsblatt.
Schuetz sought to dismiss any lingering speculation that HNA would sell its stake in the German lender, which is just under 10 percent and valued at around 3.3 billion euros ($3.9 billion).
""We want to show that this is totally wrong,"" he was quoted as saying.
HNA's $50 billion worth of deal-making over the past two years has sparked intense scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.
In the interview, Schuetz pointed to a new financing structure with derivatives -- with a three-year maturity - that insure against a drop in the bank's share price. 
""This shows that HNA is focused on the long-term and has no interest in a sale,"" Schuetz said.
Pressure on HNA's finances has risen after the Chinese government told major banks in June to review their credit exposure to HNA and a handful of other non-state companies.
However, an HNA executive told Reuters this month that the group was not facing a liquidity crisis and characterized high profile investments in Deutsche and hotels group Hilton (N:HLT) 
as successful.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 09:15PM ET</span>",Apple faces lawsuits after saying it slows down aging iPhones,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) defrauded iPhone users by slowing devices without warning to compensate for poor battery performance, according to eight lawsuits filed in various federal courts in the week since the company opened up about the year-old software change.
The tweak may have led iPhone owners to misguided attempts to resolve issues over the last year, the lawsuits contend. 
All the lawsuits - filed in U.S. District Courts in California, New York and Illinois - seek class-action to represent potentially millions of iPhone owners nationwide.
A similar case was lodged in an Israeli court on Monday, the newspaper Haaretz reported.
Apple did not respond to an email seeking comment on the filings.
The company acknowledged last week for the first time in detail that operating system updates released since ""last year"" for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE and iPhone 7 included a feature ""to smooth out"" power supply from batteries that are cold, old or low on charge. 
Phones without the adjustment would shut down abruptly because of a precaution designed to prevent components from getting fried, Apple said.
The disclosure followed a Dec. 18 analysis by Primate Labs, which develops an iPhone performance measuring app, that identified blips in processing speed and concluded that a software change had to be behind them.
One of the lawsuits, filed Thursday in San Francisco, said that ""the batteries' inability to handle the demand created by processor speeds"" without the software patch was a defect.
""Rather than curing the battery defect by providing a free battery replacement for all affected iPhones, Apple sought to mask the battery defect,"" according to the complaint.
The plaintiff in that case is represented by attorney Jeffrey Fazio, who represented plaintiffs in a $53-million settlement with Apple in 2013 over its handling of iPhone warranty claims.
The problem now seen is that users over the last year could have blamed an aging computer processor for app crashes and sluggish performance - and chose to buy a new phone - when the true cause may have been a weak battery that could have been replaced for a fraction of the cost, some of the lawsuits state.
""If it turns out that consumers would have replaced their battery instead of buying new iPhones had they known the true nature of Apple's upgrades, you might start to have a better case for some sort of misrepresentation or fraud,"" said Rory Van Loo, a Boston University professor specializing in consumer technology law.
But Chris Hoofnagle, faculty director for the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, said in an email that Apple may not have done wrong.
""We still haven't come to consumer protection norms"" around aging products, Hoofnagle said. Pointing to a device with a security flaw as an example, he said, ""the ethical approach could include degrading or even disabling functionality.""

The lawsuits seek unspecified damages in addition to, in some cases, reimbursement. A couple of the complaints seek court orders barring Apple from throttling iPhone computer speeds or requiring notification in future instances.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 05:50PM ET</span>",Former Baha Mar owner sues Chinese contractor over 'massive fraud',"By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - The original owner of the Baha Mar Resort, BML Properties Ltd, has filed a $2.25 billion lawsuit alleging a ""massive fraud"" by the Chinese contractor of the luxury hotel and casino project in Nassau, the Bahamas, that opened its doors in April after years of delays.
The 259-page complaint, filed in state court in Manhattan on Tuesday, accuses Chinese state-backed contractor China Construction America (CCA) of running a self-enrichment scheme that led to the failure of the $3.5 billion mega-resort project in 2015. 
CCA, a subsidiary of Shanghai-listed China State Construction Engineering Corp Ltd (SS:601668), did not return requests for comment.
The largest-ever Caribbean resort project, meant to be an economic driver for the island, struggled under a series of construction delays and funding squabbles that led to finger-pointing between the local developer Baja Mar Ltd, CCA and China's export finance bank - the main lender on the project - as to who was to blame for the delays.
Baja Mar Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of BML Properties, declared bankruptcy in 2015 and the resort was acquired by Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises in 2016. 
According to the complaint, CCA submitted hundreds of millions of dollars in sham bills to BML while understaffing the project and using it to train inexperienced workers for other construction projects in the region. 
""The scheme was based on CCA's efforts to falsely create the appearance that it was working toward an on time and on budget opening in December 2014 while knowingly and fraudulently concealing its real intent not to construct the Project on time and on budget and in the process extort more money than it earned and was due,"" the lawsuit said. 
As a result, it said BML Properties lost its entire $845 million equity investment in the project, as well as its right to the future benefits of running a world-class resort.

BML Properties is led by Bahamas businessman Sarkis Izmirlian, son of Armenian billionaire Dikran Izmirlian.

Analysts lowered iPhone X shipment projections for the first quarter of next year, citing signs of lackluster demand at the end of the holiday shopping season, and the company’s shares fell Tuesday along with those of some suppliers.
Sinolink Securities Co. analyst Zhang Bin said in a report Monday that handset shipments in the period may be as low as 35 million, or 10 million less than he previously estimated. ""After the first wave of demand has been fulfilled, the market now worries that the high price of the iPhone X may weaken demand in the first quarter,"" Zhang wrote.
JL Warren Capital LLC said shipments will drop to 25 million units in the first quarter of 2018 from 30 million units in the fourth quarter, citing reduced orders at some Apple suppliers. The drop reflects “weak demand because of the iPhone X’s high price point and a lack of interesting innovations,” the New York-based research firm said in note to clients Friday.
""Bad news here is that highly publicized and promoted X did not boost the global demand for iPhone X,"" according to the note.
The shares fell 2.7 percent to $170.30 in early trading in New York Tuesday. U.S.-based suppliers like Lumentum Holdings Inc., Cirrus Logic Inc. and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd. also tumbled.
Apple has been counting on a redesigned 10th anniversary iPhone to boost shipments as its market value advances toward $1 trillion. The Cupertino, California-based company is facing new challenges from Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., which is quickly recovering from the Galaxy Note 7’s recall after fires. In the meantime, Chinese brands such as Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi are also luring away potential customers in China and other emerging markets such as India.
Taiwan Report
Apple is said to have trimmed its first-quarter sales forecast to 30 million units from 50 million, Taiwanese newspaper Economic Daily News reported, citing unidentified supply chain officials. It also said Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s main iPhone X manufacturing hub in Zhengzhou, China, stopped recruiting workers. The company also known as Foxconn is the sole iPhone X assembler, and also makes the handsets in Shenzhen and Chengdu.
Shares of Asian suppliers, such as Lens Technology Co., Shenzhen Desay Battery Technology Co. and Largan Precision Co. fell Monday on the report. Lens recovered some of the losses on Tuesday, while Largan continued to slide. Shenzhen Desay was little changed.
Hon Hai shares slid for a second day Tuesday, on track for the lowest close since March. Touch screen maker General Interface Solution Holding Ltd. plunged 8.4 percent Tuesday after slipping slightly Monday.
An Apple representative declined to comment on production arrangements. Foxconn said in an emailed statement that company policy prevents it from commenting on such matters.
Apple received a rare downgrade last week from Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal, who said iPhone X sales as well as other positive factors are already baked into the stock price. He lowered his rating to ""neutral"" from ""buy.""
The stock has soared 51 percent this year, bringing its market value to almost $900 billion.
Supply, Demand
Apple’s efforts to increase iPhone X production in recent months have made supply and demand fairly balanced at the moment, said Jia Mo, an analyst at Canalys in Shanghai.
""The market will still hold high expectations for Apple’s 2018 products if Apple introduces more devices with iPhone X’s key features to cover a wider price range,"" he said.
Customers seem to be opting for cheaper models of the iPhone, according to Cowen & Co., which says that suggests Apple failed to cram enough new technology into the iPhone X to justify a $999 price tag.
New features such as facial recognition and virtual reality herald Apple’s vision for future smartphones, but other issues such as the lack of augmented-reality apps have cooled buyer buyer interest in those technologies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Healthcare, technology and Japanese small-cap stocks look poised to outperform the broader market in the year ahead, according to some of the best performing U.S.-based stock fund managers of 2017.
Small-cap stocks should be among the largest winners of the newly-signed Republican-led tax law, which slashed corporate taxes at home and made it cheaper for companies to bring back their profits from overseas. Yet small-cap fund managers from Loomis Sayles, Federated Investors and Wasatch Advisors whose funds are up 30 percent or more for the year say that a bigger factor in the year ahead will be continued global growth. 
“The tax bill is going to make some balance sheets look better on the margin, but we think the larger factor is that the recovery is still going on internationally,” said Kenneth Korngiebel, a co-portfolio manager of the $335-million Wasatch Micro Cap fund, which is up 36.1 percent year-to-date. That performance makes it the 13th best small-cap fund of the year, according to Lipper data, which tracks about 1,800 small-cap funds. 
As a result, Korngiebel is shifting more of his portfolio into international stocks, which often trade at lower valuations than their U.S. counterparts and have better growth characteristics, he said. 
Korngiebel is adding to stocks like Japanese outsourcing company UT Group Co Ltd, whose shares are up 243 percent for the year to date, and which he expects to grow its revenue by more than 30 percent in the year ahead. He is also adding to his position in U.S.-based Tabula Rasa Healthcare Inc, which helps doctors screen for potential drug interactions. Shares of the company are up 97 percent in 2017. 
""The percentage of the population who take five or more medication is going up and adverse drug events are expensive and can lead to loss of life. What we see here is opportunity to take advantage of an under-covered company that is unique and meets a large need,"" he said. 
Overall, companies in the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 index pay a median effective tax rate of 31.9 percent, while the larger, multinational companies in the S&P 500 pay a median effective tax rate of 28 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. The median for the 30 mega-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 23.8 percent. 
Some of the benefits of the tax cut are already reflected in stock prices. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF, which tracks the benchmark Russell 2000 index of small-cap shares, is up 14 percent for the year to date, with about half of that gain coming over the last three months as Republicans rolled out their tax plan.
John Slavik, a co-portfolio manager of the $18-million Loomis Sayles Small/Mid Cap Growth fund, the 16th best performing small-cap fund this year, said that industrial machinery companies such as Gardner Denver Holdings Inc should benefit if corporations reinvest part of their tax windfalls into improving their factories. 
The fund's largest position is in supply chain company XPO Logistics Inc, which Slavik expects to gain from both corporate capital reinvestment and global economic growth. Shares of the company are up 78 percent for the year, and now trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 65.9, but Slavik said that he expects its revenues and cash flow to accelerate as the global manufacturing sector continues to expand. 
""The valuation of the stock has been more challenging but we still thinks it works into the future,"" he said. 
He has also been selling his position in clear-braces maker Align Technology Inc, whose shares are up 135 percent this year and now trade at a market value of more than $18 billion, making it too large for his fund. 
""This is a company that has done very well for us but we are looking to start to redeploy that cash elsewhere,"" he said. 
Stephen DeNichilo, a portfolio manager of the $872 million Federated Kaufmann Small Cap fund, the 9th best small-cap fund this year, said that fund holdings such as plastics molding manufacturer Milacron Holdings Corp will benefit from a pickup in capital spending because its products help improve a factory's efficiency. “This kind of investment pays for itself very quickly,” he said.
Yet he has a larger position overall in biotech companies, which have greater growth potential, he said. He has been adding to his position in Nektar Therapeutics, which is developing in abuse-proof opioid medication, and gene-therapy drug maker Spark Therapeutics Inc. 
He also added a position in retailer Floor & Decor Holdings Inc shortly after its initial public offering in April as a play on consumer spending on home renovation. Shares of the company, which makes high-end floor tiles, are up 37.8 percent for the year.

""This a traditional brick and mortar retailer that has built a better mouse trap,"" he said.

The blue-chip Dow futures lost 34 points, or 0.14% by 7:04AM ET (12:04GMT), the S&P 500 futures dropped 1 point, or 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures fell 26 points, or 0.40%
Although the U.S. stock market will be up and running on Tuesday, trade is expected to be thin with European bourses closed for Boxing Day and many market participants having closed their books for the holiday season until 2018 rolls around next week.
Amid a few economic reports set for release on Tuesday, the main focus will be on the Conference Board’s consumer confidence for December out at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT).
In lesser reports, those traders not enjoying the holidays will also digest the S&P/Case-Shiller housing price index for October, and December manufacturing indices from the Richmond and Dallas Fed.
Ahead of the releases, the dollar held steady against other major currencies on Tuesday, wavering around the unchanged mark. At 7:04AM ET (12:04GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, last inched up 0.09% at 92.96.
In company news, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were off a little more than 2% in pre-market trade on Tuesday after a report from Taiwan's Economic Daily suggested that the tech firm will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X to 30 million units from an initial 50 million. The paper cited unidentified sources.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google was also reported to be planning to launch brick-and-mortar stores in India to boost sales of its Pixel smartphones.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices headed slightly lower on Tuesday despite news that U.S. shale production had taken a pause. According to data released later Friday from Baker Hughes, the number of U.S. rigs targeting oil remained unchanged at 747 a week earlier.
Still, concerns remain that U.S. crude will continue to boom in 2018, undercutting OPEC’s push to drain a global supply glut with output curbs.
Adding additional downward pressure to crude prices, the North Sea Forties pipeline, which plays an important role in the global oil market, is being tested following repairs and full flows should resume in early January, its operator Ineos said on Monday. The halt of the line earlier this month sent prices surging.
U.S. crude futures fell 0.10% to $58.41 by 7:05AM ET (12:05GMT), while Brent oil traded down 0.22% to $64.59."

1013,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 06:02AM ET</span>",China halts oil product exports to North Korea in November as sanctions bite,"By Ryan Woo and Muyu Xu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, Chinese customs data showed, apparently going above and beyond sanctions imposed earlier this year by the United Nations in a bid to limit petroleum shipments to the isolated country. 
Tensions have flared anew over North Korea's ongoing nuclear and missile programmes, pursued in defiance of years of U.N. resolutions. Last week, the U.N. Security Council imposed new caps on trade with North Korea, including limiting oil product shipments to just 500,000 barrels a year. 
Beijing also imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea in November, the second full month of the latest trade sanctions imposed by U.N. 
China, the main source of North Korea's fuel, did not export any gasoline, jet fuel, diesel or fuel oil to its isolated neighbour last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday. 
November was the second straight month China exported no diesel or gasoline to North Korea. The last time China's jet fuel shipments to Pyongyang were at zero was in February 2015. 
""This is a natural outcome of the tightening of the various sanctions against North Korea,"" said Cai Jian, an expert on North Korea at Fudan University in Shanghai. 
The tightening ""reflects China's stance"", he said. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she didn't know any details about the oil products export situation.
""As a principle, China has consistently fully, correctly, conscientiously and strictly enforced relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea. We have already established a set of effective operating mechanisms and methods,"" she said at a regular briefing on Tuesday, without elaborating.
Since June, state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] has suspended sales of gasoline and diesel to North Korea, concerned that it would not get paid for its goods, Reuters previously reported. 
Beijing's move to turn off the taps completely is rare. 
In March 2003, China suspended oil supplies to North Korea for three days after Pyongyang fired a missile into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. 
It is unknown if China still sells crude oil to Pyongyang. Beijing has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years. 
Industry sources say China still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, of crude a year to North Korea via an aging pipeline. That is a little more than 10,000 barrels a day, and worth about $200 million a year at current prices. 
North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia.
TOTAL TRADE LESS THAN $400 MILLION
Chinese exports of corn to North Korean in November also slumped, down 82 percent from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January. Exports of rice plunged 64 percent to 672 tonnes, the lowest since March. 
Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February. In November, China's trade with North Korea totalled $388 million, one of the lowest monthly volumes this year. 
China has renewed its call on all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, urging the use of peaceful means to resolve issues. 
But tensions flared again after North Korea on Nov. 29 said it had tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. 
Meanwhile Chinese exports of liquefied petroleum gas to North Korea, used for cooking, rose 58 percent in November from a year earlier to 99 tonnes. Exports of ethanol, which can be turned into a biofuel, gained 82 percent to 3,428 cubic metres.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's  Hyundai Heavy Industries  Group plans to list its refining arm Hyundai Oilbank in an IPO in 2018 and raise about $1.2 billion via a share issue by shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries (KS:009540), in a move to bolster its finances.
Hyundai Heavy Industries, the flagship company of South Korea's ninth-largest conglomerate, said on Tuesday that Hyundai Robotics (KS:267250), the group's holding company, has decided to list refining subsidiary Hyundai Oilbank [INPTVH.UL] in an initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2018. 
The shipbuilder also said it will issue rights shares worth about 1.3 trillion won ($1.21 billion). The two moves are part of the conglomerate's efforts to improve affiliates' financial soundness after switching to a holding company structure earlier this year, it said.
Hyundai Oilbank, South Korea's smallest refiner by capacity, is 91.1 percent owned by Hyundai Robotics. 
""Starting with Hyundai Oilbank's initial public offering, we will continue to strengthen the transparency of our ownership structure,"" a Hyundai Heavy Industries Group official said, according to a statement by the shipbuilder.
Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world's second-largest shipbuilder by order book, said the rights issue is expected to be completed by March 2018 and the sum raised will be used to improve its financial structure and for research & development.
The IPO and the rights issue will prepare the group for a shipbuilding industry recovery expected to start in 2019, it said. 
A Hyundai Heavy spokesman said the rights issue is part of the shipbuilder's previously announced plan to improve financial soundness. That plan began in 2015 when major South Korean shipbuilders reported losses as low oil prices drove an industry downturn, and cost overruns and delays in the construction of complex offshore facilities weighed.

(Reuters) - British sportscar maker Aston Martin is recalling around 5,500 vehicles in the United States due to problems with powertrains and battery cables, according to documents posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) website.
The recalls are expected to begin on Feb. 1, 2018, and come as the owners of the carmaker made famous by fictional spy James Bond prepare for a stock market listing or sale of the company.
The documents on the NHTSA website say Aston Martin is recalling 3,493 DB9, DBS, Rapide, Virage and Vanquish models that were made between 2009 and 2016 due to problems that can cause the transmission park pawl to not engage, which could make the vehicle roll and increase the risk of a crash.
The Gaydon, England-based company is also recalling 1,953 DB9 and DBS vehicles manufactured between 2005 and 2009 because their battery supply cables can be damaged when the driver seat is in the full rearward location, which could ultimately increase the risk of a fire, the documents said.

A spokesperson for the carmaker was not immediately available for comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) is keen to raise its stake to a majority in Indonesian lender BTPN if authorities permit, the Japanese bank's CEO said, as it aims to roll out full-scale banking operations in emerging Asia markets.
""Conditional upon regulatory approval, we would like to raise our stake and hold a majority in the future,"" Takeshi Kunibe told Reuters in an interview.
Japan's second-largest bank by market capitalization spent a total of about 150 billion yen ($1.32 billion) in 2013 and 2014 to buy 40 percent of mid-sized lender PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk (BTPN). 
Indonesian laws restrict share ownership in the country's banks by a single entity to 40 percent. However, approvals for a majority stake may be granted on a case-by-case basis.
Kunibe declined to specify if his bank is talking to Indonesian authorities about any planned stake increase in BTPN, and to give any other details, saying he could not discuss the matter since BTPN is a listed company. It was not immediately clear whether Indonesian authorities would view any such proposal from SMFG favorably or not. 
Japanese and other Asian banks are increasingly targeting a presence in Indonesia in the hopes of tapping an emerging middle class in Southeast Asia's largest economy with population of over 250 million.
South Korean Shinhan Bank acquired a majority stake in Bank Metro Ekspress in 2015, while China Construction Bank entered the Indonesian market by acquiring Bank Windu in 2016.
Japan's largest lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is interested in buying a stake in Bank Danamon Indonesia, Indonesia's financial services authority (OJK) confirmed in November. [nS9N1EW01N]
Singapore's DBS Group Holdings had sought to buy a controlling stake in Danamon in 2013, but dropped the bid after Indonesia changed laws to restrict single ownership in banks to 40 percent.
However, Indonesia can relax these curbs on special grounds, including if the investing bank is financially strong. [nL3N1NF1CU]
Kunibe, who became chief of SMFG in April, said his bank aims to have full-service banks in Asia outside its home market.
""We have already been doing wholesale business in many countries and we want to build retail business where the middle class population is expected to grow,"" he said.
The bank has been looking for opportunities to acquire commercial banks in Asia outside Japan, Kunibe said but added his focus for now is to grow the business in Indonesia and Vietnam, where it owns a 15 percent stake in Eximbank.
SMFG and rival banks face persistently low interest rates at home and stricter capital rules globally, adding pressure on them to seek growth drivers. 
Kunibe said his bank is now studying newly finalised global capital rules to see how much it can pay back to shareholders and how much it can spend on growth. He said he is likely to discuss its capital policy, including shareholder returns, when the bank announces full-year results in May. [nF9N1M801L] 
BTPN, which provides loans to pensioners and micro finance to small business owners, had a net profit of 1.367 trillion rupiah ($100.85 million) for Jan-Sept on assets of 93.788 trillion rupiah.

The aim was to ""ensure the safety of China's assets, make our state enterprises strong and excellent, and cultivate world-class enterprises that are globally competitive"", it said.
China's wide-ranging crackdown on corruption has largely focused on the domestic operations of its state-owned enterprises, rather than their overseas activities.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>","VW may post excellent 2017 results, CEO tells Welt am Sonntag","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will report excellent group results this year, its chief executive said, helped by expected record vehicle sales and by spending cuts.
The carmaker's popularity with motorists appears to have weathered the storm following the emissions scandal of September 2015, which has cost Volkswagen (VW) billions of euros in fines and penalties.
""It will certainly be quite outstanding in operational terms,"" VW group CEO Matthias Mueller told Germany's weekly Welt am Sonntag when asked to sum up the 2017 business year. VW is due to publish detailed 2017 results on March 13.
Last month, the CEO predicted that group deliveries would exceed the 2016 record of 10.3 million vehicles.
Cost cuts at the core passenger-cars division have caused the world's largest automaker to raise its profit target for the year, and it has since also upgraded its mid-term profit and sales guidance.
On the other hand, Mueller said proposals by the European Commission for progressive cuts in carmakers' average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2025 and 2030 will ""cause us real pain.""
Wolfsburg-based VW more than two years ago admitted to cheating in diesel emissions tests in the United States. It has set aside about 25 billion euros ($30 billion) to cover related fines and vehicle repairs and faces thousands of lawsuits worldwide.
Mueller also criticized the prolonged political deadlock in Germany, which has no new government as Chancellor Angela Merkel continues to search for a coalition partner three months after federal elections.

""This is taking too long,"" the CEO said in the interview published on Sunday. ""We must become capable of acting again, for this purpose sometimes also unpopular decisions are necessary.""

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2017 12:08AM ET</span>",An investor's best friend: China's booming pet market sparks deals,"By Anita Li and Adam Jourdan
PINGYANG, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Li Mingjie is a pet industry investor's dream. The 23-year-old e-commerce worker spares little expense to make his pooch happy. 
""I'll happily splash out on my dog,"" Li told Reuters as he walked his brown poodle Coco in Pingyang, a town on China's east coast. ""She is like a child to me."" He is far from alone in China these days. 
The growth in the middle class, a massive move to urbanization and other demographic changes - such as growing numbers of elderly, and people getting married and having children later than before - have been turning this into not just a pet-owning society but also one that is prepared to lavish money on them. 
Chinese shoppers are set to spend 46.3 billion yuan ($7 billion) on their pets by 2022, up from 17.5 billion yuan this year as the market grows at around an annual 20 percent, according to estimates from Euromonitor. The U.S. market may be much bigger with an estimated $44.4 billion in sales this year but it is only growing around 2 percent a year.
The surge in Chinese demand is not only great news for global pet food behemoths such as Mars Inc and Nestle SA (S:NESN), but also rapidly growing Chinese pet food and product companies, as well as entrepreneurs setting up everything from dog salons for grooming to fancy pet hotels.
It is an amazing shift in a country where owning pets was once banned for being too much of a bourgeois pursuit under revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and where - despite protests - there is still an annual dog-meat festival in the southern Chinese town of Yulin.
""There is huge growth potential in the Chinese market,"" said Liu Yonghao, the chairman of Chinese company New Hope Group [NWHOP.UL] at a recent event in Beijing, noting that younger people especially were developing closer bonds with their pets.
""They are willing to spend lots of money on the pets because they have become like part of the family,"" he said. 
New Hope joined a consortium, including Singapore's state-owned fund Temasek and private equity firm Hosen Capital that just closed a $1 billion deal to acquire Australian pet food maker Real Pet Food Co, with the aim of bringing the firm’s brands to China.
The growing popularity of pets is turning China into a magnet for local and global firms. 
Thomas Kwan, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based fund manager Harvest Global, said China’s pet market would be one of his personal picks for 2018 as consumers looked to shift up to premium products.
The questions pet owners are asking now: ""Can you buy them healthy foods? Can you give them a good lifestyle?"" he said. 
BONE-SHAPED CENTER
Pingyang, where Li lives with his poodle, has big ambitions in China's pet economy. 
The county, which is near the wealthy city of Wenzhou and has a population of almost one million, is among a slew of places responding to Beijing's call to create 1,000 ""specialty towns"" by 2020 in industries from cloud computing to chocolate. In Pingyang's case the theme is pets.
It has a dog bone-shaped visitor center and pet factories, while locals said there were plans for pet-themed hotels and a retail hub. On a recent visit, though, it was clear the concept has a way to go. The visitor center was shut and locals admitted the ‘pet town’ had yet to fully catch on. 
Nationally though, there is no doubt that the pet economy is thriving – helped by demographic shifts.
""Chinese society is aging, we're experiencing declining birth rates, we have empty nesters and the youngsters from those empty nests,"" said Zhang Tianli, co-founder of Hosen Capital, adding pets were helping people find ""spiritual sustenance"".
The pet products boom has stoked imports and boosted local business. 
Among the Chinese companies that are now challenging the global giants, in China at least, are Shanghai Bridge Petcare, Sunsun Group and Navarch.  Yantai China Pet Foods  (SZ:002891) has seen its stock climb close to 60 percent since it listed in Shenzhen in August. 
Smaller entrepreneurs abound too. They include DogWhere.com, which offers pet holidays and runs a boutique pet hotel in Beijing with all sorts of amenities for the pets - including a swimming pool, pet-sized bedrooms and a cinema. Owners can spend thousands of dollars per stay. 
""We once looked after a dog in our hotel for 47 nights, at a total costs of 17,000 yuan ($2,585),"" said the platform's marketing manager Wang Chao.
Xiao Xudong in Beijing runs a popular grooming service for ""Westies"" - West Highland White Terriers - and says his increasingly youthful clientele fly in from regions as remote as far-western Xinjiang and the southwestern Yunnan province. 
""Young people hold a different consumption view to the older generations,"" said Xiao, 45. ""They think a lot about how their pets are groomed and are willing to splash out on them.” 
PET BATHING 
Despite the growth, Chinese pet ownership is still just getting started. Some pets are mistreated and there is a lack of know-how about vaccinations and sterilization. Strict rules about pet food imports also stoke a gray market trade.
Earlier this month, police arrested gang members who were selling poisoned darts used to kill dogs that were then sold to restaurants, the official Xinhua news reported, opening the debate once more about the practice of eating dog meat. 
Back in Pingyang's state-sanctioned pet town, the owner of one pet shop said the shift towards pet ownership was nonetheless stark. 
""Ten years ago this place was basically farmland and people were eating dogs, now they don't eat them as much and have started to see them as pets,"" he said. 
In the shop, Wang Jing, 26, was getting her two dogs - Can Can and Niu Niu - their regular bath. She said she spent around 2,000 yuan a month on them, mostly on food, but that it was all worth it when she arrived home each day. 

""Otherwise when you come back there's nobody there,"" she said. ""But if you have a dog then it jumps on you happily as soon as you open the door.""

Vice Chief Executive Officer Shane Smith and co-founder Suroosh Alvi released a statement after the New York Times published a story outlining four settlements by the company involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees. The newspaper also reported that more than two dozen women had experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct at the company.
In the emailed statement sent to Reuters addressing Vice staff, Smith and Alvi said three employees had been fired for ""unacceptable behavior."" Smith and Alvi also laid out steps the company is taking to improve the work atmosphere for women, including hiring a new human resources chief and committing to equal pay for men and women by the end of 2018.
""From the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive,"" they said.
In apologizing for allowing the ""inappropriate behavior"" to permeate the company, Smith and Alvi said past dysfunction and mismanagement were allowed to ""flourish unchecked."" They added that they wanted to express ""extreme regret for our role in perpetuating sexism in the media industry and society in general.""
Neither Smith nor Alvi were accused of misconduct in the New York Times story. A spokesman for Vice did not respond to a request for further comment on the story.
Vice, which started as a Montreal punk magazine in 1994, attracted top investors in recent years as the multimedia company evolved into a news and entertainment platform that catered to Millennials. 
The Walt Disney Co owns an 18 percent stake. Private equity firm TPG in June invested $450 million in Vice, valuing Vice at about $5.7 billion. Representatives for both Disney and TPG could not immediately be reached for comment about Vice's apology.

Other changes outlined Saturday by Vice include the formation of a diversity board that includes feminist icon Gloria Steinem, clarified sexual harassment policies, and expanded maternity and paternity leaves.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 03:50PM ET</span>",Kazakhstan says it may appeal ruling over $22.6 billion frozen assets,"ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's government and central bank may appeal a judgment by a British court in an effort to regain access to $22.6 billion (16.91 billion pounds) in National Fund assets frozen by Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), the Kazakh Justice Ministry said on Saturday.
In a rare move related to a long-standing legal dispute between Kazakhstan and a Moldovan businessman, BNY Mellon froze the assets in October. Kazakhstan hoped that a court in London would force the bank to lift the freeze, but the court dismissed the claim on Thursday.
""Both the National (central) Bank and the Republic of Kazakhstan are now considering appealing this court judgment,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati, his son Gabriel and their companies are investors in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry. They say they have been subjected to harassment from the state aimed at forcing them to sell their investments cheaply.
Kazakhstan denies the allegations, but Anatolie and Gabriel Stati and two of their companies – Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd., have won an international arbitration award of around $500 million against the government.
Kazakhstan has refused to pay, accusing Stati of using fraudulent means to secure a favorable arbitration ruling and filing lawsuits against him.
The Justice Ministry said BNY Mellon, which acts as one of the custodians of the National Fund, initially refused to freeze its assets in response to rulings by Dutch and Belgian courts.
But on Oct. 30 ""BNY Mellon suddenly changed its position"" and agreed to freeze the assets, the ministry said, adding that it would seek from Stati compensation of all losses including those related to the freeze.
""In any case, the risks to the Republic of Kazakhstan are limited by the arbitration award - $497,658,101 plus interest ... and half of Stati's legal fees,"" it said.
Kazakhstan's rainy-day National Fund, worth $57 billion, is replenished by revenue from the oil and gas industry, and used to partly finance the budget deficit.

While the former Soviet republic is unlikely to find itself in urgent need of the frozen money soon, the freeze may limit its ability to manage a large part of the fund's portfolio, which is mostly invested in high-grade bonds.

(Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group (LON:RBS) Plc will pay $125 million to resolve claims that it made misrepresentations while selling mortgage-backed securities to two large California pension funds, the state's attorney general has announced.
The settlement announced on Friday by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra was the latest by RBS aimed at resolving claims stemming from its sale of mortgage-backed securities, which were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis.
Becerra's office said those securities were typically backed by thousands of mortgage loans of varying quality in which the buyer relied on the assurance that those mortgages were carefully screened and were not overly risky.
Becerra's office also said its investigations found that RBS failed to accurately disclose to investors the true traits of many of the thousands of mortgages underlying the securities.
The probe also found that those misrepresentations led to millions of dollars in losses to the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, Becerra's office said.
""RBS decided to mislead California's pension funds in order to line its own pockets - plain and simple,"" Becerra said in a statement.
RBS Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan in a statement on Saturday said the bank was pleased to have reached the settlement, which related to issues with mortgage-backed securities in 2004 to 2008.
""We have been very clear that putting our remaining legacy issues behind us is a key part of our strategy,"" he said.
The settlement comes as RBS continues to seek to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into its sales of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis.
In July, RBS agreed to pay $5.5 billion to resolve a lawsuit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming that it misled the U.S. mortgage giants into buying mortgage-backed securities.

In September 2016, the U.S. National Credit Union Administration announced that RBS had agreed to pay $1.1 billion to resolve claims over mortgage-backed securities it sold to credit unions that later failed.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 09:57AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ArcelorMittal tells Ilva it wants to change buying contract,"By Massimiliano Di Giorgio and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - Steelmaker ArcelorMittal has told commissioners running Italy's Ilva plant that it wants changes made to the contract in which it agreed to buy the company in order to protect it from legal challenges in Italy.
ArcelorMittal, the world's top steelmaker, reached a 1.8-billion-euro ($2.1 billion) deal to buy Ilva in June but the purchase has since stalled due to legal challenges and an EU anti-trust investigation.
In the latest twist, the commissioners in charge of Ilva have written to Italy's industry ministry saying ArcelorMittal has told them it now wants the purchase contract changed to safeguard it in case the legal challenges are successful.
ArcelorMittal has asked for ""modifications and additions"" allowing for the deal to be suspended or dissolved if a court in southern Italy upholds the challenges, according to the commissioners' letter, dated Dec. 21, which Reuters has seen.
""We are assessing, with our consultants, whether these requests are compatible with the rules in force,"" the letter says, adding that in any case the commissioners will take no steps without first informing the government.
ArcelorMittal declined to comment to Reuters.
EU antitrust authorities in November upgraded their own investigation into the company's proposed takeover of Ilva, fearing it will lead to steel price hikes. European steel prices are up some 85 percent since Jan. 1, 2016.
A few weeks after the anti-trust filing, the Puglia and Taranto local authorities filed an appeal against the Italian government's approval of ArcelorMittal's environmental plan for Ilva. They said the plan did not do enough to safeguard the environment and public health.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni wrote to the governor of Puglia and mayor of Taranto on Friday, urging them to drop the lawsuits. 
Similar appeals had previously been made by Industry Minister Carlo Calendar, warning the challenges could scupper the deal with ArcelorMittal. Puglia's governor Michele Emilio has so far refused to budge. 
Ilva, based in the city of Taranto in Italy's southern heel, is Europe's largest steel plant. It has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime for years. 

In 2012, Italian authorities ruled emissions from the plant had caused deaths, tumors and respiratory diseases. About half the plant's annual 11 million-tonne capacity was eventually mothballed.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2017 06:50AM ET</span>","Boeing seen eyeing broad Embraer deal, but no firm proposal made","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is eyeing a broad partnership with Embraer (SA:EMBR3) reaching beyond commercial aircraft to defense and global services, but its shape hinges on talks with the Brazilian government.
    The U.S. aerospace group has yet to make a formal offer and its final structure would be driven by talks that are expected to resume in coming weeks - but sources say the aim is to go well beyond traditional joint ventures or an equity infusion. 
    ""A broader combination would be preferred but Boeing is sensitive to concerns the government may have about issues like defense. If those can be addressed ... this deal can get done,"" a person with direct knowledge of the discussions said.
Political obstacles to a deal have eased since a U.S. spying scandal helped derail a Boeing fighter sale to Brazil in 2013.
Brazilian President Michel Temer, who took office last year, has pushed a market-friendly agenda aimed at privatizing utilities and reducing the government's role in state-run firms.
    But Temer has been wrestling with single-digit poll ratings and officials have warned they would veto any full bid. 
""The companies are now working through the regulatory issues with the government of Brazil. The defense portfolio would be handled in accordance with the government of Brazil and the golden share and discussions are ongoing,"" the person said.
A tie-up would round out Boeing's commercial portfolio at the lower end where sales have been slow, and echo a venture between Airbus and Canada's Bombardier on the CSeries jet.
    Analysts say October's deal for Airbus to control the new Canadian project left Embraer looking exposed with its smaller E-Jet, and keenly aware that China may be on the prowl again after seeing its own efforts to buy the CSeries thwarted.
Though most sources say that deal rang alarms at Embraer, people involved in the Boeing talks insist they are independent.
    ""It is a longstanding relationship that has evolved over time. These discussions have been going on for the better part of a year and came into greater focus in the last few months, but well before the Airbus and Bombardier announcement. It is not a reactive play,"" the person with direct knowledge said.
'GROWTH PLAY'
Boeing and Embraer have long pondered commercial links and sources say they were close to a deal last decade for the Brazilian company to work on the next Boeing single-aisle jet.
In 2012 they agreed to work on safety and alternative fuel.
    Their partnership expanded to include Boeing's joint sales and support for Embraer’s KC-390 military transporter.
    But Boeing is now wooing the privatized firm with a broad offer including access to a global supply chain and new markets for the KC-390 and Brazil's Super Tucano light attack plane.
    Analysts say Embraer would value access to the U.S. defense market while Boeing hopes to steady a defense portfolio weakened by slow fighter sales and the end of C-17 transport production, although there are many hurdles to full military co-operation.
""It gives Embraer access to Boeing’s balance sheet, greater access to U.S. defense and international markets and alignment of a global supply chain and services,"" the person said. 
""It's a growth play that would result in more planes being built in Brazil due to more sales volume from a stronger combined portfolio and with broader benefits to the customer.""
Observers say the two managements are culturally close and broadly in step on issues like trade, where they are waging parallel battles against alleged Bombardier subsidies.
A tie-up is also not expected to strain Boeing financially.
But with pride at stake and Brazil still limping out of severe recession, any deal is expected to depend on cast-iron assurances over autonomy and jobs.
    ""It would not be Boeing plus Embraer with a small 'e'. Embraer would keep its brand identity, management and jobs footprint,"" the person said.

Boeing said on Friday it respected the need to safeguard the company's defense and other state links.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 11:40PM ET</span>",This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamonds,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017 with the market's worst performers, including  Under Armour  and  General Electric , may do well to remember as December draws to an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds.
As investment advisors rebalance clients' portfolios in the final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor with analysts - can be self-destructive.
With the S&P 500's rally pushing price/earnings multiples to highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own technology and other high-growth stocks may attract bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017.
""A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have a good year,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.
Ghriskey in recent months bought shares of General Electric (N:GE), which has slumped 45 percent this year as it struggles with a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. He believes the 125-year-old conglomerate will claw its way back to growth, or might be split into multiple companies. 
Some of the worst-performing stocks of 2016 roared back to life in 2017, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals (O:VRTX) and medical device maker Illumina (O:ILMN). Those two companies this year have rebounded 69 percent or more. 
As he rebalances clients' portfolios this month, Jake Dollarhide, head of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is investing more in  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and other supermarkets that took a beating after Amazon.com (O:AMZN) said in June it was buying Whole Food Markets. 
Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year average of 27. 
""Grocery is local; it's not an internet play. And Kroger has the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,"" Dollarhide said.
Investors following the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy each year buy components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with the highest dividend yield, betting that those stocks have been oversold. Currently, those companies include  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ), International Business Machines (N:IBM) and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), all with dividend yields of 3.7 percent or more. 
Those three stocks were also Dogs of the Dow at the start of this year, and they have underperformed. But an investor following that strategy last December also would have bought Boeing (N:BA), which has nearly doubled in 2017,  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), which is up 64 percent, and Cisco Systems (O:CSCO), which has risen 28 percent. 
 Nike  (N:NKE) in 2016 suffered a 19-percent drop, making it the worst-performing Dow component. In the past 12 months, however, it has surged back with a 25 percent rally. 
Due partly to increased competition from Nike, Under Armour (N:UAA) has slumped 48 percent year to date, making it the S&P 500's third-worst-performing stock. Last January, most analysts recommended buying Under Armour's shares and none recommended selling. Now, most analysts are neutral on the yoga-pant pioneer.
Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P 500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to finish 2017 with annual increases above the index's 20-perent gain.
Among them, domain name registration provider VeriSign (O:VRSN) has surged 53 percent, while Emerson Electric (N:EMR) has rallied 24 percent, with much of that gain in the past month after the industrial-automation systems maker abandoned its bid for Rockwell Automation Inc (N:ROK).

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 10:20PM ET</span>",Keppel unit to pay $422 million to resolve Petrobras bribery probes,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Keppel Corporation Ltd's (SI:KPLM) offshore rig building business will pay more than $422 million to resolve charges it bribed Brazilian officials, including some at state-run oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4), U.S. authorities said on Friday.
Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd agreed to pay the combined penalty to resolve investigations by authorities in the United States, Brazil and its home country of Singapore, the U.S. Justice Department said.
The company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement while a U.S. subsidiary, Keppel Offshore & Marine USA Inc, pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The Justice Department also revealed that a former member of the company's legal department secretly pleaded guilty in August in connection with the ongoing investigation. That person's identity could not be immediately determined.
Keppel Corporation Chairman Lee Boon Yang said the Singapore-based company regretted the actions that took place in Brazil.
""Integrity is one of Keppel's core values,"" he said in a statement. ""We do not and will not tolerate any illegal activity in the conduct of our business.""
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also known as Petrobras, has been at the center of Brazil's largest ever corruption scandal amid investigations into political kickback schemes involving contractors.
The Justice Department said that from 2001 to 2014, Keppel Offshore & Marine engaged in a scheme to pay $55 million in bribes to officials at Petrobras and the then-governing political party in Brazil, the Workers Party of Brazil.
The bribes were paid to win 13 contracts with Petrobras and Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, a privately-held Brazilian company that commissioned a large fleet of rigs for Petrobras' use, according to charging documents.
Keppel concealed the bribes by making payments to a consultant, who in turn facilitated the bribes by transferring money to bank accounts controlled by or for the benefit of the Brazilian officials, the charging papers said. 
In total, the company earned $351.8 million through the bribery scheme, according to court papers.
The Justice Department said Keppel Offshore & Marine had agreed to pay about $422.2 million, of which the United States would receive almost $105.6 million.
The Justice Department said Brazil will receive more than $211 million and Singapore will receive up to $105.6 million.

Keppel said Keppel Offshore & Marine has accepted a conditional warning from Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and that a subsidiary reached a leniency agreement with Brazilian prosecutors.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",Companies have up to a year for new U.S. tax bill reporting: SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission bulletin comes after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Thursday that some U.S. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the Republican-led overhaul of the country's tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures.
In a statement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) issued on Friday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting.
The $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump, will significantly affect many companies' year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders.
The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes. 
Public companies have been given a ""measurement period"" to study the changes created by a new law.
During the measurement period, the SEC expects companies to complete their accounting and that ""in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date,"" of the TJCA.
Companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill.
For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said.

The tax bill It is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. In addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 05:51PM ET</span>",Boeing seeks to salve Brazil concerns over Embraer approach,"By Ricardo Brito and Tim Hepher
BRASILIA/PARIS (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) sought to calm Brazilian concern about a potential tie-up with Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) after President Michel Temer and other officials warned they would veto any full takeover bid for the regional jet maker.
While Temer said he would welcome an injection of foreign capital into Embraer, his warning was the latest reminder that the company, which also makes some military planes and was one of the more successful products of Brazilian industrial policy, remains a focus of national pride.
Boeing said talks with Embraer on what the companies have called a ""potential combination"" were ongoing and insisted that it fully respected the need to safeguard the company's defense and other state links. 
""As we noted, discussions are ongoing, but we have always had deep respect for the role of the Government of Brazil, as well as their important defense and security concerns,"" Boeing spokesman Phil Musser said.
Earlier, Temer told a news conference he would study any decision the companies take on an alliance, emphasizing that his government could use its 'golden share' in the company to block foreign control of the formerly state-run company, fully privatized in 2006.
""When a decision arrives, I will examine it,"" Temer said. He added: ""The purpose of the golden share is for the government to take such a decision.""
Defense Minister Raul Jungmann said the government welcomed a commercial alliance with Boeing.
""We are in favor of this and other partnerships,"" Jungmann said at the same news conference with Temer.
But he also said foreign control of the company was out of the question, citing Embraer's central role in Brazil's defense industry.
'STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT'
""The moment that control of Embraer passes to a company from another country, it will control strategic decisions"" for Brazil, Jungmann said. ""No country would give up control of that."" He mentioned the Gripen fighter jets Embraer will build with Sweden's Saab AB (ST:SAABb) and the KC-390 cargo jet project with which Embraer plans to dominate the military transport market long dominated by the U.S.-made workhorse Hercules C-130.
Boeing and Embraer last year signed a deal under which the U.S. planemaker will help market the new military cargo jet but also provide maintenance services once they are sold.
The government's opposition to a full sale does not preclude a more targeted deal, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
""If the government persists with its objections, one structure that could be proposed is for the government to keep control of its defense business, and that Embraer sells its commercial business to Boeing,"" the source said. ""The deal is strategically important for Boeing because it will fill out its commercial line with regional jets.""
Some kind of commercial jet joint venture between the two jet makers would ""make a lot of sense,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""Even some kind of military joint venture such as military transports would make sense - but an acquisition of Embraer makes no sense.""
Embraer shares, which soared 20 percent on Thursday, fell 1.4 percent on Friday. Boeing shares edged up 0.24 percent.
It would be harder to quantify the gains to shareholders from a more limited joint-venture deal than with an outright acquisition, said Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr.
""I honestly think Boeing knew all along that it would be a joint venture or partnership,"" he said. ""But just like with Airbus-Bombardier, you can still set up something along those lines that's clearly a win-win.""
The Boeing-Embraer talks come just two months after Airbus SE (PA:AIR) struck a deal to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jetliner program.

Potential gains for Embraer would include Boeing's greater sales clout with major airlines, as well as with servicing existing jets and potential savings with suppliers, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major global stock indexes slipped on Friday in light pre-holiday trade, exacerbated by weakness in several blue-chip companies' shares, while Spanish bond yields rose after separatists won a Catalan election.
Shoe and apparel maker  Nike  Inc.'s (N:NKE) shares dropped 2.3 percent after it forecast muted current-quarter revenue growth, highlighting its struggles to regain market share in North America from Adidas (DE:ADSGN).
UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) slid 0.7 percent after the health insurer agreed to buy Chilean healthcare company  Banmedica  SA (SN:BAN) for $2.8 billion.
Despite the dip, Wall Street ended the week higher after rallying sharply ahead of a $1.5 trillion tax cut bill that passed in Washington on Wednesday. U.S. President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul into law on Friday.
Stock markets around the world shot up as the law, seen as boosting corporations and leading to economic growth, advanced through both chambers of the Republican-dominated Congress.
""It's been a strong week,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. ""Whether the market is up a little bit or down a little bit is not indicative of larger trends ... It's easy to push things around when not many people are trading.""
Investors were also winding down ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 28.23 points, or 0.11 percent, to close at 24,754.06, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.23 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,683.34 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.40 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,959.96.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.02 percent.
For the week, the S&P rose 0.29 percent, the Dow added 0.42 percent and the NASDAQ gained 0.34 percent.
In Europe, the premium investors demand for holding Spanish bonds over top-rated German peers fell to its lowest in almost three months as Catalonia held an independence election. 
The euro slid 0.1 percent to $1.1858 , but Europe's common currency was still up nearly 13 percent this year, on track for its best yearly performance in 14 years.
Spanish stocks were among the biggest losers, confirming analyst expectations that any shake-out from the Catalonia vote would be mostly confined to Spain.
U.S. Treasury yields, which reached a nine-month peak after the American tax vote, pushed slightly higher as investors hung up their hats before Christmas and ahead of next week's supply of short-to-medium-term government debt. 
The yield curve, while mildly flatter on the day, was on track for its largest weekly steepening since July following the bill's passage, which was seen as hastening the pace of interest rate increases.
Investors appeared to brush off U.S. data on durable goods orders, personal spending, new home sales and consumer sentiment.
Next week, investors will watch for the release of December U.S. consumer confidence survey data. Economists polled by Reuters expect it to decline from its strongest levels since late 2000.
In commodities, oil prices waned in light trading but remained near their highest since 2015 on pledges from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC producer Russia that any exit from crude output cuts would be gradual.
Palladium prices jumped to 17-year highs as strong demand from auto catalyst makers reinforced the prospect of market shortages, while gold rose for the sixth straight session to a 2-1/2-week high on U.S. economic data.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) once again became an eye-catching mover, this time because it plunged by nearly 30 percent to below $12,000, before recovering to trade above $14,000, still down nearly 9 percent. Investors dumped bitcoin in manic trading after its blistering ascent to a peak close to $20,000 prompted warnings by experts of a bubble.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 05:50PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse expects $2.3 billion write-down from U.S. tax changes‍​,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) expects to take a write-down of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.3 billion) during its 2017 fourth quarter following changes to the U.S. tax system, the Swiss bank said on Friday.
A tax overhaul, signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday, means Switzerland's second biggest lender will have to reduce the value of its deferred tax assets.
The figure suggests Credit Suisse would make a net loss for the full year, which would be its third straight annual loss. It reported 1.1 billion francs in net income in the first nine months of 2017.
The U.S. tax package, the largest such overhaul since the 1980s, slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.
Credit Suisse described the loss as a one-time accounting adjustment with a ""minimal impact"" on the bank's regulatory capital position.
It said the policy for returning capital to shareholders announced at its Investor Day remained unchanged.
The figure was higher than a previous estimate Credit Suisse gave earlier this month, when it said it expected the tax cuts to cost it 2.1 billion Swiss francs.
Cross-town rival UBS (S:UBSG) said then it expected 3 billion francs in deferred tax asset write-downs due to the tax cut, according to its own estimates.
Credit Suisse also said on Friday that it expected to face a bigger U.S. corporate tax liability due to the introduction of a new tax on services and interest payments to affiliated companies outside the United States.
It added that it expected the tax changes to increase its activity levels in the United States, particularly in investment banking.
It said it would give further details on the implications of the U.S. bill when it publishes its fourth quarter results on Feb. 14.

Some of the expense is also due to the revaluation of its tax liabilities, the drugmaker said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Amgen did not say how much of its $38.9 billion in cash and other holdings it plans to move back to the United States. To encourage U.S. companies to bring home the more than $2.6 trillion now held overseas, the law sets a one-time tax repatriation rate of 15.5 percent for cash and cash-equivalents and 8 percent for illiquid assets.
Amgen said its future U.S. income generally will be taxed at the 21 percent U.S. corporate income tax rate, while its income elsewhere will generally be taxed in the United States at 10.5 percent, reduced by foreign tax credits.

It said the tax expenses from moving its cash back to the United States will affect its current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings forecast, but will not affect its non-GAAP forecast.

(Reuters) - CSX Corp (O:CSX), the third-largest U.S. railroad, on Friday named Jim Foote as chief executive officer, succeeding Hunter Harrison, who died last week only months into the railroad's ambitious turnaround plan.
Foote, who joined CSX in October as chief operating officer, had been named acting CEO last week after Harrison, an industry turnaround legend, went on medical leave, just a few days before he died.
Investors and analysts had questioned whether Foote would be the long-term choice to run the company given his primary expertise is sales and marketing, rather than operations, saying that a more experienced executive might be needed to implement Harrison's sweeping operations overhaul.
The overhaul has triggered service disruptions, customer complaints and federal scrutiny.
CSX shares were up 0.2 percent at $54.99 on Friday afternoon. 
Harrison's death at age 73 came just eight months into his restructuring campaign, which was designed to boost profits and streamline operations through cost cuts and operational changes. 
""Jim has decades of railroading experience and the board is confident of his ability to lead the company,"" CSX Chairman Edward Kelly said in a statement. ""He has already had a markedly positive impact.""
Foote had worked under Harrison during the turnaround of Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR).

CSX shares have risen about 50 percent this year and about 10 percent since March after Harrison was hired as CEO in a high-stakes push by activist investor Paul Hilal of investment fund Mantle Ridge LP.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Dozens of Indian securities officials descended on the homes of brokers and others on Friday in a widespread early morning raid in Mumbai, and possibly other cities, a regulatory source said.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) raids are a sign that a probe by the regulator is gathering steam. The investigation is looking into who was responsible for circulating prescient messages about major Indian companies' corporate announcements in social media chatrooms, according to the regulator.
The investigation was triggered last month after Reuters reported at least 12 instances of messages that predicted results and other financial metrics about the companies had been circulated in private WhatsApp groups. These groups consisted mainly of traders and brokers.
On Friday at least 70 SEBI officials searched homes and seized property, including mobile phones and laptops, the regulatory source said.
Two Reuters journalists covering financial markets were among those whose homes were raided.
A Reuters spokesperson said: ""The two reporters were on the team that reviewed transcripts from these WhatsApp groups and documented at least 12 cases where there were prescient messages about major companies’ financial information. That reporting appears to have now led to this investigation.""
The regulator did not respond to a request for comment about the raids. 
    The premises of more than 30 brokers and dealers were searched, the Hindu BusinessLine newspaper reported.
SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi has previously said that the regulator launched its investigation after the Reuters story was published. Last month, a person familiar with the matter said the regulator had also asked for trading data on the companies mentioned in the story.
    Stock exchanges are also cooperating with SEBI and looking into the matter, Vikram Limaye, chief executive of the National Stock Exchange, India's biggest bourse operator, said last week. 

    SEBI has in recent years beefed up insider trading rules and expanded what material constitutes ""unpublished price-sensitive information"".

The source denied rumours she would join  Burberry  (L:BRBY).

Other issues not connected to the U.S. tax reform will lead to higher taxes, however, which means the overall increase in net income will come to around 1 billion euros, the company said, without providing details of those other issues.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed off on a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul on Friday, which slashes the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
""Due to the broadly based U.S. industrial and financial services business, combined with a material value added, Daimler - similar to many other local U.S. companies - benefits from the decided tax reform,"" Daimler said.
The lower tax rate requires the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities at Daimler's U.S. subsidiaries, which the group said exceed its deferred tax assets.
It said it was still analysing the possible impact of other measures in the tax law.
The tax benefit will not affect its industrial free cash flow or operating profit for 2017, it said.

1092,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 12:10PM ET</span>",Veiled threats and boardroom battles: the bitter close of a Brazilian bankruptcy,"By Gram Slattery
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - In mid-November, the former chief executive of Brazilian telecoms company Oi SA (SA:OIBR4) told the debt-laden company's board that he was receiving ominous phone calls, according to two people present at the meeting.
The anonymous messages came to Marco Schroeder's cellphone and his home phone. Often, the caller seemed to know his exact location, such as a Sao Paulo airport. At least once, according to a person close to the executive, the calls threatened severe physical harm.
Confidants of Schroeder believed the calls were coming from people associated with Societe Mondiale, a fund owned by distressed-debt tycoon Nelson Tanure that controlled the company's board but had fallen out with its management over how to best maneuver the company out of bankruptcy protection. 
A Societe Mondiale representative called any connection between Tanure and such calls ""unreasonable and irresponsible."" Schroeder declined to comment. Societe Mondiale has declined multiple requests to make Tanure available for interviews regarding Oi.
In any case, the fact such suspicions arose in the final months of Oi's recently completed debt restructuring shows just how bitterly the process divided Brazil's largest fixed-line carrier, which employs over 100,000 people. This account of the backdrop to the restructuring was pieced together based on interviews with over a dozen bondholders, lawyers and executives.
On Wednesday, Oi's creditors finally approved a plan to restructure Oi's 65 billion reais ($20 billion) of debt, putting an end to Latin America's largest ever in-court reorganization. Oi's management has said the company is now effectively for sale with a number of potential buyers circling the telecom provider.
Yet Oi's two largest original shareholders, Societe Mondiale and Pharol SGPS SA (LS:PHRA), formerly  Portugal Telecom , have filed or threatened to file motions to overturn the decision. Oi, in response, has said the plan is legally airtight. 
ROCKY FROM THE BEGINNING
As a ""national champion"" in the parlance of Brazilian business, or a company expected to promote national interests as well as make a profit, Oi had been required by the government to expand into far-flung regions in recent decades and provide services, such as 650,000 little-used payphones, that offered meager returns. 
By the time the company collapsed under its massive debt load and filed for bankruptcy in June 2016, a global who's who of distressed-debt investors had bought in and frictions between shareholders and bondholders were coming into sharp relief.
Among the latter were veterans of sovereign debt fights Aurelius Capital Management and Goldentree Asset Management. 
Among the former was Tanure's Societe Mondiale, which had scooped up a chunk of the company's shares and struck alliances giving him majority control of Oi's board. 
That put the board on a collision course with major bondholders, who were pushing to severely dilute the value of equity stakes. Throughout 2017, Tanure's son, Nelson Jr., attempted to recruit New York and London hedge funds to support a shareholder-friendly plan, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
That campaign was initially backed by Oi's management. But as the fourth quarter approached and Oi entered its second year in bankruptcy protection, the company's executives began to doubt the plan could win over enough creditors. 
In mid-October, the Schroeder-led management team shifted its negotiating focus to the company's major bondholder groups, including Aurelius and Goldentree, without the board's blessing, according to the people. 
""The management from the beginning negotiated with all the creditors, shareholders, and the government,"" Schroeder told Reuters.
BOARD VS MANAGEMENT
That move incensed the board, the people said, and in early November, it appointed two new executives in a bid to gain more influence over the management. 
Later in November, Schroeder reported receiving the anonymous phone messages, according to the people. 
Soon after, he abruptly resigned, citing disagreements with the board, and the management quickly chose current CEO Eurico Teles, a lawyer, to replace him. Not wanting to add a tussle over management to the bondholder fight, the board accepted his nomination, one person said.
But tensions continued to simmer.
As a court-imposed December deadline for a final restructuring plan approached, Tanure-backed board member Demian Fiocca dashed off an email to Oi Chief Financial Officer Carlos Brandao, accusing him and other managers of undermining a shareholder friendly proposal. 
""Are you taking power away from the board and the company? Is that what you're doing?"" asked Fiocca in the email, seen by Reuters. ""If that's true, it's absurd.""
Oi declined to comment on the episode. A representative for Fiocca said he had exchanged hundreds of emails with Brandao, with only one adopting a ""harder"" tone.
THE ENDGAME
In the end, Fiocca's protests were in vain. 
Late that evening, on Nov. 29, the judge overseeing Oi's restructuring gave Teles sole powers to negotiate a restructuring plan, sidelining the board, citing the slow pace of negotiations 17 months after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
As the deadline for a deal approached, at a late night teleconference in mid-December, Teles reached an understanding in principal on a plan handing its major bondholders, including Aurelius and Goldentree, up to 75 percent of the company's stock.
The board was livid at the equity dilution, which was three times what they had proposed, as well as terms they viewed as giving Teles too much say over the board's composition, according to two sources.
Toward the end of a board meeting later that week, Luis Palha, the chairman of shareholder Pharol, asked advisors to leave the room and told Teles he felt severely betrayed, the sources said.
Oi declined to comment on the episode. A Pharol spokesman did not comment on the incident, referring Reuters to a statement saying that it will analyze the restructuring plan and evaluate all legal options.
At the creditors meeting, which began this Tuesday and took place in the same venue that hosted boxing matches in the 2016 Olympics, all major bondholders voted for the plan.
In the hours before, Societe Mondiale unleashed a flurry of legal filings.
""Oi with this plan is another company,"" an exhausted Eurico Teles told journalists after the 13-hour meeting ended just after 2 a.m. ""I think this was an emotional day.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - IAG (L:ICAG), the owner of British Airways and low-cost carrier Vueling, is one of the four bidders selected for the final stages of talks over the assets of insolvent Austrian airline Niki, three people familiar said.
IAG had made an offer for Niki as a whole and was the frontrunner in talks for the carrier, the three sources told Reuters. If no deal is struck with IAG, it is possible that Niki will be carved up among several buyers.
British tour operator Thomas Cook (L:TCG) and Niki's founder, former Formula One world champion Niki Lauda, are also among the four, Lauda told German daily Handelsblatt.
The administrators running the process aim to agree a deal by the end of next week, one of the administrators said on Friday. They did not confirm the identity of the bidders.
Lauda, who set up the airline in 2003, said he had been told a decision was to be made on Dec. 28. 
Niki was part of collapsed Air Berlin. It filed for insolvency last week after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) backed out of a deal to buy its assets on competition concerns, grounding the fleet and stranding thousands of passengers. 
The administrators have been racing to find an alternative buyer for its assets before it loses its takeoff and landing slots, its most attractive asset.
Six parties submitted offers by a Thursday deadline, five of which were binding, Niki administrator Lucas Floether said in a statement on Friday, without providing details.
""The bidders are very interested, and I am confident that it will be possible to save large parts of the business and many jobs in Austria and Germany,"" he said.
A German newspaper had also named Tuifly, the airline of tour operator TUI (L:TUIT), as one of the bidders for Niki, and Swiss carrier PrivatAir had expressed interest.
Niki parent Air Berlin, IAG, Thomas Cook and Tuifly declined to comment. PrivatAir was not available for immediate comment.
All of the bidders picked for further talks have indicated that they are prepared to provide Niki with funding to keep it going as soon as a deal is agreed, Floether said.
The head of Niki's works council, Stefan Tankovits, said that December salaries would be paid to the airline's staff.

If Niki's administrators fail to seal a deal for Niki's assets by the end of December, the carrier may lose its operating licence and its runway slots, but Floether said on Friday that Austrian regulators may give the parties a few extra days if an agreement is struck by the end of next week.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 10:50AM ET</span>",Republican tax plan to dent U.S. home sales next year,"By Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - U.S. home sales will likely take a hit next year as middle-class Americans receive fewer perks under an overhaul of U.S. taxes and face rising home prices and interest rates, industry experts said.
Sales of new single-family homes are projected to rise 5 percent in 2018 — only about half the growth estimated for 2017 and the slowest pace since 2014, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).
The Republican tax bill, approved by Congress on Wednesday, slashes the amount of mortgage interest that home buyers can deduct to $750,000 from $1 million, potentially hurting buyers in California and other costly markets.
The tax plan will also cap the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, effectively leaving homeowners in higher-tax states with a bigger tax bill.
""In major metropolitan areas where property values are high and taxes tend to be high as well, the middle-class family is going to get hit by that,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, a Pennsylvania-based consultancy.
The new rules should spur people to buy cheaper homes next year, a trend that has already become popular in recent years among thrifty millennials who are shunning expensive living.
Indeed, big homebuilders including  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) and PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) have suggested they will invest more in entry-level homes.
D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the largest U.S. homebuilder by number of homes sold, expects its cheaper brand called ""Express Homes"" to grow at least 10 to 15 percent over the next three years.
The business, aimed at first-time buyers, made up 37 percent of the number of homes sold by D.R. Horton in the latest quarter.
Neither Lennar nor Pulte responded to emails seeking comment.
A prolonged shift toward entry-level homes should drive much of the growth in new home sales next year, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Michael Rehaut said.
Sales of multifamily homes or apartments and condos, largely rental properties, are expected to stay relatively flat next year, NAHB's Chief Economist Robert Dietz said.
'NOTHING GOOD'
The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the median price of new homes to rise 4.5 percent next year, up from an expected 2.8 percent increase this year.
Still, some analysts expect demand for new homes will remain robust, supported by further increases in jobs and wages that are expected from the tax reform.
Appetite for new homes was strong this year but homebuilders could not properly benefit from the demand due to tight labor supply and as lumber prices (LBc1) jumped some 39 percent.
Analysts expect these challenges to persist in 2018.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has already hiked interest rates three times this year, is expected to do so another three times in 2018 and 2019, making borrowing dearer.
""Tax changes, price increases, interest rate increases — there's nothing good on the horizon for the residential housing market,"" Naroff said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - There will be no holiday slowdown this year for tax consultant Jonathan Traub, who skipped hitting the ski slopes with his family and hunkered down in his Colorado condo to prep for a webcast.
Clients have been full of questions about what the biggest rewrite of the U.S. tax code in 30 years will mean for them. And with earnings season looming, corporate treasurers and other consultants are racing to understand the implications of the sweeping changes so they can explain them to others. 
""Getting an analysis out to clients by the end of year is not soon enough,"" Traub, managing principal of the tax policy group at Deloitte Tax LLP said on Monday. ""We're trying to get things out to them sooner than that so they can take appropriate actions before the end of the year if warranted.""
Traub, who is based in Washington, said Deloitte is trying to keep a stream of analyses, webcasts and alerts coming as clients and internal employees reach out to understand the tax bill's ramifications.
""I can say it’s affected a lot of our clients and our people who are putting in working vacations this year trying to decipher this tax bill,” he said. 
Other tax professionals across the United States will be glued to their phones during the holidays as companies scramble to wrap their heads around a lower corporate tax rate and new repatriation rule ahead of audits and fourth-quarter earnings season in January and February.
The final version of the Republican tax bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate this week, cuts the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent starting Jan. 1.
It also sets a one-time mandatory tax of eight percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for the about $2.6 trillion in U.S. business profits now held overseas. 
A corporate treasurer at an S&P 500 company who wished to remain anonymous said the company has long been prepping for the tax overhaul and was particularly focused on the impact of the repatriation rule.
The treasurer said companies will have to brace for tax-related questions during company earnings calls in January and February.
Peter Bible, chief risk officer at accounting firm EisnerAmper in New York, said his corporate clients have been asking about the effects of the repatriation provision on their businesses. 
""You've got treasurers, you've got the accounting staff, you've got the tax staff - all those (people) are going to be burning the midnight oil to get this right,"" Bible said. 
There is pressure to understand the impacts accurately because companies have to close their books and be ready for external auditors around mid-January, Bible said. 
Bible added that he was headed to Sanibel Island, Florida, for the holidays, but would likely not see much of the beach. 

""I expect to be in a warm climate, but not on vacation,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A sweeping reform of European Union financial markets will come in with the New Year on January 3, a year late due to its complexity and after eleventh-hour handholding by regulators keen to avoid any trading snarls.
The new rules shine a spotlight on the innards of stock, bond, commodity and derivatives markets by forcing banks, asset managers and traders to report detailed information on trillions of euros in transactions.
Banks and trading firms have spent millions of euros getting ready for the big day. A report from Expand, part of the Boston Consulting Group and IHS Markit, has estimated that top global banks and asset managers will have spent $2.1 billion this year to comply with the new regime.
The aim is to apply lessons from the 2007-09 global financial crisis by increasing transparency in trading and bolstering investor protection.
It will mean that stock, bond, derivatives, commodity and other trades must be reported to a repository, a trove of data that supervisors can use to track trades and spot risks.
Regulators, already complaining they have too few resources, will sift through the data to try to spot bubbles early after failing to see the last crisis coming.
In run up to the launch, bankers will work through the night to check that high-speed reporting connections with customers and trading platforms work from day one.
Fund managers and others must for the first time fill in a transaction report with up to 65 bits of data within 15 minutes of a trade - or risk being fined. 
Originally due to come in at the start of 2017, the EU was forced to give banks and regulators another year to get ready for the rules, known as MiFID II or Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II. They represent a major overhaul of the 2007 MiFID law to improve transparency and investor protection and broaden its scope to take in more financial products.
MiFID II will be a journey and not a one off event in January, is how one national regulator responded to questions about how trading will unfold on January 3.
The bloc's European Securities and Markets Authority is overseeing the rollout and published a flurry of statements this week to tackle some remaining roadbumps and calm nerves.
""ESMA, in close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities across the EU, has carried out a broad range of work, even within the last few days, to ensure that the framework is in place to ensure a smooth transition from MiFID I to MiFID II,"" ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor told Reuters.
Even with the extra year, only 11 of the bloc's 28 member states have written MiFID II fully into national law, prompting ESMA to say that all firms can carry on even if their home state is among those countries that have not completed the legislative process.
It also said that a requirement for each party to a stock, bond or derivative trade to have a unique identifier for reporting transactions would put be on hold for six months.
Germany, France and Britain, home to the EU's top financial centers, are among the 11 EU states whose national laws are up to speed and big banks are likely to be ready.
Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) NatWest Markets has conducted a ""soft launch"". From January 2 to January 4, some of its staff will work through the night.
""Day One will hopefully go smoothly and we are as ready as we can be,"" Giovanni Mazzocchi, head of macro distribution in Europe for  Barclays  (L:BARC), said.
""There are a few overnighters going on to make sure everything will work on the day.""
There are concerns over smaller players who cannot afford teams of extra staff to get ready in time.
But industry officials predict light trading volumes initially rather than paralysis.
""It's in nobody's interest that the markets will freeze up. Markets will be just fine, even if there is some nervousness as they adapt to the significant changes,"" Christian Voigt, senior regulatory adviser at Fidessa, a provider of trading software, said.
""As long as regulators give time to adjust, then all will be well.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has said it will initially take a ""proportionate"" approach to enforcement but laggards must show they are making an effort.
DISRUPTIVE
ESMA will use the data provided by markets to set curbs on the maximum size of commodity positions, and cap trading of shares in ""dark pools"" or off an exchange.
MiFID II gives investors more information about which trading platforms offer the best deals, and asset managers will have show investors who is paying for stock research.
ESMA has already begun flexing its new MiFID II muscles to curb or ban financial products. Shares in British spread-betters tumbled on Monday after ESMA outlined possible restrictions on the sale of complex products to consumers.
A fundamental aim of the original MiFID was to increase competition in share trading by allowing new platforms to take on centuries-old rivals like the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE).
Upstarts like Chi-X went on to become among the biggest pan-European share trading platforms and regulators want MiFID II to bring ""disruption"" to trading in other assets, forcing companies to become more agile and serve customers better.
""There will be interesting times over the next few years with new players entering the market and both clients and banks making full use of the new available data to shape their activities in the market,"" Mazzocchi said.
Voigt said MiFID II was not a revolution in share trading, but would have a big impact on bonds, commodities and derivatives, where electronic trading will increase.
""For fixed income and off-exchange derivatives, the whole mindset needs to change as a lot of trades are still done over the phone,"" Voigt said.
Karel Lannoo, chief executive of Brussels think tank CEPS which tracks financial services, said it will take six to 12 months for markets to fully implement the new rules.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>",U.S. tax break could push startups to share the wealth,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Startup companies came away with a significant victory in the U.S. tax overhaul -- a chance to defer the often-onerous tax bill that is attached to company stock options. 
To get the tax break, companies must provide stock options to at least 80 percent of their workforce, a requirement that could prompt startups to spread the option wealth more widely.
Employees with options are commonly required to exercise them within 10 years, or within three months of leaving a startup. The gains on those shares is taxed as income, and the tax bill can easily climb to hundreds of thousands of dollars for early employees at a successful startup, say tax experts. The value of a stock option package can be worth about 10 times an employee's salary, said Mary Russell, an attorney who counsels individuals on their startup equity offers.
But employees face a big challenge when the startup is not yet public and they cannot sell the shares for cash to pay the taxes. 
Now, private-company employees will be able to defer those taxes for up to five years. Certain top executives and high earners will not qualify.
""I feel a sense of relief that I have more time to figure things out,"" said Jamil Poonja, head of public policy and communications at San Francisco startup Stride Health, who has part of his compensation in options. 
But the provision's fairly restrictive rules mandate that companies must provide stock options to at least 80 percent of their employees to be eligible for the new tax deferral.
""That might change the way people allocate equity,"" said Kate Mitchell, co-founder of Scale Venture Partners. ""But there is value in distributing it across the company.""
Startups vary in how they grant stock options to employees. The common practice among venture-backed companies is to carve out 20 percent of their total equity to distribute to employees, said Anand Sanwal, CEO of data firm CB Insights, which tracks startups.
The new tax provision responds to a problem created by the shifting investment dynamics in Silicon Valley. In the dot-com era, companies went public after an average of four years. Today, the average age is 11. That means employees have much of their wealth tied up in options that cannot be sold on the public stock markets for more than a decade.
Many resort to taking out loans or, in more extreme cases, abandoning their shares, said attorneys and founders.

""Sometimes people don't or can't or won't write that big of a check,"" said Jason van den Brand, co-founder of home refinance startup Lenda. ""They're like 'This is going to cost me $50,000, where am I going to get that?'""

In a statement on its website, China's Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said commercial banks must not divert funds into real estate, local government financing vehicles or the stock market through partnership with trust firms, or sign any under-the-table deals with them to skirt rules.
China's trust industry has been a key part of the country's massive shadow banking business, which helps channel deposits into risky investments via products often designed to dodge capital or investment regulations.
At the end of June, assets managed by China's trust industry totalled 23.1 trillion yuan ($3.51 trillion), nearly five times as big as five years ago. 
CBRC on Friday pointed out that there were ""hidden dangers"" lurking in the rapid growth of business between commercial banks and trust firms and urged trust companies not to grow ""blindly"".
The regulator also urged banks to fully assess their risk exposure to their investment via trust firms, and set aside adequate provisions for potential losses.

The notice came a month after Beijing published draft guidelines to tighten supervision of the $9 trillion asset management industry in a effort to curb shadow banking.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>","Spanish stocks, financials tumble on Catalan separatist gains","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish stocks fell after Catalan separatists won a slim majority in a regional election, deepening a political crisis which has hurt the economy and caused a business exodus from the region. 
Spain's IBEX (IBEX) fell 1.2 percent after voters backed separatist parties in a rebuke to Prime Minister Manuel Rajoy and European Union leaders. The main stock index reduced losses later in the morning, last down 0.9 percent. 
""This is Groundhog Day, we have been here,"" said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth. ""I just don't think the Spanish government can do anything other than come to the table now.""
Thin liquidity due to the holidays could be accentuating a kneejerk reaction on the IBEX, Peel added. ""Likely there's some hedge funds leaning on it, but in terms of long-only money, I don't think there will be much movement now,"" he said.
Banco Sabadell (MC:SABE) and Caixabank (MC:CABK), which have the biggest exposure to Catalonia and moved headquarters after October's independence referendum, fell 2.7 to 3.4 percent, the top fallers.
Santander (MC:SAN),  Bankia  (MC:BKIA), and BBVA (MC:BBVA) also dropped in early dealing. 
Stocks across sectors exposed to Spain's economy were hit. Telecoms firm  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), real estate investment trust Merlin Properties (MC:MRL) and airport operator AENA (MC:AENA) fell around 1.3 percent.
""The environment remains difficult for Catalonia's economy and investments,"" said Carsten Hesse, economist at Berenberg.
As political risk reared its head again, financial stocks were the biggest drag on European markets. The euro zone banks index (SX7E) fell 0.8 percent. 
Spanish stocks dominated fallers on the euro zone STOXX index (STOXXE), which dipped just 0.2 percent, confirming analyst expectations that any shake-out from the Catalonia vote would be mostly confined to Spain. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) edged down 0.1 percent, in line with France's CAC 40 (FCHI). 
""You always have to keep political risk in mind but it's the underlying fundamentals that are driving European equities,"" said Peel. 
""The euro zone and Spanish economies are recovering, interest rates are going to stay low, and most investors are only looking at those fundamentals.""
Spanish stocks were Europe's best-performing benchmark for much of the year, but political risk has held them back from the broader market's recent rally. The IBEX was last 9 percent down from its May peak.
Among the rare risers on Friday, French telecoms firm Eutelsat Communications (PA:ETL) jumped 4.8 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux raised its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) gained 5.3 percent after the company, mired in an accounting scandal, said a court decision on whether to allow an investigation into its accounts is expected by Jan. 22.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",Ryanair hit with first ever pilots strike,"By Myria Mildenberger and Victoria Bryan
BERLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair failed to avert its first ever pilots strike on Friday as pilots in Germany held a four-hour walkout although airports and the Irish budget carrier said there had been little impact on flights. 
Ryanair had sought to avert a series of threatened strikes across Europe over Christmas by giving up its long-held opposition to recognizing unions. 
That convinced pilots in Ireland, Italy and Portugal to call off planned strikes. 
However, Germany's Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) union staged a brief walkout saying it did not believe Ryanair was serious about negotiating with unions.
""This was a warning shot and we started small. However, there is potential for much more,"" union spokesman Markus Wahl said, ruling out further strikes until after Dec 26.
The strike ran from 0401 GMT to 0759 GMT when only 16 flights were scheduled.
Ryanair, which had urged pilots to work to get passengers home for Christmas, said 9 of its 36 early flights from Germany were delayed. There were no cancellations and it expected to operate all scheduled flights on Friday.
Ryanair shares were down 0.6 percent at 0941 GMT.
""We are grateful to all of our Ryanair pilots for putting our customers first and largely ignoring this VC strike,"" the airline said in a statement.
A spokesman for Berlin airports said there were no significant effects, noting that five of seven early flights had departed, with one delayed.
Cologne/Bonn airport said two of three scheduled flights had taken off and the third was delayed. Frankfurt airport said four of six scheduled flights had taken off.
The VC union said after a first meeting that it did not believe Ryanair genuinely wanted to recognize unions and said it wanted to send a message that their pilots were serious about industrial action. 
VC said Ryanair had refused to accept two members of a delegation that the union nominated to hold talks with management. One of the pilots was a contractor and one a direct employee, but Ryanair has ended both of their contracts, VC said.
""This has shown us that nothing has changed with Ryanair's management style or how it handles workers' rights,"" VC President Ilja Schulz told reporters on Thursday.
Ryanair pilots mobilized in September after the carrier announced the cancellation of around 20,000 flights, which it blamed on a rostering problem sparked by a change in Irish regulations.

Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters this week that his offer of union recognition was genuine but that employees must understand it will remain a low cost airline. Negotiations with unions will continue in the new year.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",Roche to buy U.S. cancer drugmaker Ignyta for $1.7 billion,"(Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) will buy U.S. cancer drug specialist  Ignyta Inc  (O:RXDX) for $1.7 billion in an agreed deal to broaden its oncology portfolio, the firms said on Friday.
Roche would pay $27 per share for Ignyta, representing a premium of about 74 percent to the stock's closing price on Thursday, they said.
Reuters had reported on Thursday that Ignyta was in advanced talks to sell itself, just three years after going public with a focus on precision drugs and diagnostics.
Ignyta will continue its operations in San Diego and will be responsible for the ongoing pivotal study of entrectinib, its most advanced drug.
The U.S. company has a suite of drugs in early stage development that use gene therapy to kill off the underlying diseases that drive cancer tumor growth.
""Cancer is a highly complex disease and many patients suffer from mutations which are difficult to detect and treat. The agreement with Ignyta builds on Roche's strategy of fitting treatments to patients and will allow Roche to broaden and strengthen its oncology portfolio globally,"" said the company's pharmaceuticals head, Daniel O'Day.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018, the companies said.
Roche stock eased 0.3 percent by mid-morning, in line with the European sector average (SXDP).
Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said the deal reflected Roche's strategy of making bolt-on acquisitions, adding it was not overpaying for the new assets.
""The data speak for themselves. We expect approval in the first half of 2019 and this could become a blockbuster given the wide field of use,"" he wrote in a research note, keeping his ""market weight"" rating.
Bank Vontobel analysts said the deal was set to boost Roche's efforts to address cancers with specific mutations by precision medicines that work hand in hand with diagnostics. 
Citi advised Roche on the deal, while BofA Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised Ignyta.

Sidley Austin LLP and Latham & Watkins LLP were legal counsel to Roche and Ignyta, respectively.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Pilots at Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) voted in favor of raising funds as a buffer against any actions the Hong Kong airline may take against them, such as unilateral benefit changes or job losses, their union said on Friday.
The move underscores persistent pilot discontent at Cathay, where anger and distrust has deepened after it decided not to pay any year-end bonuses to Hong Kong-based captains, five pilots told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Eager to trim costs, the loss-making airline had also sought to cut payment of housing allowances but this month extended the stipend ahead of a busy holiday travel period and amid poaching attempts by its rivals.
More than 82 percent of union members voted in favor of resolutions including raising funds to prepare for any industrial escalation. Chris Beebe, general secretary of the union, said however that there were no plans to take any action unless the airline moved to cut benefits first.
Cathay said this month it capped year-end bonuses to junior and mid-level employees at HK$35,000 ($4,475) in Hong Kong, or less than the usual payment of an extra month's salary due to the ""difficult financial environment"". 
Captains, as senior-level employees, did not get any bonus.
Cathay's director of flight operations, Anna Thompson, said in memo to pilots that the airline could have communicated its decision better and noted that more than 400 pilots had expressed ""how they are currently feeling as employees"" to managers after the bonus decision on an internal online forum.
The airline has around 3,300 pilots globally, two-thirds of whom are union members.
One of the pilots who spoke to Reuters said: ""This obviously keeps all office and ground staff happy, but docks all pilots, and deducts a whole month's salary from captains.""
Cathay in August posted its worst half-year loss in at least 20 years, due to poor fuel hedging and stiff competition from expanding mainland Chinese and Gulf airlines. 
The airline is undertaking a strategic transformation program aiming for HK$4 billion of cost savings over three years and has also warned pilots about potential cuts to their retirement benefits. 

Cathay said in a statement that it had been engaging with its pilots and the union and was aiming for an ""agreeable solution"".

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 01:18AM ET</span>",Sonic boom or bust? Dreams of super-fast jet travel revival face headwinds,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Supersonic passenger travel, which died out with the Concorde's demise in 2003, will make a comeback by the mid-2020s if three entrepreneurial U.S.-based companies can make jets quiet and efficient enough to win over buyers and fliers.
Fifteen years ago,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) canceled plans to build the near-supersonic Sonic Cruiser, the last big attempt by a major manufacturer to speed up commercial travel.
Now  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) and Virgin Group are backing one of the three U.S. supersonic projects, Denver-based Boom Technology Inc, which plans a 55-seat all business class jet.
 Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) is partnering with Aerion Corp to develop smaller supersonic business jets, with Spike Aerospace Inc also targeting the private jet market given many see the super-rich as the likeliest early adopters of supersonic travel.
Concorde was developed in the 1960s, meaning this is hardly a new technology. But the program was government-backed, with only 14 jets ever delivered to then-government owned British Airways (L:ICAG) and Air France (PA:AIRF). Other airline orders evaporated as the purchase price soared and they were eventually retired as maintenance costs rose and passenger revenue fell.
New players are relying on venture capital funding models.
""This is more about engines and economics than it is about airframes,"" Richard Aboulafia, the vice president of analysis at aerospace research firm Teal Group, said of the challenges of a supersonic revival. 
To make the project economics stack up the engines need to be far more fuel efficient and less noisy than those used by Concorde or fighter jets. 
That has proven tough to engineer, especially at higher speeds like the Concorde's Mach 2, which halved the travel time from London to New York to 3.5 hours.
'REALISTIC PROJECT'
Engine manufacturers and jet makers have spent decades improving fuel efficiency, expanding range and reducing noise.
But to get up to mach speed, a supersonic jet requires an engine core more like those on the commercial jets of the 1970s and 1980s which noisily gobble more air and fuel.
""A large fraction of the benefits we have in efficiency and noise reduction we are going to lose as soon as we have to go back to that sort of architecture,"" said Daniel Edgington-Mitchell, an aerospace engineering lecturer at Melbourne's Monash University.
Aerion, the most advanced of the proposed supersonic jet projects, is working with GE Aviation (N:GE) to develop an engine based on a core used in F-16 fighters and Boeing 737s that was developed in the 1970s, a GE spokesman said.
In a sign of the challenges involved using an older engine core rather than spending $1 billion-plus to engineer a new one, Aerion has reduced the jet's planned speed from Mach 1.6 to 1.4.
Today's top business jets fly at around Mach 0.9 and commercial jets at Mach 0.85.
Jeff Miller, Aerion's head of marketing, said the speed had fallen to meet noise standards and due to temperature limits involved with adapting an existing engine core.
Aerion, chaired by billionaire businessman Robert Bass, plans for the 12-seat, $120 million jet to make its first test flight in 2023, with entry into service in 2025.
""Aerion has researched the problems since 2003 and therefore reached the highest degree of realism,"" Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said, comparing it to the loftier supersonic ambitions of Boom and Spike. ""If one wants to go faster, a suitable core is harder to find.""
FASTER IS BETTER
Boom wants a $200 million jet capable of Mach 2.2 and Spike aims for a $100 million jet at Mach 1.6, down from an earlier Mach 1.8. 
Both want their jets to enter service in 2023, two years earlier than Aerion.
Several industry sources said those timelines appeared unrealistic because the companies have yet to select engines and will face testing and certification challenges.
Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl said the company was examining an adaptation of an existing engine as well as a clean-sheet option, with more to say next year. Spike CEO Vik Kachoria said his company was in talks with two engine suppliers. Both are working on smaller demonstrator aircraft with different engines designed to prove the concept is achievable within their proposed timeframes.
Engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L:RR) said it was interested in supersonic work. United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it was ""not currently"" working with Boom and did not respond to a question on Spike, while GE did not provide comment on either project.
Scholl said airlines need a speed of at least Mach 2 to make the supersonic business case stake up because that would shave one day off a trans-Atlantic itinerary and two days off trans-Pacific trips. For now, only over-water itineraries are under consideration due to widespread bans on civilian supersonic flights over land.
""Faster speeds not only are better for passengers, they are better for airlines, who get to turn the plane around and fly more segments in the same day, possibly even with the same crew,"" Scholl said.
Japan Airlines and Virgin Group, which declined to comment, have a combined 30 options over Boom jets, with three other as-yet-unnamed customers signed on for another 46. 
Former British Airways chief Concorde pilot Mike Bannister said the biggest hurdle for Boom was to develop jets at a price that would stack up for airlines, or early orders would evaporate as they had with Concorde.
""The technical challenges, whilst great, are surmountable,"" said Bannister, who was the captain of the last-ever commercial Concorde flight and has advised Boom's team.

""It is an absolute delight to be able to see on the horizon the prospect of another supersonic airliner, particularly for my family because my daughter who is 24 is a commercial pilot. I would love to see my daughter flying it.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc has told bankers it would top its annual revenue target by as much as 18 percent, sources with knowledge of the matter said, marking a comeback from a sales slump in recent years that triggered a business overhaul.
Xiaomi, which has been hearing bank pitches for what could be the world's biggest tech float next year, will rake in a net profit of at least $1 billion in 2017, banker projections based on the company's revenue estimate of $17 billion to $18 billion show. Profits are estimated to reach about $2 billion in 2018.
The calculations also take into account data on operating costs provided by the company, said the sources with knowledge of the discussions. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not public.
Bankers and analysts expect Xiaomi's profits to continue growing sharply into 2019, which one source said would make a $100 billion valuation at IPO look ""reasonable"".
A spokeswoman for Xiaomi - that is expected to soon mandate its leading banks for an IPO - confirmed the company had topped the annual revenue goal, of about $15 billion, but declined to comment on IPO-related matters or its financials.
""We have never externally disclosed any expected net profit and growth data and we do not respond to irresponsible speculation and rumors,"" she said.
Xiaomi was valued at $46 billion in a 2014 funding round, the world's most valuable startup for a brief period. It sales stagnated over the next two years as the firm overextended itself launching in new markets while being hammered at home by rivals including Huawei Technologies, Vivo and Oppo. 
The maker of budget smartphones has since branched out into selling accessories and home appliances. In the third quarter of this year, Xiaomi overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become China's No.4 smartphone vendor, according to International Data Corp (IDC).
Xiaomi has also has re-launched sales in dozens of countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. The company was worth about $55 billion at the end of June, one person close to the company has said. 
""This is a good time for them (Xiaomi) to list because right now they are on a roll,"" said IDC's senior research manager for client devices, Kiranjeer Kaur. 
""If they get a good valuation, they will get it now,"" Kaur said. She, however, cautioned that the company needed to focus on retaining customers.
""Xiaomi will need to make sure that users upgrade to higher-end Xiaomi from lower-end Xiaomi instead of ditching it for other brands,"" she added.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 09:50PM ET</span>",India's record share sales bring banks little cheer in the way of fees,"By Devidutta Tripathy and Umesh Desai
MUMBAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Funds raised in India through share sales reached the most in a decade this year thanks to booming stock markets, but the rush to raise capital while investor sentiment remained bullish pushed dealmakers' fee ratio to multi-year lows.
India's main stock indexes surged almost 30 percent in 2017 as investors bet on economic reform and corporate earnings recovery. That spurred almost $30 billion worth of share sales including a record $11.5 billion in initial public offerings (IPO).
But for banks which arrange the sales, fees earned as a percentage of funds raised hit the lowest in four years, Thomson Reuters data showed. That made arranging work in Asia's third-largest economy the worst paid out of 11 Asian markets.
To be sure, the structure of Indian deal-making means fees are often comparatively small. But this year was particularly low because a high proportion of deals involved state-run firms which typically pay paltry fees.
Competition was also higher with dealmakers such as IDFC Bank Ltd and IIFL Holdings Ltd gaining market share, while entrants such as China's Haitong Securities Co Ltd made headway, industry participants said.
""In a buoyant market there is no cause for anxiety for issuers, so low fees are no surprise. In a weak market, issuers may be willing to pay higher fees but the number of issues are fewer,"" said Prithvi Haldea, chairman of data provider Prime Database.
""That said, India has been a low-paying market for years and that's unlikely to change anytime soon,"" he said.
UNATTRACTIVE
Bankers are optimistic about 2018's deal pipeline which they expect to include IPOs, real estate investment trusts and state-backed share sales. But some fear a continued market boom will keep fees low.
Fees this year averaged 0.8 percent of deal proceeds, from 1.3 percent last year, Thomson Reuters data showed. The average was 2 percent in Hong Kong, 2.6 percent in Shanghai and Shenzhen and 2.8 percent in Tokyo. New York averaged 3.2 percent.
""While fees in India (usually) are attractive in the Indian context, they are not probably as attractive in an Asian or a global context,"" said V. Jayasankar, head of equity capital markets (ECM) at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd's investment banking arm, which Thomson Reuters data showed arranged the most deals this year by total value.
Kotak and four other banks split a 0.1 percent fee for arranging the $1.7 billion IPO of state-run General Insurance Corp of India, the year's biggest IPO.
Six banks arranging a $2.3 billion follow-on share offering by State Bank of India - 2017's largest ECM deal - received a token fee of 1 rupee ($0.016), according to bankers. It is not uncommon for dealmakers to agree to such terms for the opportunity to take part in blockbuster deals.
UNDERWRITING
The low fees can be partially attributed to the structure of deal-making in India where, unlike elsewhere, banks do not risk underwriting share sales.
""We don't see a material change in the fees paid, and we are at least five to 10 years away from an underwriting fee model,"" said Jibi Jacob, head of ECM at Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd, 2017's sixth-ranked IPO arranger in India this year, Thomson Reuters data showed.
An increasing number of banks involved in each deal also means fees are being split between more dealmakers, said the ECM head at a multinational bank, who was not authorized to publicly comment on fees and so declined to be identified.
There is also a ""new cycle of people willing to go down the fee curve,"" the banker said.
UNDERSTAFFED
Looking at 2018, bankers including  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc's India ECM head Arvind Vashistha said they expected average IPO sizes to be larger, with fundraising picking up in sectors such as infrastructure, real estate, metals and mining.
""The big risk continues to be that of the global geopolitical environment and of valuations which in some cases have run up significantly. But the fundamental appetite for India paper in 2018 should continue to be very robust,"" said Vashistha at Citi, ranked second among share sale arrangers.
But low fees mean regardless of higher deal volumes, many banks - especially foreign banks with high cost structures - are not aggressively expanding ECM teams, bankers said.
""When you have limited resources and deal volumes pick up, I think the only thing we can do is be disciplined about which clients, what transactions, rather than trying to do everything,"" said a senior banker at a foreign bank's India arm.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 09:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. experts resign from monitoring China’s ZTE Corp - sources,"By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - Two consulting firms hired to help the United States police ZTE Corp’s compliance with trade sanctions have resigned, according to four people familiar with the matter.
China’s second-largest telecommunications company agreed earlier this year to pay a nearly $900 million penalty - the largest in a U.S. export controls case - and open its books to a U.S. monitor as part of a guilty plea for illegally shipping goods to Iran and North Korea. To read the Reuters report that exposed the practice, click goo.gl/rvNwr6
Guidepost Solutions and Larkin Trade International were hired in June by the U.S. monitor in charge of the oversight regime - Texas lawyer James Stanton - to help assess the company’s compliance with U.S. export control and sanctions laws, and reduce its risk of future misconduct, said the people, who wished to remain unnamed because the matter is not public.
In late August, the two firms parted ways with the monitor after clashing over his approach to the job, the people said. Although Reuters was unable to determine the exact reasons for the departure , Stanton initially restricted the consultants’ access to ZTE documents and officials, hindering their ability to help monitor the company, one of the people said. 
Stanton did not respond to multiple phone calls and emails seeking comment.  
Tina Larkin, the chief financial officer of Larkin International, declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Guidepost Solutions.
A lawyer for ZTE declined to discuss the departure of the consulting firms, or the company’s relationship with the monitor.
“We're looking to be cooperative and have a successful monitorship,"" said Matthew Bell, the head of compliance for ZTE in the United States.
The problems with efforts to monitor ZTE, unreported to date, are rooted in how a U.S. judge set up the policing program in March, according to interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the matter and a review of court documents related to the plea deal between ZTE and the U.S. government. 
U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade presided over the ZTE sanctions case because the Justice Department filed the plea agreement between the United States and ZTE in his court in Texas, where the company’s U.S. headquarters are located.
Before signing off on the plea deal, Kinkeade took the unusual step of having the agreement rewritten to put Stanton, a civil and personal injury lawyer, in charge of monitoring ZTE’s compliance with U.S. export controls, several people familiar with the matter said. 
The appointment was made despite the Dallas-based attorney’s lack of experience in U.S. trade controls. The order naming him was sealed, leaving additional details about the judge’s decision unclear.  
Generally, the Department of Justice chooses an independent monitor in a corporate criminal case from candidates proposed by the company, which is how the deal was originally set.
But ZTE and the Justice Department felt compelled to agree to Kinkeade’s choice and the changes to the monitorship agreement, sources said, because the plea had already been negotiated and filed in the judge’s court and a temporary license allowing ZTE to obtain U.S. made goods - crucial for the company’s output - was about to expire.   
While courts have been weighing in more often on monitors, John Hanson, president of the Virginia-based International Association of Independent Corporate Monitors, said it was extremely rare for a judge to modify a major part of a plea agreement between a company and the government to select his own monitor. 
Kinkeade and his courtroom deputy did not respond to inquiries about the monitorship and requests for comment.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which negotiated the guilty plea with the company, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Commerce Department referred questions to the U.S. Attorney's office in Texas, which also declined to comment. 
Stanton has to issue three reports, the first of which is due in January, on ZTE’s compliance with U.S. trade rules. The reports will help determine whether the company is liable for an additional fine of $300 million or, worse, should lose its access to the U.S. market.
Both Washington and Beijing have a lot riding on the reports and the success of the monitorship, which is set to last three years. The agreement allows the company continued access to the U.S. market, which provides 25 to 30 percent of the components used in its networking gear and smart phones. It is also part of a wider push by the United States to get China’s cooperation in combating nuclear proliferation and marks the first time that a Chinese company has submitted to such scrutiny. 
Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce Department official who worked on the ZTE case, said the first few months of a monitorship do not always determine success or failure.  
“With any monitorship involving a complex situation, inevitably there will be start-up problems but in my experience the issues work out in the long run,” said Wolf, who is now a lawyer in Washington D.C. 
“MY MENTOR, ED KINKEADE”
Kinkeade has known Stanton for over a decade. Both graduates of Baylor law school in Waco, Texas, Stanton dedicated a 2016 book, titled “What Judges Want” to Kinkeade, who he described as his mentor. 
""He guided me with grace and judgment as I became a lawyer, a husband, a father and a judge,"" Stanton wrote of Kinkeade in his book.  Stanton was appointed as a Texas state civil judge in 2009 and lost the election the following year.
In the modified ZTE plea agreement, references to required qualifications and experience were removed, and a clause about professionals assisting the monitor was added, according to a review of the original and modified documents.   
To compare the plea agreements, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2BV5Duq
Kinkeade also gave his own court a key role in overseeing the monitorship, including replacing the Justice Department as the arbiter in any dispute, and the monitor’s description was changed in one paragraph from “independent third-party” to ""judicial adjunct.” In an unusual move, the judge used a civil rule to make the monitor a judicial adjunct, despite it being a criminal case.
“Anyone who looked at this scratched his or her head,” said Washington lawyer Jacob Frenkel, who specializes in government investigations at Dickinson Wright and has represented monitors. “How do you appoint someone without requisite qualifications to the monitorship?” 
While monitors are not always subject experts, they generally are not appointed in major cases without some relevant experience, Frenkel added.
With the original consultants out, Stanton turned to Ernst & Young in August to advise him, two people familiar with the monitorship, said.
Since Ernst & Young has been ZTE’s auditor since 2004, some ethics experts including University of Virginia law professor Brandon Garrett said the hiring raised conflict of interest concerns about how independent the firm would be in assessing the company’s adherence to U.S. trade rules.
A spokeswoman for Ernst & Young declined to comment, as did a lawyer for ZTE.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 09:40PM ET</span>",Some U.S. automakers go slow on automatic emergency braking systems,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers installed automatic emergency braking technology that experts said could prevent thousands of deaths and injuries in just 19 percent of new vehicles sold in the 2017 model year, regulators and safety advocates said on Thursday.
Last year, 20 automakers struck a voluntary agreement with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to make collision-avoiding braking systems standard equipment on nearly all light vehicles by September 2022, representing 99 percent of all U.S. vehicle sales.
The push comes as U.S. traffic deaths jumped 5.6 percent in 2016 to a decade-high 37,461, and pedestrian deaths rose 9 percent to 5,987, the highest number since 1990. By 2025, standard automatic braking systems could prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated.
Automatic braking systems, which activate brakes when the technology senses objects ahead and the driver does not slow down, require more sensors and software than conventional brakes and add to vehicle costs. Automakers say they need time to engineer the systems that use radar or cameras into vehicles as part of more comprehensive makeovers.
Luxury automakers have been quick to install the systems, while others have lagged.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz unit have installed the technology on virtually all vehicles sold, according to figures released by NHTSA.
Toyota Motor Corp has the largest number of 2017 model vehicles with automatic emergency braking, equipping 56 percent of its fleet, or 1.4 million vehicles.
Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) VW brand has it in 36 percent of vehicles, while its Audi unit has it in 73 percent of vehicles. Its Porsche unit did not install the technology on any 2017 vehicles. Subaru Corp has the technology in nearly all vehicles sold.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) installed the technology on 20 percent of vehicles sold, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has it in 6 percent and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co just 2 percent - the lowest of any major automaker. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors did not install the technology on any 2017 vehicles.
GM said it continues to expand availability of automatic emergency braking, and about two thirds of its U.S. models offer the system.
Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said the automaker offers automatic emergency braking on a number of vehicles and has ""a plan to standardize over time."" 
Fiat Chrysler backs the 2022 commitment, and a spokesman said it is offering automatic emergency braking on a growing number of vehicles.

Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said automakers are ""playing roulette with the lives of consumers who cannot afford safety as a luxury."" He said NHTSA must write mandatory regulations, not rely on a voluntary agreement.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 06:00PM ET</span>","Big Boeing, Airbus strategies drive small plane deals","By Tim Hepher and Brad Haynes
PARIS/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing are pairing with smaller regional rivals to add sales at the lower end of their $100 billion-a-year commercial plane duopoly, but the two market leaders are also laying the foundation for a longer-term strategic contest against more powerful threats such as China.
U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) said on Thursday they were discussing a ""potential combination"" widely assumed to focus on jetliners, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
News of the talks comes just two months after Boeing's European archrival Airbus (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) 110 to 130-seat CSeries jet, the Canadian rival of Embraer's biggest E-Jets.
""This seems initially to be about blunting the offering of the CSeries,"" said consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group, one of the first industry-watchers to predict the move. ""One of the things the CSeries brings to Airbus is the ability to offer a broader product line."" 
Both Embraer's E-Jets, which generally range between 70 and 130 seats, and to a greater extent Bombardier's CSeries, overlap at the margins of the big-airplane portfolios of Airbus and Boeing, but the products are mainly seen as complementary. Boeing and Airbus smaller planes start at around 125 seats.
Such commercial tie-ups allow planemakers to offer package deals and expand opportunities for generating revenue and profit, a person familiar with the CSeries deal said.
Boeing now appears to be a convert to this approach after initially - at least in public - dismissing the deal between Airbus and Bombardier, several analysts said on Thursday.
But the proposed alliances, neither of which is finalised, are not simply about tacking on revenue and cash flow, analysts and industry sources said.
First, they could quickly lead to technical overlap.
""If Boeing begins to collaborate with Embraer, you could imagine them creating commonality in the Boeing cockpit,"" Lundquist said. Others see similar benefits at Airbus.
More importantly, they broaden the battlefront for the next round of developments in 2030 and beyond: one in which Western jetmakers will be up against growing competition from China and Russia and could rely on their new partners to spread the risk.
PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION
Boeing and Embraer had already prepared just such a tryst in confidential talks over a decade ago. 
In October, Reuters reported that the template for a possible Boeing-Embraer response to the Airbus-Bombardier deal already existed in dormant plans for a new generation of single-aisle planes, for which there had been a previously unreported collaboration between Boeing and Brazil.
Plans for an all-new plane were put on hold while Boeing and Airbus focused on engine makeovers for existing models, cashing in on fuel savings that were considered strong enough to hold off Chinese and Russian competitors for another 10 or 15 years.
But the blueprint for deeper co-operation between Embraer and Boeing remained in place and by breaking the status quo, Airbus's Bombardier deal may have brought it back to life.
""Embraer gives Boeing access to technology for smaller jets for application on a next-generation narrowbody aircraft,"" Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins said in a research note.
A source with knowledge of the matter said Boeing had already approached Embraer twice about a potential deal in 2002 and 2006. At the time, the Brazilian government vetoed any deal, saying Embraer was a ""strategic"" company for the country.
Brazilian President Michel Temer, who took office last year, has pushed a more market-friendly agenda than predecessors.
Deals with their smaller cousins may give Airbus and Boeing more options when they develop the successors to the best-selling Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, perhaps allowing them to offer a trio of large jets coupled to a pair of smaller ones.
For Boeing, however, there may be another gamble at play.
The American firm is considering launching a twin-aisle 220 to 260-seat jet in the so-called middle of the market, challenging Airbus in the segment where it began life over 40 years ago.
The timing of the talks leaves open the possibility that any core technology Embraer has to offer could be considered for the ""new mid-market airplane (NMA),"" people familiar with the matter said.
To some, that only increases the chances that Boeing will kick-start the project next year, taking pains at the same time to shore up the lower end of its market with an Embraer tie-up.

""Boeing would apparently prefer to do the NMA and taking on two major developments at once may be considered too ambitious,” Lundquist said.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 05:53PM ET</span>",Trump rail safety oversight in focus after Amtrak crash,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As investigators sift through the wreckage of this week's Amtrak train crash in Washington state, critics have begun questioning President Donald Trump's recent efforts to roll back or delay finalizing U.S. rail safety regulations.
Making American railroads safer drew renewed attention after the passenger train derailed on Monday morning while speeding onto a bridge, killing three passengers and sending about 100 people to hospitals.
The accident occurred as the U.S. Transportation Department is reviewing rail safety requirements or proposals set under prior administrations. The White House has promised a sweeping effort to eliminate regulations throughout government and cut at least two existing regulations for every new one.
Earlier this month, the department reversed a decision requiring crude oil rail tank cars to be fitted with an advanced braking system designed to prevent fiery derailments. The requirement to install electronically controlled pneumatic brakes had been included in a package of safety reforms the Obama administration unveiled in 2015 following a series of deadly derailments stemming from the U.S. shale boom.
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, called this month's move ""a senseless decision that endangers our communities by making oil by rail transportation less safe.""
The Transportation Department has defended the decision, saying the mandate's costs would be three times as high as the benefits it would produce. 
The agency has also delayed finalizing regulations proposed during the Obama administration to require railroads to run all trains with at least a two-member crew unless it got specific approval.
Train track safety inspections were another focus of the Obama administration, which said it planned to propose new rules to address ""dangerous track conditions and defects"" in order to prevent train derailments.
The Trump administration said in a document posted last week that the previous administration's initiative had been moved to the ""long-term action"" list, meaning it does not plan any additional action for at least 12 months on the proposal and could abandon it completely.
In their defense, administration officials complain that Senate Democrats have for months delayed a vote on Ronald Batory's nomination to head the Federal Railroad Administration, the top rail safety post, and say administration reviews of many railroad regulations are ongoing and no final decisions have been made as additional data is analyzed.
On Thursday, Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, called on the Senate Commerce Committee to quickly convene a hearing on the state of Amtrak safety standards and federal rail safety regulation.
""The traveling public needs to know that Amtrak and its regulator, the Federal Railroad Administration, are doing all they can to protect the safety of passengers who use this vital piece of our transportation infrastructure,"" Cantwell said in a statement, citing several major rail accidents over the last decade. 
Railroads note that derailment rates have fallen in recent years and that the train accident rate is down 44 percent since 2000.
But the biggest pending railroad safety issue is a government mandate to install a technology called positive train control to prevent derailments. Had the technology been operational for the stretch of track where Monday's derailment occurred, the crash might have been prevented.
In 2015, Congress delayed an end-of-year deadline for installing the technology by three years to the end of 2018 after lobbying by major railroads, including Warren Buffett's BNSF Railway Co [BNISF.UL]. The Transportation Department can extend the deadline again until the end of 2020. 
Railroads had argued for years that the initial 2015 deadline set in 2008 was unworkable and that they had spent billions to develop the technology. While many passenger rail companies and freight rail companies have installed the system, CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX).,  Norfolk Southern  Corp (NYSE:NSC) and Canadian National Railway Co expect to complete the effort by 2020, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Tuesday that the Trump administration must back the funding to ensure positive train control is implemented.
""The resources aren't preventing its installation; it is the will and determination to do so. The failure of federal authorities to require and provide support for positive train control is a moral choice this nation has made,"" Blumenthal said.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended the technology since 1970 and said that since then there have been more than 140 accidents across the country resulting in nearly 300 fatalities, more than 6,500 injuries, and millions of dollars in costs, which could have been prevented by positive train control.
Batory, the White House rail nominee, told a Senate panel in July he backed a regulatory approach to safety known as ""performance-based regulations."" Critics say that would allow railroads to largely self-regulate and would eliminate specific safety technology requirements.
Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska in June proposed legislation requiring regulators to consider adopting a performance-based approach rather than setting specific regulatory requirements.
Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a statement the Amtrak crash was not caused by the vacancy at the Federal Railway Administration, but said the agency needs leadership to advance safety issues and oversight. 
""The time for playing political games with the leadership of this railroad safety agency should be over,"" Thune said.

Thune on Thursday moved that the Senate unanimously confirm Batory, but Schumer objected and the motion failed.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian pharmaceuticals billionaire Barry Sherman failed to implement a succession plan at his Apotex business before his death last week, two business associates told Reuters, potentially leaving it vulnerable to takeover approaches. 
The bodies of Sherman, 75, and his wife Honey, 70, were found in their Toronto mansion last week and their deaths are under investigation by Toronto's homicide squad. A memorial service was held on Thursday. 
Sherman had always resisted approaches from trade buyers and never wanted to take the generic drugmaker public, the associates said, preferring to keep control and not involve outside shareholders. 
Despite stepping down as chief executive in 2012, the self-confessed workaholic continued to work seven-day weeks and twelve-hour days. None of Sherman's four children were interested in running the business and only one had worked at the company, the associates said. 
Sherman's son Jonathan, who has a degree in industrial engineering from Columbia University, took at job at the firm after graduating but quit after less than a year. 
Sherman founded Apotex in 1974 and grew it through a strategy of launching hundreds of lawsuits against competitors to overturn patent protection for their drugs. Apotex would then manufacture cheaper identical products that did not carry a brand name. 
The company now employs more than 10,000 worldwide with annual sales exceeding C$2 billion ($1.6 billion). 
The associates said no formal sales process is underway. Any approach would come as the world's biggest generic drug companies are grappling with declining drug prices and intensifying competition. 
Any potential buyer would also require an appetite for litigation, the associates said, since Apotex is regularly involved in legal actions over patents. 
And Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA), the world's biggest maker of generic drugs, is currently in a legal dispute with Apotex over allegations a former Teva executive shared trade secrets with Apotex CEO Jeremy Desai. 
Teva is also weighed by $35 billion in debt it took on to acquire Allergan's (N:AGN)  Actavis  generic drug business for $40.5 billion last year. Last week it said it would axe 14,000 jobs.

A Teva spokeswoman in Israel had no immediate comment when asked about any takeover plans or the status of its legal case against Apotex.

Shares of the world's largest footwear maker were marginally down at $64.36 in after-market trading.
Nike's second-quarter gross margins fell 1.2 percentage points to 43 percent due to stronger dollar and higher production costs, the company said.
The company's selling and administrative expenses for the quarter rose 10 percent as it spent more on advertising to create demand in the muted North American market. 
Fall in demand for its footwear and sports equipment in North America led to a 5 percent decline in revenue from the market but it was more than offset by increased demand from Greater China and European regions. 
Quarterly revenue from Greater China rose 16 percent and European region 19 percent. 
Net income fell to $767 million, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 30, from $842 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company earned 46 cents per share on revenue of $8.55 billion.

Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share and revenue of $8.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority will each fine Bank of America Merrill Lynch $13 million over brokerage account transactions that occurred mainly in 2010 and 2011 and were not properly policed for illicit activity, the sources said.
The firm will also enter into a cease-and-desist order.
One allegation is that the brokerage firm provided traditional banking services, such as wire transfers to offshore companies and cash deposits via ATMs, yet the transactions were not screened by bank software designed to flag potentially illicit activity, a source familiar with the impending fines said. 

Spokesmen for Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the SEC declined comment. A FINRA spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 04:56PM ET</span>",Boeing in talks with Embraer; Brazil backs jetliner alliance,"By Brad Haynes and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Planemakers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) are discussing a ""potential combination,"" they said on Thursday, in a move that could consolidate a global passenger jet duopoly provided Brazil's government gives its blessing.
Embraer's shares soared more than 20 percent in New York and Sao Paulo to close with a market capitalization of $4.5 billion after the statement, which did not give details of how a tie-up might be structured. Boeing shares slipped nearly 1 percent.
The Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer, would support a partnership in commercial aviation with Boeing but would block any takeover attempt, a senior government official told Reuters. 
The news comes just two months after Boeing rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jetliner program, a direct rival of Embraer's biggest E-Jets. Reuters reported at the time that the CSeries deal could push Boeing and Embraer closer together.
For decades, Canada's Bombardier and Embraer have faced off in the 70- to 100-seat regional jet segment just below the radar of Airbus and Boeing's larger commercial jet line-ups, but the CSeries alliance may have tipped that delicate balance.
Boeing has approached Embraer about a deal twice before, more than a decade ago, but was rebuffed due to the government's veto, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
ENDING GOLDEN SHARES 
Any tie-up involving Embraer requires approval by Brazil's government, which holds a 'golden share' in the planemaker, a formerly state-run company fully privatized in 2006. 
Brazil's President Michel Temer took office last year with a market-friendly agenda focused on privatizing state utilities and reducing political influence in state firms such as oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4).
In September, Brazil's Finance Ministry asked an audit court to study how the government could exit the golden shares it holds in former state monopolies.
Temer's policies contrast with those of the Workers Party that governed from 2003 until 2016, placing an emphasis on state-led development and 'national champions' in strategic industries.
Still, foreign control of the planemaker at the apex of Brazilian industry appears to be a stretch even for Temer.
""Embraer will never be sold in my government,"" he told military aides in a meeting on Thursday, according to a report by Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo.
Folha, which did not say how it obtained the information, said the meeting was called after a report in The Wall Street Journal that Boeing was in talks to take over Embraer.
A spokeswoman at the Defense Ministry, which works closely with Embraer on military programs, said it was premature for the government to say anything that could upset the talks. 
""They still have to consult the government. We are following closely but there is nothing concrete yet and anything we say now could be imprudent and harm the talks,"" said spokeswoman Adriana Fortes. ""Not even the companies have agreed on anything concrete.""
The two planemakers already work on projects including runway safety and alternative jet fuels. Their partnership intensified recently to include Boeing's commitment to joint sales and support of Embraer's KC-390 military airlifter.
""Although Boeing would look like a good fit with Embraer's Regional Jet business, this is not the case for the company's Executive Jet and Defense divisions,"" said Rob Stallard, aerospace analyst at Vertical Research Partners in a note.

Boeing is willing to take steps to protect Embraer's brand, management and jobs to help entice the government and is also willing to structure a deal to protect the government's interest in Embraer's defense business, the WSJ reported.

1162,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 04:54PM ET</span>",The Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
US macro data
The dollar is set for data-laden day as markets await the latest reading on inflation, durable goods and new home sales.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – is expected to rise to 1.5% in November year-on-year, compared to a 1.2% rise in the previous month.
The Commerce Department on Friday is expected to report a slowdown in core durable goods orders to 0.5% in November from 0.9% in the prior month, pointing to underlying weakness in business sentiment.
The upward trend in the number of buyers signing contracts to purchase existing homes is expected to have reversed November. Economist forecast Pending Home Sales fell 4.7% in August.
The dollar rose against its rivals on Monday after Janet Yellen reaffirmed the central bank’s view that raising rates gradually was the most appropriate policy amid uncertainty over inflation.
An update on Canada’s economic growth outlook 
Canada’s economic growth is expected to have cooled in November as economists forecast GDP grew at an annualised rate of 0.1% in November, following a 0.2% rise in the previous month.
Investor expectations for tighter monetary policy from the Bank of Canada rose on Thursday, after Canadian inflation data topped economists' forecasts. The Bank of Canada’s has raised interest rates twice this year.
Ahead of the data USD/CAD traded at C$1.2743.
Baker Hughes rig count
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by 4 to 747.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures settled 27 cents higher at $58.36 a barrel on Thursday amid recent bullish data showing US crude stockpiles fell for the fifth-straight week."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge overseeing the Justice Department's bid to stop AT&T (N:T) from buying  Time Warner  (N:TWX) said Thursday that he would deny a request to tighten protections on confidential data.
Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) had requested that a protective order on sensitive information be strengthened for fear that their data would be inadvertently exposed in a trial next year.
""I'm going to deny the order,"" said Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 
Disney and Fox have given data to the Justice Department, which is using it to build a case against AT&T's bid to buy Time Warner. The companies say they fear that executives with AT&T, which owns satellite TV provider DirecTV, could inadvertently gain access to it during the trial.
Leon had given access to confidential information to the court, Justice Department lawyers and staff, service providers and AT&T and Time Warner's outside counsel.
The Justice Department sued in November to stop AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless company, from buying Time Warner for $85 billion because of concerns that it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers and hamper the development of online video.

A trial to decide the matter is set to begin on March 19, and run about 15 days, according to a court filing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three main U.S. stock indexes rose on Thursday, boosted by bank and energy stocks as investors bet on more economically sensitive sectors.
Energy (SPNY) and financial (SPSY) stocks led gains among the 11 major S&P sectors. Financials have gained 21 percent this year, compared with a 20 percent gain for the S&P 500. Energy, by contrast, has underperformed this year, with a 4.2 percent loss year-to-date, and some analysts suggested that Thursday's gains reflected a rotation to stocks particularly responsive to economic growth.
""Today of late, (energy has) picked up significantly,"" said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management in New York. ""In particular, it reflects the effect of growth outside the U.S. and the demand for imports of oil...There's an opportunity to see oil run further.""
 Chevron  (N:CVX) shares jumped 3.3 percent. The shares earlier touched a record high of $125.35, after broker Cowen & Co raised its price target on the stock by nearly a third to $160.
The U.S. Congress approved a $1.5-trillion tax bill this week that will slash corporate income tax rates to 21 percent from 35 percent. Investors are hopeful that the lower rates will prompt companies to spend more on dividends and share buybacks.
""There's still the after-effects of tax reform being passed,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""I get the sense that the market is very optimistic about next year.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 55.64 points, or 0.23 percent, to 24,782.29, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 5.32 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,684.57 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 4.40 points, or 0.06 percent, to 6,965.36.
Adding to the upbeat sentiment, third-quarter data showed that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in more than two years, powered by robust business spending.
A separate report showed a jump in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a tightening labor market. 
The utilities sector (SPLRCU), among sectors likely to benefit the least from tax cuts, fell 1.2 percent, in a fourth consecutive day of declines.
Shares of Accenture PLC (N:ACN) rose 1.6 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts, driven by digital and cloud services business. The shares earlier hit a record high of $158.44.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.60-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Volume so far on U.S. exchanges was 6.08 billion shares, compared to the 6.88 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

The S&P 500 Index closed higher Thursday, buoyed by energy and financial stocks. While the U.S. GDP figure was trimmed on lower contributions from consumer spending and trade, the pace of expansion remained the fastest since early 2015, Commerce Department data showed.
“I think the best way to approach today is to recognize it’s a real mixed bag of data,” Steve Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities, said by phone. “The big story is the tax cut, and whether or not the tax cut will work or not in terms of driving up economic activity. Everyone has been such a growth optimist for years on the U.S. economy, and now they’ve got this fiscal move, and they’re not all convinced that it’s going to work dramatically.”
Core European bond yields rose for a fourth session as traders tidied up positions ahead of the Christmas holiday. Those in the periphery were mostly lower. Treasury yields dropped.
Equities in Europe steadied after two days of declines. The Stoxx Europe 600 index rose after a mixed session in Asia, as energy firms rallied with oil prices, outweighing a slump in utilities. Health-care and mining stocks pushed the FTSE 100 Index to a record close. Sterling and the euro both advanced.
The dollar gave up some early gains on the GDP report. The yen fluctuated as the Bank of Japan held rates and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said there’s no need to reconsider the current policy framework.
Oil rose to a two-week high. Gold and copper also gained.
Ballots are being counted in elections in Catalonia, where voters got another chance to express their view on whether the region should press its fight to break away or remain within Spain. 
A poll released as voting ended showed the separatists winning a very narrow majority, but the result was still too close to call. An exchange-traded fund that tracks Spanish equities fell from session highs after polls closed but still finished up on the day.

1180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",BlackRock Likes Japan Stocks Best After Emerging Markets Shares,"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). favors Japanese equities second only to emerging-market stocks because the nation’s corporate earnings look solid and share valuations are more attractive than in the U.S.
“We are overweighting equities in emerging markets, Japan, Asia and Europe,” Takeshi Fukushima, chief investment officer at the Japan unit of BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, said in an interview this week in Tokyo. “That’s not just because the economies are good in those regions, but also they have their own stories. In Japan’s case, corporate earnings are becoming stronger.”
Japan’s benchmark Topix index has rallied 20 percent this year as global growth has helped generate record Japanese corporate profits. Higher local earnings amid a sustained global economic recovery will boost the Topix to 2,050 by the end of next year, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities. That would be a 12 percent gain from Thursday’s close.
The estimated price-to-earnings ratio for Japan is 15 times for this year, compared with 20 times for the U.S. and 16 times for Europe, based on MSCI Inc. indexes.
Even as Japanese stocks have rallied, valuations haven’t changed much from earlier this year, because investors weren’t aware that companies would have such strong earnings, Fukushima said.
Earnings in the July-September period were above consensus forecasts and positive surprises outweighed negative for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to a report by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). last month.

Still Underweight
“The fact that Japan’s economy is in good shape has not yet been conveyed and overseas investors still have the old image” of stagnation, Fukushima said. “Global investors are still underweight Japanese stocks” so they may review their stance on Japanese equities.
Possible headwinds include any breakdown in talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. That would be an ominous sign for global trade and lead to a stronger yen and hurt Japanese export-related shares, Fukushima said, though he puts the odds of that scenario playing out at 20 percent.
BlackRock’s preferred plays are domestic demand-related value stocks, such as retailers and services, as well as technology shares, according to Fukushima. The company also is interested in small-to-medium sized companies which focus on labor-saving investment, those which benefit from a rise in foreign tourists, and increased participation of women and the elderly in the labor force.
“It’s important to keep a balance between momentum stocks and value shares,” Fukushima said. “Domestic demand-related value shares are not glamorous, but they will probably perform in line with our Japan growth scenario. On the other hand, momentum shares, such as technology shares, depend on the global economy.”
While BlackRock likes technology and financial shares globally, it is “neutral” on Japanese bank shares as they lack a positive story on their earnings, he said.

In a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton, the Chamber highlighted the extensive analysis the bill will require of many companies and asked for guidance on the circumstances in which a filing delay may be acceptable.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill to President Donald Trump for his signature.
The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies, allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes. 
The bill will significantly affect many companies' year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. 
Reuters reported on Thursday that refiners and pipeline companies are likely to embark on a capital spending spree due to the bill, while it will hurt debt-laden companies and potentially increase banks' short-term funding costs.
For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said.
""Companies may encounter difficulties in quantifying the impact of the new law, which could in turn lead to potential delays in filing periodic SEC reports on a timely basis,"" Neil Bradley, senior vice president and chief policy officer at the Chamber, wrote. 
""In this situation, we believe issuers and investors alike would benefit if the Commission or SEC staff provided guidance on the circumstances under which a delay in reporting may be appropriate, and the appropriate process to follow,"" he added. 
A spokesman for Clayton was not available for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. regulator overseeing  Fannie Mae  (PK:FNMA) and  Freddie Mac  (PK:FMCC) has reinstated a $3 billion capital cushion for each of the mortgage guarantors, citing the imminent tax overhaul.
The $3 billion cushion, which comes after Fannie and Freddie were expected to eliminate their capital reserves next year, would cover ""ordinary income fluctuations,"" the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Thursday. The two enterprises remain in government conservatorship after the subprime mortgage crisis and are still expected to pay out quarterly dividends to the Treasury, according to the terms of their government support.
The FHFA and the Treasury Department said Fannie and Freddie probably would also need additional government funds because of the upcoming sharp drop in the corporate tax rate. 
Once U.S. President Donald Trump signs the tax bill passed by Congress, the decline in the corporate tax rate will require Fannie and Freddie to write down the value of tax-deferred assets they hold.

Fannie and Freddie, which have been directed to shrink their capital reserves under the terms of their rescue, will probably need the $3 billion capital buffer, as well as future draws of federal government funds, to cover that upfront write-down, according to the Treasury and FHFA.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The once-hot online lending industry has been battered by scandal and losses since last year, but one of the oldest forms of lending - store credit - is increasingly attracting tech companies aiming to supplant a retailer's credit card.
One such lender, San Francisco startup Affirm, is attracting investment and large customers by using a new approach to underwriting that allows it to approve more borrowers than traditional store credit cards. 
Max Levchin, Affirm's founder who also co-founded one of the earliest digital payments companies, PayPal, boasts that Affirm approves 126 percent more borrowers than Synchrony Financial, the largest issuer of private-label credit cards. 
Merchants have enjoyed the boost in sales. Affirm recently finalized a deal to become the exclusive financing option for customers of mobile phone company Motorola (NYSE:MSI), replacing Motorola's private-label credit card. 
As of August, the most recent data available from a case study by the companies, purchases made with Affirm's loans represented 19 percent of all Motorola's sales.
""The point-of-sale market is monstrous,"" said Peter Renton, an independent industry analyst who hosts an online lending conference called LendIt. ""But it's been really low-tech.""
Companies like Affirm are using smartphone apps, online messaging with borrowers and instantaneous approvals, removing the paperwork from retail lending. 
Synchrony did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not able to independently verify Affirm's claim of loan approval rates. 
Some industry watchers worry about the fallout of risky lending. Affirm, which is not profitable, has not yet been tested by a downturn in the economy. 
""Long history will tell you, you have to be skeptical of someone saying they've cracked the code on underwriting,"" said Todd Baker, a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School and a consultant for financial services companies. ""You really won't know until the credit cycle turns.""
Long before the internet, stores such as Sears offered credit cards, and some built profitable financing arms. Private-label cards can provide stores with valuable consumer data and lower processing fees than general-purpose credit cards.
The total balance on store cards roughly doubled between 2007 and 2015 in the United States to $84 billion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But while people are buying more on credit, fewer people are opening new store accounts, with the number of accounts down from 2007.
The average in-store credit card has a 26.38-percent interest rate, with jeweler Zales and department store Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) Inc topping the list at 30 percent, according to a survey this year by CreditCards.com. 
'MORE APPROVALS AND MORE SALES' 
That has left an opening for tech companies touting what they claim to be more transparent, economical and convenient financial products in one of the few bright spots in online lending. 
Other parts of the industry, particularly marketplace lending, have suffered from controversy and poor performance. For instance, LendingClub Corp's CEO was forced to resign last year after a scandal over its loan-selling practices, and the company's market capitalization has collapsed from more than $9 billion in 2014 to about $1.7 billion.
Competing with Affirm is Klarna, founded in Sweden in 2005, which offers deferred payments and installment loans at more than 70,000 retailers, with merchants setting their own interest rates. Jim Lofgren, CEO for North America, said Klarna has been profitable for more than a decade.
San Francisco payments company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) in June started allowing customers of selected merchants to take out loans up to $10,000 to pay back over three months to a year. 
Affirm offers installment loans to shoppers at nearly 1,300 online retailers, financing purchases such as a new couch or mattress. The loans average $750 and generally have a pay-back period of three months to a year. There are no late fees but the average annual interest rate is still high, 19 percent.
Investors' familiarity with Levchin from his days at PayPal Holdings Inc has helped Affirm raise about $450 million in equity funding, including a $200-million round at a $1.75 billion valuation last week. [nL1N1OB13H] 
Affirm has issued loans this year totaling more than $1 billion. The company, which is private, declined to provide its default or delinquency rates, or say how often it rejects applicants. 
By comparison, Synchrony had more than $76 billion in purchases on its retail credit cards in the first three quarters this year and earned $9 billion on interest and fees, according to the company's financial earnings.
Levchin said Affirm is able to approve more loans than traditional private-label card providers because it looks at personal data, such as the borrower's debt-to-income ratio and bank account details, rather than simply relying on the borrower's credit score or credit bureau history.
This allows Levchin to lend to 20-somethings who maxed out credit cards in college and have a low credit score but a well-paying job to pay back the loan, he said. 

""We do bring more approvals and more sales, but we don't do this because we are more willing to take risks,"" he said.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 12:31PM ET</span>",U.S. holiday shopping season surging towards a strong finish,"By Nandita Bose
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A jump in consumer spending in the final stretch of December should build on a strong start to the U.S. holiday season and help the embattled retail industry beat sales forecasts, industry research groups said. The spending boost in December comes ahead of Super Saturday - the last Saturday before Christmas, which often sets the annual record for retail sales and is one of the busiest shopping days of the year along with Black Friday. 
In recent years, shopping in the final weeks has determined the success of the season. ""Across the board, the whole season is up pretty significantly this year versus last year,"" said Glenn Fodor, senior vice-president and head of information and analytics at payment processor First Data. 
 First Data Corp  (N:FDC), which collected data from point-of-sale systems of 1.3 million physical and online retailers, said strong demand for categories like electronics, appliances, building materials, furniture and home furnishings boosted overall retail spending. During Oct. 28 to Dec. 15 retail spending grew 5.4 percent from last year's 2 percent. 
During the five-day period between Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday this year it grew 8 percent from 5.8 percent last year, according to First Data. Brett Lambi, who works at an insurance brokerage and was Christmas shopping for a hand blender for his mother at Macy's on Chicago's State Street, said he felt better about spending this year than last year because of an improving job market. ""My budget is slightly more than last year but I feel more confident about making a purchase this year,"" he said. 
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported better-than-expected U.S. retail sales for November and revised its October figures upward, pointing to a jump in household spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Low unemployment levels, a strong job market, stock market gains and rising home values have contributed to the growing optimism and spending.In its mid-season holiday spending report, Mastercard Inc's (N:MA) SpendingPulse report said 2017 is projected to show the strongest holiday season sales growth rate since 2010, with the overall potential to surpass 5 percent year-over-year growth. ""This is a consumer saying I have got a job, gotten a raise, even expecting a bonus ... the economy is really humming,"" said Sarah Quinlan, senior vice president & group head, Market Insights. 
Mastercard tracks spending by combining sales activity in MasterCard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms. Quinlan also said e-commerce saw the largest share of holiday retail sales ever this year at more than 11 percent. Online shopping rose sharply this year, with Cyber Monday becoming the largest online sales day in history in the U.S. at $6.6 billion. The jump in spending prompted a retail consultant to raise his holiday sales forecast. Craig Johnson, president of consultancy Customer Growth Partners, told Reuters that he now estimates sales growth of 5.6 percent in November and December, up from his initial estimate of 4.3 percent. Johnson said he expects this year to be the strongest since before the great recession began in 2007, and sales momentum is likely to remain strong until the New Year. Despite the optimism, some analysts expressed caution over deepening discounts in December.""Given the important holiday shopping days remaining this year and in the context of deepening promotions since the Thanksgiving weekend ... we believe it is still premature to declare the holiday season a success,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note to clients. 

Apparel sales showed modest improvement over last year but still remained weak. That will pressure department stores like Macy's Inc (N:M), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS), and JC Penney (N:JCP), analysts and consultants said.The biggest beneficiary of the holiday season continued to be Amazon.com (O:AMZN), which outperformed its rivals again this year, they added.

1225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 12:00PM ET</span>","Crypto, Taxes & Volatility: A Hedge Fund Watch List For 2018","(Bloomberg) -- Even a new U.S. president and rising geopolitical tensions couldn’t stop stock markets from marching higher. But that’s about to change, money managers say.
They see a market correction, a ""reckoning"" with North Korea and a bitcoin ETF in 2018. Here are some of the top themes hedge fund firms - and those who invest in them - are looking for in the year ahead:
More Volatility
A pullback in quantitative easing by central banks globally could trigger a downward spiral in asset prices and spell a ""significant change"" for the macro trading environment, Paul Tudor Jones wrote Nov. 30. He compared the current bull market to the bubble of 1999. Low volatility is becoming ""dangerous"" and has lulled investors into a false sense of complacency, he wrote. His firm’s main fund lost 2.1 percent this year through Dec 8.
Assets most at risk are those reliant on low interest rates, such as highly-leveraged credit, illiquid securities and those that benefit from momentum trading, including FANG stocks —  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), London hedge fund manager George Papamarkakis said. These companies are ""definitely prime for a substantial correction"" next year given current valuations, he said.
Volatility spells good news for macro hedge funds and the outlook has renewed interest in the struggling strategy. Investors have moved nearly $15 billion dollars into macro funds this year through September, more than any other strategy, according to data provider eVestment.
Crypto Craze
Cryptocurrencies are hot. Mike Novogratz started a $500 million hedge fund to invest in the assets and bitcoin futures contracts began trading at Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) this month. What’s next? Some hedge fund startups plan to offer loans that use the cryptocurrency as collateral, but given the high volatility, expect steep terms.
""I think we will see a bitcoin ETF in 2018,"" said Jose Suarez, co-founder of $300 million hedge fund Silver 8 Capital, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups, and is up more than 800 percent this year through Dec. 19.

""Futures are already giving more legitimacy to the asset class and ETFs will give even more legitimacy, so more institutional investors will make it part of their portfolios. Still, the custodianship issue needs to be solved,"" he said, referring to security concerns involved with holding the currency.
Tax Policy
Yesterday, Congress passed the first major overhaul of the U.S. tax code in decades. Kevin Russell, who runs UBS’s $5.4 billion hedge fund unit, said the legislation bodes well for stock pickers because the changes will impact companies differently depending on their geographic location, net earnings, effective tax rates and the amount of debt they have. That will create greater price anomalies for traders to exploit.
Small and mid-cap stocks may see gains next year with new rules, said Jonathan Hook, chief investment officer of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, which allocates money to hedge funds. That’s because those companies ""tend to be higher taxpayers, so their returns should go up since their tax bill should be lowered,"" he said.
Hedge fund Roubaix Capital, which runs $103 million, agrees. The tax bill will be “the most significant fiscal event” for small-cap stocks for the foreseeable future. A corporate tax cut will create fresh opportunities on both the long and short side. For companies getting a tax break, “less than a third of this benefit is currently priced in,” the Denver, Colorado-based manager wrote in an email this week. For those firms that already pay little or no taxes, the new rules will have little effect on their earnings, “driving incremental short opportunities.”
Europe Positive
Europe is looking good to investors. Differing growth outlooks for countries across the euro zone is creating tradable opportunities for UBS’s hedge fund unit. ""For example, we see relative mispricings in bank credits with interesting opportunities across banks in Germany, France and Spain,"" Russell said.
European distressed credit, particularly non-performing loans and non-core asset sales from banks, are top picks for Infinity Capital Partners’ Jeff Vale, who invests in hedge funds. And Brevan Howard Asset Management is betting Greece will bounce back from almost a decade of crisis.
Banks and hedge funds had reduced exposure to Europe this year amid Brexit and other political uncertainty. That, along with a rise in passive investing, has created less active competition in the region, said Man GLG’s Pierre-Henri Flamand. In addition, new European MiFID II regulations will likely create a less-researched market, one that’s ripe for stock-pickers to shine, he said. ""It’s fewer people looking at the same investment opportunities,"" he said. ""It should be an excellent environment for long-short money managers.""
Banking on Banks
The future is bright for the credit quality of regional banks, says SkyBridge Capital senior portfolio manager Troy Gayeski. Their balance sheets have ""ample room"" to grow as corporate lending rises and a hike in interest rates could result in higher cash flows. They are also positioned to benefit from merger activity in the industry and the U.S. tax bill, which lowers the levy on corporations. Potential changes to the Dodd Frank financial regulations in the U.S. may also benefit the industry. To seize the opportunity, SkyBridge has ramped up its wager on regional and community bank Trust Preferred CDOs, which are collateralized debt obligations with both equity and subordinated debt-like features.
Banks in peripheral Europe are favored by Oceanwood Capital Management’s Julian Garcia Woods. Spain’s Liberbank has been ""unfairly punished"" in the wake of Banco Popular’s June collapse, he said. Northern Italy’s Banca Popolare di Sondrio has a strong balance sheet and yet ""the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater,"" Woods said. The industry is under the microscope of the European Central Bank, so ""there is constant fear of equity dilution, even if the underlying economy is strengthening,"" he said.
Watch List
Apart from trading ideas, here are key events in the industry for 2018:
In January, hedge fund legend Steven Cohen can once again trade client capital. He was banned after his former hedge fund pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a record $1.8 billion in penalties. (Cohen himself was not charged with any wrongdoing.) Terms for the potential new fund are already raising questions among some investors. The new year is expected to bring clarity on whether investors will jump in or see the price-tag as simply too steep.

Other firms to watch: Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp., Paulson & Co., Caxton Associates and Brevan Howard. It’s been an especially painful year for these funds, which have seen assets plunge and performance wither. Jones shuttered one of his firm’s funds in November and Andrew Law’s Caxton is grappling with one of the worst losses in the macro-trading universe this year. The chiefs of both funds are betting if they manage more of the money and risk themselves, it will help turn things around.

Geopolitical tensions remain an over-arching question mark that could change the course of trading quickly.
The new year could bring a “sort of reckoning with North Korea,” said the Weinberg Foundation’s Hook. Michael Hintze, who runs credit-focused CQS, cited strained relations with the nation as one 2018’s ""potential potholes."" For Russell, tensions with the Middle East appear to be the market’s ""mini blind spot.""

WALLKILL, NEW YORK (Reuters) - Joshua and Amy Hightower drive 40 minutes to a Toys 'R' Us Inc store in a blue collar neighborhood in Wallkill, one of the farthest reaches of the New York City suburbs, so their children can try toys at an amusement area dubbed the ""play lab.""
""We were actually here last night and last week,"" said Amy Hightower, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mom as her daughter played house and her two sons raced cars in the play lab, which Toys 'R' Us launched in 42 of its stores this year.
""It is hard to get them away from this area,"" she said.
The Hightowers may be ideal Toys 'R' Us customers, but so far there has not been enough of them. Many shoppers now make their toy purchases online. Foot traffic at Toys 'R' Us, the largest U.S. toy retailer, has declined, as consumers turn to e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), mass discount chains, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), and some small independent toy stores.
For a graphic on the changing toy retailer landscape, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2BuQGMW
As Toys 'R' Us aims to exit bankruptcy in 2018 after defaulting on its debt last September, its efforts to reinvent its stores with play labs will shape how other retailers look to experiential shopping to tackle e-commerce.
The holiday shopping season, when 75 percent of all toy sales are made, is a key test of this strategy.
Toys 'R' Us has set aside more than $400 million out of its $3.1 billion in bankruptcy loans for sprucing up its approximately 900 stores over the next three years with more experiences and better-paid staff.
The company's creditors are wary of these plans, according to sources close to the situation who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Creditors can ask the bankruptcy judge to stop Toys 'R' Us from spending on play labs or other experiential aspects, if they view the costs as excessive. 
In bankruptcy court papers, Toys 'R' Us has argued it cannot wait until it emerges from bankruptcy to invest in its stores. The retailer also plans to close unprofitable locations and improve its website and loyalty programs.
Dave Brandon, who became Toys 'R' Us chief executive in 2015 after spearheading a turnaround at Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ), defended the strategy in an interview, saying that bricks-and-mortar stores and experiential shopping were important to the retailer's brand. 
""We think our scale is a huge advantage, because we have a brand that's nationally and globally known,"" Brandon said.
Toys 'R' Us aims to offer shopping experiences like those found at Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (N:DKS),  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) and Ulta Beauty Inc (O:ULTA), Brandon added.
To be sure, Toys 'R' Us may end up with little to show for its investment, industry experts said. Experiential shopping is expensive to scale up for big box retailers that rely heavily on seasonal hiring, they said.
""There is a chance that Toys 'R' Us could be out of business in the next two years entirely in the United States,"" said Stephanie Wissink, a consumer products analyst at investment bank Jefferies LLC. ""My fear is that they are not selling goods to a consumer that values that experience."" 
Other toy retailers offering shopping experiences, such as stuffed animal shop  Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc  (N:BBW) and The Lego Group have also posted sales declines. Sales at Build-A-Bear declined 7 percent to $364 million last year from $392 million two years prior. 
INDEPENDENT TOY STORES
Regional independent toy retailers have also been taking market share away from Toys 'R' Us, thanks to merchandise that extends beyond mass-market toys, strong customer service and products that accompany school lessons.
Those chains also seek to cater to local tastes in a way Toys 'R' Us has not. ""Stores in Texas buy cheerleading stuff a lot, there's a big football community,"" said Sharon DiMinico, chief executive of Learning Express Inc, a U.S. toy store franchiser with about 120 independently-owned stores.
Steven Aarons, the owner of four-store chain Barstons Child's Play in the Washington, D.C. area, said he is able to offer entry-level wages of $15 per hour and health insurance to full-time workers because he has cheaper rent and does not have to answer to investors.
In Wallkill, Toys 'R' Us hired new employees like Nora Hanlon to oversee the store's Play Lab, which is a cordoned off foam mat, scattered with toys and a picnic table nearby where parents can sit. Boxes marked for layaway surround it.
""I get minimum wage, but it's a really fun job,"" said Hanlon, a high school student and part-time Play Lab Coach, sporting a reindeer headpiece. 
Toys 'R' Us also plans to hire more skilled workers. About $72 million of the $400 million the retailer will use for its redevelopment will go toward wage increases. 
The chain's efforts to emulate features of independent stores underscores the dramatic reversal of its fortunes. As the chain grew its national footprint, it wiped out mom-and-pop shops decades ago. But its glitzy Fao Schwarz store and flagship Times Square (NYSE:SQ) location featuring a Ferris Wheel were too pricey.
Earlier efforts with experiential stores called ""Geoffrey,"" named after its giraffe mascot, failed. Its $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005 led to expensive interest payments that ate up cash Toys 'R' Us could have used to improve stores.

""Can they somehow turn their stores from a warehouse into a play area?"" said retail consultant Howard Davidowitz. ""That is a big jump.""

1233,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",U.S. tax bill provision likely to spark EU trade dispute: legal experts,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - The sweeping tax bill awaiting President Donald Trump's signature includes a tax break for U.S. exporters that appears to contravene World Trade Organization rules and is likely to spark a major trade dispute with Europe, legal experts said. 
For some U.S. companies, the provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed both houses of Congress this week could be twice as generous as the Foreign Sales Corporation scheme, which was abolished around 2006 after causing one of the biggest transatlantic trade disputes of recent decades.
The provision taxes earnings from exports of ""intangibles"" at around a 13 percent rate against a 21 percent corporate tax rate overall. The bill does not define intangible but it is understood in business terms to include patents, trademarks, copy-righted material and know-how. 
A Reuters analysis of past corporate filings suggests the measure on ""foreign-derived intangible income"", or FDII, could save U.S. companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walt Disney, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) billions of dollars. 
Legal experts and the European Commission said it appears to amount to an export subsidy, which effectively allows U.S. companies to undercut European competitors on their own turf. 
""We seem to be facing another, repackaged, version of the Foreign Sales Corporation saga. The United States seems to have not learned,"" said Folkert Graafsma, a WTO expert with law firm VVGB in Brussels.
""The newly proposed rule seems prima facie manifestly inconsistent with standing WTO law and practice,"" he said.
U.S. companies export hundreds of billions of dollars worth of software, technology, patent rights and other intangible goods each year, trade data shows. 
The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, wrote U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the bill was passed to say the measure appeared to be at odds with the WTO treaty, which governs how signatories tax cross-border trade.
""... the draft U.S. tax bill as it currently stands contains elements that risk seriously hampering trade and investment flows between our two economies,"" said the letter, dated Dec. 12. ""We believe it is in our joint interest to avoid this.""
A study of the bill released on Monday by a dozen U.S. tax and legal academics said the FDII provision ""likely violates WTO obligations"". 
Four legal experts consulted by Reuters shared their view.
""A WTO complaint by the EU seems to be very likely,"" Prof. Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann, a trade law expert with the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, told Reuters.
Microsoft, Bank of America, Starbucks and Oracle declined to comment. Disney did not respond to requests for comment.
The House Committee on Ways and Means, which helped write up the tax bill, said it was drafted to be ""consistent with WTO requirements"". 
""This bill simply levels the playing field – so American businesses can compete and win anywhere around the world – including here at home,"" a committee spokesperson said in answer to Reuters questions.
EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS 
Most of the European business groups contacted by Reuters said they were still examining the implications of the measure. Britain’s largest business lobbying group, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said it saw risks.
""The risk of retaliatory action from other governments to the proposals in the U.S. is a real one,"" said Annie Gascoyne, CBI's Head of Economic Policy.
WTO rules clearly state that lower tax rates on profits from exports constitute an unlawful subsidy, Petersmann said.
""If a U.S. sales or income tax is reduced on condition of the exportation of the goods or intangibles concerned, it seems to be a subsidy 'contingent upon export performance' as prohibited by Article 3.1(a),"" he said.
Article 3.1(a) was the rule which led to a WTO judgment against the United States over the Foreign Sales Corporation regime in 2000.
The scheme, which ran in various forms from 1984 until around 2006, allowed U.S. companies to structure their earnings in such a way as to benefit from an effective reduction in tax of around 15 percent on the export of physical products as well as intangible goods and services.
Big manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) were the best-known beneficiaries of the regime. 
The exact benefit to U.S. companies of the FDII tax break will depend on what tax planning strategies they already have in place and how much of a company's export earnings will be classified as ""intangible income"". 
Reuters went through the annual reports and presentations to analysts of more than 100 U.S. companies, randomly picked, going back 20 years, and found 26 firms that noted that they benefited from the Foreign Sales Corporation scheme.
Of those 26, half were businesses whose exports were mainly of intangible goods, including drugmaker Merck (NYSE:MRK), coffee chain Starbucks, software group Oracle and technology giant  IBM  (NYSE:IBM). 
The 13 companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment for this story. But a Reuters analysis of their past corporate filings showed the regime offered big benefits.
Walt Disney Co., the vast majority of whose exports are intangibles such as movies and video games, said in annual reports between 2002 and 2005 that the regime allowed it to reduce its overall effective tax rate by around 3 percentage points annually. 
If the new export tax break generated similar savings as the old one, and Disney remained as focused on exports as it has in the past, it could save the company more than $250 million a year, based on its $9 billion annual earnings.
The company could end up even better off than under the Foreign Sales Corporation scheme, however, even without all its exports covered.
That's because paying a 13 percent tax rate rather than 21 percent on foreign-derived intangible income would allow U.S. companies to reduce the tax they pay on qualifying exports by 38 percent – more than twice the 15 percent reduction effectively offered under the older tax break. 
Jeffrey Korenblatt, a tax attorney with law firm Reed Smith in Washington D.C., said companies will now begin to examine how much of the profit on their exported goods and services can be ascribed to intangibles. 
Even for manufacturers of heavy equipment, a considerable amount of value can be linked to patents and trademarks, he said.
""People will be doing the modelling,"" he said.

1234,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",U.K.'s Secret Brexit Studies Reveal That Airbus Makes Planes,"(Bloomberg) -- For months, journalists tried to get their hands on government papers setting out how leaving the European Union will affect different parts of the British economy. They contained, according to Brexit Secretary David Davis, “excruciating detail.”
But despite boasting about their contents, ministers were reluctant to let anyone else see the documents. In November, after being forced to give way by a vote in Parliament, the government allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions. Their phones were confiscated, and they were only permitted to make notes with pen and paper, lest too much information leak into the public domain.
“These documents in aggregate represent the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue to date,” Davis wrote this month, explaining why he was being cautious about publication.
On Thursday, the documents were released online. There was detail, as promised.
“The parts of an aircraft can be simplistically split into three areas,” began the first, on aerospace. It was explained what the industry makes: “structures which include the nose, fuselage, wings, engine nacelles (which encase the engines) and tail; propulsion system which includes engines and propellers, or fan blades; and systems which include the electronics used in the flight system.”
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus
It went on to reveal that there are two companies in the world that make large passenger aircraft. Now that the documents are public, these firms can be named as  Boeing Co  . and Airbus SE.
The paper covering the insurance and pensions sector, which employs one in every 100 British workers, is 2,732 words long. “Insurance business operates by firms writing insurance policies for clients, intermediated by brokers,” it reveals. “Insurance firms in turn can pass on excess risk to reinsurance firms, via reinsurance brokers. Insurance underwriting requires large amounts of capital, so the industry tends to be dominated by large firms.”
191-Word Explanation
Each document begins with a 191-word explanation that it is simply a summary of other documents the Brexit Department possesses.
“Our analysis is not, nor has it ever been, a series of impact assessments examining the quantitative impact of the U.K.’s EU exit on the 58 sectors,” the department explained in a statement. “As our analysis does not exist in the form parliament requested, we took time to bring together information in a way that met parliament’s specific ask.”
The final part of each document, titled “Sector Views,” has been held back at the government’s request, as it explains what companies have said to ministers about Brexit.
Lawmakers were unimpressed. “Most of this could be found on Wikipedia or with a quick Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search,” said David Lammy of the opposition Labour Party. “David Davis clearly misled the House and then set his civil servants the unenviable task of coming up with these documents in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises.”"

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>","Accenture's digital push boosts earnings, shares hit record","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing services firm Accenture Plc's (N:ACN) quarterly earnings and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts, as investments in fast-growing digital and cloud services paid off.
Shares of Accenture, which have risen about 30 percent this year, rose 4 percent to a record high of $157.93 in on Thursday morning.
The company also lifted its forecast for yearly earnings per share and gave a forecast for current-quarter revenue largely ahead of analysts' expectations.
Revenue from Accenture's digital, cloud, analytics and security-related services - a group it calls ""the New"" - made up 55 percent of overall revenue in the first quarter ended Nov. 30.
""The primary driver of our growth in the quarter continues to be the New,"" Accenture Chief Financial Officer David Rowland said on a call with analysts.
Indeed, much of Accenture's recent growth has been driven by digital and cloud services, which include everything from managing clients' social media marketing strategies to helping them move operations to the cloud.
Another bright spot for Accenture was revenue from the healthcare and public services industry, which rose nearly 9 percent and exceeded growth in prior quarters.
The result came despite warnings from the company of weak client spending amid uncertainty around U.S. healthcare law.
""Based on the results of last quarter, businesses were feeling more confident and the spending clearly improved since last quarter,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said.
Accenture has also grown rapidly by buying smaller companies and has invested some $3.4 billion on about 70 acquisitions over the past three years.
About half of that amount was spent in fiscal year 2017 alone as Accenture ramped up digital and cloud investments, helping it gain market share from Cognizant (O:CTSH) and  IBM  Corp (N:IBM).
The company expects to spend another $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion on acquisitions in fiscal year 2018.
The Dublin-based company expects an annual tax rate of 22 to 24 percent, down from a prior expectation of 23 to 25 percent.
The forecast does not include the impact of an expected overhaul of the U.S. tax code, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
Net income attributable to Accenture rose 11.8 percent to $1.12 billion. On a per-share basis, earnings were $1.79, ahead of analysts' average forecast of $1.67 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net revenue rose nearly 12 percent to $9.52 billion, topping analysts' expectations of $9.26 billion.

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:43AM ET</span>",Special Report: How Philip Morris is selling regulators on its hot new smoking device,"By Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter, Duff Wilson Thomas Wilson, Ami Miyazaki and Aditya Kalra
TOKYO/TEL AVIV/BOGOTA (Reuters) - In Tokyo's upscale Ginza shopping district, around the corner from the sparkling storefronts of Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) and Cartier, shoppers searching for a new device called iQOS can buy it in a boutique behind a glass façade. The store combines a high-tech aesthetic with the feel of an exclusive club: The young woman at the door says a members-only smoking lounge is upstairs.
The device is advertised under the slogan, ""This changes everything,"" with a hummingbird in fluorescent green and blue floating in midair. From the small ""i"" of its name when it was rolled out to the minimalist white box it comes in, the iQOS evokes the marketing-and-design savvy of the American technology giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
But this little machine is sold by the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM). And it isn't a smartphone.
The iQOS is essentially an electronic cigarette that heats – without burning – plugs of tobacco, releasing tendrils of nicotine-laced aerosol. And the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value, which has spent more than $3 billion in developing new smoking devices, says iQOS is nothing less than its future.
Philip Morris International says the lack of combustion means iQOS produces far lower levels of carcinogens than regular cigarettes. It's early days, but iQOS is already bringing in piles of cash. The device drove up sales of the company's new-generation smoking products to nearly $1 billion in the last quarter, from some $200 million just a year ago.
Wowing consumers with the prospect of a less harmful smoke built on flashy technology is essential to iQOS' rapid success. Consumers, though, aren't the only target. Interviews with government officials and trade groups reveal how the company is seeking to sell national authorities on the benefits of the device, before regulators can toss up hurdles.
A key objective: convince governments of iQOS' benefits so they don't slap the same taxes and restrictions on the device as they do on cigarettes.
Philip Morris is employing a novel argument: The tobacco plugs inserted into the iQOS device shouldn't be classified as cigarettes because they do not burn or produce smoke. And the device itself, the company says, is an electronic product and so should not be regulated like tobacco.
In Japan, Philip Morris blitzed officials with the science of iQOS to persuade them to classify the device in a way that would lead to a lower tax rate than cigarettes. In Israel, the company flew in an executive to convince a senior health official of the upside of the device. And in Colombia, the health ministry says Philip Morris launched iQOS without seeking the agency's approval.
The approach is outlined in internal company documents seen by Reuters.
Evidence that iQOS ""is 'not smoked' is the most critical element,"" says a 2014 PowerPoint briefing on iQOS and other new smoking devices.
Reuters has published that document and others in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (http://reut.rs/2sT51xF)
Other traditional cigarette companies, notably  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc, have launched similar devices. None have reported anything close to the global sales of iQOS.
UNLIKELY VENUE
The iQOS is championed by Andre Calantzopoulos, Philip Morris International's chief executive, who in media interviews makes the point that he smokes the device. In September last year, Calantzopoulos told investors it was the company's ""aim to become the undisputed leader"" of a new tobacco category it dubs ""reduced-risk products."" The goal he said, is to have ""RRPs"" ultimately replace regular cigarettes.
Philip Morris now has an application pending at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the device in America as being less harmful than cigarettes.
A Reuters investigation published Wednesday identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant's application to the FDA. Former Philip Morris employees and contractors described irregularities in those experiments.
The company chose Japan as its first iQOS market, launching in late 2014. If the company could achieve its goals in ""priority"" markets like Japan, it would provide ""good reference points to other countries,"" said the 2014 Philip Morris presentation on reduced-risk products like iQOS.
It unveiled the device in an unlikely venue – Nagoya, a city of more than 2 million people on a bay of the Pacific Ocean. Nagoya is close to Toyota Motor Corp's headquarters, a town of skyscrapers and automotive plants; a place with neither the buzz of Tokyo nor the charm of Kyoto.
At first, business lagged. An internal company review of Asia, dated June 2015, put iQOS sales figures toward the end of the Japan market rundown. It showed iQOS sales dropping about 40 percent from that January to May.
Philip Morris pushed ahead with a national expansion in September 2015. In an in-house newsletter for the Japan operations the next month, Ashok Rammohan, director of reduced-risk products, told employees that ""building iQOS will take time and focus as we need to educate LAS"" – legal-age smokers.
By early 2016, the buzz surrounding iQOS in Japan was growing, thanks in part to a group of Japanese entertainers. That April, six popular Japanese comedians were on a national TV show when the presenters began to talk about smoking. One of the comedians, Terumoto Goto, a household name, held up a red iQOS.
""It doesn't release smoke,"" he explained. ""It's like steam coming out of my mouth."" The five men sitting around him on the TV set, decorated with bright rainbow stripes, held up iQOS units as well.
Goto said he bought an iQOS because his wife wouldn't let him smoke cigarettes inside their house and the neighbors didn't like him standing around and smoking outside.
Toshiyuki Itakura, just behind Goto, chimed in about smoking the device in public: ""There doesn't seem to be any harm.""
Searches on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for the Japanese word for iQOS spiked that day.
The talent agency that represents Goto and Itakura, Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd, said in a statement: ""Our company received absolutely no payment from Philip Morris or affiliated companies"" for the appearance. The network that carried the show, TV Asahi Corp, said it did not consult with the tobacco company beforehand.
'THAT IQOS MOMENT'
That promotional bump came during a period when Philip Morris was working to use social media to propel iQOS into the national consciousness.
""That IQOS moment."" ""My IQOS way of living."" Those are two of the catchphrases the company's social media team considered using as catalysts to promote online chatter about the device. The guidance appears in a 2017 online-content strategy paper, marked ""confidential,"" that cites examples from Japan.
A separate document, a 54-page training handbook for social media teams in 2016, warns that the company's postings walk a fine line. ""Since the law is set up to prevent tobacco companies from promoting their products on social media, and iQOS is a product that uses tobacco, you'll always be walking through a minefield of sorts,"" the document says.
Away from the public eye, Philip Morris employees equipped with pages of scientific findings were lobbying government officials in Japan. They set out to convince regulators to tax iQOS at a lower rate than cigarettes and exempt it from ordinances that ban smoking in public places and restaurants.
Koki Okamoto, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, said the city's planned public smoking regulations almost certainly will exempt iQOS. ""My personal view, as a lawyer, is that there will be reluctance to apply penalties to something without scientific evidence on health hazards,"" said Okamoto, a lead for tobacco control issues in the party that won the capital's elections this July.
To date, Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS. 
Philip Morris executives say the product is meant only for people who would not otherwise quit smoking. That is inconsistent with where the company has chosen to introduce iQOS. 
Industry sales numbers show Philip Morris is selling iQOS almost entirely in countries where cigarette sales are already in decline – in other words, where people are quitting. While the global average for cigarette sales was down 1.9 percent from 2005 to 2016, in 30 countries where iQOS is now sold the drop in sales was about 30 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of industry numbers from Euromonitor International.
Philip Morris said in response that there are more than 180 million smokers in the countries where iQOS has been launched. ""Those 180 million people deserve an opportunity to switch to a potentially less harmful product than cigarettes,"" the company said.
As the company honed its strategy in Japan – impressing officials with its scientific findings while advocating for lower taxes – it set out to conquer new markets.
HOLY LAND LAUNCH 
More than half a year before iQOS launched in Israel, Moira Gilchrist, a corporate affairs vice president for reduced-risk products, flew into the Holy Land and took a March 2016 meeting with a senior health ministry official to talk about the company's science.
A few weeks after that meeting, the official, Itamar Grotto, sent a letter to the country's tax authority saying iQOS was in a new product category exempt from marketing and advertising restrictions on tobacco products. In a later court filing, Philip Morris cited the letter in explaining its decision to launch iQOS in Israel. 
Asked why he said iQOS was exempt from tobacco regulations, Grotto told Reuters that the ministry was being cautious after losing a case against e-cigarette companies a few years earlier. Grotto also said he thought at the time that the question of regulating iQOS was ""theoretical."" He had understood from Philip Morris that it did not plan to market the device in Israel until it had approval from a European or American regulatory authority, Grotto said. 
Told of Grotto's remarks, Philip Morris said in a statement, ""We did not state that PMI would wait for the approval of a foreign regulatory authority.""
In Israel, iQOS has faced obstacles. This March, a group headed by an activist named Shabi Gatenio challenged the health ministry and Philip Morris in the country's top court over the sale of iQOS without the same marketing restrictions imposed on regular cigarettes. An Israeli tobacco company also challenged the government and Philip Morris in a similar filing. 
During an interview in Tel Aviv, Gatenio, 45, marveled at the reach and access of Philip Morris. He said within two and half hours of his filing the court petition, before it had become public, he got a text message from Erez Gil-Har, co-chief executive of Policy Ltd, Philip Morris’ powerful lobbying company in Israel. The message, viewed by Reuters, accused Gatenio of becoming a “tool” in the hands of the local tobacco company – a charge he dismisses. 
Gil-Har, who attended the meeting with Grotto and Philip Morris' Gilchrist, declined to comment. The tobacco company, Dubek Ltd, declined to talk as well.
Before the court could give a final ruling, the health ministry reversed its position and said it would treat iQOS as it does traditional cigarettes. The ministry said it planned to revisit its decision after seeing how the U.S. FDA regulates the product.
The about-turn left Philip Morris scrambling. According to a government official familiar with the matter, Philip Morris hired more than two dozen women for an urgent task: They manually peeled off the old labels from thousands of tobacco-insert packs in a warehouse near Tel Aviv and stuck on new ones with more prominent health warnings. The packs were then released.
'DERIVED FROM TOBACCO'
Half a world away in Colombia, Philip Morris kicked off its sale of iQOS this March with a large white balloon at a music festival. Emblazoned with ""iQOS"" in blue and green letters, the balloon was hoisted 20 feet in the air by a crane.
Tobacco advertising and promotion are banned in Colombia, the first country in Latin America to get iQOS. According to a health ministry official, Philip Morris launched iQOS without getting approval from the agency to sell the tobacco inserts in the country as is required by law. 
""This is a product which is derived from tobacco and which must have a prior evaluation by this ministry,"" said senior health ministry official Jose Fernando Valderrama. 
Philip Morris said it is in compliance with Colombian law. The company said it is required to submit the tobacco inserts for health ministry approval following the release of the agency's tobacco warnings in November each year. Its Colombian affiliate will do so ""in the next month,"" the company said in a Dec. 7 statement to Reuters.
On a stroll through the capital Bogota a few months ago, iQOS could be seen being sold at the front of a restaurant with bright displays of packs of the tobacco inserts and the hummingbird emblem facing the sidewalk. In a trendy quarter of the city, a large white billboard advertised a coming ""iQOS Boutique,"" next to a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and an Apple retailer. 
A former Philip Morris employee in Bogota said the company's position is that because the device itself does not include tobacco, unlike the inserts, marketing restrictions don't apply to it.
The company confirmed that position, saying iQOS is an electronic device, and ""as such, the current tobacco law does not regulate its commercialization as a tobacco product.""
Back in Japan, sales of the device have taken off. Philip Morris says the iQOS tobacco inserts made up 11.9 percent of the Japanese tobacco market in the third quarter, up from 3.5 percent a year ago.
That growth took on additional significance for company revenue in light of the lower tax rates. The iQOS kit retails for about 11,000 Japanese yen, roughly $100. The company said that cigarettes in Japan are taxed at 60 percent, while the iQOS tobacco inserts – priced about the same as a pack of Marlboros – are at 51 percent. 
Philip Morris shows no signs of slowing down. Paul Riley, president of the company's operations in Japan, this January called on Emiko Takagai, who as a former vice health minister is an influential voice on national health policy. They met in Takagai's seventh-floor office in Tokyo, one decorated with stuffed animals and posters of healthy food groups.
During that conversation, Riley laid out the company's pitch on iQOS, said Takagai. In documents later sent to her office, Philip Morris said the product reduces the levels of harmful substances by at least 90 percent compared to regular cigarettes.
When Reuters in August interviewed Takagai, a member of the upper house of parliament for the nation's ruling party, it seemed the tobacco giant's message was hitting home. 
If the company's scientific claims bear out, she said, ""we must make efforts to thoroughly tell people.""

(Reuters) - As corporate America celebrates one of the biggest-ever cuts to its tax bill, one corner of Wall Street is fretting over the impact the reforms will have on its ability to profitably invest in companies. 
Private equity firms that buy companies only to sell them a few years later at a profit face restrictions on their ability to deduct the interest these companies pay on their debt from their taxes, according to legislation approved on Wednesday by U.S. lawmakers and set to be signed into law by President Donald Trump. 
The changes are a blow to the industry's business model of larding companies with debt to juice returns. They could make it more difficult and less profitable for buyout firms to outbid competitors for companies, industry executives said.
""It's a deviation from what has been allowed in the last 50 years,"" said David Fann, chief executive of TorreyCove Capital Partners LLC, a private equity advisory firm.
""This is a radical change. In fact, the buyout business would have never evolved without the benefits of leverage.""
The rules also show the limits of the industry's influence in Washington, despite efforts by executives such as Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman to cultivate Trump and his Republican party.
Companies that were previously unrestricted in the amount of interest they could deduct now face a cap for the next four years of 30 percent of their 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). 
After 2021, the cap becomes even more constrictive by switching to 30 percent of 12-month earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).
For a Reuters graphic on the sector-by-sector impact of the interest deductible cap, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2AZlrZf
HEAVILY INDEBTED COMPANIES TO TAKE A HIT
S&P Global Ratings estimates that nearly 70 percent of companies whose debt amounts to more five times EBITDA would be negatively impacted by the interest deductibility cap. This casts a wide net, given that private equity firms, on average, saddle companies with more debt than that, according to Cambridge Associates.
Around a third of all leveraged buyouts are expected to be worse off under the new tax system, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Using excessive borrowing as a yardstick, health publisher WebMD, software provider LANDESK and auto accessory seller Truck Hero are among those that could take a hit from the interest expense deductibility cap. All these companies are indebted at well above five times EBITDA, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. 
WebMD owner KKR & Co LP (N:KKR), and Truck Hero owner CCMP declined to comment on the impact of the cap on their companies and whether other aspects of the tax code overhaul could offset it.
A representative for LANDESK owner Clearlake Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
While the tax rates of private equity-owned companies will decrease alongside all other U.S. companies, the changes could hasten the demise of those struggling with their debt piles, Moody's said last week.
This means that bankruptcies of heavily indebted private equity-owned companies, such as that of U.S. retailer Toys ""R"" Us in September, could come more quickly and become more difficult to escape.
""Defaults for lower-rated (credit) issuers could increase in a downturn,"" Moody's analysts wrote in a note.
That could discourage private equity firms from overburdening companies with debt, but also erode returns by pushing them to stump up more of their cash as equity to fund acquisitions.
Given publicly traded companies that are not as indebted will have more cash under the new tax system to make rival offers for assets, the changes could make leveraged buyouts harder to complete on attractive terms, investment bankers said.
""The valuation challenge that private equity firms are facing in considering new investments may become exacerbated in 2018,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of M&A at  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC).
""Companies with the same P/E ratio but with lower tax rates may see EBITDA multiples go up, making the economics more challenging for private equity firms,"" Posternack added.
FLEXIBILITY
To be sure, the new rules offer some flexibility. They allow companies to deduct interest payments above the 30 percent cap to the extent they did not reach that limit in the previous years. 
And the benefits from a tax rate cut to 21 percent from 35 percent and full upfront capital expenditure deductibility outweigh the cost of the curbs on interest deductibility for the majority of private equity-owned companies.
Given that private equity fund managers have also largely been spared a much-feared tax hike on their performance fees, known as carried interest, the American Investment Council (AIC), the industry's lobby group, has put on a brave face. 
""On balance, the tax bill represents a net positive for private equity and will enable the industry to continue to make long-term investments that will grow the economy,"" AIC President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. 
The impact of the new tax system will also vary across sectors. 
Those with high leverage and significant leveraged buyout activity, such as technology, healthcare and aerospace and defense, have the highest percentage of companies worse off, according to Moody's. 
""As cash flow scenarios and interest rates fluctuate, those (interest expense deductibility) caps could start to make leveraged deals harder,"" said Larry Grafstein, UBS's co-head of M&A in the Americas.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:00AM ET</span>",Steinhoff investor Wiese sells part of Shoprite stake,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African investor Christo Wiese has sold an additional 1.1 billion rand ($87 million) of shares in supermarket group Shoprite (J:SHPJ), exchange filings showed on Thursday, after his exposure to scandal-hit retailer Steinhoff (J:SNHJ) dented his fortune.
More than $14 billion of shareholder value has been wiped off Steinhoff over the last three weeks after the owner of Mattress Firm and Conforama discovered what it called accounting irregularities and parted company with its chief executive.
The 90 percent collapse hit Wiese's wealth -- estimated by Forbes magazine to have dropped to below $1 billion -- the hardest as he is the largest Steinhoff shareholder with a stake of about 20 percent.
Exchange filings showed Wiese sold 5 million shares at an average price of 221.5 rand each in Shoprite, a 128 billion rand ($10.1 billion) company in which he owns about 17 percent stake and is chairman. 
That brings the money he has raised since Dec. 14 from the sale of Shoprite stock to 3.3 billion rand ($260 million). It is unclear what he would be using the money for and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Wiese borrowed 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to buy additional Steinhoff shares in September 2016, pledging 3.2 billion euros of his existing holding as security to the investment banks that lent the money.
Shares in Steinhoff dropped a further 11 percent on Thursday, extending the decline to the second day after the company said some lenders have started restricting access to credit lines.
Wiese was one of the early directors of a budget retailer Pepkor, which was co-founded by his parents in 1960 in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert.
He is best known for transforming Shoprite from just six shops in the 1970s to hundreds of stores across Africa.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said on Thursday the Swiss subsidiary of U.S. bank JPMorgan (N:JPM) had committed serious anti-money laundering breaches in relation to Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.
The case adds to the political storm that has raged for more than two years over the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the focus of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chaired 1MDB's advisory board, has denied any wrongdoing.
The case has already swept up Swiss private banks Edmond de Rotschild, BSI and Falcon; the international arm of the British queen's bank Coutts, and big banks UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN).
""Enforcement proceedings conducted by FINMA between May 2016 and June 2017 uncovered serious shortcomings in the anti-money laundering controls of J.P. Morgan (Switzerland) Ltd in connection with business relationships and transactions associated with the allegedly corrupt Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB,"" FINMA said in a statement.
The ruling, which imposed a monitor on the bank but did not involve any monetary penalties or business restrictions, had not been appealed and was final, FINMA said.
The bank had failed to identify heightened risks in some instances, FINMA said, while in others it failed to adequately manage risks after identifying clients as politically exposed persons requiring special scrutiny.
""The bank failed in particular to identify the money-laundering risks relating to cash flows between business accounts and personal accounts,"" the supervisor said. 
""In one case, it credited hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, allegedly earmarked for the purchase of a company, to the personal account of an individual with close ties to a 1MDB business partner.""
Part of that money was then transferred to a business account associated with the person, FINMA said, without the bank having questioned the purpose or procedure behind the transactions or the substantial sum that stayed in the private account.
JPMorgan said the findings arose from activities which had since been tightened.
""The resolution announced by FINMA relates to matters that took place many years ago in the Swiss private bank, and since that time we have increased training, added staff and made improvements in monitoring and surveillance,"" the bank said.
A FINMA-appointed monitor would be carrying out an on-site review of the ""appropriateness and functioning"" of the bank's controls, the Bern-based agency said.

FINMA said one of a total of seven enforcement proceedings it had brought against financial groups in relation to 1MDB remained open. It did not name the final bank involved.

The bank also said it was examining whether its Lithuanian and Latvian branches had been involved in money laundering, expanding an investigation beyond its Estonian operations.
Denmark's financial regulator reported Danske Bank to the police last year for violating anti-money laundering rules and reprimanded the bank for not identifying or reducing ""significant money laundering risks"" in its Estonia branch.
The fine, which Danske Bank accepted, relates to that charge by the financial regulator.
Danish newspaper Berlingske had reported that the bank's Lithuanian branch had been used in 2012 as part of money laundering and other illegal activities in Estonia.
Danske Bank said in September it had had inadequate measures in place in Estonia to prevent money laundering in the period up to 2014 and said it was cooperating with the authorities in the money laundering cases.
Danske Bank head of compliance Anders Meinert Jorgensen said in an email the Estonia case had prompted the bank to ""look at the other Baltic markets,"" and said this could prompt a deeper investigation depending on its initial findings.
""The challenges around money laundering and non-resident customers are linked to a certain portfolio we had in Estonia at that time,"" he said, adding that issues in Lithuania and Latvia could ""not be equated with those in the Estonian branch.""
A spokesman said Danske Bank began looking into activities in Lithuania and Latvia after the Estonian investigation started in September, adding it would take nine months to a year.
French authorities placed Danske Bank under an anti-money laundering investigation in October based on suspicions over transactions by customers of Danske Bank Estonia from 2008 to 2011​.
Danske Bank hired the former head of Denmark's intelligence agency and fraud squad, Jens Madsen, in September to help it in its effort to counter money laundering.
""Anti-money laundering work is complex and comprehensive, and historically we have not been competent enough in this area everywhere,"" Jorgensen said in his email.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), at the centre of a data-falsification scandal that has shaken Japan's manufacturing industry, admitted for the first time that executives were aware of the cheating, and reassigned three senior officials. 
Japan's No.3 steelmaker, which supplies the manufacturers of cars, planes and trains across the world, has said about 500 customers had received products with falsified specifications, throwing global supply chains into turmoil. 
Outside investigators appointed by Kobe to look into the malpractice have found that senior officials in the company's copper and aluminium business knew of some of the cheating.
""Based on this information, as of today, we have reassigned these three executives,"" the company said, adding it would decide on any punishments after the probe was completed.
The three were senior officials in the company's aluminium and copper business, where most of the cheating occurred. 
Kobe Steel ""takes it very seriously that current executive officers were aware of this,"" Executive Vice President Naoto Umehara told reporters at a media briefing. 
Kobe also said the investigation would be completed by around the end of February, two months later than expected.
The 112-year-old company has had Japanese government-sanctioned seals of quality revoked on many of its products and is also the subject of a U.S. Justice Department inquiry. 
Kobe Steel has been in touch with the U.S. Justice Department multiple times since an initial contact through lawyers, Yoshitsugu Nishimura, a manager of public relations, said at the briefing. He declined to provide further details. 
No safety issues have so far been identified from the data cheating, which mainly involves falsely certifying the strength and durability of products. 
CEO Hiroya Kawasaki said in November that his ""ultimate management responsibility"" will be decided after the outside investigators complete their report on the case.
A series of compliance failings by Japanese companies have surfaced in the past few months. 

Scandals have involved among others, Nissan Motor (T:7201) and key product suppliers to global manufacturers, Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) and Toray Industries (T:3402).

LONDON (Reuters) - A slate of U.S. tax reforms could provide a lift for European companies that sell into the country. For others, it may yet turn out to be a threat. 
Proposals passed by lawmakers on Wednesday will see the corporate tax rate in the United States fall to 21 percent from 35 percent, a dramatic cut that is likely to boost the profits of American corporations.
The change is likely to benefit some European companies, too, and investment banks have been quick to point that out: JP Morgan has introduced a basket of 41 European stocks it believes will benefit most for its clients to buy. 
More than a sixth of companies in the pan-European Stoxx 600 index (STOXX) derive more than a third of their revenues from North America, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Thirty-one stocks generate more than half their turnover in the United States. Nineteen of those are UK-domiciled, with construction and defense companies well-represented: Ashtead (L:AHT),  Cobham  (L:COB), Ferguson (L:FERG),  Meggitt  (L:MGGT) and  Melrose  (L:MRON) are all heavily exposed, according to the data. 
Equipment rental firm Ashtead, whose U.S. Sunbelt arm made up 86 percent of 2016 revenues, should see a “material impact” from the tax reform, according to analysts at Liberum. 
The company has told analysts it expects its effective tax rate to fall from 34-35 percent to 23-25 percent -- an uplift of 15 percent to Liberum’s current profit estimates for 2020.
Building and plumbing supplier Ferguson, with 78 percent of its revenues from the United States, could also benefit according to analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), though the company said in its quarterly results in early December the reduction of its tax rate would be less than four percentage points.
InterContinental Hotels (L:IHG) (58 percent U.S. revenues) said on Thursday its tax rate would reduce by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points, as well as benefiting from an ""exceptional"" tax credit in the year the bill is signed. 
Share prices of many U.S.-exposed European companies have seen strong gains as the tax bill edged towards the finish line. But Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said analysts have been quite slow to factor it into their 2018 company earnings estimates. 
""It would not be that surprising if we see that with P/E having expanded already, as those earnings upgrades come through that potentially takes (share prices) even a little bit higher,"" he said. 
But not all firms that earn in dollars will gain an advantage. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) N>, whose main commercial planemaking rival is Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR), said it would now pay tax at rates closer to those of global rivals, helping it compete better. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said French catering company Sodexo (PA:EXHO), which makes 61 percent of operating profit (EBIT) in the United States, could see 6 percent EBIT upside from the reforms, but the investment bank believes British rival Compass already has a lower U.S. tax rate than Sodexo and would see ""little benefit"". 
Daniel Ekstein, an analyst at UBS, said the broker has received a number of questions about whether Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) would benefit. 
Despite deriving 62 percent of revenues from the United States, the retailer’s tax rate is already low at around 24 percent, meaning its U.S. peers could benefit more and leading to deflation in the retail sector.

“If the U.S food retail industry were to benefit from, say, an average 5 percent reduction in tax rate we believe that in the mid-term you'd see shelf-edge prices 5 percent lower, rather than margins 5 percent higher,” he said in a note to clients.

ALMATY (Reuters) - The Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK) has frozen $22 billion in assets held by Kazakhstan's National Fund over a lawsuit launched by Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati and his companies against the Kazakh government, a source familiar with the case said on Thursday.
The National Bank has in turn filed a lawsuit against BNY Mellon. A British court is due to deliver a judgment on that case on Thursday, the source told Reuters.
The National Fund is replenished from oil export revenue and may be used as an emergency state funding tool. 
The amount of the funds frozen account for around 40 percent of the fund's total. 
Kazakhstan's central bank and justice ministry could not be reached for immediate comment.
The Bank of New York Mellon was also not available for immediate comment.
The legal row between Stati, his son Gabriel, two family-controlled companies and the Republic of Kazakhstan has dragged on for years in various courts.
The Moldovan businessmen, who invested in Kazakhstan's oil and gas industry, have asserted that they were subjected to significant harassment from the Kazakh state, with the ultimate purpose of forcing them to sell their investments cheaply.
They have said that the value of their investments was affected negatively by the harassment, because Kazakhstan was hoping to take over the fields owned by them and was therefore trying to bring the price down.
Kazakhstan denies the allegations. 
In October, Kazakhstan filed a civil racketeering lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, against Anatolie and Gabriel Stati and two of their companies – Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd., often collectively referred to as ""the Stati Partners"".
The lawsuit followed an international arbitration award of around $500 million that the Stati Partners won in an international arbitration court.

Kazakh currency the tenge  strengthened by 0.6 percent on Thursday.

1270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 05:09AM ET</span>","Crypto, Taxes & Volatility: What Hedge Funds Are Eyeing in 2018","(Bloomberg) -- Even a new U.S. president and rising geopolitical tensions couldn’t stop stock markets from marching higher. But that’s about to change, money managers say.
They see a market correction, a ""reckoning"" with North Korea and a bitcoin ETF in 2018. Here are some of the top themes hedge fund firms - and those who invest in them - are looking for in the year ahead:
More Volatility
A pullback in quantitative easing by central banks globally could trigger a downward spiral in asset prices and spell a ""significant change"" for the macro trading environment, Paul Tudor Jones wrote Nov. 30. He compared the current bull market to the bubble of 1999. Low volatility is becoming ""dangerous"" and has lulled investors into a false sense of complacency, he wrote. His firm’s main fund lost 2.1 percent this year through Dec 8.
Assets most at risk are those reliant on low interest rates, such as highly-leveraged credit, illiquid securities and those that benefit from momentum trading, including FANG stocks —  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), London hedge fund manager George Papamarkakis said. These companies are ""definitely prime for a substantial correction"" next year given current valuations, he said.
Volatility spells good news for macro hedge funds and the outlook has renewed interest in the struggling strategy. Investors have moved nearly $15 billion dollars into macro funds this year through September, more than any other strategy, according to data provider eVestment.
Crypto Craze
Cryptocurrencies are hot. Mike Novogratz started a $500 million hedge fund to invest in the assets and bitcoin futures contracts began trading at Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group this month. What’s next? Some hedge fund startups plan to offer loans that use the cryptocurrency as collateral, but given the high volatility, expect steep terms.
""I think we will see a bitcoin ETF in 2018,"" said Jose Suarez, co-founder of $300 million hedge fund Silver 8 Capital, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups, and is up more than 800 percent this year through Dec. 19.
""Futures are already giving more legitimacy to the asset class and ETFs will give even more legitimacy, so more institutional investors will make it part of their portfolios. Still, the custodianship issue needs to be solved,"" he said, referring to security concerns involved with holding the currency.
Tax Policy
Yesterday, Congress passed the first major overhaul of the U.S. tax code in decades. Kevin Russell, who runs UBS’s $5.4 billion hedge fund unit, said the legislation bodes well for stock pickers because the changes will impact companies differently depending on their geographic location, net earnings, effective tax rates and the amount of debt they have. That will create greater price anomalies for traders to exploit.
For $103 million hedge fund Roubaix Capital, the tax bill will be “the most significant fiscal event” for small-cap stocks for the foreseeable future. A corporate tax cut will create fresh opportunities on both the long and short side. For companies getting a tax break, “less than a third of this benefit is currently priced in,” the Denver, Colorado-based manager wrote in an email this week. For those firms that already pay little or no taxes, the new rules will have little effect on their earnings, “driving incremental short opportunities.”
Europe Positive
Europe is looking good to investors. Differing growth outlooks for countries across the euro zone is creating tradable opportunities for UBS’s hedge fund unit. ""For example, we see relative mispricings in bank credits with interesting opportunities across banks in Germany, France and Spain,"" Russell said.
European distressed credit, particularly non-performing loans and non-core asset sales from banks, are top picks for Infinity Capital Partners’ Jeff Vale, who invests in hedge funds. And Brevan Howard Asset Management is betting Greece will bounce back from almost a decade of crisis.
Banks and hedge funds had reduced exposure to Europe this year amid Brexit and other political uncertainty. That, along with a rise in passive investing, has created less active competition in the region, said Man GLG’s Pierre-Henri Flamand. In addition, new European MiFID II regulations will likely create a less-researched market, one that’s ripe for stock-pickers to shine, he said. ""It’s fewer people looking at the same investment opportunities,"" he said. ""It should be an excellent environment for long-short money managers.""
Banking on Banks
The future is bright for the credit quality of regional banks, says SkyBridge Capital senior portfolio manager Troy Gayeski. Their balance sheets have ""ample room"" to grow as corporate lending rises and a hike in interest rates could result in higher cash flows. They are also positioned to benefit from merger activity in the industry and the U.S. tax bill, which lowers the levy on corporations. Potential changes to the Dodd Frank financial regulations in the U.S. may also benefit the industry. To seize the opportunity, SkyBridge has ramped up its wager on regional and community bank Trust Preferred CDOs, which are collateralized debt obligations with both equity and subordinated debt-like features.
Banks in peripheral Europe are favored by Oceanwood Capital Management’s Julian Garcia Woods. Spain’s Liberbank has been ""unfairly punished"" in the wake of Banco Popular’s June collapse, he said. Northern Italy’s Banca Popolare di Sondrio has a strong balance sheet and yet ""the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater,"" Woods said. The industry is under the microscope of the European Central Bank, so ""there is constant fear of equity dilution, even if the underlying economy is strengthening,"" he said.
Watch List
Apart from trading ideas, here are key events in the industry for 2018:
In January, hedge fund legend Steven Cohen can once again trade client capital. He was banned after his former hedge fund pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a record $1.8 billion in penalties. (Cohen himself was not charged with any wrongdoing.) Terms for the potential new fund are already raising questions among some investors. The new year is expected to bring clarity on whether investors will jump in or see the price-tag as simply too steep.
Other firms to watch: Jones’s Tudor Investment Corp., Paulson & Co., Caxton Associates and Brevan Howard. It’s been an especially painful year for these funds, which have seen assets plunge and performance wither. Jones shuttered one of his firm’s funds in November and Andrew Law’s Caxton is grappling with one of the worst losses in the macro-trading universe this year. The chiefs of both funds are betting if they manage more of the money and risk themselves, it will help turn things around.
Geopolitical tensions remain an over-arching question mark that could change the course of trading quickly.
The new year could bring a “sort of reckoning with North Korea,” said Jonathan Hook, chief investment officer of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, which allocates money to hedge funds. Michael Hintze, who runs credit-focused CQS, cited strained relations with the nation as one 2018’s ""potential potholes."" For Russell, tensions with the Middle East appear to be the market’s ""mini blind spot."""
1271,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 05:00AM ET</span>",Hotelier IHG sees mid-to-high single-digit percent tax rate cut on U.S. tax reform,"(Reuters) - Hotelier InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) (L:IHG) said the new U.S. tax bill is expected to reduce the group's tax rate by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage point next year from the current rate in the low 30s.
The operator of brands such as Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and InterContinental, in a brief statement, said the measure in the tax bill will result in one-off tax credit in the year it is signed into law.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval on Wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years.
The bill keeps the existing number of tax brackets but adjusts many of the rates and income levels for each. The top tax rate for high earners is reduced.
The United States is the largest market for the hotel group in terms of room numbers and contributed to about 58 percent of company's revenue in 2016, according to their last annual report.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), in a client note, said that a 5-9 percent tax rate reduction would be equivalent to a 7-13 percent EPS upgrade, pushing up its target price on the stock to 46 pounds from 42 pounds. 
Shares in the company, which runs over 5,000 hotels in about 100 countries, were up 1.2 percent at 0941 GMT.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 04:56AM ET</span>",Catalan vote tests Europe,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World markets offered a muted reception on Thursday to the passage of U.S. tax cuts as potential benefits to company bottom lines were already priced in, while bonds were spooked by the blowout in government debt needed to fund the giveaways.
An election in Catalonia, which has become a de facto referendum on its independence movement, was another test for European assets late in the year, though there was only modest stress in Spain's markets and none on the euro., 
""It (the Catalan election) cannot be ignored going into year-end,"" said Orlando Green, European fixed income strategist at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR). ""But the secession movement has been significantly diminished and would need a decisive move to revive it.""
Madrid's IBEX (IBEX) was down 0.6 percent, compared to falls of between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for the euro zone's other major bourses <0#.INDEXE> which were showing the effects of subdued sentiment in Asia and Wall Street overnight. [.N][.T][.SS]
In U.S. President Donald Trump's first major policy win, Republicans steamrollered opposition from Democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary relief to middle-class Americans.
Having spent more than a year anticipating the bill, its actual passage proved something of an anticlimax for Wall Street. The Dow (DJI) fell 0.11 percent, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 0.04 percent.
Most of the action was in bond markets where yields on U.S. 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) jumped to the highest since March at 2.50 percent, in the process making a bearish break of a key chart level at 2.47 percent.
Benchmark German and euro zone yields were camped near one-month highs too and the swing higher in long-term yields for once outpaced the move in the short-end and steepened the yield curve a little. [GVD/EUR]
On the U.S. tax cuts, bond investors are concerned that adding fiscal stimulus at a time of full employment will only reinforce the Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates, thus pushing up short term yields.
At the same time, many assume the unfunded tax cuts will lead to an explosion in government borrowing, increasing the supply of new bonds and pressuring prices across the curve.
The impact is all the greater as the Fed has begun to unwind its massive bond holdings, as have central banks elsewhere.
Sweden's Riksbank on Wednesday took its first baby steps toward reversing ultra-loose policy by ending net new bond purchases.
""An appreciation that central banks are going to be buying fewer bonds next year at a time when many governments will be selling more of them, plus profit-taking on the curve-flattening theme that has been a winning trade for large parts of 2017, are playing a part,"" said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB.
BOJ NOT FOR TURNING
One institution that has long been committed to aggressive stimulus is the Bank of Japan, and it showed no inclination to re-think the policy at its board meeting on Thursday.
Currency investors are assuming the BOJ will keep Japanese bond yields super-low for a long time to come and have been nudging the yen lower in response.
""Our most important goal is to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible,"" BOJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda told a news conference. ""We won't raise interest rates just because the economy is improving."" 
That kept the euro up at its highest since late 2015 at 134.84 (EURJPY=). The dollar stood 0.15 percent higher at 113.51 yen , after also rising 0.4 percent on Wednesday.
The euro outperformed broadly, reaching $1.1877  per dollar after starting the week down at $1.1752. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at 93.346 (DXY).
But the common currency still faces the Catalonia hurdle. The election is expected to produce no clear majority for either the separatist or unionist parties, leading to weeks of political wrangling.
""It looks likely that it ends up being something of a long-running saga,"" said one of rating agency Fitch's top European sovereign analysts, Tony Stringer. He said the Catalan situation would be a key factor in whether Spain gets a rating upgrade next year. 
""It is feasible that it is just a prolonged standoff that doesn't affect the Spanish economy and public finances.""
In commodity markets, gold  was underpinned by the softer dollar to stand at $1,265 an ounce.
Oil prices steadied after rising on a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and the continued outage of the North Sea Forties pipeline system. [O/R]

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks followed Wall Street and Asian bourses lower on Thursday in a muted response to the U.S. Congress's approval of a long-anticipated tax overhaul.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.2 percent, with major European bourses trading sideways. 
Spain's IBEX (IBEX) was down 0.4 percent, slightly worse than Germany's DAX (GDAXI) and Paris CAC 40 (FCHI), which were both down 0.2 percent. 
The Spanish government hopes a regional election will strip pro-independence parties of their control of the Catalan parliament. 
Describing the muted market reaction to the U.S. 1.5 trillion dollar tax bill, Henry Croft of Accendo Markets described ""a widely touted ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ event"" and said investors were now focused on whether the tax reform would boost equities in 2018. 
Other analysts believe investors will need time to crunch the data and figure out which companies will benefit the most. 
""As people sharpen their pencils and figure out which companies will benefit (from the tax bill), and companies start talking about that themselves, I think we'll see larger moves in share prices,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. 
Nokia (HE:NOKIA) posted the best performance of the STOXX 600, rising 2.6 percent after announcing a patent agreement with China's Huawei (SZ:002502).
Britain's Balfour Beatty  added a 2.4 percent rise after it said on Thursday it had agreed to sell a 12.5 percent stake in M25 motorway operator Connect Plus for 103 million pounds ($137.6 million), helping push up 2017 profit and generating funds to pay down debt.
Scandal-hit Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) posted the worst fall, down 12.6 percent and hitting a low 0.26 euro.
In the banking sectors, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) was down 1 percent after the CEO of Italy's biggest bank, UniCredit (MI:CRDI), said he was not considering taking over the German bank.
Still in banking,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) lost 1.5 percent. It said on Wednesday it would aim to cut up to 1,000 jobs as part of the planned integration of retail arm Postbank.
Energy was the only sector trading in the black with Norway's  Statoil  (OL:STL) rising 0.6 percent after presenting plans to extend output from the North Sea Snorre oilfield.

Heavily indebted telecoms and cable group Altice (AS:ATCA), also made it to the top risers of the session.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts lowered their price target but kept an overall ""buy"" rating on the stock, which has slumped nearly 60 percent so far in 2017 due to concerns over its 50 billion euros debt pile.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",A Model Life: How Petra Nemcova transformed tragedy into joy,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Petra Nemcova's life were a movie plot, nobody would believe it.
Girl grows up under Communism in the former Czechoslovakia, climbs to the top of the fashion world as one of the most famous models on the planet, and nearly has it all taken away as a victim of the 2004 tsunami in southeast Asia.
But Nemcova, 38, survived and she now heads a foundation called All Hands and Hearts (https://www.allhandsandhearts.org), to help victims of natural disasters around the world rebuild their schools and communities. 
For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, Nemcova sat down to talk about how to transform tragedy into joy.
Q: You grew up under Communism, so what was that experience like?
A: You were part of a system. So my dad was a bricklayer, my mom was a teacher and we grew up with very little, picking up pennies to help put food on the table. Our staple diet was lentils and eggs, and maybe we could afford meat once a week. Once I wore the same pair of winter shoes for seven years.
Q: How did you handle the transition to modeling?
A: Communism fell when I was 11 years old, so at that point my generation got to follow their dreams. I grabbed opportunities in modeling, because I knew that would get me out of the Czech Republic, and I could take care of my parents, who had always taken food out of their own mouths to feed us. 
I entered the ""Look of the Year"" competition, won it, and started traveling to places like Milan, Paris, London and New York. 
Q: Coming from that experience, how did you handle the money that started coming in?
A: In those early days there were lots of situations where I was misled because I was young and naive, and I didn't know anything about the financial world. 
After that, I started investing in real estate, which seemed like a much solid and safer choice for me. My first was an investment property in Paris, and then I bought places in New York. I have invested in real estate ever since.
Q: Working with famed designers so closely, did you learn from any of them?
A: I learned by observing them, how passionate and dedicated they are - in particular, Giorgio Armani, his work ethic and how particular he is. 
Another role model, when Communism fell and I got exposed to Western culture for the first time, was Audrey Hepburn. Not only her incredible grace, but how she used her platform to put a spotlight on those suffering. 
Marc Benioff, (CEO) of Salesforce, is one of the most powerful business leaders in world, but I have never met anyone who takes so much time to help others. 
Q: Are you able to talk about your traumatic tsunami experience, and what you learned from it?
A: Life has a way of teaching you its lessons. I was extremely successful. I was happy with my partner, and we were on a romantic vacation. In a few seconds, we went from a beautiful walk on the beach to something that shattered everyone's lives.
My pelvis was crushed in four places, and for eight hours, I clung to a palm tree in the waters. What I learned from that is that anything can happen at any time. Nobody knows what will happen next, and every moment is a gift.
Even when you are going through tragedies, you can still focus on the positive. When I was in the hospital and didn't know if I would ever walk again, I told myself: 'Well, I still have my eyes and ears.' I lost my partner, but I still had my family. You deal with hopelessness by being grateful.
Q: How did that experience inspire you with your foundation?
A: After natural disasters, when first responders leave, there is a gap where communities have no support. In particular, children would wait for years for schools to be rebuilt. We have focused on rebuilding schools after natural disasters - 171 of them in 10 countries around the world.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass on to others?

A: Take the time to really experience giving and not just write a check. Go to the places you are helping, because it will give you a different understanding of life, and a new dimension of joy and gratitude. If you don't do that, you are missing out on what life has to offer.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 12:14AM ET</span>","Noble Group gets another credit extension, but future remains uncertain","By Kane Wu and Henning Gloystein
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Troubled commodity trader Noble Group on Thursday said it had received an extension on a loan until May next year, giving it crucial time for negotiations over debt restructuring.
But the firm, based in Hong Kong and listed in Singapore, said the outcome of the discussions with creditors remained uncertain.
The loan had already been extended twice until mid-December, as Noble (SI:NOBG) battles to recover from years of crisis.
""The company has obtained an extension on a waiver in relation to the financial covenants in its committed unsecured revolving credit facility to 18 May, 2018,"" Noble said in a written statement on Thursday. 
The company, which has bank debt of about $1.2 billion and bonds aggregating about $2.3 billion, did not indicate the size of the credit being extended.
""Noble ... continues to be in discussions with its creditors,"" it said. ""No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these discussions.""
Noble's chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who was appointed this year, said last Friday it was the company's priority to keep out of insolvency.
Noble was plunged into crisis in 2015 when Iceberg Research started questioning its accounts, resulting in sharp share price falls, credit downgrades and its bonds trading at distressed levels. Noble has refuted such criticism.
Once Asia's biggest commodity merchant with ambitions to rival dominant European trading houses like  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Vitol, Noble's stock price has crashed from a peak of S$17 ($12.65) in 2011 to 25 cents. That gives it a market capitalization of just S$318 million, compared with over $70 billion for Glencore.
Noble was also hit by a commodities downturn that started in late 2014.
Its financial woes resulted in the company's retreat from most financial commodity markets, including oil, natural gas and even coal, Noble's traditional strongpoint.
The downsizing has also played a part in Noble's failure to profit from resurgent commodity prices this year.
Despite soaring oil, natural gas and coal markets, the company lost around $3 billion in the first nine months of this year.

The turmoil at the company has also resulted in several high level departures, including chief executive officer (CEO) Yusuf Alireza in 2016, and co-CEO Jeffrey Frase in November.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 07:39PM ET</span>",Stocks dip lower as U.S. Republicans pass $1.5 trillion tax bill,"By Laila Kearney
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major global stock markets fell slightly on Wednesday as investors took profits after record gains, while U.S. Treasury yields reached nine-month highs, as a $1.5 trillion tax bill cleared both chambers of the Republican-led U.S. Congress.
The legislation, which would enact the biggest U.S. tax code overhaul in more than three decades, heads to President Donald Trump for signing, although the timing was unclear.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted for a second time to pass the sweeping bill Wednesday afternoon, hours after the Senate approved it.
The bill will slash the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, which analysts say will boost business earnings and lead to higher dividends and stock buybacks.
U.S. stocks rallied in the days ahead of voting on the bill, introduced six weeks ago, but some investors have begun to sell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 28.1 points, or 0.11 percent, to end at 24,726.65, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,679.25 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 2.89 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,960.96.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.06 percent.
European stock markets fell (STOXX) 0.7 percent, with blue-chip indexes in Berlin (GDAXI), Paris (FCHI) and London (FTSE) 0.3 to 1.1 percent lower. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (FTEU3) also lost 0.70 percent. 
Japanese stocks inched up slightly as strength in financials offset a sustained sell-off in construction shares. The Nikkei share average (N225) edged up 0.1 percent to 22,891.72 after trading in the red.
Government bond yields, which move inversely to their prices, have jumped in the United States and Europe on expectations tax reform would help boost economic growth and inflation. 
U.S. Treasury yields rose to nine-month highs as the bill passed. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) were last down 10/32 in price to yield 2.497 percent, from 2.463 percent late Tuesday. The 30-year bond (US30YT=RR) was last down 1-3/32 to yield 2.8767 percent, from 2.823 percent.
Euro zone government bonds sold off sharply for a second straight day.
The U.S. dollar slid against most currencies except the Japanese yen  on expectations the tax bill's upside impact on the greenback had been factored into the market. 
Gains in the dollar were limited versus the yen, as the market looked to Thursday's outcome of the Bank of Japan's two-day policy meeting for clues to whether it will join the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in winding back stimulus.
The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.12 percent. That led the euro  to rise 0.31 percent to $1.1875. The dollar also fell against sterling  and the Canadian  and New Zealand  dollars.
The weaker dollar pushed up gold prices for a fourth straight session to hit a two-week high. Spot gold  added 0.3 percent to $1,265.45 an ounce. U.S. gold futures  gained 0.37 percent to $1,268.90 an ounce.
Crude prices rose, supported by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and a continued outage in the North Sea Forties pipeline system. [O/R]

West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) rose 50 cents to $58.06 a barrel while Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 73 cents at $64.53.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:57PM ET</span>",Three months that shook Ryanair: How cancellations sparked a pilot revolt,"By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Within hours of the news on Sept. 15 that thousands of Ryanair flights had been canceled in Europe, pilots' WhatsApp groups exploded with pent-up frustration.
While management explained away the cancellations as a one-off rostering screw-up, pilots believed there was a deeper problem - that disaffected colleagues were leaving in droves.
The pilots saw an opportunity to shift the balance of power in a company where they feel they are treated, in the words of one serving captain, ""like janitors"".
A hectic five days of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp exchanges and meetings later, representatives of 20 of Ryanair's 87 bases were demanding new contracts. In December, pilots in Italy, Ireland and Portugal called strikes that would have been the first of their kind in the airline's history.
""The discontent has always been there ... but the cancellations triggered everyone to mobilize,"" one pilot said.
Their maneuver worked. On Dec. 15, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary recognized unions for the first time, crossing what for him had always been a red line.
The full implications of union recognition for Ryanair's pioneering ultra low-cost business model will take months to become clear. The market's view was immediate: shares fell 9 percent in a single day. 
In his first interview since the cancellations, O'Leary told Reuters the decision did not indicate management weakness or pilot strength but the fact that the airline was facing the prospect of compensating 150,000 passengers in Christmas week.
""If you need to go on strike just to test our mettle, then go ahead,"" O'Leary said in his Dublin office on Tuesday. ""But not in Christmas week. And not one that disrupts all our customers across Europe.""
The blunt-speaking CEO, who once crossed a picket line of baggage handlers to help load a plane, also indicated a grudging respect for the pilots: ""In fairness, their timing was good."" 
Analysts have been concerned that rising staff costs could destroy one of the main pillars of the airline's cost advantage, pushing it into the crowded middle ground occupied by easyJet (L:EZJ) and restructured legacy carriers such as Air Lingus. 
O’Leary counters that a ""tiny proportion"" of its advantage over rivals is due to staff costs. ""There will be an uptick in labor costs next year, but will it alter the model? No."" 
SOMETHING AWRY
The first signs that something was awry at Ryanair came in early summer, according to union officials and three pilots who asked not to be named because their contracts forbid them to talk to the media.
By May, the rostering department had begun calling pilots to ask them to work during their annual month off, a first. Calls on days off also increased in frequency and on short notice, measures one pilot said were seen as a sign of ""desperation.""
""From the start of the summer schedule there were very, very clear signs that there issues in crew control,"" said the pilot, a captain who works at a base in northwest Europe. 
O'Leary acknowledged in the interview that there were ""all these little bits of mismanagement"", including training pilots being sent to fly passengers and a backlog of newly hired pilots unable to fly. 
By mid-summer, punctuality was suffering. In-house statistics show the number of flights arriving on time deteriorated from 91 percent in April to 83 percent in July, its worst level since 2010. In early September, it had collapsed to the mid-60s, causing cascading delays and cancellations.
Management put out a call on Sept. 13 offering pilots more money to work extra days, with management ""not quite realizing how serious it was,"" O'Leary told Reuters.
Two days later, Ryanair bowed to the inevitable and announced the cancellations.
Management has maintained the problem was triggered by a regulatory change: starting in 2018, Irish airlines will have to calculate pilots' annual 900-hour flying time limits on the basis of the calendar year, like the rest of the European Union, rather than the customary April to March.
The rostering department responded by over-allocating annual leave in the final four months of 2017, which meant almost half of the company's pilots took a month off between September and December compared to 40 percent in a normal year, O'Leary said. 
The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) told Reuters the rostering move was not a direct result of their change because the rules on annual limits were effectively waived.
""The airline made a commercial decision and has accepted full responsibility,"" the IAA said in a statement. 
SHORTAGES
Many pilots believe the key factor was the high number of pilots leaving, and questioned management's distinction between a ""standby pilot shortage"", which it admitted, and a ""pilot shortage"", which it denied. 
O'Leary told investors on Sept. 18 that the annual turnover among Ryanair's 4,400 pilots was less than 5 percent . 
On Tuesday, however, he admitted turnover had reached ""high single digits"" for captains and ""low teens"" for First Officers in 2017, more than double the churn rate of below 4 percent reported by easyJet.
The number of pilots leaving has ""undoubtedly stepped up this year,"" O'Leary said. ""The uptick in First Officer resignations is highly unusual.""
After the September cancellations O'Leary announced an extra 10,000 euros per year to pilots in several bases and ""goodies"" to pilots at others. If pilots misbehaved, however, ""that will be the end of discussion on goodies,"" he said.
The approach did not have the desired effect and a week later the airline was forced to cancel another 18,000 flights and cut its growth plans, grounding 25 planes in the winter and 10 next summer. 
While management was suffering setbacks, the pilots were growing in confidence. By the end of September, they had set up an unofficial pan-European body with its own web site and WhatsApp group, allowing information to be shared instantly among a majority of pilots for the first time.
In October, the airline made its next move, hiring back its former director of flight operations, Peter Bellew, after just over a year as CEO at Malaysia Airlines to lead a ""significant transformation in the way we reward and interact with our pilots.""
In a meeting with pilots in London in mid-December, Bellew conceded the airline had lost pilots' trust, according to a recording of the meeting reported in Irish media on Tuesday and heard by Reuters.
The airline's administrative staff appeared determined to give pilots a hard time, he said. 
""With the anger there is around the place, if we don't manage to turn that around, we're going to lose more people, so we need to change that,"" Bellew said. 
Ryanair and Bellew declined to comment on the recording.
TOXIC CULTURE
O'Leary made it Ryanair's trademark to treat pilots more like bus drivers than what he saw as the pampered rock stars of aviation's golden age.
While Ryanair says it pays some of the highest salaries in the sector, pilots counter that pay varies widely. 
They cite a ""toxic"" culture that included making them pay for uniforms, training and snacks on planes.
""Everybody you talk to is either in an interview process or looking,"" the captain based in northwestern Europe said.
But they said Ryanair could become a very attractive employer if pilots were allowed to conduct collective bargaining that would provide them with legally binding fixed conditions.
The airline's system of 5 days on, 4 days off, combined with its large pool of base cities, was a winning formula, they said. Management cited the potential for rapid promotion and one of the youngest fleets in Europe as other pull factors. 

""There will be a mass exodus if they don't implement genuine collective bargaining for pilots,"" the captain based in southern Europe said. ""If they start to change things, they will hold on to a lot of people.""

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 06:14PM ET</span>","AT&T, two banks offer bonuses, pay hikes in wake of U.S. tax reform","NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) were among American companies promising more pay for workers or more investment in training on Wednesday after the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to the tax bill on Wednesday, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and sent it to U.S. President Donald Trump for his signature.
The companies' announcements gave at least some support to claims by Trump and fellow Republicans that their tax bill would lead to more investment by U.S. companies with the money they save. 
AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier, said it will pay $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees and invest an additional $1 billion in the United States in 2018, once the tax reform bill is signed into law. An AT&T spokesman said the bonuses were unrelated to the $1,000 that 20,000 AT&T Mobility employees will receive as part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America announced last week. 
Employees eligible for the bonus are all ""union-represented, non-management and front-line managers,"" AT&T said in a statement. The company has more than 250,000 employees in all. The bonuses will cost the company at least $200 million, but the precise amount is not yet known, the company said.
Cable provider Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) also said it would give $1,000 bonuses to more than 100,000 employees and invest $50 billion over the next five years in its infrastructure. Wells Fargo & Co (N:WFC) said the bank will hike minimum hourly pay to $15 an hour in March, up 11 percent from its previous minimum. It will also offer new restricted stock awards to 250,000 employees.
Regional U.S. bank Fifth Third Bancorp (O:FITB) said it would raise the hourly wage for nearly 3,000 of its employees to $15 and give a one-time bonus of $1,000 to more than 13,500 employees, which its CEO said was made possible by the corporate tax cut. 
The company said it expected to distribute the bonuses by year-end, assuming Trump signs the bill by Christmas – which is not certain - and that the pay increases would go into effect once the bill became law.
Aerospace company Boeing Co (N:BA) also said on Wednesday it would invest $300 million in workforce training and facilities enhancements for employees as its CEO lauded the tax bill.
REPUBLICANS PRAISE, DEMOCRATS DON'T
Republican senators, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump praised the announcements.
“Within hours of passing #taxreform, we're already seeing announcements that companies plan to give back to their employees and invest more at home,"" said Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia on Twitter. ""Good news for workers and the economy!""
Democrats, who opposed the bill, offered no congratulations. Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York criticized AT&T on the Senate floor.
""AT&T - big American company, fine American company – their tax rate over the last 10 years was a mere 8 percent, and they cut 80,000 jobs,"" he said. ""That one statistic belies all this trickle-down bunk that our Republican colleagues still cling to even though it’s outdated and disproven.""

AT&T is in the process of acquiring  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) for $85.4 billion, but the U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T to block the deal, saying it could raise prices for rivals and hamper development of online video.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former chief financial officer of Bankrate Inc has been charged with criminal accounting and securities fraud in connection with allegations he misled the company's accountants and falsified its books, the U.S. Justice Department said.
The indictment against Edward DiMaria, 52, which was unsealed on Wednesday, comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed parallel civil charges against DiMaria in 2015.
An attorney for DiMaria could not immediately be reached.
In August, DiMaria settled the SEC's charges and agreed to be suspended for five years from practicing as an accountant, according to settlement documents.
Bankrate, a publisher of financial content, was acquired by privately held digital marketing company Red Ventures in November.
The Justice Department's indictment, filed in federal court in Southern Florida, alleges that DiMaria in his former capacity as Bankrate's chief financial officer was responsible for certifying that the company's financial reports were truthful.
However, from 2011 through 2014, the government says that DiMaria and other co-conspirators carried out a complex scheme to mislead outside auditors, shareholders and regulators about Bankrate's financial condition.
One such accounting scheme involved the use of a ""cushion"" or ""cookie jar"" of unsupported expense accruals to help manipulate the company's reported earnings. That tactic led to the buildup of more than $1 million in unsupported expenses, which were later selectively reversed to help meet earnings targets, the Justice Department said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday recommended steep anti-subsidy duties on Bombardier Inc's CSeries jets, setting up the next round of a fierce international trade dispute between the United States and Canada.
The U.S. Commerce Department announcement to impose duties of nearly 300 percent stems from a complaint by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co that Bombardier had been unfairly and illegally subsidized by the Canadian government, allowing the planemaker to dump its newest jetliner in the U.S. market below cost.
""Today's decision validates Boeing's complaints regarding Bombardier's pricing in the United States, pricing that has harmed our workforce and U.S. industry,"" Boeing said in a statement on the decision, which was generally expected within the aerospace industry. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), the second largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, has an order for 75 of the 100-to-150 seat CSeries jets.
The aircraft starts at $79.5 million, according to list prices, or some $5.9 billion for the total order, but carriers typically receive steep discounts.
If imposed, the duties would more than triple the cost of a CSeries aircraft sold in the United States, based on Boeing's assertion that Delta received the planes for $20 million each, well below an estimated cost of $33 million and what Bombardier charges in Canada. 
Bombardier criticized the U.S. decision as out of touch, citing the Canadian planemaker's plan to team up with European Airbus to launch assembly of the CSeries from a production line in Mobile, Alabama, making it a domestic product for U.S. buyers. 
""Unfortunately, the Commerce Department decision is divorced from this reality and ignores long- standing business practices in the aerospace industry, including launch pricing and the financing of multibillion dollar aircraft programs,"" Bombardier said in a statement. 
The U.S. penalty against Bombardier will only take effect if the lesser-known U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) rules in Boeing's favor, as it so far has, in its final decision expected in early 2018.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said the government will consider its next steps and options for appeal.
""We are steadfast in our determination to defend Canadian companies and workers against protectionism,"" Freeland said in a statement.
Freeland said Boeing has failed to demonstrate that it is being threatened with injury by the CSeries ""in a market segment it exited over a decade ago.""
Boeing had called for countervailing duties of 79.41 percent to offset what it described as harmful Canadian subsidies to Bombardier. It also identified a ""dumping margin"" of 80.5 percent, based on the unpublished prices at which it claims Bombardier sold the CSeries planes to Delta, for a combined border charge of just under 160 percent on the Bombardier jets.
Wednesday's decision is in line with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' pledge to aggressively police unfairly traded imports to help shrink U.S. trade deficits. 
It also coincides with negotiations between the United States, Canada and Mexico to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The dispute between the two planemakers could, however, move to a larger stage as Canada weighs a complaint to the World Trade Organization or through NAFTA.
At a contentious hearing of the ITC on Monday, Canada said that a positive finding of material harm to Boeing by the group could represent a possible violation of international trade agreements and prompt a formal objection. 
Canada earlier this month scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Ottawa's anger over the trade challenge. Boeing has said it considered all potential risks before deciding to open its trade case.

U.S.-Canadian trade relations have also chilled over disputes about Canadian softwood lumber and U.S. milk protein products.

1292,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 04:32PM ET</span>",Short Sellers Are Targeting Asia's Booming Dollar Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Asian companies are turning to the dollar bond market like never before, selling record amounts of securities that leveraged investors desperate for yield are scooping up. But there’s a flip side to all that growth: it’s getting easier for funds to sell them short. 
With unprecedented numbers of first-time borrowers and concerns about the financial transparency of some issuers, the market is increasingly vulnerable to higher volatility. Traders are already reeling from high-profile meltdowns this year after prices collapsed on bonds from Noble Group Ltd. and Reliance Communications Ltd.
“You will see movements that you won’t have seen before,"" even as short selling can help improve market efficiency, said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
Booming issuance and more buying by banks is increasing the supply of securities available for lending -- and therefore shorting. Sales of dollar bonds in Asia excluding Japan have soared to $310 billion this year.
“We have found it easier and less expensive to short bonds,” said Darryl Flint, chief investment officer at Double Haven Capital (Hong Kong) Ltd. “There is more liquidity in the repo market.”
Repos, or repurchases, are agreements by a bondholder to lend out the security, retaking possession after a set time. Funds on the other side of the trade can sell the borrowed bond in hope of profiting from a slide in its price during the repo period.
Greater Leverage
Because the deals occur off organized exchanges, volume numbers are hard to estimate. But market participants say a rising stockpile of Asian dollar bonds at banks, along with the increased use of leverage to buy such securities, has fueled repos.
Banks took 30 percent of new note issuance this year, up from 17 percent in 2014, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). estimated in a note this month. That bump has come at the expense of institutions including pension funds.
“As you have more Chinese banks and securities firms buying Asia dollar bonds in large amounts, such investors are more able to lend out bonds for repo, which improves liquidity,” said Richard Cohen, head of credit for Asia-Pacific at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA.
That all threatens to shake up what’s been a notably stable market, aside from some company meltdowns like Noble. In some cases Asian dollar bonds have shown less volatility than U.S. counterparts during times of stress.
Investors in Asia have up to now also had less opportunity to bet against dollar bonds in the region due to a relative lack of credit-default swaps, which have been slow to catch on compared with developed markets.
“The market is more able to fulfill demand from investors to short Asia dollar bonds now because there are more bonds being lent out on repo by counterparties that are new to the market and taking a bit more leverage,” said Edward Gildar, Asia regional head for global finance products at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)."

The S&P 500 Index was little changed Wednesday, held back in part by slumping consumer and real estate shares, while the energy and telecom sectors rose. Core European bond yields followed Treasury rates higher, with European Central Bank asset purchases for the year ending Thursday.
The U.S. Senate approved the tax-cut legislation in a party-line vote and the House of Representatives passed the bill after a re-vote, bringing Trump to the brink of his first major legislative victory. The bill itself will be signed at a later date.
“The tax reform passing, you’d expect the market to celebrate that,” Kevin Caron, a senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, said by phone. “But in reality a lot of this has already been part of the drama over the last year or so in anticipation of this moment.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 04:29PM ET</span>","Wall Street edges lower, pauses as tax bill clears Congress","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes dipped on Wednesday, pausing after recent record highs as both houses of Congress approved a long-anticipated tax overhaul.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to a sweeping tax bill, which will be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The Senate had already voted in favor of the bill.
The proposed changes include cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent from Jan. 1, which could boost company earnings and pave the way for higher dividends and stock buybacks.
The S&P 500 has climbed about 4.5 percent since mid-November, led by a rally in sectors such as transport, banks and others that are expected to benefit the most from lower taxes.
Some analysts say the market has reached a lull, given stocks have already priced in approval of the tax bill.
""There's not as much upward movement as there was last week,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""As people sharpen their pencils and figure out which companies will benefit (from the tax bill), and companies start talking about that themselves, I think we'll see larger moves in share prices.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.1 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,726.65, the S&P 500 lost 2.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,679.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.89 points, or 0.04 percent, to 6,960.96.
Four of the 11 major S&P sectors ended higher, led by a 1.4 percent gain in energy. Energy stocks were fueled as oil prices rose about 1 percent, supported by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories.
Telecoms saw a 0.6-percent rise. The sector is considered by some analysts to be the biggest beneficiary of lower taxes. AT&T (NYSE:T) gained 1.3 percent.
The Dow Jones Transport Index jumped 0.9 percent to a record high close, helped by a surge in FedEx (NYSE:FDX). The company's shares were up 3.5 percent and earlier in the session touched a record high, a day after it reported a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.
Technology stocks, expected to benefit the least from lower taxes, were down 0.1 percent on the S&P 500. Chipmaker Micron was up 4.0 percent after strong results and forecast.
The consumer staples index fell 0.4 percent, weighed by a 2.5-percent slide in Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM).
Reuters reported former Philip Morris employees detailed irregularities in clinical trials for the company's e-cigarette, due to be voted on by the U.S. FDA next year.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Volume so far on U.S. exchanges was 6.17 billion shares, compared to the 6.84 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers is cooperating with a government investigation into allegations of embezzlement by union officials at training centers funded by U.S. automakers, the union's president said on Wednesday.
The probe was limited to a small group of people and would not affect remaining leadership, UAW President Dennis Williams said. He said the union is conducting its own investigation, led by outside attorneys and UAW general counsel Niraj Ganatra.
""I don't see no reason to have no cloud over anybody at this point,"" Williams told reporters at the union's Detroit headquarters. ""We have spent the last several months under a magnifying glass, and rightly so.""
In July, federal prosecutors accused a former  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) vice president of making $1.2 million in improper payments to a former union vice president and his wife. Four people have been charged in the Fiat Chrysler probe.
In November, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said they were cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice investigation.
The UAW is preparing for an election next June to replace Williams. Top union officials have nominated Gary Jones, a UAW regional director, as president. 
Williams said he did not expect a backlash from rank-and-file members.
""I feel very comfortable that our standing with the membership is the same,"" he said.
He expressed dissatisfaction with Ford over its decision to shift production of a future battery electric vehicle to Mexico to make room for self-driving vehicles at the company's Flat Rock, Michigan, plant.
A Ford spokesman said the company remains the top producer of U.S. vehicles and has more hourly U.S. workers than any other automaker.
The UAW has struggled to organize automakers and suppliers this year. 
Workers at a  Fuyao Glass  Industry Group Co Ltd (SS:600660) plant in southwestern Ohio voted heavily against union representation last month. The UAW also lost a bitterly contested vote at a Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) plant in Mississippi in August.
Last week, the National Labor Relations Board voted to make it harder to organize so-called micro unions made up of small groups of a company's employees, posing a fresh challenge. [L1N1OG0A6]
Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is contesting the NLRB's recognition of a vote for UAW representation by roughly 160 skilled workers at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant.

Williams said that if the NLRB moved against the VW micro union, ""we may have to go back to striking to get recognition.""

The extent of the power outage that began on Sunday at Delta's most significant hub was first reported by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, following an interview with Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian. 
Bastian told the paper that it was not yet clear where responsibility for the outage fell between the airport or its utility provider, but the carrier would be seeking reimbursement for the losses he estimated to be between $25 million and $50 million.
 Georgia Power  (N:GPJA), the utility that provides electricity to the sprawling airport that is run by the city of Atlanta, has said the failure was linked to a fire in an underground facility that damaged substations serving Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The blaze, possibly started when a piece of gear failed, damaged access to a backup system, the company said.
Delta was forced to cancel some 1,400 flights as a result of the system failure. 
The outage struck at the onset of one of the busiest travel periods of the year, as airlines typically have significantly more passengers traveling for the winter holiday season. 
Industry trade group Airlines for America (A4A) had previously forecast that 51 million passengers would fly on U.S. airlines globally during the 21-day period from Dec. 15 to Jan. 4, up nearly 3.5 percent from the year prior.

Any losses during the busy period, including costs incurred refunding and rebooking passengers, could put a damper on carriers' earlier projected fourth-quarter and full-year earnings.

Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said in a statement that its board made the change to allow members to ""engage directly"" with key shareholders and ""to address areas of interest."" In the past, it funneled shareholder communications with its board through a company-run website.
John Roe, a managing director and head of analytics at proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services, said Exxon was belatedly recognizing that big shareholders were more willing to back activist resolutions since the 2008 financial crisis. He called acceptance of shareholder-director meetings ""quite a normal practice"" at many companies.
Exxon's board has been under pressure for years from investors unhappy with a policy that effectively barred independent directors from speaking directly with shareholders.
Top asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) earlier this year said it voted against two directors at Exxon's annual meeting on May 31, ""In line with our expectations that the lead independent director should be available to shareholders."" A BlackRock spokesman did not immediately reply to a message on Wednesday.
A group of investors recently said they were considering a resolution to challenge the policy at Exxon's 2018 shareholder meeting. In a Dec. 5 letter to Exxon's board, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs and other shareholder representatives had urged an end to the practice of barring direct board interactions with shareholders. 
On Wednesday, Frerichs called the decision ""a positive step for investors and the environment,"" and called for additional governance changes. 

""The next step is to revise the director-nominating process, director compensation, and executive pay to ensure that ExxonMobil is well‑positioned to address climate-related risks and capitalize on fresh, innovative ideas,"" he said.

Up to 250 jobs could be affected at Deutsche Bank and up to 750 at the Postbank unit, the paper said, adding the bank hoped about two-thirds of the reductions could be achieved via early retirement and the rest through severance pay.
Employees have until October 2018 to decide, the paper said.

Postbank is currently being integrated into Deutsche Bank after Germany's biggest lender unsuccessfully tried to sell the business.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp shareholders get impatient for change,"By Tom Käckenhoff and Christoph Steitz
DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Some investors in German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) are becoming impatient with the pace of its restructuring, putting pressure on Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger to fix underperforming units and revive its flagging share price.
In the job since 2011, Hiesinger is seeking to transform the sprawling engineering and steel group into a company with a focus on high-tech elevators, the construction of industrial plants, materials trading and its businesses serving car makers, its biggest single customer group.
Since he took over nearly seven years ago, shares in Thyssenkrupp are down about a fifth, underperforming an 87-percent rise in the DAX <0#.GDAXI> but better than the 55-percent decline of ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's biggest steelmaker.
But for some investors that's not good enough.
""There are areas that are lagging expectations and need fixing,"" one of Thyssenkrupp's top 20 shareholders said, declining to be named.
The muted performance even caused activist investor Cevian, Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder with an 18-percent stake, to recently question whether the group's conglomerate structure was still appropriate.
Hiesinger, in a letter to shareholders last month, said it was still Thyssenkrupp's goal to enable the ""optimum development of all business areas so as to strengthen the performance of the group as a whole"".
Cevian, in the meantime, has repeatedly suggested a demerger of better-performing units, including Thyssenkrupp's most profitable elevator business that accounts for almost half of its operating profit, calls which Hiesinger has so far resisted.
""The major break-through is still lacking,"" said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which usually represents 1 percent of Thyssenkrupp's voting rights at its annual general meeting.
Hiesinger has spent a lot of resources on severing ties to Thyssenkrupp's steel business, whose roots go back more than 200 years, and in September struck an initial deal to merge its European steel unit with that of  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC).
IN FOCUS
""Other divisions have perhaps not been in focus that much as a result and that poses a problem now,"" said Ingo Speich, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder that owns about 0.3 percent of Thyssenkrupp.
""Profitability levels of the individual businesses show that there is still a lot of room for improvement.""
Investors and analysts are most concerned about Thyssenkrupp's Industrial Solutions division, which builds plants, ships and submarines and has been hit by low-margin legacy orders and weak demand for plant in recent years.
Thyssenkrupp has already unveiled job cuts and recently announced a five-year high in orders at the division, but at 2 percent its operating margin is still below the 6-7 percent medium-to-long term target.
""I think the division is more cyclical than we all thought,"" said Bjoern Voss, analyst at Warburg Research. ""Now the division needs to be restructured.""
Some analysts also expect that Thyssenkrupp will at some point sell Materials Services, its materials distribution and trading division, a move analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) say would be a ""major catalyst"" for the group's stock price.
The division's operating margin stood at 2.3 percent in the last financial year, compared with a mid-term target of 3-4 percent.
Smaller German steel distributor  Kloeckner  & Co (DE:KCOGn) has expressed an interest in some parts of Materials Services, but said last week no talks were currently underway about a possible consolidation.
So far, Thyssenkrupp only wants to sell a small part of the division -- Acciai Speciali Terni (AST), its Italian stainless steel unit, which made 1.78 billion euros ($2.11 billion) of sales in 2016/17 and has been labeled non-strategic.
The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder with a 21 percent stake, declined to comment.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 12:20PM ET</span>","With small caps, best to be choosy after U.S. tax overhaul","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors have seen small-cap stocks as having the most to gain from a tax code overhaul ever since the 2016 U.S. election, but with a bill on the brink of Congress approval, analysts warned not all small names will benefit equally. 
The Russell 2000 index (RUT) has had its fortunes rise and fall based on the perceived chances of the tax plan's success. It surged nearly 14 percent in the seven weeks after the November 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who made a tax code rewrite central to his campaign.
Small caps in general are relatively sensitive to proposed tax cuts because more of their revenue is derived domestically compared to larger names with a greater global footprint. 
""Small caps underperformed for most of the year and are best able to receive the boost from a tax cut,"" said Alicia Levine, Director Of Portfolio Strategy at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.
Despite the post-election bump, small caps have trailed bigger companies in 2017, having felt more pain whenever the tax plan appeared on the brink of failure. 
The Russell 2000 tested a technical support level at its 50-day moving average on Dec. 14, when the sweeping bill seemed to hit obstacles as more Republican U.S. senators appeared to waver. 
The index is up 13.6 percent on the year versus a nearly 20 percent climb in the S&P 500 (SPX) and a more than 25 percent jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (DJI)
But as the small-cap index surged nearly 3 percent in the two session leading into the vote on Tuesday, some market participants cautioned a tax cut will not be a security blanket for all smaller names. 
Some have yet to produce earnings, while some may be vulnerable to rising interest rates after taking on debt in the low rate environment following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
""There’s a misperception that broad based they’ll do well,"" said Dan Hughes, vice president and client portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson Investment Management in Houston, Texas. 
One concern for small caps is valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the Russell 2000 at 26.1, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream, well above the 21.5 median and 21.4 mean. That number rises significantly when companies that do not generate earnings are included.
""It’s weird to say this - but earnings matter again,"" said Francis Gannon, chief investment officer at Royce Funds in New York. 
""At a moment in time when people are looking at the index and thinking the index should benefit, the index is getting increasingly risky."" 

Gannon recommended economically sensitive and cyclical names that have fundamentals, are not heavily leveraged and are poised to benefit from expansion both globally and domestically. He flagged industrial and materials businesses, including steel and chemical companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is powering up a lower-cost computerized investment management tool this week and plans to offer the robo-adviser to some clients next March and on a wide scale in the middle of the year.
The company will file required disclosures on Wednesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, bank officials told Reuters, so they could start testing the service this week with fewer than 100 employee accounts.
The goal is to offer ""guidance and advice for a broad range of clients, whether you have a few thousand dollars, or more,"" said Kelli Keough, head of digital wealth management. 
The service, piloted as JPMorgan Digital Investing, is the latest in a raft of online investing tools called robo-advisers that firms offer as a low-cost way to get basic advice and automated portfolio management.
The services ask such questions as customer age, risk appetite and objectives, then suggest investments like diversified exchange-traded funds, which often are selected by an investment committee. Computers rebalance portfolios according to preset rules.
The robo-advisers are viewed as a low-cost way to attract individuals who do not yet have enough money to make individual personal management worthwhile. 
Consulting firms estimate the services could be managing more than $10 trillion within several years. Financial companies including  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) and Bank of America's (N:BAC) Merrill Lynch, have followed fintech firms, such as Betterment, with the offerings. 
Fees for basic services range from 25 to 50 basis points annually, or $2.50 to $5.00 per $1,000 invested, significantly less than the roughly 100-basis-point fees financial advisers charge.
JPMorgan plans to set its fees for the public by March, Keough said. It will also lower the $5,000 minimum investment being used during testing with employees. ""We are exploring and testing a variety of different pricing mechanisms,"" Keough said.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last year the bank could offer the service free or as part of a package of products.
JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets, with upwards of 50 million customers holding consumer banking and credit card accounts.
The bank developed the service in-house with InvestCloud, a financial software firm that it hired and invested in last year to improve its online, mobile banking and investment offerings. 

The investment in the automated service is part of a $300 million commitment by Dimon for better technology for asset management products, Keough said.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 11:09AM ET</span>",Amazon's allure may be tough to top this holiday: poll,"By Richa Naidu and Chris Kahn
CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - More U.S. online shoppers plan to give Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) the bulk of their holiday business this year than in previous years, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, despite costly efforts by traditional retailers to attract customers to their websites. 
The online poll of 2,644 adults, released on Wednesday, found that 60 percent of online shoppers planned to do most of their holiday buying on Amazon.com, up from 50 percent during the same period in 2015. Meanwhile, the proportion of shoppers who said they expected to do most of their shopping at Walmart.com,  Target .com and  Macys .com declined by about 1 percentage point each in that period.
Consumers opting increasingly for convenience and speedy delivery have already pushed online sales this holiday season to record highs, making it all the more crucial that retailers get their digital businesses into gear.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), Target Corp (N:TGT) and Macy's Inc (N:M), like many of their peers, have invested in deeper online discounts and free shipping this holiday season, potentially hurting fourth-quarter profit margins to win back customers who have turned increasingly to Amazon.com.
Retailers have also invested heavily in sprucing up their websites and mobile device apps. They are rolling out more fulfillment options such as curbside pickup, click-and-collect and same-day delivery. The holiday shopping season can account for 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.
Anand Raghuraman, EY's Americas leader for consumer products and retail strategy, said traditional retailers' online sales were growing, but not fast enough to win market share. 
""They're dealing with an 800-pound gorilla that has different metrics around profitability than they do, which is tough to compete with,"" said Raghuraman. 
Earnest Research, which looks at anonymous card transactions made by millions of U.S. shoppers, said data from the two weeks after Thanksgiving showed Amazon's market share of U.S. sales had risen 2.6 percent from the same period last year.
Meanwhile Walmart's in-store and online market share for the period was down 1.7 percent, while Target had lost 0.6 percent and Macy's was down 0.5 percent, according to Earnest. 
Target expects fourth-quarter digital growth to once again be among the best in the industry, spokesman Joshua Thomas said. Macy's spokeswoman Radina Russell said the department store chain had begun the holiday season well and would continue to offer value online and in stores.
Walmart did not immediately provide comment.
To be sure, analytics firms and industry groups expect most traditional retailers to report higher holiday sales this year, both online and in stores, driven by discounting, low unemployment, rising consumer confidence and good weather across the country.
Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday also topped prior years and Amazon.com said it broke sales records during that holiday weekend.
According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, about one in every four adults plan to shop primarily or entirely online this holiday season, up from one in five in 2012. Convenience, delivery and the ability to compare prices easily were the most common reasons people choose to shop online, the poll showed.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English throughout the United States from Nov. 27 to Dec. 7. Because it is an online poll, the respondents may be more experienced with computers and online shopping than the general public. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 11:06AM ET</span>","Qatar's currency manipulation probe could curb offshore FX trade, risk Gulf backlash","By Saeed Azhar and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar's investigation into alleged manipulation of its currency could give it more control over exchange rates but make some international banks more wary of doing business with Doha.
The probe may also risk prompting Qatar's diplomatic enemies to impose more economic sanctions on it, if their banks are targeted in the investigation.
""The risk is if the other Gulf countries, say Saudi and the UAE, react to this campaign by Qatar against currency manipulation by imposing fresh sanctions on Qatar,"" said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics in London. 
""In particular, if they try to prevent their own banks from dealing with Qatari banks."" 
Qatar's central bank said on Tuesday that it had launched a legal investigation into attempts by countries opposed to it to harm the Qatari economy by manipulating the currency, securities and derivatives markets.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic boycott on Qatar in June, accusing it of backing terrorism, which it denies. 
In Tuesday's statement, Qatar did not specify how the other countries were trying to sabotage its markets.
But Qatari central banker Khalid Alkhater told Reuters last month that some banks from nations boycotting Qatar were trying to manipulate the riyal by trading it between themselves offshore at artificially weak levels, to create an illusion that the riyal was under pressure.
He said a similar attack had been made on Qatari bonds, though it had failed because the bond market was illiquid and because Doha had taken precautionary steps. Other Qatari officials have accused boycotting countries of trying to undermine Doha's stock market by dumping shares.
Qatar's central bank said it hired New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to lead its probe. That firm was among legal advisers to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) when it was accused of rigging interest rates in 2015; Deutsche agreed to pay $2.5 billion in a deal with U.S. and British regulators.
A number of financial institutions and individuals have been asked to preserve documents in advance of legal proceedings, the central bank said without naming them.
Bankers in the Gulf said the threat of the probe was likely to make banks more cautious about trading riyal  in the offshore foreign exchange market, for fear of leaving themselves exposed to accusations of manipulation.
WEAKER
Since the boycott was imposed, the riyal has sometimes traded offshore at levels several percent weaker than in the onshore market, where the vast majority of activity occurs and where the currency has stayed near its official peg of 3.64 to the U.S. dollar.
By deterring offshore activity, Qatar may force even more currency trade onshore, where it can be monitored and the central bank can more easily take action against institutions which appear to be trading without commercial motives. 
A portfolio manager at a Dubai-based bank said Qatar's central bank was already identifying institutions which were selling the riyal and inquiring about motives behind the trades.
Some banks doing business with Qatar have begun to prepare for any potential legal challenges arising from the probe by checking documents and electronic records of their riyal transactions, banking sources said.
One danger for Qatar is that the costs of these legal precautions, and the perceived risk of being caught up unwittingly in the investigation, could deter international banks from doing legitimate business there.
""As a financial institution you’re running a reputational risk, especially if your bank has a licence in Qatar,"" said the portfolio manager.
Last month, equity index compiler MSCI said it would consider using offshore exchange rates to value Qatari stocks - a move that could hurt the stocks' weightings in international indexes - because some foreign investors were finding it difficult to obtain riyal onshore. 
MSCI ultimately decided not to make the change after the Qatari central bank pledged to supply all investors' currency requirements. But if more foreign banks withdraw from the market and liquidity suffers, the problem of access to riyal could emerge again.
Qatar's legal action may eventually come to resemble litigation in the United States, where private investors have filed suit accusing over a dozen international banks of rigging prices in the roughly $5.1 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. Many banks have settled the litigation.
If Qatar attempts to take action against banks from the boycotting countries, however, those banks' governments could respond with tougher action against Doha. So far they have warned their banks to be wary of doing business in Qatar, but have stopped short of an outright ban.
Officials from central banks or other government institutions in the four countries did not respond to requests for comment

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate Fosun International (HK:0656) is taking a large chunk of  Tsingtao Brewery  Co (SS:600600) (HK:0168) after Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502) said on Wednesday it would sell its entire 19.9 percent stake for a total of 106 billion yen ($937 million).
Asahi said in October it was considering selling its stake in Tsingtao, China's second largest brewer which was founded in 1903 by German and British merchants. Asahi is drawing back from China to focus more on Europe and other Asian markets.
China is the world's largest beer market by sales, but profits have been harder to come by amid fierce competition between local brewers and global beer giants AB InBev (BR:ABI),  Heineken  NV (AS:HEIN) and Carlsberg (CO:CARLb).
Asahi has agreed to sell most of its stake -- about 243 million shares, equivalent to a 17.99 percent stake -- to Fosun and its subsidiaries for HK$6.6 billion ($844 million), Asahi and Fosun said in separate statements.
The remainder, around 27 million shares, will be sold to state-owned Tsingtao Brewery Group for HK$735 million, Asahi said.
The sale price of HK$27.22 per share was at a 32 percent discount to Tsingtao's last closing price of HK$40 in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, Fosun said.
""Fosun has been able to pick up the shares at a fairly significant discount,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group, adding there was room to grow both at home and overseas if Fosun could help Tsingtao move up-market.
""China's beer market is going through a reinvention right now as younger consumers shift towards more niche brands. Tsingdao is kind of an outlier because it has mass scale and volume but is also looked upon as being more premium than other domestic beer brands.""
CLOSER TO HOME
Asahi's decision to divest its stake in Tsingtao, which it acquired in 2009 for around $666 million, follows its announcement in June of the sale of its 20 percent stake in China's Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co Ltd for $612 million.
The maker of Japan's best-selling beer, Asahi Super Dry, has been increasingly focusing on Europe, and bought a group of eastern European beer brands from  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) last year for 7.3 billion euros ($8.7 bln).
Its exit from Tsingtao will make Fosun the second largest shareholder in Tsingtao after Tsingtao Brewery Group. 
It comes as a handful of Chinese conglomerates including Fosun have turned their sights back on the domestic market amid a crackdown by Beijing on eye-catching overseas ventures.
Cavender said the deal would likely go down well with Chinese regulators because it was ""an example of Fosun coming home and investing in a Chinese asset"" rather than overseas.
""Tsingtao is both a leading brewery in China, and a leading Chinese brand that has successfully penetrated the international markets,"" Fosun Chairman Guo Guangchang said in the company's statement.
Fosun's business model and global reach would help grow Tsingtao's brand and tap into Chinese demand for more premium beers, he added.
Fosun, one of China's most prolific deal-makers headed by billionaire Guo, is best known outside the country for its portfolio of businesses including French resort chain Club Med, margarine maker St Hubert and Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp. 
The firm is also in exclusive talks to take a majority stake in luxury Italian lingerie group La Perla.
Like other Chinese conglomerates such as Dalian Wanda and HNA Group, Fosun has dialled back on some ambitions abroad as Beijing has stepped up scrutiny of outbound deal-making, notably in sectors such as property, hotels and entertainment. 
Fosun has since pared back its foreign real estate portfolio. It sold off a Sydney office tower for A$142.5 million ($109 million) this week and is also selling Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Chambers in London.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Russian oil firm Tatneft ran Crimea fuel station, despite sanctions risk","By Anton Zverev and Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - One of Russia's biggest oil companies, Tatneft, has been doing business in Crimea despite the risk of being placed on a U.S. sanctions blacklist, according to company documents and a source close to Tatneft.
Most big Russian oil firms pulled out of Crimea after Washington imposed sanctions over Moscow's annexation of the region from Ukraine in 2014 and threatened to put any company operating on the peninsula on its list of sanctioned entities. 
But a company called ZAO firma KONTs that operated a fuel station in the Crimean city of Sevastopol until at least September is controlled by units of Tatneft, according to ownership records in the state tax registry and the state statistics service that were collated by the Russian database
SPARK.
In addition, a document dated Sept. 4 that was seen by Reuters at the Sevastopol fuel station stated the fuel on sale there had been supplied by Tatneft-AZS-Yug, which is listed in the official register of the tax service as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tatneft.
By late November, documents issued by the fuel station showed KONTs was no longer the owner, and there was no ownership link between Tatneft and the new owner. Reuters was not able to establish whether a Tatneft subsidiary was still supplying the fuel.
Tatneft said in a Sept. 18 statement to Reuters that it has no fuel stations in Crimea and cannot control where fuel products it sells end up. Tatneft ""does not supply (its own or anyone else's) fuel to Crimea or Sevastopol,"" it said.
Calls to a telephone number listed for KONTs went unanswered. A Reuters reporter who visited the Moscow address where the firm is registered found no sign of the company.
A security guard at the Moscow address said KONTs had never had an office there though a letter, he said, had once arrived addressed to the firm. Tatneft had an office in the same building until a year ago, he added.
Tatneft AZS-YUG, which is based in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia, did not respond to a request for comment. 
SANCTIONS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT
Tatneft's presence in Crimea would give the U.S. Treasury Department legal grounds to include it on a list of companies which U.S. entities are forbidden to do business with, according to two Moscow-based lawyers who specialise in sanctions law - one of them with an international law firm and another with a Russian law firm.
The U.S. Treasury Department, whose Office of Foreign Assets Control enforces sanctions, declined to comment on Tatneft’s presence in Crimea and any implications for companies that do business with Tatneft.
Non-U.S. companies that have assets within U.S. jurisdiction and are deemed by Washington to have helped evade sanctions can themselves be subject to punitive measures, according to several U.S. and Russian lawyers who specialise in sanctions. Those could range from fines to inclusion in the sanctions list.
Tatneft has commercial relations with companies including global oil trader Vitol, and Polish firms PKN Orlen and Lotos, according to public documents and oil traders. Reuters has found no evidence that Tatneft has any business with, or plans to do business with, U.S. entities.
Tatneft's case highlights a gap between sanctions and their enforcement, showing that not all firms that do business in Crimea are blacklisted by Washington, either because officials are unaware or because they choose not to act.
Vitol, which traders say buys crude oil from Tatneft, said its dealings with clients were confidential but it has policies to ensure it complies with ""all relevant regulations and legislation"", including sanctions, wherever it operates.
PKN Orlen told Reuters it has a contract to buy oil from a Tatneft unit but considers possible geopolitical risks, and ways to minimise them, when concluding all trade agreements.
Lotos buys crude from Tatneft, according to a senior Lotos source and traders. A Lotos spokesman said the company does not comment on its trade relations or speculate on future events. A Lotos source who asked not to be named said the firm was aware of Tatneft's Crimea operation and potential risks stemming from the sanctions.
HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT
The Tatneft logo is on a sign outside a fuel station on Belkin Drive, a street near the centre of Sevastopol.
A Reuters reporter who bought fuel at the station on Sept. 8 was issued with a till receipt in the name of KONTs which included the firm's tax identification number.
The records displayed in the SPARK database from the official register of the Russian tax service do not show who currently owns KONTs but lists it as managed by Tatneft-AZS-Zapad. According to the register, Tatneft-AZS-Zapad is 99.9 percent owned by Tatneft.
According to other official data collated by SPARK, from the state statistics service, KONTs is 100 percent owned by Fin-Invest, a company controlled by firms listed as Tatneft-Aktiv, Processing Centre and Tatneft-AZS-Tsentr.
Tatneft-Aktiv and Tatneft-AZS-Tsentr are 100 percent controlled by Tatneft, while Processing Centre is 99 percent controlled by Tatneft, according to SPARK.
The source in Tatneft, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the fuel station that it “officially does not belong to Tatneft, so as not to fall under sanctions, but de facto it's entirely Tatneft."" The source did not explain the difference between official ownership and de facto ownership.
Tatneft's headquarters are in Russia's Tatarstan region, which holds a 35.93 percent stake in the company. 
Tatarstan's president, Rustam Minnikhanov, chairs Tatneft board meetings but the region's presidential administration said it did not make decisions about Tatneft's operations. 
It also said Tatneft did not now, or in the past, own fuel stations in Crimea and that the company had ended its presence in Crimea in 2013.
A female member of staff at the Sevastopol fuel station showed the Reuters reporter who visited it a document called a ""fuel passport"" detailing the origin of the fuel on sale there.
The document stated the fuel had been supplied by Tatneft-AZS-Yug, the firm listed by the tax service as a Tatneft unit.
SECOND VISIT
On a second visit to the Sevastopol fuel station on Nov. 27, after Reuters contacted Tatneft seeking comment for this article, KONTs' name had been removed from the till receipt and replaced with a company called OOO Resurs-A. The Tatneft branding was still on display at the station.
At the address in Sevastopol where Resurs-A is officially listed, there was no sign of the company. Employees of other firms based there had not heard of it.
Tax registry records displayed in the SPARK database and current as of Dec. 1 identified the ultimate owner of Resurs-A as Sergei Kucheryavenko, who is listed as a director or owner of 319 companies in Russia. No telephone number or address was listed for him.
One of the firms via which, according to the same records, he controls Resurs-A is registered in Tatarstan's capital, Kazan.
The firm, Restor, had no contact telephone number. Reuters sent an email seeking comment to the address listed for the company in the tax registry records but there was no reply. 
Tatarstan has ethnic ties to Crimea’s Tatars, a large ethnic minority. After Moscow annexed the region, the Russian government ordered several Russian regions to sponsor regions in Crimea, among them Tatarstan, according to the Tatarstan regional government’s website. 
At a meeting on April 1, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin told Minnikhanov he wanted Tatarstan to help rebuild Crimea’s infra-structure. Minnikhanov replied: “We’re ready to stand with you,” according to a Kremlin transcript of the meeting. 

The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment.

Durogesic is sold as a skin patch to control ongoing moderate to severe pain and is often prescribed in cancer cases. It contains fentanyl, an opioid which, if misused, can lead to death by overdose.
The French Autorite de la Concurrence said J&J's Janssen had ""repeatedly intervened"" to block the approval processes in France of Durogesic's generic copies and disparaged them when in contact with doctors and other healthcare professionals.
The company disputed the finding. 
""We firmly object to the statements contained in the competition authority's release and to its assessments,"" a spokeswoman for J&J said in an emailed statement, adding that the company was studying its options.
The case was brought to the watchdog by German firm Ratiopharm, later acquired by Israel's Teva pharmaceuticals, after Durogesic lost its patent in 2005.
In 2013, France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) was ordered to pay 40.6 million euros for disparaging generic competition to its Plavix blood thinner.

PARIS/ZURICH (Reuters) - Online platforms offering rentals or shares in everything from glitzy watches to sports cars are making inroads in the luxury goods market, as a shift in consumer habits begins to head up market. 
Playing off the sharing economy model popularized by the likes of Airbnb, such companies invite people to enjoy luxury brands without spending a fortune. For example, a fixed monthly fee gives a consumer use of a Rolex watch for a few weeks which they then send back to exchange for another luxury brand.
Businesses say the market for renting or co-investing in everything from jewelery to fine art is taking off with moderately well-off clients aspiring to a taste of the high life, and potentially the seriously wealthy.
""The modern generation leads a very different life, people want to keep their options open,"" said Marco Abele, who formerly worked in digital banking at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and is now developing sharing platform TEND, set to launch in Switzerland in March. 
The platform offers people ways of buying tradable stakes in a Porsche or a vineyard, for a return on their investment and a chance to go for occasional spins in the car or get customized bottles. 
While aiming to ""democratize"" luxury, its target customers are not quite every man or woman: their net worth would be around 100,000 to 1 million Swiss francs ($1 million), Abele said. 
While still small, the sharing economy is predicted to grow from around $15 billion in 2016 to $335 billion by 2025, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Luxury is only a small part of that but has potential.
""It's not a significant market, but it's getting under way, it will become more significant,"" said Olivier Abtan, a luxury specialist at Boston Consulting Group. ""There are a lot of start-ups and especially young people piling into this.""
Eleven James, a U.S.-based watch rental site launched in 2014, is considering moving into jewelery and artworks and may expand overseas, Chief Executive Olivier Reza said. 
The company - whose monthly fees range from $150 to $500, depending on the value of the watches - used to rent out its own stock. But in November it opened up to collectors wanting to lease their timepieces. 
""This mainly came about because of consumer demand,"" Reza said. ""People have more watches, they can't wear them all at once, they tire of them.""
TEST BEFORE BUYING
For some luxury manufacturers, this budding market may be an unwelcome development. 
They had only just started to make peace with e-commerce, having long been afraid that online sales might dilute their brands, and are still fighting to control distribution, resisting moving onto mainstream sites such as Amazon (O:AMZN).
Now they run the risk of missing out on sales as people rent a piece of the luxury they offer, making items more accessible - and ubiquitous - undermining their exclusivity. 
Still, rentals of evening dresses or designer items by Chanel or Louis Vuitton have long existed, as have co-investments in assets including private jets and yachts. Online platforms offer a means of rapidly expanding such services. 
For watch enthusiast Chi Chan, 43, a New York-based IT developer who has consigned four watches to Eleven James, the rental site is an easy way of testing before buying. 

""It is very intimidating sometimes to go to a boutique with the salespeople judging you,"" said Chan, suggesting online leasing was less pressured.

LONDON (Reuters) - Subscription music leader Spotify is set to capitalize next year on the rude health of the industry with a stock market flotation, even as competitors race to find fresh ways to outflank it by catering to often fickle consumer tastes.
As Spotify plans a stock market listing, its own valuation among private investors has grown around 20 percent to at least $19 billion in the past few months, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
The streaming music service said last June it had more than 140 million active users while listing more than 30 million songs, but it is paid subscribers that count in business terms. Spotify last reported over 60 million paid users, twice that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, its closest rival. 
INDUSTRY HEALTH 
The global market for recorded music grew by 5.9 percent in 2016 - the quickest pace in the two decades since industry body International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) began tracking the digital music market in 1997. 
Streaming revenue grew 60 percent last year, offsetting a sharp drop in download revenue and a longer-term decline in CD sales, the trade group estimates. (https://goo.gl/mMgwP9)
No. 1 Spotify reported over 60 million paid subscribers in July. 
No. 2 Apple Music reported 30 million users as of September. 
No. 3 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had around 16 million paid subscribers in July, according to MIDiA Research. 
COMPETING BUSINESS MODELS 
Google's (O:GOOGL) YouTube has been one of the most popular sources of free music for online listeners for a decade. 
YouTube is expected to join up with Google Play service for phones to create a new paid streaming service in the first few months of 2018, according to various media reports, building on an initial ad-free effort called YouTube Red it launched in 2016 with popular song artists. 
Soundcloud. Once the world's most popular free streaming music app, the Berlin-based company struggled to find a profitable business model before nearly running out of cash this year. Since August, it has raised new financing and brought in an executive team that had worked for online video service Vimeo.
Deezer dominates the francophone world and parts of Eastern Europe. It competes with big global players not by securing the rights to the latest music from Beyonce or Ed Sheeran, but by focusing on local music genres in fast-growing markets and striking deals with telecom operators. 
Pandora Media Inc, the largest U.S. music service, has struggled in recent years with its advertising supported service, which users may find too invasive as alternatives proliferate. CEO Roger Lynch said last month it aims to improve its existing platform. A source told Reuters that it will likely buy an ad tech firm to help, rather build its own system.
ASIA
Music streaming dominates in Europe and the Americas, but Asia is a far newer story. While global brands are racing to expand there, regional players such as China's Joox are creating a home field advantage by hiring local teams with different interfaces for Chinese, English and Malay listeners and more localized music options. (https://goo.gl/pJUsFV)
Spotify and the music arm of China's Tencent Holdings Ltd agreed to buy minority stakes in each other ahead of the Swedish firm's expected stock market listing, the companies said earlier this month.
Tencent Music Entertainment Group, which runs on three music streaming sites, QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo, and counts more than 100 million free, daily active users, launched a subscription service earlier this year. It boasts 60 percent of China's online music market, research firm iiMedia has estimated. (https://goo.gl/MQ71U4)

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",Foreign investment banks in EU face tougher central bank supervision,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Big foreign investment banks face a tougher regulatory regime in the European Union under proposals made on Wednesday by the European Commission to bring them under the direct control of the European Central Bank, already the main regulator for top euro zone lenders.
Investment banks trade stocks, bonds, currencies and derivatives on behalf of customers, activities that have traditionally been supervised by market regulators rather than a central bank.
But the Commission is proposing to bring big investment banks with assets of over 30 billion euros ($35.5 billion) under the tougher supervision faced by lenders who take deposits, while easing the regulatory burden on small investment firms, which account for the bulk of 6,000 investment firms currently authorized.
""The new rules will support well-functioning capital markets, while ensuring financial stability,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
""At the same time, larger firms posing similar risks as banks should be regulated and supervised like banks.""
The big investment banks are largely concentrated in Britain, but are shifting parts of their operations to elsewhere in the EU in order to maintain links with customers there after the UK leaves the bloc in March 2019.
The ECB, which will be their new regulator, has been vocal in warning that foreign banks in London won't get away with setting up ""letter box"" or thinly staffed operations in the bloc.
The banks are hoping, however, to continue serving EU customers from London to some extent after Brexit.
The EU has existing powers to grant such market access to non-EU financial firms if their home rules are ""equivalent"" or as robust as the rules in force in the bloc.
It is a test solely in the gift of Brussels, and it looks set to become tougher.
""As the proposals change the prudential rules for investment firms, the equivalence test must also be adjusted to include these new rules,"" the European Commision said in a statement.
""It is proposed to set out in greater detail some of the requirements for equivalence.""
Any equivalence assessment done by Brussels will have to be ""very detailed and granular"", it added.
To remain equivalent, a non-EU country like Britain after Brexit has to avoid diverging from the bloc's rules, which could turn Britain into a ""rule taker"", a step which some advocates for Brexit fiercely oppose.
Separately on Wednesday the BBC reported that the Bank of England would not force branches of EU banks in London to convert themselves into subsidiaries after Brexit, which would have been a costly undertaking.
The BoE announcement could help persuade Brussels to soften the plans it announced on Wednesday.
The proposals need the approval of EU states and the European Parliament, a process that will take many months and often results in changes.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 07:21AM ET</span>",Special Report: Scientists describe problems in Philip Morris e-cigarette experiments,"By Tom Lasseter, Paritosh Bansal, Thomas Wilson, Ami Miyazaki Duff Wilson and Aditya Kalra
TOKYO/NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to approve a potentially path-breaking smoking device by Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM). With a decision expected next year, former employees and contractors have described to Reuters a number of irregularities involving clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant's application to the agency.
By heating tobacco instead of burning it, the company says the device, known as iQOS, avoids subjecting smokers to the same levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in a regular cigarette. The company has spent more than $3 billion developing new smoking platforms like iQOS. As part of that initiative, Philip Morris has published extensive scientific findings, based in part on clinical studies.
Tamara Koval, who worked at the company from 2012 to 2014 and helped coordinate clinical trials for the device, questioned the quality of some of the researchers and sites contracted to carry out those experiments. Koval was a co-author of the company's protocol used to run the studies globally. When she highlighted an irregularity in one of the studies, Koval said, Philip Morris excluded her from meetings.
Reuters also found irregularities during interviews with some of the principal investigators contracted to conduct the trials for the company. One principal investigator said he knew nothing about tobacco. Philip Morris had to jettison the experiment that investigator performed after it emerged he hadn't followed a basic procedure for obtaining informed consent from participants during clinical trials.
A second investigator submitted urine samples that exceeded what a human being is capable of, according to two former company employees, and then initially refused to acknowledge there was a problem. A third said he doesn't hold such company-sponsored clinical trials in high regard, describing them as ""dirty"" because their purpose is more commercial than scientific.
After reviewing Reuters' findings, Philip Morris said in a statement that ""all studies were conducted by suitably qualified and trained Principal Investigators."" The company said it understands that ""FDA inspectors have already audited some facilities"" involved in the trials. Philip Morris also said it had taken steps to address ""any reported irregularity in our studies.""
""Our policies encourage speaking up about suspected violations of law or our policies and we do not tolerate retaliation against those who speak up,"" the company said.
In addition to former Philip Morris employees involved with the iQOS program, Reuters interviewed six of the 11 principal investigators who were responsible for five of eight clinical trials the company submitted to the FDA. Reuters also reviewed hundreds of pages of publicly available Philip Morris study reports and FDA filings.
That reporting identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators, as well as their knowledge of the study results.
A group of tobacco research and policy experts reviewed detailed summaries of Reuters' reporting and Philip Morris' response. The experts, including a former head of the FDA and two former scientific advisers for the agency, said those findings raise concerns about Philip Morris' clinical trial program.
""Taken as a whole, it's clear they do not have the sophistication to carry out adequate and well-controlled clinical trials,"" said David Kessler, the FDA's commissioner from 1990 to 1997, referring to the company. ""I am not inferring any malicious intent here, just that they lack sophistication, because this is not their bread and butter.""
If the FDA has already audited some of the trial sites used by Philip Morris, the agency ""should carefully review its audits and possibly expand them,"" said Kessler, a former dean of the medical school at Yale University.
'THE FDA SHOULD AUDIT'
Tom Eissenberg, who served on the FDA's tobacco products scientific advisory committee until earlier this year, said: ""The FDA should audit.""
Reuters did not find any evidence that the outcome of the experiments presented by the company to the FDA was manipulated or falsified. 
The new insights into the company's clinical trial program for iQOS come at a crucial time for Philip Morris. The world's largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value and maker of Marlboro cigarettes has applied to the U.S. FDA to be able to sell iQOS in America, and also for permission to market it as a modified-risk tobacco product. That designation could mean that Philip Morris is allowed to market iQOS as presenting less harm or risk of disease to users than traditional tobacco.
For now, the FDA is evaluating the company's studies. Reuters outlined its findings about the iQOS trials to the agency. The FDA said it cannot comment on a pending application.
Philip Morris says the device, which heats small tobacco inserts, is meant for smokers who would not otherwise quit. Its chief executive officer, Andre Calantzopoulos, has told investors and media alike that he intends to one day replace cigarettes with products like iQOS. So far, iQOS makes up a fraction of the company's $75 billion revenues and Philip Morris continues to market conventional cigarettes across the globe.
Internal Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters show the significance of iQOS goes beyond its profit potential. The device is now sold in more than two dozen nations after it was first launched in Japan and Italy during late 2014.
The company has a 10-year plan for what it calls ""normalization"" of the tobacco industry, according to a 2014 strategy document. The industry has been shunned over the past two decades for producing and marketing products that kill people and previously lying about it. Under a section on ""strategies and actions"" to achieve that goal, the document lists, among other things, new smoking devices such as iQOS and the scientific research involved in developing them.
Told about that document, Philip Morris said: ""The suggestion that the purpose of our development of IQOS and our scientific research program is to 'normalize' the tobacco industry is false.""
That previously undisclosed document and others can be found in a searchable repository published by Reuters, The Philip Morris Files. (http://reut.rs/2sT51xF)
'I JUST DON'T READ THEM'
As part of its submission to the U.S. FDA, the company said the results of its research showed the device significantly reduced the level of certain harmful substances that users were exposed to compared with cigarettes, and satisfied their nicotine cravings. ""In fact the level of reduction is so considerable, it approaches 95% of the levels measured in smokers who quit altogether,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.
Taken along with the company's laboratory studies, Philip Morris said, the research program ""in its entirety demonstrates that IQOS is likely to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases.""
Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS. ""Those who criticize us should probably look at our science,"" said Tommaso Di Giovanni, a company spokesman, during a tour of Philip Morris' research and development headquarters in March.
The eight clinical experiments that Philip Morris submitted to the FDA were conducted between 2013 and 2015. For one study, scientists in Texas and Florida did not respond to messages left by Reuters. Other scientists, in Belfast and Tokyo, declined to talk. Half of the eight studies were done in Japan.
FDA guidelines for conducting clinical studies say a trial should adhere to standards such as Good Clinical Practice. That best-practices document says investigators ""should be qualified by training and experience and should have adequate resources"" to properly conduct a trial.
Masayuki Sugimoto, the principal investigator who oversaw testing at one facility used by Philip Morris to conduct a trial, said his Tokyo clinic is ""heavily in the red.""
Sugimoto said he generally has little confidence that all the participants in experiments like the one he ran for Philip Morris on nicotine tell the truth about their smoking history – that is, whether they smoke.
Speaking about the final study report from the Philip Morris trial, Sugimoto said in an interview that he generally doesn't have time to read such things in detail. He said he probably signed a document indicating he had received the final report. Sugimoto gestured with his thumb and forefinger to indicate a thick document: ""I just don't read them.""
Philip Morris said that it ""did not receive any such comments or statements from the PI,"" or principal investigator. Sugimoto's study, it said, was completed ""without any issues."" The company said the study data was reviewed and discussed with the investigator throughout the trial.
The Japanese company hired to monitor studies in the country,  CMIC Holdings  Co Ltd (T:2309), said in a statement that researchers confirmed that trial participants were smokers by using urine tests.
Asked about the tests, Sugimoto said he thought they would prevent non-smokers from joining the trial but added, ""I don’t know whether they were done that rigorously.""
Told of Sugimoto's doubts about the honesty of study participants, Eissenberg, who served on the FDA's tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2011 to 2017, said ""it raises a great deal of concern.""
A principal investigator ""is required to make sure that the participants meet the inclusion-exclusion criteria that are in the protocol,"" said Eissenberg. He was referring to the fact that clinical trial subjects' backgrounds – such as whether they are smokers – should meet the parameters of the experiment for the data to be valid. ""And a PI should have confidence in that,"" he said.
DATA DISCARDED
At another laboratory in Japan, issues with how the study was carried out were so acute that data from 56 participants was thrown out, raising questions about the competence of the principal investigator. Philip Morris halted the study at that location.
In the company's study documentation released by the FDA, Philip Morris recorded the reason for discarding the data as non-compliance with good clinical practices, specifically ""failure of the site to meet sample collection procedures and data recording procedures.""
Kishor Lad, who was Philip Morris' data manager on the study, said the site crossed a line of what's allowed during such trials: It collected samples before getting informed consent forms signed by the volunteers. ""Completely a no-no in the GCP world,"" Lad said, using the acronym for good clinical practice.
Philip Morris confirmed to Reuters that ""informed consent was not obtained prior to execution of a study procedure"" – specifically, the collection of urine samples. The problem was identified by CMIC, the contract research group, during a routine monitoring visit, Philip Morris said. A subsequent round of audits, it added, ""led to prompt discontinuation of the study at the Seishukai Clinic."" The incident, the company said, was properly logged in the study report and the submission to the FDA.
""It suggests the investigator had no idea, did not understand or just didn't care what his responsibilities were in conducting the study,"" said Greg Koski, a former director of the U.S. federal Office for Human Research Protections, which advocates for research subjects. ""This is such a flagrant violation, that investigator shouldn't be doing clinical studies.""
Mamoru Oki was the principal investigator at the time at the facility, the Seishukai Clinic in Tokyo. Reached by phone, Oki said: ""My specialty is urology and I don't know anything about tobacco, so I cannot talk.""
Told of that remark, Philip Morris said: ""Dr. Oki was qualified and trained specifically on the product.""
Dorothy Hatsukami, a member of the FDA's tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2010 to 2013, said a principal investigator's professed lack of knowledge about tobacco is not ideal.
""For any tobacco-related clinical trial, an investigator with a background in tobacco product research would have better qualifications to evaluate the study results than a novice,"" she said.
The study continued at a parallel site, the Tokyo Heart Center. 
During an interview at the center, principal investigator Masahiro Endo said repeatedly that he had no idea what the results were from his study.
""We did medically safe and accurate blood samples, but were not told the results. So even if we are asked questions, we won't be able to answer,"" he said. ""We were paid, it ended there.""
But in a statement signed last year and submitted by Philip Morris to the FDA, Endo said he had read the clinical study report from the company and confirmed ""that to the best of my knowledge it accurately describes the conduct and results of the study."" Principal investigators in all of the Philip Morris clinical trials signed the same statement.
A day after speaking with Reuters, Endo sent an email clarifying that after checking his records he saw that he'd signed a receipt saying he received a report on the results and acknowledging that he'd be listed as the principal investigator. He had spoken during the interview ""with a fuzzy memory,"" Endo said.
'LESSER OF TWO EVILS'
Clinical trial experts interviewed by Reuters said it's not uncommon for principal investigators to be unaware of test results sent to a third party specialty laboratory for analysis. But they also emphasized that if companies want better science, they need the investigators to be more involved with all aspects of a study.
""It seems like the investigator here is in the role of a technician, not as a principal investigator,"" said Kessler, the former FDA commissioner.
Kessler said it's hard to understand how such investigators could have signed off on the clinical study report ""when they clearly were not versed in the study results.""
Other principal investigators described their work differently.
Fumimasa Nobuoka, a principal investigator on one of the trials in Japan, said he read the Philip Morris study report: ""I thought it was well done, well written.""
James Borders, who was the principal investigator for a study held in Lexington, Kentucky, said the experiments in his trial were done ethically and followed sound scientific practice.
Borders, who became chief medical officer at the Baptist Health Lexington hospital, said such studies help consumers make an informed decision. His decision to be involved with the study, he said, hinged on the proposition that a device like iQOS could be the ""lesser of two evils.""
Philip Morris said that while it sponsored the clinical trials, the experiments were ""performed by reputable research facilities"" and monitored by contract research organizations – companies used to oversee such studies. It hired U.S.-based Covance Inc to serve as its global contract research organization, according to an internal Philip Morris 2013 assessment plan. Covance, a unit of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (N:LH), declined to comment.
CMIC, the company hired to monitor the Japan studies, said in a statement: ""All the clinical trials you referred to were conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines"" – good clinical practices – ""and we believe that the results of the trials are scientifically trustworthy.""
As part of her job coordinating between Philip Morris and those contracted to run its clinical trials, Koval, the former company scientist, conducted medical safety training across the world for principal investigators and others involved with the iQOS studies.
During one study training session in Tokyo, Koval said, she realized some of the researchers could not speak English well and she was unable to communicate with them. Koval said she does not speak Japanese and there was no interpreter present.
""I was like, Jesus, what are we doing here?"" she said. At dinner later, Koval said, she saw two of the men, and they were unable to describe in English what their jobs were.
When asked about Koval's session, Philip Morris said it was a meeting with its contract research organization and others. It added that ""all PIs and team members with active roles in the study were fluent in English.""
But Sugimoto, one of the Japanese principal investigators, told Reuters in an interview, ""I can't speak English.""
And Endo, another of the lead researchers, said that when Philip Morris executives visited his site someone was present who helped translate ""questions like whether to cut the crusts off bread"" when giving food to study subjects.
CMIC said, ""All the principal investigators received adequate training in Japanese before the trial began.""
URINE SAMPLES
In Poland, some urine samples collected as part of one Philip Morris clinical study exceeded the limits of what a human being is capable of producing in a single day, according to Koval and Lad, the former clinical data manager.
Lad, who worked at Philip Morris from 2012 to 2015, said he didn't think anything ""malicious"" had happened. Maybe urine samples were swapped or there was a mistake with the containers used to collect the urine, he said.
But when the principal investigator for the Polish site was asked about the results, she would not admit there was a problem, Lad and Koval said. Instead, they said, the scientist explained that the test subjects were large Polish men.
Philip Morris said that ""a few participants"" in an early stage of the trial ""produced unusually large volumes of urine."" Because medical tests showed no problems with the subjects, the company said, the investigator did not initially consider the samples to be ""adverse events.""
After discussion with the medical monitors of the study as well as Philip Morris, the investigator ""ultimately decided to mark these incidences as adverse events,"" the company said. An investigation at the site confirmed that researchers had followed study protocol and good clinical practices, the company said.
The principal investigator running the study in Poland for Philip Morris, Katarzyna Jarus-Dziedzic, declined to discuss what happened with the urine case at her site, citing confidentiality. 
Koval said that after she raised concerns about the Polish study with Philip Morris executives in Switzerland she was excluded from meetings.
Philip Morris said in a statement that Koval was ""part of the team"" that followed up on the urine samples. In fact, the company said, she was ""an active member"" of the group that finalized the data set from the studies for further analysis.
Koval confirmed that she was part of the team and involved with the data set. But she stood by her account that she was shut out of conversations and meetings about the urine samples.
In 2014, Philip Morris terminated her contract, Koval said. She said she returned to the pharmaceutical industry a few months later and now works for Swiss drugs giant  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN).
After leaving Philip Morris, Koval was given a certificate of service that said, ""Tamara drove clinical program development activities."" It said she had demonstrated ""professionalism"" and ""unwavering commitment"" in her work.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Subaru Corp (T:7270), already smarting from a vehicle inspection scandal at home, said it was now investigating whether mileage readings may have also been falsified during final checks, driving its shares down as much as 8 percent.
Mileage readings, an indicator of fuel efficiency, do not fall under safety requirements. However, any proof of what would be a second instance of misconduct in as many months would taint the image of not only Subaru but also Japan's manufacturing industry that has been rocked by a slew of scandals recently. 
Just last year, Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) saw around 40 percent of its market value, or $3.2 billion, wiped out in three days after it admitted it had overstated the fuel economy of its minivehicles.
Subaru on Wednesday said it was checking to see if any possible fabrication could have impacted its official mileage readings and if any exported models may have been affected.
""At the moment we are trying to confirm whether data was indeed fabricated, and if so, how this happened and which models are affected,"" Subaru spokeswoman Miyuki Yasuda said.
She added that any evidence of falsified mileage figures, which show the number of kilometers a vehicle can travel on a liter of petrol, was unlikely to result in a recall as it would not constitute a violation of safety requirements.
The mileage probe follows Subaru's revelation in October that uncertified staff had been for decades carrying out final checks on new cars sold in the domestic market. The company this week vowed to improve oversight, but it did not mention any probe into mileage readings at the time.
Subaru said reports of falsified mileage readings emerged as external investigators looked into the inspection scandal.
Some inspectors told investigators that mileage data had been altered on some sample vehicle models tested during final checks. Subaru said it had not confirmed that any such fabrications had taken place. 
""Coming on the heels of the certified inspection issue, this could be a sign of a bigger problem of how Subaru manages its manufacturing operations,"" said Janet Lewis, head of Asia transportation research at Macquarie Securities.
Subaru shares fell as much as 8.5 percent to their lowest since July 2016, before ending down 7 percent. The stock has given up almost 10 percent over the past two months amid the inspection scandal.
A series of compliance failings by Japanese companies have surfaced in recent months, hitting the country's reputation for quality control and prompting calls for better governance.
Nissan Motor (T:7201) has admitted to incorrect final inspection procedures. In just the latter half of the year, Kobe Steel (T:5406), Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) and Torbay Industries (T:3402) - all key suppliers of products to global manufacturers - have admitted to product data fabrication.

Fretting about the impact of the string of scandals, nearly half of Japanese firms have either taken steps to strengthen internal controls or are planning to do so, a Reuters poll showed earlier this month.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 05:37AM ET</span>","Land ownership riddles in ageing Japan come at a cost, stifle economy","By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - When Sparx Green Energy & Technology, a renewable energy firm, found an ideal plot of land on which to build a solar panel factory in Japan, there was a catch. The three people on public record as the owners of the land had died years ago.
What followed was a protracted search for the dead owners' descendents to find the legal heirs of the land, about the size of a football field. The company found that the number of people who could lay claim to the plot had mushroomed to more than a hundred.
At that point, the unit of Sparx Group, changed plans and looked for land elsewhere to avoid having to conduct separate, potentially expensive and time consuming, negotiations with so many people.
Registration of land ownership is not compulsory in Japan but the lack of up-to-date ownership records is an increasing problem. More than a tenth of the country's land mass, or an area the size of Holland, has no up to date record of ownership.
A research group at the National Land Planning Association estimates the problem will cost the economy 6 trillion yen ($53 billion) by 2040 based on the cost of maintaining abandoned land and the value the land could bring if it was put to productive use.
The government is responding. Earlier this month it said it plans to introduce legislation next year to make it easier for public works to be carried out on vacant land when it is difficult to determine ownership.
Such land plots were a major obstacle for reconstruction efforts after the 2011 tsunami and experts warn it could stifle any recovery efforts should Japan suffer another major natural disaster in the future.
""I believe we can inherit land in a real sense only by using it. If you can't tell who owns where in a country with limited land, it's as if you were abandoning the country's precious assets,"" said Takahide Taniwaki, president of Sparx Green Energy.
Many land owners do not bother to register because it is not mandatory.
Shoko Yoshihara, research fellow at the Tokyo Foundation who has written a book about the issue, said under current regulations there is no disadvantage for owners if they do not register their interest, while at the same time, there is a cost. Registration comes with at least a 0.4 percent tax on the value of the land, plus any legal or notary fees.
DEMOGRAPHIC TIPPING POINT
Until recently, the lack of accurate records of land ownership had attracted scant public attention.
But legal notaries, private sector researchers and local government officials say the problem of tracking down owners is only going to get more difficult as the baby boom generation die, often leaving several siblings and children.
Mass migration into big cities by the baby boom generation and their children during Japan's rapid industrialization, will also complicate efforts to track down descendents.
A pensioner in his sixties, who identifies himself as Y.K., said he came to learn recently from a note left by his aunt when she died that his parents owned land in a forest in Kyushu, Western Japan, about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) away from his current home.
Although he initially wanted to report his inheritance he decided not to, he said, because doing so came at a cost and no benefit.
""I went there to check the land but the place seemed useless. It was even hard to tell exactly where it is because there was no picket or anything that shows the border. I asked a local real estate agent whether they wanted it but they said they didn't want it either,"" he said.
""I don't need it. I just wish the local government would take it,"" he said.
And while the issue has been seen as mostly confined to rural areas with low economic value, there are cases that are too late to untangle even in big cities.
A houseowner in the Tokyo suburb of Fuchu decided not to try to register as the owner of the house he lives in after he found that the registered owner was his great grandfather, who was born in the middle of the 19th century. That meant that now there were about 50 descendents who could claim ownership, said a legal notary, who requested anonymity to protect the confidentiality of his clients.
""If you are talking about 10 to 15 people having ownership, you can cope. But if you have 50 people having a claim, it's just impossible to get agreement from all of them,"" he said.

""Even though they are relatives on paper, they don't know each other. And I suspect most of them don't even know they have a piece of ownership,"" he said.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares inched lower on Wednesday following a drop in the previous session when a sell-off on the bond market weighed and support from a landmark tax reform in the U.S. faded. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark fell 0.1 percent by 0933 GMT. Germany's top share DAX (GDAXI) index and the UK's FTSE (FTSE) also fell by the same amount.
The Republican-led U.S. Senate approved the sweeping $1.5-trillion tax bill in the small hours of Wednesday, moving their party and President Donald Trump a step closer to the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years.
""In the short term the U.S. tax reform is already priced in. What remains to be seen is whether U.S. companies will follow up with share buy backs or investments,"" said Andrea Scauri, fund manager at Italy's Ifigest. 
He said the European equity market was penalized by a strong euro, adding that any further increase in the bloc's currency could lead to a downwards revision of earnings estimates, especially for the export oriented DAX index.
""This is the big risk I see for 2018,"" he said.
The STOXX 600 has risen more than 8 percent so far this year, while the euro zone STOXX index is up 11 percent. 
Both indexes are below the peaks they hit at the start of last month as resurfacing political worries and a slowdown in earning growth has sparked some profit taking.
Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) was the biggest loser on the STOXX on Wednesday, down 31 percent as the scandal-hit South African furniture retailer started losing credit lines from lenders. 
Steinhoff said it was still unable to determine the scale of accounting irregularities which have wiped more than $10 billion off its market value over the past two weeks. 
 British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) was the biggest weight, down 0.8 percent following gains in the previous session. 
Some analysts say BAT should benefit from the U.S. tax reform as the UK-listed tobacco company makes more than 40 percent of its profits in the States.
UK drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP) inched up 0.3 percent following a 3.8 percent surge in the previous session which traders attributed to vague takeover rumors. 
""Shire is arguably an attractive target for ""Big Pharma"" given the company’s dominant franchises and strong cash flow generation,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.
""US tax reform legislation could drive an M&A reacceleration in the broader healthcare arena. And, this dynamic could potentially result in another bid for Shire,"" they added. 
The top gainer was Stada (DE:STAGn), up 8.9 percent, after the German pharmaceutical company agreed a new profit transfer deal with its new majority investor, Nidda Healthcare.
Weaker financials also weighed on the broader market with bank heavyweights  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN)  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) all trading down, between 0.6 and 1.1 percent.
Dufry (S:DUFN) rose 3.5 percent, after activist investor Elliot took a 6 percent stake in the company.

RWE (DE:RWEG) rose 0.6 percent, after the CEO of its Innogy (DE:IGY) unit resigned just days after a profit warning that hit shares in both companies. Innogy gained 1 percent.

New EU securities rules, known as MiFID II, come into force on January 3 and require everyone involved in a transaction to have a ""legal entity identifier"" or LEI in order to report the trades to regulators.
Many customers of banks have yet to obtain one, which would make it impossible to execute a trade.
The European Securities and Markets Authority said on Wednesday that banks could apply for an LEI on behalf of customers. Trading venues could also use their own LEI codes for non-EU issuers that currently don't have one.
MiFID II has already been postponed by a year but many smaller market participants have still found it too complex to comply in time.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 03:12AM ET</span>",Japan's Kansai Electric used possibly falsified Mitsubishi Materials products at reactors,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co (T:9503) said on Wednesday it has used parts in important safety equipment at two of its nuclear plants that were supplied by a unit of Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) with possibly falsified data.
The utility has found it is using rubber seals from Mitsubishi Cable Industries with possible falsified specifications in dozens of locations at its Takahama and Ohi nuclear plants, a spokesman said, confirming Japanese media reports.
The discovery comes after Kansai Electric delayed the restart of one of the nuclear power stations because it needs to make checks on parts supplied by Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), which, like Mitsubishi Materials, is embroiled in a scandal over product specifications. 
The utility has told Japan's nuclear regulator that it has not found any immediate safety issues, the spokesman said.
Kansai Electric receives rubber seals from multiple suppliers and is having difficulties identifying which ones come from Mitsubishi Materials, he said. The company does not plan to switch suppliers, the spokesman said. 
Rubber seals are used in large numbers in the extensive piping found in nuclear reactors and their cooling systems and can be subject to high temperatures and pressure. 
Mitubishi Materials and Mitsubishi Cable both declined to comment on Wednesday.
Mitsubishi Materials previously said it had discovered that products with falsified specifications had been sent to more than 300 of its customers.
That was the latest in a slew of scandals to rock Japan's manufacturing industry. Apart from Kobe Steel, similar lapses on specifications have been found at Toray Industries Inc (T:3402) and incorrect final inspection procedures were discovered by automakers Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Subaru Corp (T:7270). 
Kansai Electric's delays and checks on Ohi reactors are further hitches to the protracted reboot of Japan's nuclear sector, shut down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011.
Kansai Electric does not plan to close down the Takahama station for checks, or expect any additional delays on the restart of Ohi, the spokesman said.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 01:01AM ET</span>",Exclusive: KPMG partners face court contempt over China audit,"By Matthew Miller
BEIJING (Reuters) - Several current and former KPMG partners are facing contempt proceedings in a Hong Kong court, as liquidators for a failed U.S.-listed Chinese company step up their action against the auditor over its refusal to produce Chinese working papers.
The contempt summons, seen by Reuters, names 91 individuals and was issued on Nov. 22. It is the latest move in a battle surrounding the 2012 collapse of China Medical Technologies, whose founders are being prosecuted in the United States for allegedly defrauding investors out of more than $400 million.
The writ highlights a long-running tussle between China, which is reluctant to hand over mainland documents, and overseas regulators that demand such papers - leaving auditors trapped between upsetting Beijing or facing offshore penalties when dealing with foreign-listed Chinese firms.
KPMG was ordered by Hong Kong's High Court in 2016 to give audit papers, correspondence and records on China Medical to Borrelli Walsh, liquidators for the one-time NASDAQ-listed firm. 
But KPMG has refused to do so without written direction of the relevant Chinese authority, arguing that its mainland-based affiliate KPMG Huazhen, which carried out the China Medical audit field work, would be in violation of national security laws if the materials held state secrets or sensitive information, court documents and the writ show.
KPMG and Borrelli Walsh both declined to comment.
Those named in the writ were partners in KPMG China - the partnership covering China, Hong Kong and Macau - in 2015, which is when the court dispute over the audit papers began.
Petitions to wind up China Medical were filed in the Cayman Islands, New York and finally in Hong Kong in 2012, and the company was placed into liquidation.
The liquidators are asking each of the 91 defendants be held in contempt of court, which could result in criminal penalties, or impose weekly fines for failure to comply with the High Court order.
China Medical is the most high-profile international contest over Chinese audit papers since 2014, when EY, KPMG's fellow Big Four accounting firm, handed over certain documents to Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission after a court battle.
EY had argued that Chinese officials would not let it produce documents related to its work on an unfinished audit of Standard Water Ltd - a Chinese municipal water services provider that scrapped plans for an initial public offering in Hong Kong.
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
Hong Kong and U.S. regulators have been at loggerheads with Chinese firms and their auditors over the production of audit work papers since the start of the decade - a battle that at one point threatened to leave U.S.-listed Chinese groups unaudited and in danger of delisting.
While U.S. and Chinese regulators came to a non-binding agreement in 2013 over exchanging documents, mainland officials have objected to inspections and are still in practice often reluctant to let papers leave China. 
""The problem for accounting firms is that they're still between a rock and a hard place,"" said Paul Gillis, professor of practice at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.
""They need to comply with the laws in all of the locations where they are doing business."" 
In July, the U.S. audit regulator revoked the registration of the Hong Kong affiliate of Crowe Horwarth International because it failed to comply with demands to produce documents, including Chinese audit work papers.
Earlier in the year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged China Medical Chairman Wu Xiaodong and CFO Samson Tsang Tak Yung with securities fraud and wire fraud conspiracy, alleging they stole much of the $426 million they raised in two convertible bond offerings in 2008 and 2010. 
KPMG issued written audit reports for China Medical from 2003 to 2008, and was replaced by PwC Zhong Tian in August 2009.

Contempt proceedings will be held at Hong Kong High Court.

David Muino Suarez, a relationship manager of Zurich-based BSI bank, was arrested at Sao Paulo's Guarulhos airport as he got off a flight from Switzerland on Nov. 27 and is being held in Curitiba, the centre of the so-called Car Wash investigation.
The federal prosecutors' office in Curitiba said in a statement that Suarez, who has dual Swiss-Spanish nationality, knew the money came from bribes paid to Cunha and Pedro Bastos, a former executive at state-run oil company Petrobras, from an oil field acquisition in the African nation of Benin in 2011.
They said Suarez concealed the illegal financial operation with false information given to the bank's compliance office.
It was not immediately known how the banker responded to the charges as his representatives could not be reached for comment.
Prosecutor Diogo Castor de Mattos said the almost four-year Car Wash probe had uncovered several cases of managers of international banks who helped Brazilian politicians, financial intermediaries and former Petrobras executives hide illegal money in offshore accounts.

Cunha is the highest profile politician convicted of graft and sentenced to 15 years in jail for his role in the corruption scheme, in which engineering companies paid billions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks from contracts with Petrobras and other state-run companies.

United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) held back some shipments of its troubled Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan jet engines to plane makers, and offered spares to airlines which have had problems with engines already in service.
Korean Air, the first Asian airline to receive the C Series, in August forecast it would receive five CS300 jets this year. In October, President Walter Cho said the estimate had changed to ""hopefully one"".
The first CS300 will be delivered to Korean Air in Canada on Friday and will arrive in Seoul on Dec. 25, with the second due to arrive in Seoul on Jan. 1, a Korean Air spokeswoman said. 
Korean Air in a statement said the two jets will run domestic routes from Jan. 16. The airline expects to receive eight more CS300s by the end of 2018, raising its total to 10.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence among Asian companies rose in October-December to the highest in almost seven years due to robust consumption and global trade, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> , representing the six-month outlook of 94 firms, rose to 78 for the December quarter from 69 three months before. The index reached its highest since January-March 2011.
A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
Improvement in sentiment in Australia, China and South Korea drove gains in the overall index. Sentiment in Indonesia and Thailand was also strong, showing that many countries in Asia continue to benefit from accelerating global growth.
""The index shows that the slow strengthening that we have seen in the world economy has lifted business sentiment in Asia,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.

""Asia is a reflection of what is happening in the world,"" he said.
The index measuring sentiment in Australia rose to a record high of 92 in October-December from 69 in the previous quarter. The country's ruling coalition has recovered from a dual-citizenship crisis that threatened to throw policy-making into turmoil.
Signs of a rebound in consumer spending, Chinese demand for Australian metals, and growing capital expenditure in other sectors has also underpinned sentiment.
China, upon which much of Asia depends for trade, saw its subindex rise to 83 to reach the highest since the third quarter of last year.
The market reforms that Chinese President Xi Jinping laid out at the Communist Party Congress in October has fueled optimism that the world's second-largest economy can manage a surge in house prices and credit growth. 
South Korea's subindex rose to 83 from 50 in the previous quarter to reach the highest since the second quarter of 2011, as international pressure has so far slowed the pace of North Korea's missile tests for its nuclear weapons program.
The subindex for Indonesia slipped to 92 in the fourth quarter from 100 in the previous quarter but remained at a high level. Sentiment in Thailand and India improved, while sentiment in Taiwan fell to the lowest level in more than a year.
ASSET PRICES AND POLITICS
The International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have raised their global growth forecasts for this year due to strong trade, consumer spending, and investment in many major economies.
However, the outlook is not without risk. Respondents to the survey, which was conducted Dec. 1-15, showed companies' biggest concern was a sudden correction in asset prices.
U.S. stocks have repeatedly set record highs this year and stock markets in most other countries have rallied strongly due to expectations for faster growth.
Some analysts have expressed concerns that stock prices may be overheating. Companies from the transportation, healthcare, energy and finance sectors also expressed concern about a correction in asset prices, the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
Industries subject to frequent mergers and acquisitions, such as technology, metals, natural resources and healthcare, identified increased regulatory scrutiny of cross-border transactions as a risk, the survey showed.
Many companies have concerns about protectionism, which can hurt not only exports but also become a barrier to making acquisitions overseas.
Of companies surveyed, nine respondents identified political instability and geopolitical risks as their biggest concerns, because events on one side of the globe, such as Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union, can have consequences elsewhere.
""The impact of 'Brexit' affected British demand for tourism aboard,"" said Supitcha Fooanant, senior investor relations manager at Minor International PCL (BK:MINT), Thailand's leading hotel and restaurant operator.
""We saw a decline in British tourists in our hotel portfolio. Fortunately, our successful diversification strategy enables us to maintain resiliency and consistently achieve robust results.""
On the downside, the sub-index for Taiwan fell to 50 in October-December from 75 in the previous quarter, but the decline may have been exaggerated by a smaller sample size.
The index for Malaysia weakened to 64 from 75 as respondents expressed concern about consumer sentiment. Business sentiment for the Philippines fell to 70 from 83 previously, while in Japan sentiment eased to 70 in October-December from 75 in the previous quarter. In Singapore, the sentiment subindex rose to 79 from 64.

(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (N:FDX) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly net profit due to strong global demand and increased package volumes during the peak holiday shipping season, but its results were hit by lingering effects from a cyber attack on its Dutch unit.
The Memphis-based company, which is often considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, said the June cyber attack on  TNT Express  (PK:TNTEF) cut $100 million from fiscal second-quarter profit.
FedEx raised its projected costs of integrating TNT Express through fiscal 2020 to about $1.4 billion from a previous estimate of $800 million. It acquired the Dutch company last year for $4.8 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said FedEx was ""on track for another record holiday-shipping season,"" referring to late November through the New Year.
Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said FedEx ""clearly exceeded expectations on the earnings front,"" but ""there might be some push-back in regards to the increased integration costs with TNT and the overall flat profitability in its ground (small-package delivery services) segment.""
FedEx and rival  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) have spent billions to upgrade their networks to handle rapidly rising e-commerce package volumes, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas. 
FedEx has been grappling with lower margins on its e-commerce business, as deliveries to individual homes are typically more expensive than deliveries to businesses that often receive several packages at once.
FedEx has also faced increased competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which has expanded into the delivery business. 
FedEx's quarterly net income rose to $775 million, or $2.84 per share, from $700 million, or $2.59 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items, FedEx reported earnings per share of $3.18, beating analysts' expectations of $2.89.
Results also reflect a roughly $80 million tax benefit from foreign tax credits associated with a dividend from overseas operations, and a favorable net impact from fuel, the company said.
FedEx said it expects full-year fiscal 2018 earnings per share in a range of $12.70 to $13.30, excluding items.
Analysts had forecast earnings of $12.45 per share for the full fiscal year. 
Its full-year estimate would be improved by changes the company has said it hopes to see under a sweeping tax overhaul that appeared headed for congressional approval soon.

The bill cuts the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, beginning on Jan. 1. FedEx forecasts an effective 2018 tax rate of about 33 percent, it said.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>","Businesses like investment tax breaks, but will they spend?","By Timothy Aeppel and Chris Sanders
(Reuters) - Jerry Zeitler says a sweeping Republican tax overhaul will encourage him to take a bigger bite next year out of his $3 million wish list of new equipment for the metal-stamping operation he runs outside Cleveland.
Not that much bigger, however.
Die-Matic Corp, which mostly serves the auto industry and has sales of more than $30 million, may spend $600,000, the president of the family-run company said, up from about $450,000 this year. A tax break is nice, but it will not prompt him to rewrite his spending plans entirely. 
Thrift and caution among small businesses, and pressure from investors for big businesses to return any windfalls from a U.S. tax code rewrite directly to shareholders, pose a challenge to President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders.
Their tax plan is designed to kick start economic growth in part by offering new incentives for capital investment, which would allow businesses to lower their tax bills by writing off the cost of things like new machinery more quickly.
U.S. commercial and industrial loan growth has shrunk to almost flat at the end of November from nearly 14 percent at the start of 2015, Federal Reserve data shows. 
And investment growth has likewise slowed to a near standstill. After a nearly 9 percent increase in 2014 and a nearly 10 percent jump in 2015, S&P 500 companies, excluding the capital-intensive energy sector, boosted capital expenditures by just 1 percent in 2016, according to Reuters data.
But surveys of business leaders consistently show that lackluster demand growth, and not access to capital, is what has been holding back investments. 
And many companies face pressure to pass on any tax windfall to shareholders rather than invest in factories or hire workers.
For instance, Cisco System Inc's (O:CSCO) Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said at an investor conference in February that if the company was able to repatriate profit from overseas it would look at strategic investments and returning capital to investors.
The tax bill is partly aimed at prompting big companies to bring back capital parked overseas.
But that aspect of tax reform could become a replay of the 2004 repatriation holiday under President George W. Bush, in which 843 U.S.-based multinationals brought back $362 billion in overseas profits at a deeply slashed tax rate of 5.25 percent. Most of that went to stock buybacks and dividend increases.
“The question is, are business leaders motivated that much by tax?” said BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink recently at the Reuters Global 2018 Investment Outlook Summit in New York. “I think on the margin, yes. But it’s not overwhelming.”
Some big companies have pledged to ramp up investment.
AT&T Corp (N:T) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said if the tax bill is signed into law, the No. 2 U.S. wireless company would boost domestic investment by $1 billion in the first year the new corporate rates are in place. 
""Research tells us that every $1 billion in capital invested in telecom creates about 7,000 good jobs for the middle class,” he said. 
The tax bill also features a provision that allows companies to quickly write off investments in new plants and equipment. 
That could prompt companies to accelerate their investments to lower taxable income, but that would likely be seen mostly at companies where spending can quickly translate into higher production. 
“Being able to expense capital expenditures immediately will pull forward some demand and bring companies over the hurdle of making new investments,” said Stephen DeNichilo, co-portfolio manager of the $870 million Federated Kaufmann Small Cap fund.
“At the end of the day, will someone buy a new dump truck if they don’t need it just because of a tax cut? Absolutely not,"" he said. ""But you will see more outlay for areas where there is an immediate economic payback.” 
That approach would likely benefit automation companies as well as those that make equipment like conveyors and hoists that increase factory floor production, he said. 
Among his holdings, DeNichilio expects that  Milacron Holdings Corp  (N:MCRN), a plastics molding manufacturer with a market value of $1.2 billion that builds machines equipped with artificial intelligence, will benefit the most from a boost in capex spending because its products are used in a range of industries. 
“This kind of investment pays for itself very quickly,” he said. 
But for many smaller companies, the timing for ramping up spending might not be quite right. 
Zeitler, the president of Die-Matic, says he usually splurges on capex during recessions, not expansions. 
“The time to buy is when others are constricting, not spending, because that’s when we can buy things for 20 or 30 percent off,” he says. 
Other companies will retain thrifty habits that have become the norm, especially in slow-growing industrial sectors.
David Shippoli, a manufacturing engineer at Dan T. Moore Co, a privately held company in Cleveland with factories across Ohio and Indiana, seldom buys new equipment and said tax breaks will not change that. 
“Some large companies probably will spend more because they don’t care about spending money,” he said. He still might buy new machines, but only if they are the only option available, “not because of taxes.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators said Tuesday that ""living wills"" submitted by eight large U.S. banks are satisfactory, but half of those plans have ""shortcomings"" that should be addressed in the future.
The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found shortcomings in plans from Bank of America (N:BAC), Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), detailing how they could be safely taken apart should they face bankruptcy.
Regulators found no problems with plans submitted by Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK),  Citigroup  (N:C), J.P. Morgan Chase (N:JPM), or  State Street  (N:STT).
The resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, require large banks to detail for regulators how they could be unwound in cases of bankruptcy with minimal disruption to the financial system. If banks cannot gain regulatory approval for their plans, they could face more severe restrictions or even be ordered to divest. 
Tuesday's results serve as a relatively clean bill of health for the nation's largest and most complex institutions. It marks the first time since 2014 that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found significant issues with those plans that merit immediate action by banks. 
The regulators said the 2017 results show ""significant progress"" had been made in the banking sector in recent years.
Of the banks facing shortcomings in their plans, there was no unifying concern. For example, regulators said Goldman needed to address an issue related to the bank's ""separability analysis related to the actionability of divestiture options,"" while Bank of America was told it should take a second look at its derivatives portfolio.
Regulators said four areas where all banks need to refine their focus in the years ahead include: intra-group liquidity, internal loss-absorbing capacity, derivatives, and payment, clearing and settlement activities.
Large banks have been required to submit plans detailing how they could be safely taken apart in a time of crisis since 2012, after the requirement was included in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.
In September, regulators announced they would be giving banks more time to submit their living wills, as part of a broader effort to ease post-crisis rules. The banks are not required to submit new plans until July 1, 2019.
Banks had argued the annual cycle for submitting living wills - which can comprise thousands of pages - was too onerous. 
In a June report, the U.S. Treasury recommended extending the cycle to two years, revising the threshold for banks that must submit living wills, and increasing the transparency of guidance regulators feedback on to banks on the plans.

(Reuters) - A U.S. administrative court on Tuesday asserted its right to review the validity of patents owned by the University of Minnesota, rejecting the public university's argument that its ""sovereign"" status grants it immunity.
The ruling by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board is a setback to efforts by pharmaceutical and technology companies to shield patents from the court by transferring them to entities like state universities and Native American tribes. 
As government entities, they can assert sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that holds they cannot be subject to litigation without their consent.
In a January ruling in a different case, PTAB said it recognized the defense of sovereign immunity.
But the board said on Tuesday the University of Minnesota had waived its immunity by filing lawsuits in federal court in 2014 accusing telecom equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and several other companies of infringing the same patents.
Ericsson challenged the validity of the University of Minnesota's patents before PTAB, and the case was put on hold pending a decision by the board.
Neither Ericsson nor the University of Minnesota immediately responded to requests for comment.
Many of the patents the board reviews are also being litigated in federal court, so the ruling cuts back sovereign immunity as a viable defense before the tribunal, said Matthew Rizzolo, a patent lawyer at Ropes & Gray not involved in the case.
The ruling casts doubt on a strategy adopted by the drug company Allergan Plc (N:AGN), which in September transferred patents in its bestselling dry-eye treatment Restasis to the upstate New York Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which licensed them back in exchange for ongoing payments. 
Allergan proceeded to argue PTAB had no jurisdiction over the Restasis patents, which had been challenged there by generic manufacturers. 
Lawmakers criticized the deal as a sham designed to allow Allergan to maintain a drug monopoly. U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, has introduced legislation aimed at preventing tribes from asserting sovereign immunity in cases before the patent board.
At the time it announced its patent transfer, Allergan noted it remained willing to have its patents subject to review in federal court. A federal judge subsequently found its Restasis patents invalid, rendering its deal with the Mohawk tribe largely moot.
Other patent owners have adopted similar deals with tribes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as excitement over the likelihood of a tax code revamp was offset by concern over its effect on years of monetary policy stimulus and the future of interest rates.
The U.S. House of Representatives initially passed the tax legislation in an afternoon vote, but the bill included provisions that did not comply with Senate rules. The Senate was expected to vote this evening on a revised version of the bill, with the offending provisions removed. If the Senate approves the bill, as is expected, the House will vote again on Wednesday. 
Stocks added to losses after the vote, which followed weeks of market gains on optimism that tax cuts would boost U.S. earnings and the economy. Some investors also said that much of those benefits were already reflected in stock prices.
The S&P 500 has climbed about 5 percent since mid-November when the House passed its tax overhaul bill.
""The tax rate we’ve certainly priced in (in stocks),"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Investors may also be ""celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away.”
The bill, among other things, proposes lowering corporate tax rates to 21 percent from 35 percent, which investors are betting will boost profits as well as trigger share buybacks and higher dividend payouts.
The S&P 500 technology sector (SPLRCT) fell 0.5 percent, with tech stocks weighing the most on the major indexes. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 37.45 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,754.75, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 8.69 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,681.47 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 30.91 points, or 0.44 percent, to 6,963.85.
Earlier in the day, stocks were pushed lower as Treasury yields rose on strong housing data. Domestic home construction hit a 13-month high in November.
Apple (O:AAPL) fell 1.1 percent after broker Instinet downgraded the stock to ""neutral,"" saying the supply-demand balance for the iPhone X suggested little space to raise sales estimates for the next quarter.
The consumer staples index's (SPLRCS) 0.2 percent rise led gainers.
Altria (N:MO) rose 1.7 percent after Berenberg upgraded the stock saying a lower tax rate would boost the tobacco company's profit and shareholder payouts.
Wal-Mart (N:WMT) rose 0.9 percent after  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) upgraded the stock to ""buy"" on expectations that the retailer's shares will rise further in 2018.
Zimmer Biomet (N:ZBH) jumped 6.1 percent, the S&P's biggest gainer, after the company appointed a full-time chief executive.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.82-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.6 billion shares, below the 6.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 05:54PM ET</span>",U.S. tax cut to deliver corporate earnings gift,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The massive Republican tax overhaul working its way to President Donald Trump's desk is making bulls on Wall Street a little more bullish. 
Wall Street strategists are revising their 2018 earnings forecasts sharply higher because of the tax cuts, though the jury is out on whether that positive effect will endure much beyond next year. 
The tax bill will cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent beginning Jan. 1 and is expected to be the single biggest positive factor for earnings in 2018.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the tax package on Tuesday afternoon, but the move hit a last-minute snag, requiring another vote on Wednesday. A Senate vote was still awaited.
Although there is a wide range of profit estimates for 2018, the expected tax plan benefit has strategists now calling for double-digit profit gains in 2018 over 2017, compared with their forecasts for mid-single-digit gains without the tax cuts. 
""This is going to drive the earnings numbers. (Tax) is going to overwhelm everything,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub, who was waiting for the bill's passage to adjust his own earnings estimates.
With the U.S. and world economies expanding, consumer demand strong and interest rates low, corporate profits were expected to be healthy next year. The tax law will give them an added jolt of adrenaline. 
Many strategists estimate the cut in corporate tax could deliver an extra boost to earnings next year of between about 7 percent to more than 10 percent. Some of the forecasts were based on a previous version of the legislation calling for a tax cut to 20 percent.
In one of the most recent projections, UBS on Friday said it saw a potential 9.1-percent boost to S&P earnings per share because of the tax plan. 
It is unclear how great the lasting positive impact will be.
""The retention of this benefit is unclear,"" said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, who forecasts the plan could add $19, or about 14 percent, to S&P 500 earnings including potential paybacks from repatriation. 
But the net recurring benefit is likely to be closer to $11, or 8 percent, she said. Subramanian, in a presentation earlier this month, said companies may look to use the benefit for short-term lifts. For example, retailers, which have been suffering from competition from Amazon (O:AMZN), may want to pass the benefit on with bigger sales and more promotions.
""You have to wonder how much of that benefit you're going to really see float to the bottom line on a longer-term basis,"" Subramanian said.
The boost to profits goes a long way to justify some of the rapid rise in stock valuations since Donald Trump's election as president a year ago. Stronger earnings mean less stretched price-to-earnings ratios. Investors are paying about $18.45 for every $1 in expected earnings over the next 12 months, the most since 2002.
""Earnings may go up, but a lot of the benefit is already in the market,"" Golub said. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained about 5 percent since mid-November when the House passed its tax overhaul bill and is up about 20 percent year-to-date. Stocks drifted lower following the House vote Tuesday.
Golub and others said after the initial boost to forecasts, the profit numbers could still drift higher in the months ahead as companies adjust their plans.
""We'll get a big jump in '18, but the ripple effect of the tax bill could be the big surprise in the second half of '18,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
""The tax cuts... will give companies a lot more flexibility to do dividend increases, buybacks and hiring, and that's what's difficult to get a handle on,"" Hellwig said. 

Companies already are beginning to cite the tax cuts in forecasts. After the bell on Tuesday, FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said if the tax package becomes law, its earnings per share for fiscal 2018 could increase.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 05:40PM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler in talks over potential diesel emissions settlement,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Lawyers for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and owners of the automaker's diesel-powered vehicles are in settlement talks over allegations of excess diesel emissions, a court-appointed adviser said Tuesday.
In May, the U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler, accusing the company of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in nearly 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014. Numerous suits have been filed by vehicle owners.
Court settlement master Ken Feinberg said at a court hearing in San Francisco Tuesday that ""term sheets"" or proposed settlement documents have been exchanged between Fiat Chrysler and diesel owner lawyers.
Feinberg said the proposals were briefly discussed at a meeting Tuesday with the parties, along with the Justice Department, California Air Resources Board and German auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL], which develops diesel vehicle systems, and has also been sued by diesel owners.
Feinberg said it was ""a very healthy discussion on how we might get to yes."" He added he would hold a day of settlement talks in Washington between the Justice Department and Fiat Chrysler in January, along with another day of talks between the automaker, Bosch and diesel owners.
There are parallel talks between the Justice Department and Fiat Chrysler and the company and diesel owners aimed at reaching settlements.
""We're looking for different substantive ways to secure an early comprehensive settlement,"" Feinberg said, adding a settlement could occur before testing on vehicles is completed in March. ""Everybody in good faith is certainly trying to figure out how we might achieve a comprehensive settlement.""
In July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 diesel vehicles after it came under scrutiny for alleged excess emissions in older diesel models.
Fiat Chrysler lawyer Robert Giuffra said in court the company remains confident it can use updated emissions software in the 2017 vehicles as the basis of a fix to address agencies’ concerns over 2014-2016 diesel vehicles.
Justice Department lawyer Leigh Rende declined to comment in court on the settlement talks.
She said company testing on the proposed fix began on Dec. 17 and would take about three months. The government will then have 30 days to review the results and expects to make a determination by the end of April.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving.
The company has denied wrongdoing, saying there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules.

Fiat Chrysler’s emissions case came after Volkswagen AG’s (DE:VOWG_p) diesel emissions scandal prompted increased industry scrutiny.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets edged lower on Tuesday, while U.S. Treasury yields rose, as Republican legislation with steep cuts to corporate taxes cleared the House of Representatives and headed towards a final vote in the Senate.
U.S. stocks hit successive highs ahead of the tax overhaul bill, but modest selling has crept into the market as most traders see the positive impact of the bill as already priced in.
""I really think it might be: buy the rumor, sell the news,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist with the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ""Wall Street has had long enough to vet this thing.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.45 points, or 0.15 percent, to end at 24,754.75, the S&P 500 lost 8.69 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,681.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.91 points, or 0.44 percent, to 6,963.85.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.51 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.30 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved the tax bill by a vote of 227-203. A Senate decision could come Tuesday night on what would be the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years. However, the U.S. Senate parliamentarian has ruled against three provision of the Republican tax bill, forcing the House of Representatives to hold a second vote on the legislation, Senator Bernie Sanders said.
President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law by the end of the week if it is passed by the Senate.
The plan includes slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, which analysts say would likely increase profits, buybacks and dividend payouts.
A slump in technology stocks, led by Apple Inc, also helped drag markets down in afternoon trading. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 1 percent after broker Instinet downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" on doubts about iPhone X sales.
U.S. Treasury yields rose with the benchmark yield hitting a seven-week high as the tax bill pushed forward.
Before the House vote, bonds were selling in reaction to data that showed U.S. domestic home construction rose to a 13-month peak in November, with single-family home construction hitting a 10-year high.
Now, bond investors could be pulling back on expectations of economic growth, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""Some may be concerned the boost on the fiscal side can be offset by monetary tightening,"" Ablin said.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last down 20/32 in price to yield 2.4644 percent, from 2.392 percent late Monday.
The 30-year bond was down 1-17/32 in price to yield 2.206 percent, from 2.744 percent.
The U.S. dollar, which slipped on tax plan doubts on Monday, began to flatten on the unexpectedly strong housing data. 
In late trading, the dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 112.92 yen. It was little changed against the Swiss franc, but higher versus sterling as well as the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars.
The dollar index, which fell 0.26 percent, was weaker against the euro, which was up 0.5 percent to $1.1840.
Gold, which dipped as U.S. Treasury yields rose, is on track to post its narrowest trading range of any quarter in a decade in the last three months of the year.
Spot gold added 0.1 percent to $1,262.07 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.02 percent to $1,265.20.
Oil rose slightly, aided by an ongoing North Sea pipeline outage, supply cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories had fallen for a fifth week.

Brent crude was up 42 cents or 0.66 percent to $63.83 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 47 cents or 0.8 percent to $57.69.

Bitcoin To Rebound? 
Sell-offs in bitcoin have been few and far between but the popular digital currency appeared to losing its popularity on Tuesday, falling more than 10% amid signs of fading investor hopes that the launch of futures contracts would spur institutional demand.
Bitcoin futures debuted on CME, the world's biggest exchange operator, on Sunday but investor uptake was tepid.
Some participants noted, however, that year-end profit taking could be adding to downside pressure as investors attempted to lock in gains on the impressive rally which has seen bitcoin rise more than 1900% since the start of the year.
On the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange, bitcoin fell to $17,600, down $1405.0, or 7.48%, well below its recent all-time high of $19,891.
U.S. crude oil stockpiles to fall for fifth-straight week?
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the fifth-straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 3.78m barrels in the week ended Dec. 16.
Crude oil futures have made a mixed start to the week, reversing Monday’s losses to settle at $57.36 amid the prospect of fresh supply disruptions in the Middle East following escalating geopolitical tensions in the region.
European Macro Data 
With much of central bank and top-tier economic data out of the way, investors turn attention to German wholesale inflation data measured by the production price index and Eurozone current account data slated for Tuesday.
Economist forecast the German producer price index to show a 0.2% rise in November, a touch lower than the 0.3% rise in the previous month.
The Eurozone current account is expected to have narrowed to €33.4 billion in November from €37.8 billion in October.
EUR/USD rose 0.48% to $1.1839 on Tuesday."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower at 24,754.75. The S&P 500 closed 0.36% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite closed at 6963.85, down 0.44%.
House members voted 227 to 203 to pass the tax bill on Tuesday, while a similar outcome is expected from the Senate ahead of its vote after Senators Mike Lee and Susan Collins signaled their support for the bill.
That did little to spark a rebound in US equities as some market participants noted that markets had priced in the prospect of lower taxes, while others remained optimistic that markets will enjoy further tax-related gains.
“Many investors point to the rally in US equities since August as evidence that a tax cut is already priced in,"" said Keith Parker, a strategist at UBS, but noted that “past instances in which a tax cut was passed highlight the potential for further gains once the bill gets signed.""
On the economic data front, investors cheered upbeat housing data supporting the narrative of a strengthening US economy as single-family homebuilding in November rose to its highest since September 2007.

Terium's sudden departure comes less than a week after Innogy trimmed its operating profit forecast for 2017, citing a persistently difficult market environment for npower, its ailing British electricity and gas supplies business.
It also predicted a fall in profits in 2018, mainly due to increased spending on energy supply networks, broadband telecoms and renewable power generation. Since then, its shares have fallen 17 percent while those of RWE are down 18 percent.
""The Supervisory Board generally welcomes the corporate and finance strategy pursued by the Board, but sees the necessity for greater emphasis on cost discipline and a more focused growth and investment strategy,"" Innogy said in a statement.
According to last week's announcement capital expenditure was expected to rise by more than a quarter to more than 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) next year.
Innogy said that Terium's departure was the result of a ""friendly agreement"" with the supervisory board. His employment contract was due to have run until the end of March 2021.
Innogy was carved out from RWE and listed in 2016 in an attempt to separate its networks, renewables and retail businesses from RWE's thermal power plant and energy trading activities. RWE retains a 76.8 percent stake in Innogy.

Terium, who had served as RWE's CEO before taking the same job at Innogy in 2016, will be replaced in the interim by Uwe Tigges, chief human resources officer, until the supervisory board decides on a successor, Innogy said.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 02:50PM ET</span>","As stores close, Canada's mall owners turn prime land into condos","By Nichola Saminather
caTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian mall owners are adding condos and apartments to their shopping centers, seeking to capitalize on a supply-constrained housing market while reducing exposure to a struggling retail sector.
Developers such as RioCan REIT (TO:REI_u), Canada's largest property trust, and the property units of some Canadian pension funds are turning prime land that has historically not been put to best use - such as parking lots or low-rise retail - into housing in one of the world's most expensive, supply-constrained residential markets.
In the greater Toronto area, there were 12,500 new homes available to purchase in October, less than half the average between October 2000 and 2015, according to Altus Group. 
The rental market is just as tight. Toronto has a 1 percent rental vacancy rate, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. That was despite the highest level of rental construction in 25 years in the third quarter, according to Urbanation Inc.
Home prices have surged more than 60 percent in Vancouver and 40 percent in Toronto in the last three years. Even pullbacks in these markets this year following policies to dampen price gains appear to be reversing on continued demand and limited supply. 
""The population is growing and there's no real land left"" in Canada's biggest cities, said RioCan Chief Executive Ed Sonshine. ""Demand for retail space isn't growing... it makes perfect sense on so many levels.""
In Toronto, RioCan is creating ePlace, a development with about a fifth of the retail space of some of its other malls, 1,100 condominiums and apartments, and some offices. 
The 466 rental apartments will add the first of 10,000 residential units the shopping center developer plans to own by 2025 across 50 properties.
Buyers are responding. All the condos at ePlace, expected to be completed by early 2019, have already been sold. 
Even owners of thriving malls are joining in.
Yorkdale Shopping Center in Toronto is Canada's most productive mall, with C$1,653 ($1,285) of sales per square foot for the year ended June 30, according to a Retail Council of Canada study.
But owner Oxford Properties, the real estate unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, is seeking to add as many as 1,496 residential units, offices and hotel space under a planned revamp.
Oxford is betting that better public transit and technological changes such as autonomous vehicles will reduce demand for parking, said Bradley Jones, head of retail at Oxford.
MORE MALL VACANCIES
Rising retail vacancies, exacerbated by the demise of Sears Canada and Target Corp's Canadian operations over the past few years, ""have caused even more people to start thinking that there are alternate uses for part of their sites,"" said Matthew Smith, head of national retail investment at Jones Lang LaSalle.
And, if a concentration of retailers around transport nodes is weighing on businesses despite their location, changing some to residential could reduce that burden, Smith said.
It's not simply about plopping a few apartments on or adjacent to existing malls, however. Owners like Cadillac Fairview (CF), a unit of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, have concluded that the traditional mall, anchored by department stores with chain stores and fast-food restaurants in between, may no longer be as profitable.
CF plans to spend about C$2 billion to add residential units at four of its malls, in addition to one under construction in Toronto, said Finley McEwen, its senior vice president for development.
Many of the redevelopments include ""turning the malls inside out,"" putting specialty stores, sit-down restaurants and other non-traditional mall occupants facing outward, which, combined with the residential units, create a space that's more alive, McEwen said. 
""Mixing uses creates a vibrancy after hours, they create safer streets ... And they become naturally more attractive,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A push by activist hedge fund TCI to oust the chairman of the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) was heavily defeated on Tuesday, but that may not bring an end to the row.
LSE shareholders voted by 79.07 to 20.93 percent at an extraordinary general meeting, defeating a resolution that aimed to ditch Donald Brydon over the way he handled the departure of former chief executive Xavier Rolet in November.
TCI, which has a 5 percent stake in the exchange, was founded by Christopher Hohn, who called for the vote after accusing the board of forcing Rolet out.
A source close to TCI said the firm would keep up efforts to ditch Brydon, saying 20 percent backing for its resolution showed significant support among shareholders.
""Many of the large shareholders who voted against the resolution have informed us that they had asked the board to commence work on the chairman's succession plan immediately,"" Hohn said in a letter to the LSE after the vote.
The LSE said no large shareholder has expressed such a view.
""Today's vote should now lead to an orderly process of succession of the CEO and then the chair of the LSE as set out by the board,"" said the Financial Conduct Authority, the watchdog overseeing the stock exchange.
The spat has shone a spotlight on the 300-year-old exchange.
""This is a very sorry affair, which has brought considerable opprobrium on the company,"" Aubrey Franklin, a small shareholder for more than 20 years who backed the bid to remove the chairman, said during the meeting.
""This should have been an orderly succession process...however it has ended in a less than satisfactory situation for all concerned,"" said one top-30 shareholder who opposed the resolution but declined to be named, adding that the resolution had been ""an attempt for a symbolic rejection of the whole board"". 
A string of institutional shareholders, such as BlackRock (N:BLK) and  Aviva  (L:AV), had said they would vote against TCI's resolution, making its defeat all but certain.
""It seems to me the old boys' network has got together and the establishment is winning out,"" Franklin said.
Paul Heiden, a senior LSE non-executive director, told the meeting the board unanimously backed Brydon to remain in his post until the annual meeting in 2019, adding that suddenly losing the chairman would destabilize the exchange.
David Warren, interim chief executive, said the exchange was positioned to grow under the strategy put in place by Rolet. ""The group continues to perform well across all main businesses,"" Warren said.
Asked why Rolet quit early rather than stay until the end of 2018 as originally planned, Heiden said the former CEO was asked to step down after relations between him and senior management ""became fairly strained.""
TCI founder Hohn did not attend the shareholder meeting.
Brydon told the meeting that board members reached their decision collectively regarding Rolet's succession. ""United, your board will proceed to complete the identification and recruitment of the next chief executive,"" he said.
Brydon has already interviewed six candidates, with another six in the pipeline, a source close to the exchange said.
Rolet is widely credited with turning a lackluster company into a larger and more diversified firm, but the Frenchman's attempt to merge with the German exchange Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) collapsed in the face of regulatory opposition.
Britain's planned departure from the European Union in 2019 raises questions about the LSE's strategy at the heart of Europe's biggest financial center.
Deutsche Boerse is trying to take market share in clearing euro denominated derivatives from LSE, with tacit backing from euro zone policymakers.

Without a permanent CEO, the LSE may be more vulnerable to a takeover bid, although Brexit uncertainties may protect it for now.

LINCOLN, Nebraska (Reuters) - Nebraska regulators on Tuesday denied TransCanada Corp's request to amend its route application for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline through the U.S. state, a potential setback for the company as it seeks to head off legal challenges.
The Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an approval for the line in late November, removing what appeared to be the last big regulatory obstacle for the long-delayed project, which has been backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
But the commission's approval was not for the route TransCanada had singled out in its application. Instead, the commission approved an alternative route that shifts it closer to an existing pipeline right-of-way down the eastern side of the state, a move opponents of the pipeline have said violates state statutes.
TransCanada filed a motion last month with the commission seeking permission to retrospectively amend the route application, a move that a company official said was intended to prevent lawsuits that could delay the project.
The commission on Tuesday voted 5-0 against the motion.
TransCanada said in a statement that it would review the decision to determine next steps for Keystone XL, but added that it believed the project remained economically viable.
""It is important to remember that this project has widespread support within the U.S. and Canadian federal governments,  as well as state officials in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska,"" the company said.
Ken Winston, a lawyer for environmental group the Sierra Club, said he saw the ruling as a win for pipeline opponents.
""The fact that they're having to consider an alternate route and that their motion was denied continues to make it more complicated for TransCanada. And any time it's more complicated, that's a victory for us,"" he said.
Attorneys for landowners opposing the pipeline also said Tuesday's ruling represented a setback for the project.
""The PSC clearly recognizes that it voted on a route that was not in the TransCanada application as a route it wanted approved,"" said attorney David Domina. ""TransCanada knows it is now in a position where it cannot go forward without a tremendous risk of reversal on appeal,"" he said.
TransCanada shares were down 20 cents to $61.61 in midday trading.
The proposed Keystone XL, which would run about 1,180 miles (1,899 km) from Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, has been a lightning rod of controversy since it was proposed a decade ago, with environmentalists making it a symbol of their broader fight against fossil fuels and global warming. 

Trump handed TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March as part of a broader agenda to boost the energy sector and create jobs. That reversed a decision by former President Barack Obama in 2015 to block the project on environmental grounds.

Niki filed for insolvency last week after Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), which is buying other parts of Air Berlin, scrapped plans to buy Niki, grounding the airline's fleet and stranding thousands of passengers. 
Niki's workers' council chief said on Dec. 15 the sale had to be agreed within seven days as its runway slots, or take-off and landing rights, would be lost after that point.
But a spokesman for airspace regulator Austro Control said no such deadline existed and the slots, among Niki's most attractive assets, would remain untouched for as long as the ministry was looking into the airline's insolvency filing.
""I cannot say anything about the length of the investigation for which there are no designated deadlines. The investigation at the Transport Ministry has been ongoing since (Niki) filed for insolvency,"" the spokesman said.
Sources told Reuters that British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) was once again interested in Niki.
Other interested parties include its founder and former Formula One champion Niki Lauda, tour operator Thomas Cook (L:TCG) and Irish budget carrier Ryanair (I:RYA),
Swiss carrier PrivatAir also voiced interest. ""We want to take Niki over in its entirety and save all the jobs, if possible,"" CEO Thomas Limberger told Austrian paper Die Presse, saying he was under time pressure get an idea of the carrier and arrange financing.
Niki's administrator said bidders have until Thursday to submit offers.
The Transport Ministry had no comment as new minister Norbert Hofer, who was sworn in on Monday, had not yet moved into his office as of Tuesday morning, meaning no spokesperson was available to comment on the investigation.
There was no immediate comment from the office of the head of the new government, Sebastian Kurz, when asked if it would continue to look into possible bridge financing for Niki as the previous cabinet had.
Lauda's spokeswoman said he was supposed to meet Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, but declined to give any details.
Lauda said he did not expect any decision on Niki's future to be made before the Christmas holidays.
""Several bids will be made by Thursday, and then on Friday they surely won't say: Mr. Lauda wins,"" he told German weekly Die Zeit in an interview.
The planes flown by Air Berlin and Niki were leased, and Lufthansa has now taken on many of them from the lessors.

However, should another buyer for Niki be found, Lufthansa will have to lease out some of those planes to the buyer, under an existing deal with the European Commission.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>",Defiant O'Leary says union recognition sets stage for Ryanair expansion,"By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary broke months of media silence on Tuesday to defend his decision to recognize unions for the first time in 32 years, saying it would allow his airline to expand and help to keep staff costs down. 
In his first interview since Friday's surprise decision to accept unionization to stave off a string of Christmas strikes, O'Leary said the move was his idea and that he would not step down. His action knocked more than 10 percent off the company's shares. 
But he also warned unions that he would not be a soft-touch and if they put forward unreasonable demands he would simply shift planes and jobs to other jurisdictions. 
""This is not a ruse. This is serious,"" O'Leary said of the decision, which he said was ""in many respects my idea"" and which he ran past the company's board of directors on Thursday night. 
""But if someone is being unreasonable and we are being completely messed around by a union, we will still move aircraft away from that base or country,"" he said in the interview in his Dublin office, flanked by his chief operations officer Peter Bellew and chief people officer Eddie Wilson, who are leading talks with unions.
He rejected media speculation that he may step aside to make way for Bellew, who left his position as chief executive of Malaysia Airlines last month and has been the face of the company in recent days. 
""Am I going to leave? No. I am going to stay,"" said O'Leary, in his first media interview since a Sept. 21 annual general meeting when he infuriated pilots by saying they did not have a difficult job.
O'Leary said union recognition would open new opportunities for Ryanair, allowing it to work in heavily unionized countries like France and Denmark. 
The airline could move 50 planes to France - one eighth of its current 400-plane fleet - he said, although he said the speed of such a deployment would depend on the availability of planes and deals with airports.
Ryanair will still meet its target of flying 200 million passengers per year by 2024, up from just under 130 million this year, he said. 
O'Leary said the decision to recognize unions would not impact on the company's annual profit forecast and that he did not expect staff costs to increase beyond the extra 100 million euros announced following the cancellation of 20,000 flights in September.
""We have already admitted there will be an uptick in labor costs next year. But will it alter our model? No,"" he said. 
""We will still have much lower aircraft costs, much lower financing costs, much lower airport deals. That will all remain unchanged.""
In the longer term, the rate of growth of staff costs could actually decrease as he said pilots prefer to work in unionized airlines, he said. 
O'Leary said the decision to recognize unions was not a result of management weakness or pilot strength but the fact that the airline was facing the prospect of compensating 150,000 passengers in Christmas week and possibly more after that. 
""If you need to go on strike just to test our mettle, then go ahead,"" O'Leary said. ""But not in Christmas week. And not one that disrupts all our customers across Europe."" 
""Union recognition was always going to happen when we moved into France. We have just moved that forward,"" he said.
Bellew and Wilson are due to meet with the Irish pilots union for the first time on Tuesday evening. O'Leary declined to comment on what Ryanair would concede. Ryanair, he said, would go in with a ""can do"" attitude.
Ryanair shares closed up 2.3 percent on Tuesday at 14.95 euros, but well below the Friday opening of 17.6 euros as investors have fretted that union recognition could potentially damage the carrier's low-cost business model. 
Rory Powe, fund manager at Man GLG (L:EMG), a top 20 shareholder in Ryanair, said some investors agreed with O'Leary's reading of the situation. 

""I don't see Ryanair’s cost advantage being eroded by anything more than an immaterial amount,"" he said. ""He has adapted and will continue to stay.""

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 01:38PM ET</span>","Saudis boost spending, slow austerity drive in 2018 budget","By Katie Paul and Rania El Gamal
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will increase government spending next year and slow an austerity drive as it struggles to lift the economy out of recession in the face of low oil prices, according to a state budget released on Tuesday.
Riyadh plans to increase spending to a record 978 billion riyals ($261 billion) in 2018, the finance ministry said. That is up from 890 billion riyals in the original 2017 budget plan and 926 billion riyals of actual spending this year. 
As a result, the decline in the government's budget deficit will slow next year. The 2018 deficit is projected at 195 billion riyals, or 7.3 percent of gross domestic product, against an actual 230 billion riyals in 2017.
In a speech, King Salman formally announced that the target date for eliminating the deficit would be pushed back to 2023 from the original target of 2020. Finance ministry officials had already informed local economists of the change last month.
Much of next year's increased spending will go to infrastructure projects that would benefit private companies, government ministers told a nationally televised briefing.
""In 2018, we will keep issuing legislation that will support the private sector, and we will also privatize some sectors that are ready and interest private business,"" said economy minister Mohammad al-Tuwaijri.
Riyadh has imposed new taxes and slashed spending in some areas bring down its deficit since 2015, when lower oil export revenues produced a record budget gap of 367 billion riyals, or about 15 percent of GDP.
The austerity drive has restored investor confidence in the Saudi currency and financial markets but taken a toll on the economy, where private sector growth has slowed to a crawl. Data for the first half of 2017 showed the overall economy in recession, partly because of cut-backs in oil output.
That has prompted the government, under pressure to cut an unemployment rate among Saudi citizens that is officially put at 12.8 percent, to plan on loosening its purse strings next year.
The budget plan predicts the economy will grow 2.7 percent in 2018 after contracting 0.5 percent in 2017. The non-oil sector is projected to expand 3.7 percent next year.
Many private economists said those growth targets might be too optimistic, since the government plans to introduce a 5 percent value-added tax in January and raise domestic energy prices later in the year.
But Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said Riyadh needed to shift policy towards faster growth to support long-term reforms designed to reduce the economy's reliance on oil exports.
""They are balancing fiscal consolidation required by rating agencies and international investors - they can't have a blowout budget - with the domestic need to show progress with the economic transformation plan, and boost the feel-good factor with stronger growth,"" she said.
Estimating the impact of the budget is harder for 2018 because of the government's increasing use of its giant Public Investment Fund and other state funds to invest in projects that lie partly outside the budget plan, economists said.
The finance ministry said that including these funds, government spending would total 1.11 trillion riyals next year. State loans worth 32 billion riyals would be offered to fund home construction, in an effort to address a housing shortage that is a major frustration for Saudis.
Another uncertainty is how Saudi Arabia's massive crackdown on corruption, launched last month with the arrest of dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen, will affect revenues.
The government has said it aims to claw back some $100 billion of illicit funds through settlements and prosecutions of people detained in the crackdown.

Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, does not disclose the oil price assumptions behind its budget. But private economists calculated that the 2018 budget appeared to assume an average Brent crude price of around $51 to $55 a barrel. It is now around $63, suggesting revenues may be larger than projected next year.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 12:54PM ET</span>",United Technologies resolves U.S. counterfeit parts probe for $1 million,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) will pay $1.06 million to resolve claims that a company it indirectly owned falsely certified the authenticity of counterfeit parts incorporated into U.S. Army helicopter engines, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.
The civil settlement with the Farmington, Connecticut-based aerospace supplier will resolve claims that a business it has since sold violated the False Claims Act while acting as a subcontractor to Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L:RR).
""Vulnerabilities caused by counterfeit parts will not be tolerated,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut said in a statement.
United Technologies did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement centered on a pump and engine controls systems business that United Technologies came to indirectly own after purchasing aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp in July 2012.
As part of a deal to resolve a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit, United Technologies agreed to divest the pump and engine control systems business. United Technologies sold the business to  Triumph Group Inc  (N:TGI) in March 2013.
The department said the Goodrich business had been a subcontractor to Rolls-Royce, an Army contractor, and sold parts to the company to be included in the M-250 series of engines, which were installed in Army helicopters.
From 2005 to 2012, the Goodrich pump and engine control systems business bought, shipped and caused counterfeit microprocessors to be integrated into an engine control unit that was installed in the M-250 engines, Durham's office said.
During that time, the Goodrich business provided to the government numerous false certifications as to the authenticity of the parts, according to the settlement agreement.
Prosecutors have previously brought criminal charges against two men in connection with the case, Jeffrey Krantz and Jeffrey Warga, who they say supplied computer chips to the Goodrich business that were then used in helicopters.

Krantz pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced in 2015 to three years of probation and a $100,000 fine. Warga pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and was sentenced in 2016 to three years of probation and a $10,000 fine.

""Questions have also arisen concerning potentially manipulative transactions in the company's stock in November 2017,"" the SEC said in a Monday press release.

In late November, the over-the-counter-traded company announced a deal to buy a majority stake in Coin Tracking e.K., a German cryptocurrency data platform.

1484,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 12:01PM ET</span>",Carlos Slim Is Said to Map Plan to Slash New York Times Holdings,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Carlos Slim is planning to sell more than half of his 17 percent stake in the New York Times Co. to U.S. hedge fund investors, reducing his sway over one of the world’s most influential publishers.
Slim’s businesses earlier this month sold $250 million of mandatory exchangeable trust securities in a private offering that gives the buyers a claim on a 9 percent stake in the New York Times, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The newspaper’s shares have surged more than 50 percent since Slim boosted his stake in 2015 and became the biggest shareholder.
The deal, which was referenced in a Dec. 6 statement but has gone largely unnoticed, means that when the securities mature three years from now and they automatically convert into Class A shares of New York Times, Slim and his companies will be left with about 8 percent of the publisher’s shares, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. In essence, the billionaire created a trust, pledged New York Times shares to it, locked the shares up for three years, then sold rights to that stock to investors.
Slim built his stake in the New York Times after lending the company $250 million in 2009 to help it get through the financial crisis. In 2015, he exercised stock options to become the Times’s biggest single investor in a display of confidence in the company even as readers and marketers flocked to the Internet where content is often free and ad rates are cheaper.
With the smaller stake, he’ll lose some of the power he had to vote for Class A directors, a group that can include no more than a third of board members. The Ochs-Sulzberger family -- the paper’s controlling owners -- hold Class B shares that give them a firm grip on the company. Publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. will retire at the end of this year after a quarter-century of overseeing the newspaper. His 37-year-old son, A.G., will take over.
Transferring the shares through the hybrid instruments allows Slim to take advantage of deferred tax payments until the transaction is completed, the person said.
Arturo Elias Ayub, a spokesman for Slim, confirmed the transaction. A New York Times spokesperson said the paper is “grateful for Mr. Slim’s confidence and support of the company” after he became a shareholder at a “critical” time in its history.
Technical investors such as hedge funds bought most of the securities Slim offered, perhaps seeking to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity opened up by the deal, the person said.
In July, Slim’s family holding company Inversora Carso sold 521,500 Times shares -- a fraction of its ownership and an amount representing 0.3 percent of the company, according to an SEC filing and data compiled by Bloomberg. Slim had said at the beginning of this year that the U.S. daily had been a good investment and that he wasn’t planning to sell his stake.
When Slim made his loan to the Times, the publisher was reeling from the global financial crisis and needed a cash infusion to buy time for asset sales and new strategic initiatives. The company agreed to pay 14 percent interest and granted Slim stock warrants to acquire his stake at a discount. The terms seemed onerous at the time but that ultimately let the Times dig itself out of a bad situation. The company paid back the loan in 2011, ahead of schedule.
Slim exercised the warrants in 2015 and has held on to most of the shares, benefiting from a 51 percent rally as the election of President Donald Trump drove demand for digital subscriptions from news-hungry readers.
Shares closed Monday at $18.60, still far off their high of more than $52 in 2002, back in the early days of the internet. Slim has said his bet on the Times was always about the value of the newspaper’s brand, which he figured would survive the upheaval of the digital age.
Before he was elected, Trump accused Slim of using his ownership stake in the Times to influence the paper’s coverage of him. The Times said Slim never affected coverage and a representative for the billionaire said Slim wasn’t interested in influencing the election.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) (J:SNHJ) said on Tuesday it had started to lose credit lines from lenders, pummeling the South African retailers' shares again as it grapples with an accounting scandal.
The embattled owner of brands such as Mattress Firm, Conforama and Poundland said in a presentation prepared for lenders at a meeting on Tuesday in London that it was still unable to determine the scale of the financial irregularities.
Uncertainty about Steinhoff's finances has hammered the shares that are listed in Frankfurt and Johannesburg, driving the firm's market value down by more than $10 billion since it first disclosed what it described as ""accounting irregularities"" two weeks ago. The stock tumbled 20 percent further on Tuesday.
The firm, once dubbed Africa's IKEA and which vied with the Swedish giant for global market share, said some credit facilities were being suspended or withdrawn, while insurers were cancelling or reducing credit insurance. 
""Given the ongoing forensic review, it is not possible to provide further detail regarding ... whether any additional years financial statements may require restatement,"" Steinhoff said in a presentation to lenders.
The company, which has spotted a 2 billion euro hole in its balance sheet, urged lenders which include  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) to continue to provide support.
Steinhoff was sitting on 10.7 billion euros in outstanding debt with about 690 million euros notional facilities rolled over to date, the company said.
But the lack of clarity about the company's financial situation and its future has rattled investors.
""It points to uncertainty and markets hate it,"" said Ryan Woods, a trader at Independent Securities. ""More importantly, are banks going to allow them to have their lines of credit?""
In its efforts to steady the company, Steinhoff named Chief Operating Officer Danie van der Merwe, a company veteran of two decades, as acting chief executive, the second person to hold the executive role since CEO Markus Jooste quit on Dec. 5.
Steinhoff's top shareholder Christo Wiese initially stepped into the executive post, but abruptly resigned as chairman and de facto CEO last week.
Van der Merwe, with acting chairperson Heather Sonn, now has the task of steering the recovery of a firm that grew from a modest distributor of furniture in communist eastern Europe to a global firm spanning food, furniture and clothing.
Steinhoff had been a ""must have"" for investors, who were won over by its reinvention and ambition, even though it faced investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015. The company's primary listing is in Frankfurt.
Four current and former managers are under suspicion of overstating revenues at subsidiaries, prosecutors have said.

The company has previously said the investigation related to whether revenues were booked properly, and whether taxable profits were correctly declared.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>",Gulf boycott boosts Qatar as wealth comes home,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh
DOHA (Reuters) - The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) is seeing a surge in business as Qataris register more of their assets at home and multinationals navigating a Gulf boycott of the country boost their local presence, its chief executive told Reuters.
The diplomatic and trade boycott imposed in June by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain has changed the way business is done with Qatar, the world's largest liquefied natural gas exporter and host of the 2022 World Cup.
State-owned companies, or companies owned by mostly Qatari shareholders, and rich individuals are redirecting their investments to the Qatar Financial Centre, the QFC's head Yousuf al-Jaida told Reuters in an interview in Doha, Qatar's capital.
It reflects nervousness among the country's elite that investments registered abroad could be frozen, as well as a desire by international companies to maintain close ties with the world's biggest liquefied gas producer.
The trend, he said, has seen migration from Dubai in neighbouring United Arab Emirates, which was traditionally the hub for companies doing business across the Gulf, from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait.
The shift to Doha is the result of the diplomatic and trade boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain on June 5. 
""The immediate action was that ... a lot of the companies that had their special purpose vehicles set up in Dubai International Financial Centre were re-routing their investments in (to) the QFC because they wouldn't know what the uncertainty factor would lead to eventually and how long this will go on for,"" Jaida said.
""They would rather hold those international assets from here (Qatar) rather than face uncertainty there because of their Qatari background or nationality,"" he said. ""They panicked.""
Jaida also pointed to the number of companies registered in the Qatar Financial Centre, which has increased 45 percent in the third quarter compared to the year earlier.
When compared to the second quarter, in the wake of the boycott, growth rose 6.9 percent, from 390 companies to 417 companies registered at QFC with $20 billion in assets, QFC said in a statement.
Jaida said some of these investments had previously been registered in Dubai's financial freezone but have moved to Qatar after the boycott began in June. He did not provide the value of the assets those companies hold.
""They don't know how they will be treated by nearby countries,"" he said. ""So a lot of the companies that used to set up in blockade countries are coming back home.""
The Dubai International Financial Centre told Reuters that it has seen an increase in the number of companies registered this year, when asked whether some Qatari companies had moved to Doha. 
""In 2017, the number of companies operating in DIFC increased by 6 percent to 1,750 as at June 30.  The number has continued to grow further still in H2 2017,"" it said in an email. 
    
POLITICS AND BUSINESS MIX
The boycotting states accused Qatar of financing militant groups operating in the Middle East, and allying with their regional foe Iran at the expense of Gulf security, allegations Doha denies. 
In the aftermath of this diplomatic row, some Gulf investors withdrew deposits from Qatari banks and pulled funds out of Doha's stock market.
It has also made it harder for international companies wanting to maintain ties with Qatar. 
""You can no longer service the region from one country, wherever you are, and you're going to have logistical problems. Unfortunately politics and business are being mixed up in the region,"" Jaida said.
Previously, many multinational companies in the region used Dubai as a base to do business with Qatar. But because of disruption to travel and banking links, some are now ramping up their presence in Doha, he said.
""We're seeing a lot of the multinationals who used to service Qatar from abroad and nearby financial centres in blockade countries unable to freely travel so they are having to put 3, 4 or 5 more people here on the ground to continue that relationship.""
Jaida said emotions were playing an increasing role in business, and that some Qataris were hesitant in doing business with foreign companies unless they had a local presence.
""For us, it's a good period,"" he said. ""It's never been better.""
The boycott has prompted Qatar to embrace multinationals and foreign investment. It has made economic reforms and has opened up visas to more than 80 nationalities.
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani recently said his government was focusing on completing strategic projects to cope with the sanctions, including ports, water and food security.

""If it wasn't for the crisis this probably would have taken a decade,"" said Jaida.

1506,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>",Hurricane-hit catastrophe bond managers plan new funds,"By Maiya Keidan and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds and other managers of catastrophe bond funds racked up some of the worst losses in more than a decade from this year's hurricanes and wildfires.
But a year that is shaping up to be the costliest on record for insurance losses from natural disasters is nonetheless clearing a path for new fund launches.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Asset Management, Securis Investment Partners and Stone Ridge Asset Management are all launching new funds in insurance-linked securities (ILS) such as catastrophe bonds, sources say. 
Reinsurance rates are expected to rise up to 20 percent at key Jan. 1 renewals due to greater demand for cover after three major hurricanes in the United States and Caribbean, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires still raging in California.
That should translate into higher ILS yields, potentially drawing in new return-seeking investors, industry specialists say.
""We are seeing (investors) take a fresh look. It's a good addition to a portfolio in the long run and good now from a tactical perspective – an attractive entry point,"" said Chris Walvoord, partner, global head of hedge fund research at Aon Hewitt.
That entry point comes after hedge fund-run ILS funds lost 6.6 percent in the year to end-November, data from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed.
""Right now, these funds are just estimating their losses, but by the first quarter of 2018 the full extent of the losses will be clear which could usher in fund closures,"" said Mohammad Hassan, head of hedge-fund analysis at Eurekahedge.
""This year was the ILS's version of GFC (global financial crisis) 2008 – the steepest losses on record for ILS hedge funds in more than a decade.""
Across the industry, hurricanes alone could lead to losses of $100 billion this year, according to risk modeling agencies and reinsurers.
That compares with losses of about $74 billion caused by Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005.
Catastrophe bonds and other ILS package insurance risk in debt form. They offer high yields but default if a specified natural disaster or series of natural disasters takes place.
Several bonds have already been marked down sharply, particularly in Florida, industry sources say, on expectations that losses will be severe enough to trigger non-payment to investors.
ILS loss estimates in the secondary market range from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, according to specialist consultancy Lane Financial. 
""We can already see who went swimming without bathing trunks and a few who were clearly out of their depth in the storms and wildfires of 2017,"" said Christine Farquhar, head of fixed income research for EMEA at Cambridge Associates.
The ILS alternative to reinsurance is growing. It totaled $89 billion in June 2017, compared with $516 billion in traditional reinsurance, according to broker Aon Benfield.
Once the preserve of risk-taking investors, ILS have appealed in recent years to mainstream investors such as pension funds, family offices and high net worth individuals, due to their relatively high yield and lack of correlation to financial markets.
Chris Rule, chief investment officer of Local Pensions Partnership, made up of two large UK local government pension schemes, said one of the schemes had invested this year in ILS fund Aeolus Capital Management, backed by hedge fund Elliott, and could make further ILS bets.
""The discussion we are having now is whether premiums have expanded sufficiently to warrant a larger allocation,"" he said.
Credit Suisse is in the process of launching two new ILS funds, according to two sources close to the firm.
ILS hedge fund manager Securis and asset management firm Stone Ridge are also launching new funds, sources said. 
A spokeswoman at Credit Suisse declined to comment while Securis and Stone Ridge did not respond to requests.
Other ILS managers have enjoyed an injection of investor cash. 
ILS assets at hedge fund manager Leadenhall Capital Partners grew to $4.5 billion in December, from $3.5 billion at the start of the year, a spokesman for the firm told Reuters.
Markel CatCo Investment Management has also raised over $1.8 billion for its private ILS fund.
""Yields have risen and business is getting done on much better terms than we have seen since 2013,"" said Farquhar at Cambridge. ""It's the only credit-like market where yields are rising and won't be round historic lows going into next year.""
However, some industry watchers are doubtful reinsurance rates will rise so much, given strong competition which has contributed to several years of falling rates.
UBS analysts said they expected reinsurance price rises to be ""localized"" to those areas hit by the disasters.
""Versus initial post-loss commentary, companies are now more measured,"" they said in a note.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 09:24AM ET</span>","Work hard, play hard: Life lessons from Sammy Hagar","(The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)
By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - You probably know Sammy Hagar as a music legend, either from his solo career or as a longtime frontman for Van Halen.
What you might not know: The gravel-voiced 70-year-old is also an impressive business titan, with successful ventures ranging from spirits to restaurants.
For the latest in Reuters' ""Life Lessons"" series, we talked to Hagar about his remarkable rise from hardscrabble poverty in California to a Hall of Fame music career along with his status as the de facto king of Cabo San Lucas.
Q: What was the money situation like in your early days?
A: We were dirt-ass poor. My mom was basically raising four kids on her own, so things were tough. But it made me grateful for every bit of success I got. And I always wanted more. It drove me to say, 'I'll never be poor again.' That almost became a problem, because I wondered when I was ever going to stop working so hard.
Q: When your fame started to grow and you joined Van Halen, how did you handle extreme success?
A: The best thing that ever happened to me was that it wasn't overnight success. It was very gradual. In the early days I even did other things, like construct apartment buildings and rent them out. 
By the time I made my first million, I was pretty grounded.
Q: Your ventures outside music started in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Why did you set roots down there?
A: I had bought a little house, and eventually I decided to open up a bar. I became hip to really good tequila, with 100 percent agave, because at that time in America, there really wasn't any. I just thought, 'I'll build a cantina, and have all these wonderful tequilas you've never heard of.' And then I started making my own.
Q: What did that teach you about the business side of things?
A: You don't have to know what you are doing to be successful. 
Sometimes passion, wanting something different and breaking the rules is the shortest route to success. If you get one idea that makes you excited, and you put your heart and soul into it - there is no stopping that.
I ended up being around $250,000 in and sold for around $100 million because the tequila was making $7 million to $8 million a year. Then the cantina starting making $3 million to $4 million a year, and now it's well beyond that. 
Q: Your split from Van Halen in 1996 was a little acrimonious, so what did you learn from that experience?
A: Ha! Well, I guess things didn't work out so well at the end, but I can't say anything bad about Van Halen. I had a long run as part of one of the top bands in the world, having the best times you could ever imagine. And in retrospect, it really helped me with my own business goals. Looking back in life, it really makes you believe in God, because you can see that every step happened for a reason. It's like somebody planned it.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass along to your kids?
A: My philosophy - which Warren Buffett told me personally - is that you should give your kids enough to live humbly, but not so much that they have no drive or ambition. You don't want them to starve to death, but you also want them to work and succeed on their own. So far, it is working.
Q: Tell me about your philosophy of giving back?
A: Anything I do to make money, I make sure to give some back. It's a spiritual thing, like leaving some for the gods. I believe that, and it makes me more comfortable with being rich. A lot of people hate rich folks - but I say don't judge others by how much money they have, judge them by what they do with it.

Every place I have restaurants - like Cleveland, Maui, Oahu, and Las Vegas - I give my proceeds back to the local community, usually food banks. I also have deals with some local hospitals, where if terminally ill kids come in without insurance and the families can't pay, I help with the bills. That's my favorite thing to do.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - In one video, Sergeant Mychal Turner stunned a mentally ill inmate with a Taser multiple times after the inmate defied an order to stand in his cell at Ohio’s Franklin County jail.
In another, Turner fired the Taser’s electrified barbs into an inmate’s chest after he refused to remove a piece of jewelry. In a third, he pulled the trigger five times on a handcuffed inmate who wouldn’t sit on a bench.
Each incident violated the jail’s Taser policy, and each was cited in a class-action lawsuit the county settled that accused jail guards of “sadistic” and unconstitutional use of Tasers from 2008 to 2010, court records show.
Yet neither Turner nor any other deputies were disciplined, according to internal county jail records reviewed by Reuters.
Instead, Turner was promoted to major. He’s now commander of Franklin County Corrections Center II, the largest of the jail’s two main facilities.
Reached by phone, Turner declined to comment. In court documents, he has defended his actions, saying he feared for his safety in some incidents and wanted to avoid potentially dangerous physical struggles in the small confines of a cell. Jail officials also declined to comment, though the county said it instituted reforms in 2011 under the lawsuit settlement.
Now, following a Reuters report this month that included publication of more than a dozen stun-gun videos, the jail faces escalating calls for investigation.
Two United Nations torture experts called for a criminal inquiry into the cases documented by Reuters. Local political leaders say they agree.
Ohio State Senator Charleta Tavares, a Democrat whose district includes the jail, said she planned to call on the county prosecutor’s office to investigate. She said she was disturbed by the video footage published by Reuters.
“Any time a stun gun is used inappropriately – particularly in the video, where it looks as though it is just used over and over and it's more like a prod that people would use on animals – that is criminal in my opinion,” Tavares said.
Ohio Democratic State Representative Kristin Boggs also urged a closer look. A criminal investigation would be appropriate, she said, if an officer was found to have used excessive force that violated jail policy. “I certainly think it's worth investigating to determine what we can be doing to make our system better,” Boggs said.
Deputies who misused Tasers should be held to account, said relatives of the inmates.
“It was absolutely abuse,” said Logan Amburgey, whose brother Patrick was stunned multiple times and pistol-whipped with a Taser by another deputy after defying orders to sit on a bench in his cell on June 12, 2009. Patrick, a 21-year-old college student at the time, had been arrested for passing out intoxicated on the front porch of a local residence.
""UNCOOPERATIVE""
From 2008 to 2010, 22 deputies at the Franklin County Jail used Tasers on 80 inmates, according to a Reuters review of the jail’s “use of force” reports. No jailer pulled the trigger more times than Turner.
In all, Turner delivered 28 shocks for a total duration of 126 seconds over the course of 12 incidents. One other guard, Sergeant Andrew Eing, fired his Taser 26 times for a total of 114 seconds. Most other deputies who used the weapons pulled the trigger fewer than a dozen times.
Like Turner, Eing was promoted – to lieutenant in the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau, responsible for investigating officer misconduct. Now supervisor of the detective bureau, he did not return calls seeking comment. In internal reports, Eing denied abusing the Taser, saying he aimed to prevent injury to staff and inmates.
In one case, Eing shocked a 23-year-old mentally ill inmate, Jibril Abdul-Muwwakil, 14 times for 64 seconds while he lay bleeding on the floor, surrounded by 10 officers. An internal investigation concluded the Taser use was “justified” to control a “violent, dangerous, resisting inmate.” Experts for the plaintiffs described the incident as “excessive” and a violation of Taser product-safety and health warnings.
Sixty percent of the 80 Taser incidents involved people classified by the jail as intoxicated or mentally ill, Reuters found. 
In January 2009, Turner and four deputies tried to move Ralston Distin, a 47-year-old inmate classified as “mentally disabled,” to another location. When the jailers opened his cell door, Distin shielded his body with a sleeping mat, speaking unintelligibly. Turner shocked him repeatedly for refusing to stand up. Once in leg irons, Turner shocked him again for not letting go of the mat.
Turner feared he would get “entangled in a wrestling match” or be kicked if he didn’t use the Taser, he testified in court documents.
In another video, Turner fired the Taser’s electrified barbs into the chest of Kevin Carey in May 2009 for refusing to remove a nipple ring. Carey, 25, had been charged with drunk driving and resisting arrest.
Turner said he stunned Carey to “make sure that he doesn’t become uncooperative” and because he failed “to follow directions.”
He also stunned a handcuffed Gregory Esmile five times after the 46-year-old failed to sit down on a bench. Esmile was jailed on trespass charges after failing to leave a nightclub, court records say.
Turner said he worried Esmile was “getting ready to charge.”
""UNLAWFUL USE""
According to the jail’s Taser policy at the time, Tasers were allowed for self-defense, protection of another inmate or staff, disarming an inmate, preventing self-harm to an inmate, or controlling a combative inmate.
Tasers could not be used on inmates in handcuffs, leg irons or a restraint chair, or on pregnant women. So several cases violated the policy, the lawsuit against the county alleged. One video cited in the case showed a pregnant woman, Martini Smith, being shocked. She later miscarried, and was among plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit.
Axon Enterprise Inc, the stun gun manufacturer, said its guidelines suggest proper practices and that it does not “condone torture of any kind.”
In separate statements, the office of Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O’Brien and the Franklin County sheriff’s department said no one officially sought a criminal investigation in the cases.
The statements said the U.S. Department of Justice did not recommend criminal charges when the DOJ intervened in the civil lawsuit on grounds that Franklin County “engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful use of Tasers against detainees and inmates in their custody.” 
After that case, the county agreed to pay eight inmates a total of $102,250 in damages, strengthened its Taser policy and expanded training.
The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division does not recommend that jurisdictions prosecute cases, according to DOJ rules.
O’Brien’s office said neither the inmates' lawyers nor its expert witness, Steve J. Martin, sought charges.
Disability Rights Ohio, a legal group representing inmates, said that’s not its role. The nonprofit group “is not an enforcement agency,” said advocacy director Kerstin Sjoberg-Witt.
Martin, who has inspected more than 500 U.S. prisons and jails, said urging investigations is not his role. He was “surprised” at O’Brien’s comment.
The cases were ultimately investigated by the special litigation section of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. Under DOJ rules, litigation lawyers can refer possible crimes to the unit’s criminal section.

Justice spokesman Devin O'Malley said he couldn’t “comment on the existence or non-existence of investigations.”

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 05:50AM ET</span>",EU agency may not be fully prepared to wind down failing banks- auditors,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's agency in charge of disposing of failing banks may not be fully prepared to deal with a new banking crisis, EU auditors said on Tuesday, casting doubt on a body facing dozens of lawsuits for its forced sale of Banco Popular.
The Single Resolution Board (SRB) was established after the euro zone banking crisis, which forced governments to use hundreds of billions of euros of taxpayer money to rescue failing banks.
The body, chaired since its creation in 2014 by Elke Koenig, Germany's former financial regulator, is intended to minimize the cost to taxpayers and depositors when failing banks are wound down, forcing the losses on their shareholders and bondholders. 
To achieve its target, the SRB needs to devise resolution plans for the 142 euro zone banks under its watch, which should detail banks' critical functions that need to be protected in a rescue.
But the SRB has drawn up detailed plans for only some of the banks and those available are ""still missing key elements,"" the European Court of Auditors said in a report published the day after Koenig's mandate was renewed for five years. 
The auditors said the banking agency ""was unable to provide an overview of critical functions for every bank under its remit,"" raising doubts on how the SRB assesses bank liabilities.
The report, which is part of a regular oversight of EU institutions, also said the plans scrutinized by auditors did not show the ""potential contagion risk"" caused by a bank resolution, warning that this could turn a lender's rescue into another bank's problem.
The SRB, in replies included in the report, said the auditors' report was based on last year's resolution plans and many of the shortcomings were already addressed this year.
""We are saying that the resolution planning (..) is inadequate in a number of respects,"" Kevin Cardiff, the auditor responsible for the report said in a news conference.
""But that is not the same as saying that in a particular case the institution would not perform well,"" he added.
So far, the SRB has tested its powers to wind down a bank only once, with the forced sale in May of Spain's ailing Banco Popular to a larger rival,  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN). 
Popular's bondholders who lost their investments in the process are suing the SRB. EU regulators called the rescue a ""success"" because it spared depositors and did no damage the Spanish banking system. 
The sale of Popular did not reflect the resolution strategy that the SRB had planned for the bank, the agency admitted after the overnight rescue. The most common option is a bail-in, in which a bank continues its operations after its creditors have paid the rescue bill.
The auditors said the SRB's resolution plans did not properly take into account possible ""unanticipated, short-term developments"", increasing the chances that in the future the agency will again be forced ""to deviate from the plans,"" as it occurred with Popular.

The SRB's shortcomings were partly caused by the fact that the agency is ""seriously understaffed"", auditors said. The SRB replied that it will reach 306 staff members early next year - still short of its target of 350.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares followed U.S. and Asian markets higher on Tuesday as investors awaited a long-anticipated U.S. tax reform bill which looks almost certain to pass this week. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.2 percent to a five-week high, maintaining Monday's momentum, although gains were more muted, with euro zone stocks and blue-chips (STOXX50E) up 0.1 percent. 
Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3 percent, boosted by its weighting towards defensive, high dividend-paying stocks which investors favor when they sense uncertainty.
""The tax reform is driving equities. In our view, the risks are limited and the reform will now pass,"" said Valentin Bissat, equity strategist at Mirabaud Asset Management. 
Leading stock moves was chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), jumping 7.7 percent after Tsinghua raised its stake in the company further to 9 percent.
Tsinghua Unigroup has been adding to its stake since Dialog shares plunged in November on a report the power management chip maker might lose its biggest client, Apple (O:AAPL). 
Shares in AMS (S:AMS), another chipmaker, rose 3 percent, but this wasn't enough to boost the tech sector, which fell back 0.1 percent. The highly-valued tech sector has weakened in recent weeks as investors shifted into bank stocks.
Shares in Anglo-South African financial services group  Old Mutual  (L:OML) gained 4.6 percent after the company said it would sell its Buxton UK wealth business to TA Associates for $800 million as part of a planned break-up.
Intrum Justitia (ST:INTRUM) shares fell 6.3 percent after the debt collection firm said its CFO would leave the company.
Germany-listed shares in South African retailer Steinhoff (DE:SNHG) rose 6.2 percent, building on a bounce from depressed levels the stock fell to as an accounting scandal broke. 
Budget airline Ryanair (I:RYA) gained 4 percent, bouncing back after six straight sessions of losses caused by investors' concerns over the firm's decision to recognize unions.
Telecoms stocks were strong performers, boosted by a note from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) arguing the industry could fare better in 2018 thanks to successful cost-cutting, stronger mobile revenue growth and lower cash tax rates. 
Telcos have been among the worst performing sectors this year, down 2.5 percent from January.
Overall euro zone equities were drawing to the close of a stellar year of gains, shrugging off a strengthening euro to deliver substantial returns.
""If you look at performance in euros, European equities had a very strong year even compared to U.S. companies,"" said Mirabaud's Bissat, adding the difference in local currency performance was mainly down to the euro's strength.
""More importantly, it came from earnings growth rather than valuation expansion,"" he added.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 04:20AM ET</span>",Greenyard targets U.S. market with talks to acquire Dole Food,"By Alan Charlish
(Reuters) - Belgian fresh and frozen foods company Greenyard NV said on Tuesday it was in advanced negotiations to acquire Dole Food Company [DFCI.UL], the world's largest fruit and vegetable producer, confirming a Reuters report.
The California-based company, one of the largest producers of bananas and pineapples, could be valued at more than $2.5 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Greenyard has a market capitalization of 869 million euros ($1.03 billion) according to Thomson Reuters data.
""Greenyard has secured appropriate financing, and is confident in its ability to complete the transaction with a balanced financing approach should a definitive agreement be reached,"" the company said in a statement.
The deal would create a company with annual revenue of around 8 billion euros.
Shares in Brussels-listed Greenyard, half-owned by the family of Belgian entrepreneur Hein Deprez, were up 1.9 percent at 0830 GMT, after a 3.3 percent rise on Monday.
For Dole's 94-year-old chairman David Murdock a deal with Greenyard would offer a quick way to cash out on his ownership of the California-based company, which has also been considering a potential initial public offering.
For Greenyard, an acquisitive company that started out as a mushroom grower in the 1980s, the deal would allow it to branch out into the U.S. market. It could also supply the U.S. businesses of existing customers such as Aldi [ALDIEI.UL], Lidl and Ahold Delhaize.
""It is a very fragmented fruit and veg distribution market they're operating in... some of the markets where they’ve talked about being more ambitious are France, the UK and the U.S., and certainly Dole would give them that key into the U.S.,"" said Berenberg analyst Fintan Ryan.
""From a strategic point of view, the acquisition would make sense creating a large player in both Europe and America,"" KBC analysts said in a note, adding that Greenyard would need to raise about 500 million euros to keep its net debt/EBITDA level ratio to below 3.5.
Dole Food Company could not immediately be reached for comment.

In October, Subaru revealed that uncertified technicians took part in final inspections at domestic plants for over 30 years. It also said some staff had cheated on tests to certify as technicians for the final inspections.
Subaru said last month it was recalling 395,000 vehicles in Japan and forecast 20 billion yen ($177 million) in related costs.
In its latest report to the government, Subaru said it would improve training for and monitoring of final inspections, and communicate the importance of compliance to staff. 
The automaker said a root of the problem was that management and staff did not fully appreciate the importance of the final inspections. 
""We regret that, despite understanding the social demand for an emphasis on compliance, and the increased influence we have through our social presence, we had problems of compliance, carrying out inappropriate final inspections,"" it said. 
Subaru's revelation was part of a series of compliance failings by Japanese companies that have surfaced in recent months, hitting the country's reputation for quality control and prompting calls for better governance.
Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) has admitted to similar lapses, while Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406), Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) and Toray Industries Inc (T:3402) - all key suppliers of products to global manufacturers - have admitted to product data fabrication in recent months.
On Tuesday, Mitsubishi Materials said in an update on its own probe that it had found more cases of products whose data had likely been falsified.

Separately, Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) said it had installed more than 10,000 elevators that did not meet specifications it had submitted to the government, but added there were no safety concerns with the elevators.

1534,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 03:44AM ET</span>",Fed's Dots Have Lost the Plot as Economists Puzzle Over Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve published a fresh set of economic forecasts last week covering the next three years. Economists have been trying to make sense of the 2018 outlook ever since.
Here’s the conundrum. Fed officials raised their forecast for growth by four tenths of a percentage point for next year, to 2.5 percent. That’s comfortably above the 1.8 percent rate they estimate the economy can sustain in the long run.
The unemployment rate falls just two tenths more under that robust forecast to average 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 -- well under their estimate of full employment. Inflation moves up to just under 2 percent.
For all that, they kept their interest-rate projections for 2018 steady at three increases, presented in a dot-plot chart, to finish the year in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Put another way, the economy will run a lot hotter than the committee forecast in September, but the rate-hike path stays the same.
“The revisions to the forecast were inconsistent with the lack of revisions to the dots,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in New York. “The number of dots should have gone up.”
Jerome Powell, nominated by President Donald Trump to replace Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her terms ends Feb. 3, discussed various “challenges” created by the dot plot in a February 2016 speech, including the fact that they are anonymous and quickly become stale.
If confirmed by the Senate, he’ll have a chance to do something about it under any review of the central bank’s communication strategy he decides to undertake. Meanwhile, economists are tossing explanations at the 2018 forecast to see if they can get something to stick. Here’s a look at some theories and where they might fall apart.
Positive Supply Side Shock
The economy can grow faster without much inflation if productivity suddenly picks up. The Republican tax plan currently being hammered out in Congress does create incentives for investment.
Inflation Persistence
It may be that more Fed officials view inflation as less responsive now to low rates of unemployment. This was Yellen’s answer in her press conference: “You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more?” she said, referring to rate hikes, after cautioning that the projections are a mash-up of 16 different outlooks and not a consensus forecast.
“Well, okay, growth is a little stronger. The unemployment rate runs a little bit lower, that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy,” she said. “Counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective.
Politics
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists suggest Fed officials want to avoid showing an aggressive policy response on the eve of a vote on the Republican tax bill. “We think the monetary policy projections may be lagging the economic projections, perhaps in part due to political sensitivity,” they said in a note to clients on Dec. 13.
Bloomberg Economics chief U.S. economist Carl Riccadonna also thinks there was some political sensitivity that kept the committee from showing four hikes for next year. “The Fed is eager to avoid political meddling,” he said.
Nevertheless, economists said the Fed is in show-me mode now with the tax package and inflation, while ready to move to faster hikes if necessary.
“If we saw of a series of inflation prints where inflation was moving higher, even just up to their target, we would see them be more aggressive on their rates,” said Robert Martin, an executive director at UBS Securities in New York and a former Fed economist.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 03:13AM ET</span>",Cuba boosts trade ties with Cold War ally Russia as U.S. disengages,"By Sarah Marsh and Nelson Acosta
HAVANA (Reuters) - Boxy Russian-built Lada automobiles still rattle around Cuba, growing more decrepit by the year, a reminder of vanished Soviet patronage for the Communist-led island.
But next month, more than 300 shiny new Ladas are slated to roll onto Havana's potholed streets, the first in more than a decade. Their manufacturer Avtovaz, Russia's biggest carmaker, says it hopes to ramp up exports, thanks to financing from Russian government development bank VEB.
Flush with state funding, Avtovaz and other Russian companies are once again increasing sales to the Caribbean isle. It is part of a broader move by Moscow to renew commercial, military and political ties just as the U.S. government is retreating from Cuba under Republican President Donald Trump.
Russian exports to Cuba jumped 81 percent on the year to $225 million in the January-September period, official Russian data shows. That is just a quarter of the exports of Cuba's chief merchandise trading partner, China, but growing fast.
Russian state oil major Rosneft in May resumed fuel shipments to Cuba for the first time this century. The company's head met with Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana on Saturday, the latest sign the two countries are readying a major energy agreement. The nations in the past have discussed increased deliveries of Russian oil to the island and development of Cuba's offshore oil fields. 
That would be a major assist for Cuba amid slumping shipments of cheap fuel from its troubled socialist ally Venezuela.
Last month, private Russian company Sinara delivered the first of 75 locomotives worth $190 million ordered by Cuba in 2016. Russia's largest truck maker KAMAZ has also stepped up exports to Cuba. 
Negotiations for rail lines and other infrastructure are in the works.
""We can call this period a renaissance,"" Aleksandr Bogatyr, Russia's trade representative in Cuba, said in an interview. He forecast bilateral trade could grow to $350 million to $400 million this year, one of its highest levels in nearly two decades, up from $248 million in 2016.
Russia's Cuba offensive comes as Trump has halted efforts by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama to normalize U.S.-Cuba ties and ease the decades-old U.S. trade embargo.
In June, Trump ordered tighter travel and commercial restrictions again, disappointing U.S. businesses that had hoped to capitalize on the detente. In September, his administration slashed U.S. embassy staffing in Cuba.
Moscow is seizing on that rollback as a way to undermine U.S. influence in its own backyard, some foreign policy experts say.
""Russia sees it as a moment to further its own relationship with Cuba,"" said Jason Marczak, Director at the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.
""The more the Russian footprint increase in Cuba, the more that will reinforce hardened anti-U.S. attitudes and shut out U.S. businesses from eventually doing greater business in Cuba.""
MONEY SPEAKS
Throughout the Cold War, Moscow propped up Fidel Castro's revolutionary government, providing it with billions of dollars worth of cheap grain, machinery and other goods. Those subsidies disappeared with the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Trade plunged. 
Under Russian President Vladimir Putin, who longs to return his nation to superpower status, Moscow over the past decade has sought to revive relations with Latin America, particularly with countries wary of U.S. influence.
The turnaround with Cuba got a boost in 2014 when Russia forgave 90 percent of Cuba's $35 billion Soviet-era debt. It also started providing export financing to Russian companies looking to sell to the cash-strapped island.
The help has been cheered in Cuba, where Raul Castro is due to step down next year, marking the departure of the generation that led the 1959 Cuban Revolution.
Russia may lie half a world away from Cuba, but traces of its historic ties with the Caribbean's largest island are everywhere. Older generations learned Russian and studied in the Soviet Union. At a recent trade fair in the capital, Cubans spontaneously sung along to the folk music played at the opening of Russia's pavilion.
Moskvich and Lada cars, Ural motor-bikes and Kamaz trucks chug along the streets. Most Cuban farm equipment is from the former Soviet Union. That legacy alone has sustained some Russian trade.
""We sell spare parts for ground transport, some planes, agriculture, construction,"" said Russian businessman Igor Leonov. He set up his import company, Ces Co. Ltd, in Cuba nearly thirty years ago and says there is plenty of demand.
The decades-old U.S. trade embargo has also forced Cuba to remain loyal to some Russian manufacturers. The island upgraded its Soviet-era fleet in the 2000s with Russian-built Tupolev, Antonov and Ilyushin planes.
Nadezhda Lesova, an executive at the Russian Export Center in Moscow, said her organization regarded Cuba as a ""strategic region."" She said the center is providing support for exports to Cuba, including insurance, loans and subsidies, worth around 430 million euros ($508.60 million).
HIGH SPEED TRAIN 
Some major deals are under discussion. 
State-owned monopoly Russian Railways (RZD) is negotiating to upgrade more than 1000 km of Cuban railroads and install a high-speed link between Havana and the beach resort of Varadero, in what would be Cuba's biggest infrastructure project in decades.
""It is expected the deal will be worth 1.9 billion euros ($2.26 billion) and will be signed by the end of the year,"" Oleg Nikolaev, Deputy Chief Executive Officer at the RZD subsidiary RZD International, told Reuters.
In October, oil firm Rosneft said it was looking at modernizing the island's Cienfuegos oil refinery.
But the optimistic talk could be overblown. Venezuela and China have announced investments in Cuba that came to naught, largely due to the complications of doing business in Cuba.
Some Russian companies are already smarting from Cuba's cash crunch. Ces Co. Ltd, the parts importer, said Cuba was behind on $9 million in payments.
And it is unclear how long Russia will continue to finance exports, with its own economy struggling amid low oil prices and Western sanctions.
Russia's economic constraints are one reason analysts are dubious that Moscow will make good on recent proposals to re-open a former base in Cuba. Shuttered in 2001, the so-called Lourdes base was used for electronic surveillance of the United States.
Still, U.S. military experts are concerned that Russia could leverage increased economic influence in Cuba to step up its military and espionage activities on the island.
Sixteen high-ranking military officers wrote an open letter to the Trump administration in April asking it to continue Obama's opening with Cuba for national security reasons.
""If Russia is willing to offset oil supplies from Venezuela and some other things, maybe Cuba doesn't have much of a choice but to let them re-establish political warfare operations there,"" retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. David L. McGinnis, one of the signatories, said in an interview with Reuters.
Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba, sees Russia's renewed interest in Cuba as geostrategic. 
""It’s hard to see a business interest, as Cuba can’t pay,"" said Hare, who now lectures at Boston University’s Pardee School of Global Studies. ""The Russians will do just as much as they want to prop up Cuba so as to be a nuisance to the United States.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) has appointed Michel Coulomb as its top sales executive in India, replacing Sanjay Kaul, a source familiar with the move said on Tuesday, as the U.S. tech giant pursues a bigger share of the world's third-largest smartphone market.
Coulomb has worked with Apple since 2003 and was most recently the managing director for Apple in South Asia, according to his biography on professional network LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
The Economic Times newspaper had reported earlier on Tuesday that Kaul would be leaving after six years with Apple, citing people familiar with the matter.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Coulomb and Kaul were not immediately reachable.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based maker of the iPhone is keen to widen its reach in India where it currently holds just under 3 percent of the smartphone market.
Apple's sales rose 17 percent to 116.19 billion rupees ($1.81 billion) in the fiscal year to March 2017, much slower than the 50 percent growth in the previous year, regulatory filings show.
It is also seeking incentives and tax breaks from the federal government to expand manufacturing in India.
On Monday, Apple increased prices for all its phones in India by an average 3.5 percent after the government last week raised taxes on imported phones, except the low-cost SE model that it assembles through its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron (TW:3231) in Bengaluru.
India's price-sensitive market is currently dominated by South Korea's  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), and Chinese players including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. 
Apple's iPhones remain aspirational for a rising middle class but their price keeps them out of the reach of many.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 10:00PM ET</span>",Court orders Trump administration to give immigrant teens abortion access,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Monday that President Donald Trump's administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally, escalating a high-profile legal fight.
Judge Tanya Chutkan put her order on hold, however, to give the U.S. Justice Department time to appeal her ruling. 
The Justice Department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The judge's temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention.
The issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the Trump administration's objections. 
In that instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on Oct. 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration’s opposition.
The two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, requested abortions, but the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure.
In her ruling, Chutkan wrote that the girls' ""constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term"" needed to be preserved. 
She also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court.
“We are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel HHS to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,"" a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.
""A pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor. HHS-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.”

Shares in Taisei fell 5.3 percent to a more than 3-month low, while Obayashi shed over 3 percent before paring losses. The benchmark Nikkei average (N225) was flat. 
Taisei, one of the so-called ""big four"" of Japan's construction firms, is fully cooperating with the investigation, company spokesman Takayuki Renbutsu said. 
Separately, prosecutors raided Obayashi's offices over suspected antitrust breaches, a company spokeswoman said. The firm is already under investigation for suspected bid-rigging over maglev-related contracts.
The Tokyo prosecutor's office said it could not comment on individual cases.
The raids come after prosecutors launched investigations into Shimizu Corp (T:1803) and Kajima Corp (T:1812), also on alleged antitrust breaches related to the maglev project. The train line will link Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.
Shimizu shares fell as much as 3.2 percent, while Kajima slumped as much as 5.6 percent, both extending losses from Monday. 

Japan's large and politically influential construction industry has been a frequent source of scandals such as bid-rigging.

(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co and  Hershey Co  on Monday unveiled deals totaling nearly $6 billion to buy healthy packaged snacks makers, the latest example of big U.S. food companies trying to cater to an increasing American preference for healthy foods.
Campbell (N:CPB) will buy Cape Cod chips-maker Snyder's-Lance Inc (O:LNCE) for $4.87 billion in cash to combat sagging soup sales. Snyder's-Lance, the No. 5 U.S. healthy savory snacks maker, also owns brands such as Eatsmart veggie snacks.
Hershey (N:HSY), meanwhile, will spend about $921 million to acquire Amplify Snack Brands (N:BETR), which makes SkinnyPop popcorn and Paqui tortilla chips.
Most of the products made by Snyder's-Lance and Amplify Snack claim to have no artificial ingredients or transfats and come in dairy-free cheese and naturally sweet flavors that are popular among millennials.
Snyder's-Lance shares, which have gained in the past few session on reports of a possible deal, rose 6.8 percent to a record high of $50 per share, matching Campbell's offer.
Amplify's shares rose 71 percent to their highest in just over a year. They closed 6.9 percent higher at $50.04 on Monday. Shares of Campbell and Hershey both ended up about 0.1.
U.S. packaged food makers, including  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) and Kellogg Co (N:K), are buying or investing in healthy-food companies to shore up margins that have taken a beating from falling prices and demand for their mass-market brands.
Conagra Brands Inc (N:CAG) bought Boomchickapop popcorn maker Angie's Artisan Treats in September, while Kellogg bought RXBar protein bar maker Chicago Bar Co in October to create premium positioning for their wares.
The savory healthy snacks market is estimated to be $8.95 billion in the United States, having gained nearly 15 percent over the past five years, according to data from Euromonitor International. The healthy sweet-snacks market is worth $10.37 billion, rising more than 20 percent in the same period.
""CRYSTALLINE LOGIC""
Campbell completed its $700 million acquisition of organic soup and broth maker Pacific Foods last week, when media reports first surfaced about a possible deal with Snyder's-Lance.
""We think the Snyder's-Lance deal represents crystalline logic,"" ConsumerEdge Research analyst Jonathan Feeney said in a note.
Melding Campbell and Snyder's-Lance's roughly $2 billion U.S. snack portfolios will radically cut costs and add complementary salty snacks to round out Campbell's successful Pepperidge brand and Lance's position as a big national distributor of salty snacks, Feeney said.
Meanwhile, the primary benefit to Hershey from Amplify will likely be faster growth, Feeney said. But he cautions that the deal sets Hershey up for competition with PepsiCo Inc's (N:PEP) Frito-Lay and Campbell's Pepperidge.
Hershey, which makes Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey's Kisses, has acquired brands such as Krave meat jerky and Ripple Brand Collective's barkTHINS over the past two years.
The company, which rejected a $23 billion bid from Oreo cookie owner  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) in June last year, said it expects to save $20 million over the next two years through the Amplify deal.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and  Morgan Stanley  & Co (NYSE:MS). LLC are financial advisers to Hershey, while Jefferies LLC advised Amplify.

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) acted is Campbell's lead financial adviser and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP its legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) LLC advised Snyder's-Lance and Jenner & Block LLP gave legal counsel.

(Reuters) - Regulators in Massachusetts and New York State said on Monday they are probing MetLife Inc (N:MET) after the insurer revealed last week it had failed to pay pensions to potentially thousands of people.
""Retirees cannot afford to have glitches with their pension checks,"" Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, said in a statement announcing an investigation.
""I want to uncover why this occurred and how MetLife is going to rectify the problem for the retirees,"" Galvin said.
The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which regulates insurers and banks in the state, said on Monday that it is reviewing the matter.
MetLife said on Friday that it believed the group missing out on the payments represented less than 5 percent of about 600,000 people who receive a type of annuity benefit from the company via its retirement business.
Those affected generally have average benefits of less than $150 a month, MetLife said. 
""We are deeply disappointed that we fell short of our own high standards,"" MetLife said. ""Our customers deserve better. We are committed to making this right for our customers. We found the issue, we self-reported it, and we are committed to doing better.""
New York's regulator was aware of the issue prior to MetLife's disclosure, NYDFS Superintendent Maria Vullo said.
""The department is currently reviewing the matter and will work with MetLife to remediate the issue and ensure that all MetLife’s outstanding pension obligations are fulfilled,"" Vullo said.
MetLife, which pledged to fully cooperate with regulators, said the standard way for finding retirees who are owed benefits is no longer sufficient.
""While it is still difficult to track everyone down, we have not been as aggressive as we could have been,"" MetLife said in a statement.
""When we realized this was a significant issue, we launched an effort to do three things: figure out what happened, strengthen our processes so that we do a better job locating retirees, and promptly pay anyone we find - as we always do,"" the company said. 

MetLife said it is now using ""enhanced techniques"" to locate and promptly pay any those who may be entitled to benefits.

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 06:28PM ET</span>",Boeing-Bombardier spat puts U.S.-Canadian trade deals in spotlight,"By Alwyn Scott and Alana Wise
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Bombardier Inc traded barbs on Monday over the U.S. planemaker's claim that its Canadian rival benefited from billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies and dumped its newest jetliner in the United States at below cost.
At a contentious hearing of the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), Boeing accused Bombardier of harming its ability to sell 737s in the U.S. market, in one of the final stages of a bitter trade dispute due to conclude in February. 
Bombardier argued Boeing's large 737 order book shows there has been no adverse impact from its CSeries jet and that the U.S. planemaker does not manufacture a jet that competes with the new model.
""Boeing is making money hand over fist. And with a backlog of 737 orders years into the future, there are no signs of difficulty on the horizon,"" Bombardier representative Peter Lichtenbaum said. 
If the ITC sides with Boeing, as it has so far, it could effectively keep U.S. airlines from using Bombardier's CSeries jet by imposing duties of nearly 300 percent, one of the largest ever imposed for a market-based economy, Boeing said.
""These investigations have already established beyond question that Bombardier has taken billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to prop up its C Series program. The C Series would not even exist at this point but for those subsidies,"" Boeing said in a statement emailed during Bombardier's panel remarks. 
The U.S. Department of Commerce was due to finalize the proposed duties on Monday or Tuesday.
If Bombardier wins, Chicago-based Boeing says its smallest 737 model could face unfair competition from the CSeries for decades. 
Canada's ambassador to the United States, David MacNaughton, warned that a positive finding of material harm to Boeing by the ITC could represent a possible violation of World Trade Organization agreements and prompt a more formal complaint with the global trade group.
""Boeing's assertion that future imports from Canada threaten to cause material injury is necessarily based on just the type of 'speculation and conjecture' that is prohibited under both U.S. and international law,"" MacNaughton told the panel. 
Canada earlier this month scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Ottawa's anger over the trade challenge. Boeing has said it considered all potential risks before deciding to launch its trade case. 
The case stems from an April 2016 sale of 75 CSeries jets to Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). Boeing claims Delta paid $20 million per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33 million and what Bombardier charges in Canada. 
""A single large order, like Bombardier's sale to Delta, takes years of demand out of the market. In this industry, if we lose a sale, it’s gone forever. That's years of lost production and deliveries for Boeing, years of lost work for our employees, and years of lost work for our U.S. suppliers,"" Boeing Executive Vice President Kevin McAllister said. 
European planemaker Airbus SE, which is buying a controlling stake in the CSeries program and has a competing plane, has said it would add a second CSeries production line to a factory in Alabama, making it a U.S. product for domestic airlines.
Boeing says that should not negate the duties because Airbus and Bombardier would import fuselages and wings and merely be assembling in the United States. 
But Bombardier argues that Boeing's case is against full imports of airplanes, not parts, so it does not apply to imports of wings, fuselages and other pieces. Bombardier says more than half of the value of CSeries content comes from the United States, including engines by Pratt & Whitney.
DEFINING DEAL 
Boeing says the Delta deal was market defining because other airlines will demand the same low price and the planes will be in service for decades. 
All jetliners are sold below cost initially because airlines are taking a risk on a new jet model and upfront development costs are high, Bombardier argues. The cost drops over time as the factory produces more planes and gets better at making them.
The U.S. planemaker said Bombardier failed to cooperate in a U.S. investigation providing pricing information to the United States.
Bombardier said it turned over the Delta sales contract but cannot accurately estimate the cost and price of those planes because they are being built and delivered in coming years. 
Boeing says the CSeries benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada and Britain and a $1 billion equity infusion from the province of Quebec. 
Those subsidies are not prohibited because they are either market-based investments or repayable loans, Bombardier said.
Bombardier also argues that Boeing and Airbus do not compete with the CSeries because their planes are larger and have more range. The CSeries' more direct competitors are smaller jets made by Embraer Mitsubishi.

The CSeries poses no threat to the U.S. aerospace industry because building it at the Airbus factory in Alabama would create U.S. jobs and generate billions of dollars in business for U.S. aerospace companies, Bombardier said.

The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is expected to begin voting on sweeping tax legislation on Tuesday, aiming to get the bill to President Donald Trump to sign into law by the end of the week. Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins said she would vote for the sweeping overhaul, all but ensuring its passage.
""This Congress has shown an inability to pass anything over the past five years,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""If a major piece of legislation is passed, you'd expect the markets to be happy.""
U.S. stocks have enjoyed a near year-long rally, with the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) set for their best year since 2013.
The bill would cut corporate tax rates to 21 percent from 35 percent, which investors are betting will boost profits as well as trigger share buybacks and higher dividend payouts.
Another expected outcome of lower taxes is cash repatriation, which market analysts say could boost mergers and acquisitions.
""A lot of the things in the tax proposal are better for stocks than anything else,"" said Rob Stein, chief executive officer of Astor Investment Management in Chicago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 140.46 points, or 0.57 percent, to 24,792.2, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 14.36 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,690.17 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 58.18 points, or 0.84 percent, to 6,994.76.
Besides the three indexes, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) and the S&P 100 <.OEXA> also hit record highs. The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) rose 1.2 percent to a record closing high.
The materials index (SPLRCM) gained 1.5 percent, the most among the major 11 S&P sectors. The utilities index (SPLRCU) had the largest decline, with a drop of 1.2 percent.
Utilities suffer from higher interest rates, which the Federal Reserve announced last week, and they are expected to see less upside from tax cuts than other sectors, Stein said.
On Monday, investors were treated to a flood of deals.
Shares of Amplify Snack (N:BETR) soared 71.6 percent to $12.01 after Hershey (N:HSY) said it would buy the SkinnyPop popcorn maker in a $1.6 billion deal. Hershey rose 0.1 percent.
Snyder's-Lance (O:LNCE) rose 6.9 percent after  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) said it would buy the Pretzels and Cape Cod chips maker for $4.87 billion.
Casino operator Penn National Gaming (O:PENN) said it would buy Pinnacle Entertainment (O:PNK) in a $2.8 billion deal. Penn National dipped 2.2 percent, while Pinnacle's shares were up 0.7 percent.
Twitter (N:TWTR) jumped 11 percent after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it expects the company to post double-digit daily average user growth in 2018.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

About 7.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 6.8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Shareholders on Monday appointed Stefania Bariatti as chairwoman to replace Alessandro Falciai, who decided to leave the bank citing personal reasons. 
The new board, which will govern the bank to 2019, will comprise 14 members from the current 13. 
""Today's shareholder meeting closes a period of uncertainty that has lasted five years,"" Falciai said, calling the period the stormiest in the bank's centuries-old lifetime.
Weighed down by mismanagement, a derivatives scandal and bad debts, the world's oldest bank turned to Rome for help after failing, in late 2016, to find buyers for a 5 billion euro share issue needed to keep it afloat.
After pumping in around 5.4 billion euros, the Treasury now holds about 68 percent of the lender.
Marco Morelli, former head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Italy appointed CEO at Monte dei Paschi last September, was confirmed in his position.
Morelli told shareholders that regaining profitability would take a long time since the bank needed to recoup years of total commercial inactivity.
""I won't play the Pied Piper... 'don't worry, everything has been resolved', is not something you'll hear me say,"" he said.
Monte dei Paschi posted a net loss of 3 billion euros in the first nine months of the year, with writedowns on loans totaling about 4.8 billion euros.

Earlier this year the bank tabled a five-year restructuring plan that included cutting thousands of jobs and selling assets to get the European Union's blessing to receive state aid.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>","BMW electric cars hit 100,000 sales target","BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) said on Monday it had hit its target of selling 100,000 electric cars this year around the world, benefiting from strong demand in western Europe and the United States for models such as the i3 and the 2-series plug-in hybrid Active Tourer.
This is more than 60 percent up from the 62,255 electric cars BMW sold last year. The German luxury carmaker has said it expects 2018 electric-vehicle (EV) sales to grow by a medium two-digit percentages.
A pioneer in electric cars, BMW launched the i3 hatchback in 2013 but sales have been relatively low and management has wrestled with whether to go all-out for electrification. 
But that changed in September when the Munich-based group said it would gear up for mass production of electric cars and aimed to have 12 fully electric models by 2025 with a range of up to 700 kilometers.
""Electric mobility is the indicator where I measure our success,"" Chief Executive Harald Krueger said.

Earlier on Monday, U.S. EV battery company Solid Power said it had partnered with BMW to develop the next-generation solid-state battery technology for use in electric cars.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for General Motors (N:GM) on Monday urged a federal bankruptcy judge in Manhattan to throw out a settlement that would require the company to pay $1 billion to car owners suing over faulty ignition switches.
The carmaker made its argument on the first day of a scheduled three-day bench trial before Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The trial will determine the validity of a deal the car owners said they reached in August with a trust that holds many GM liabilities from before its 2009 bankruptcy.
The claims stem from GM’s 2014 recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, including one linked to 124 deaths.
Lawyers for the car owners say the trust agreed to a deal in August but walked away several days later, instead accepting GM’s offer to help pay for its defense against the car owners’ claims.
The judge questioned how that came about, noting GM had an interest in dissolving any deal that required it to pay more. 
“I have trouble saying it passes the smell test,” Glenn said, referring to a two-hour meeting between the trust and GM in August, after which the trust dropped the agreement with the plaintiffs.
But attorneys for the carmaker and the trust told Glenn the trust had every right to drop the agreement.
“Sometimes people simply get cold feet, even when they get married,” said Susheel Kirpalani, a lawyer for GM, “and the same applies to settlements, your honor.”
The carmaker said the deal with the car owners had never been signed, rendering it non-binding. Mitchell Karlan, an attorney for the trust, on Monday also said plaintiff lawyers contradicted each other in their testimony on when the agreement was allegedly reached.
But the car owners said the trust acted in bad faith and claimed the agreement was binding even without a signature, pointing to conversations and emails with the trust.
The settlement called for the trust to accept $10 billion in claims to resolve about 11.9 million allegations over economic loss and between 400 and 500 personal injury and wrongful death claims.
About 2.4 million claims, involving vehicles sold after GM’s bankruptcy, would have remained pending in another court.

GM has already paid roughly $2.5 billion to settle ignition switch-related claims, including $900 million to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 01:22PM ET</span>","Buffett's latest milestone: Berkshire stock hits $300,000","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's stock price touched $300,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting investors' confidence in Warren Buffett's conglomerate despite four straight quarters of lower operating profit.
Crossing the $300,000 threshold put Berkshire's Class A shares up 22.9 percent for the year, compared with a 20 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500.
Berkshire's Class B shares, worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares, traded at around $199.75. Neither class pays dividends.
The gain occurred even though 2017 has been Berkshire's second straight year of mediocre operating performance relative to prior periods.
Operating profit, which rose 1 percent in 2016, was down 16 percent from January to September, reflecting losses from storms such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the accounting for a transaction with American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).
But book value, or assets minus liabilities, was up 8.9 percent. Buffett considers this a good measure of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's growth.
Berkshire has more than 90 operating units, including large businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Berkshire Hathaway Energy utilities, and smaller businesses making Dairy Queen ice cream, Duracell batteries, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Ginsu knives and the World Book encyclopedia.
Buffett, 87, has run Berkshire since 1965, when it was a struggling textile company whose shares were worth barely $11 each. Shareholders who hung on for the ride have had gains topping 2,400,000 percent.
Only a handful of U.S. companies have stock prices that have reached even four figures.
Other members of the exclusive club include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Priceline Group Inc, and lesser-known companies such as Seaboard Corp, a pork producer that also ships cargo by sea.
A high share price can reduce trading and encourage long-term ownership.
But companies can encourage retail ownership by splitting their stock or, as Berkshire did, creating lower-priced shares.
In 1996, Buffett created Class B shares worth 1/30th of Class A shares, but with lesser voting rights, to stop fee-hungry managers from creating ""unit trusts"" that sliced up Class A shares for smaller investors seeking ""Berkshire look-alikes.""

Then in 2010, when it bought BNSF, Berkshire split the B shares 50-for-1, letting more of the railroad's shareholders swap their stock for Berkshire stock if they wished.

LONDON (Reuters) - For years, the Brazilian mining conglomerate Vale was a darling of emerging market investors, who were happy to ignore the company's poor record on environmental and social issues because of the high yields its bonds paid.
But warnings about the company's policies were horribly vindicated in 2015, when a dam holding back waste at its Samarco mine burst, killing 19 people in Brazil's worst-ever environmental disaster.
Prices on Vale and Samarco bonds plummeted by about a third after the disaster. Vale, along with mine co-owner BHP Billiton (LON:BLT), is facing a multi-billion dollar claim. 
Events like that are increasingly spurring fund managers to look closer at environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks before investing in emerging markets, where polluting industries and accounting issues have often gone unpunished.
This is especially so in dollar debt markets, where the temptation of a lucrative income stream via high-interest bond coupons has often proved too strong to resist.
But recent months have seen more frequent governance-driven sell offs - from ""accounting irregularities"" at South African retailer Steinhoff to bribery and food safety investigations at Brazilian meatpacker JBS.
In January, investors who bought Mozambique's 10.5 percent ""tuna bond"" learned the country would default. Bond proceeds, earmarked for a tuna fishing fleet, had vanished. 
Vale was a vindication of sorts for Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Union Investment. Vale had been on the ""fail"" list for most of Union's ESG funds for about six years because of its environmental and social governance record.
""When Samarco happened, it was a confirmation for us that we had identified this issue properly,"" Dergachev said. 
""ESG mandates tend to lag a bit in risk-on environments, but in risk-off scenarios they tend to do better,"" he said, referring to investors' willingness to look past problems when they are flush with cash.
That might be why fund managers have been happy to buy bonds this year from the likes of Tajikistan or Saudi Arabia. But demand for ethical investment is growing - over half of the $265 billion of institutional money invested in emerging debt is now run with ESG considerations, according to research firm eVestment.
And the number should grow as sovereign wealth funds join in. This month a group of funds, including from Norway's and Saudi Arabia's, pledged to develop an ESG framework to address climate change; some of them are already divesting from fossil fuels.
This suggests the worst offenders - whether on the environmental or political front - will face a dwindling pool of investors willing to buy their bonds, putting pressure on those that fail to clean up their act.
""As investors become increasingly ESG-minded, a company that isn't making any efforts in terms of ESG will have fewer investors willing to lend them money, so longer term, their cost of funding will increase,"" said Karine Jesiolowski, senior investment specialist for EM debt at Swiss asset manager UBP.
LEADERS AND LAGGARDS
In equities, there is good evidence that ethical investors reap higher returns over the longer term.
Index provider MSCI's Emerging Markets ESG Leaders Index, which comprises shares in companies with high ESG scores relative to sector peers, has outperformed the main emerging equity index by an annualized 4.1 percent since inception in September 2007.
Now there are signs that debt markets are pricing ESG risk. A recent research paper by Steffen Hoerter, global head of ESG at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, found better ESG scores reflected in lower sovereign debt insurance costs. 
But applying ethical metrics to emerging debt is tricky. The prevalence of natural-resources companies, repressive regimes and corruption means a simple exclusion-based approach may not work.
As a result, some managers, such as UBP, are adopting a ""leaders and laggards"" strategy, investing in best in class companies that also meet other key investment criteria.
Others, such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management, also don't exclude most issuers outright but use ESG criteria to assess whether they are being paid to take the risk. 
""If we think the alpha proposition is very high, we will take a position, but it will be much less than we would have done if the ESG score had been more favorable,"" said Bryan Carter, head of emerging market fixed income. 
But they tend to stay out of markets with rock-bottom ESG scores, such as Angola, Iraq, Mongolia and Belarus.
""It's very intuitive to think of the lowest-scoring ESG countries as places to stay away from, as they are more likely to suffer debt distress or a credit event,"" Carter added.
Not everyone is convinced that using ESG criteria can help generate excess returns for debt investors. This year's list of top-performing emerging bond markets is peppered with countries such as Poland and Russia, where leaders are tightening their grip on power.
""We have seen some predictive power (for ESG) on the equity side, but we haven't seen the same level of detail on the credit side,"" said Steve Williams, a senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management. ""We need to go through a full credit cycle.""
The ease with which some frontier markets have issued debt this year suggests that short-term investment horizons, higher yields and the perceived predictability of autocratic regimes will keep some investors coming back for more. 
But if ethical investing is not yet a must, the direction of travel is clear, says Roy Scheepe, senior client portfolio manager at NN Investment Partners, which incorporates ESG components into its investment process.

""There is always a group with very high standards, and that has helped raise the minimum level for all,"" he said. ""The bar is higher than it was five to 10 years ago, and I expect that to continue.""

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 12:42PM ET</span>",Tiny stem cell companies close in on major heart disease goals,"By Bill Berkrot
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The early hope that stem cell therapy would make the paralyzed walk, the blind see and cure diabetes have given way to a long list of failures, highlighted by early stem cell champion Geron Corp abandoning the field in 2011.
But two small companies, Athersys Inc and Mesoblast Ltd, are beginning final stage trials in hundreds of patients that they - along with loyal investors - say could change the course of devastating stroke and heart failure.
Both have overcome major hurdles to manufacturing stem cell treatments on a large scale that are off-the-shelf products derived from healthy donor bone marrow and do not face immune system rejection issues.
Cleveland-based Athersys, with a market value of about $200 million, demonstrated evidence in a midstage trial that its therapy may be able to expand the emergency treatment window for major strokes to up to 36 hours, compared with about four hours with current drugs, potentially allowing many more patients to avoid crippling disabilities. 
Australia's Mesoblast, with a market value of about $500 million, is attempting to alter advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths and an enormous cost burden. 
They are among the farthest along in the stem cell industry at a time when Wall Street investors have focused on potentially big payoffs from immune-system based cancer therapies and rare disease treatments. 
Perception of the field has also been hurt by unscrupulous actors selling unapproved, possibly unsterile cell therapies for everything from cancer to lung disease and ALS, prompting a U.S. crackdown this past summer.
""The market tends to test these companies sometimes to the brink,"" said Tom Dobell, who manages a fund for U.K.-based M&G Investment Management that specializes in supporting promising companies during difficult periods. ""We're comfortable that the progress that's going on is going to be worth it."" 
M&G is a long-time holder of Mesoblast, with about a 15 percent stake, and Athersys, with about 4 percent.
Athersys's experimental Multistem treatment was one of the first companies to be designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a promising cell-based therapy with potential to address unmet needs for serious or life threatening conditions, potentially easing the approval process.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a recent interview the agency is seeking an approval pathway for legitimate stem cell therapies ""that's not overly burdensome.""
""The regenerative medicine space has been a tough road clinically and Athersys is one of the bright, shining stars,"" said Steven Martin, managing member of Chicago-based Aspire Capital and a long-time holder of Athersys shares.
REDUCING THE RISKS
Athersys believes Multistem - 1.2 billion cells delivered via simple intravenous drip - dampens the immune system's hyper-inflammatory reaction to signals that the brain is under attack during stroke, and promotes healing. 
The body's reaction to stroke may also severely deplete the immune system, leading to later complications beyond paralysis or speech impairment. In the Phase II trial, Multistem patients had significantly fewer incidents of pneumonia, acute pulmonary distress and other serious complications.
That trial, attempting to extend the treatment window to 48 hours, failed. But researchers were encouraged by patients treated up to 36 hours post stroke.
""It's reason to be cautiously optimistic,"" said Dr. Ken Uchino, a leading Multistem investigator from Cleveland Clinic. 
The company plans to begin a 300-patient Phase III study of Multistem in early 2018, aiming for U.S. and European approval after regulators agreed to protocols for one pivotal trial.
""This reinforces and cements an efficient path forward for us,"" Athersys Chief Executive Gil Van Bokkelen said. A separate 220-patient Multistem trial in Japan for that market began enrolling patients through partner Healios KK. 
""Of the many entities in this field, they have been careful and deliberate in their movement forward"" and do not engage in ""overwrought claims,"" said Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael, co-director of UCLA Broad Stem Cell Center, who was not involved in Multistem trials. 
Mesoblast's MPC-150-IM therapy aims to mitigate advanced heart failure, a progressive condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to efficiently serve the body. 
The company believes the therapy reduces inflammation, increases blood flow and spurs blood vessel formation that helps repair the heart muscle. A single dose consists of 150 million highly purified stem cells delivered directly to the heart’s left ventricle by injection or catheter.
An ongoing Phase III trial of 600 advanced heart failure patients is currently enrolling. Reducing the severity of a patient's heart failure ""would give them back potentially many years of good quality life,"" said Mesoblast CEO Silviu Itescu. 
Independent monitors who oversee and can halt blinded clinical trials for futility gave a green light to continue the Mesoblast study in April after a review of the first 270 treated patients, suggesting the therapy might be effective. 
A separate U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored Phase II study of 159 end-stage heart failure patients dependent on an implanted pumping assist device completed enrollment in September, with results expected in the first quarter of 2018. 
Some 250,000 people in the United States alone have been diagnosed with most serious class IV heart failure, and only about 9,000 receive a transplant or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) each year, Itescu said. 

If such patients can recover enough to again rely on their own heart, said Dr. Joseph Woo, a heart surgeon at Stanford University and an investigator of the NIH trial, ""this would be considered one of the big advances of this century.""

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 12:30PM ET</span>",Barclays proposes alternative Seadrill restructuring plan-court filing,"OSLO (Reuters) - British bank  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) has submitted an alternative proposal to restructure  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), the oil rig company said in a U.S. court filing.
Seadrill, which filed for Chapter 11 restructuring in a U.S. court on Sept. 12, has already received two restructuring proposals. 
The Norwegian company, once the largest drilling rig operator by market value, filed for bankruptcy protection after being hit hard by oil company investment cutbacks following the fall in oil prices.
One of the proposals is from its main owner, Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen and a group of hedge funds.[L8N1OD5OL]. The other came from an ""Ad-Hoc Group"" of unsecured bondholders, including about 40 investors from the United States, Europe and Asia.
""Indeed, the debtors (Seadrill) recently received proposals from each of Barclays and the Ad Hoc Group,"" Seadrill said in the court documents filed last Friday.
Barclays, which also holds Seadrill's bonds, was not immediately available to comment.
The court filing did not give any details of Barclays' plan.
Seadrill said it would continue to engage with both Barclays and the Ad Hoc Group ""in hopes of reaching a global resolution."" 
The company also said the original plan proposed by Fredriksen represented ""the highest and otherwise best value-maximizing alternative.""
The proposal from Fredriksen and the group of hedge funds's envisages investing $1.06 billion via new equity and secured debt to restructure Seadrill and its $12.8 billion in debt and other liabilities.
This plan offered holders of Seadrill's $2.3 billion of unsecured bonds 14.3 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, while existing shareholders would be left with just 1.9 percent.
The plan requires the approval of unsecured bondholders as their holdings will be impaired in the restructuring. In a court filing on Friday, Seadrill said this plan was backed by about 40 percent of unsecured bondholders and almost all of its bank lenders. 
Seadrill's spokesman said in an email on Monday the company had no further comments. 

A hearing on the official restructuring plan will be held in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Texas on Jan. 10.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 11:04AM ET</span>",Casino operator Penn National to buy Pinnacle in $2.8 billion deal,"By Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - Casino operator  Penn National Gaming Inc  (O:PENN) said on Monday it would buy  Pinnacle Entertainment Inc  (O:PNK) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $2.8 billion, cementing its position as the leading U.S. regional gaming operator.
The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. gambling sector in recent years as companies look to expand their reach, diversify their businesses and take advantage of recent legalization of gaming in some states.
In a bid to assuage regulatory concerns around the deal, Pinnacle will sell four of its Ameristar properties to  Boyd Gaming Corp  (N:BYD) for $575 million. At the same time, Boyd will sign a lease agreement with Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc (O:GLPI), the landlord for Penn National and Pinnacle.
""This was a very complex four-party transaction and we took a look holistically at the deal and what we needed to handle regulatory (approval) at the state and federal level,"" Penn National Chief Executive Timothy Wilmott said.
After the deal, Penn National will operate a combined 41 properties with about 53,500 slots, 1,300 tables and 8,300 hotel rooms in the United States.
Under the deal, Pinnacle's shareholders will receive $32.47 per share, comprising $20.00 in cash and 0.42 shares of Penn National common stock.
The offer represents a premium of 36 percent for Pinnacle shareholders based on the closing price of the two stocks on Oct. 4, a day before the Wall Street Journal first reported that the companies were in merger talks.
Pinnacle's shares were trading at $31.03, below the offer price, while those of Penn National were down 3.6 percent at $31.00.
Penn National expects to benefit with respect to the potential changes in the tax laws, including getting access to additional ammunition for potential acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer William Fair said on a call with analysts.
Union Gaming Research analyst John DeCree said he expected M&A activity in the sector to continue through 2018, adding that casino operators would gain from low cost of capital and potential tax reforms next year.
The Pinnacle deal is expected to generate $100 million in annual run-rate cost savings within 2 years of closing.
After the deal, Penn National shareholders will own 78 percent of the combined company and Pinnacle shareholders the rest.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the lead financial adviser and BofA Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser to Penn National. J.P. Morgan was advising Pinnacle.

About 19 EU states had still not fully implemented the ""MiFID II"" rules into national law by October. This raised concerns about whether trading platforms and investment firms from those countries could still operate on a pan-EU basis from January.
""The authorization granted under MiFID I should continue to be valid after 3 January 2018,"" the European Securities and Markets Authority said in new guidance on Monday.
MiFID II is already a year late, having been delayed to give regulators and banks more time to get ready.

1604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 10:32AM ET</span>",Yield Curve Inversions and Stocks Are a Toxic Mix: Ben Carlson,"(Bloomberg View) -- Predicting when the next recession will begin is no easy task because the economy doesn’t operate on a set schedule. But there is one market relationship that’s been a reliable indicator over that past 40 years or so -- the spread between the two- and the 10-year Treasury yields.
The chart below shows that every recession since the mid-1970s (the shaded regions) has followed an inverted yield curve when the two-year note yields more than the 10-year:
The spread has been rapidly closing in recent years and is fast approaching another inversion. Since September alone the two-year yield has gone from 1.26 percent to 1.85 percent. In that same time the 10-year yield has gone from 2.05 percent to 2.37 percent. This means the yield curve is getting “flatter” as long-term rates are rising much slower than short-term rates.
This matters because bond yields are typically used to gauge the health of the economy. Wider spreads between short-term and long-term bonds lead to an upward sloping yield curve, which can indicate healthy economic prospects -- most likely faster growth and inflation in the future. Narrower spreads lead to a flatter or even negatively sloped yield curve, which can indicate poor economic prospects -- most likely slower growth and inflation.
Experts are predicting the two- to 10-year spread could invert as early as 2018, which could be accelerated by further rate hikes from the Fed. Nothing works always and forever in the markets but this is a situation economic watchers should pay attention to, just not right away if we use history as a guide. Here are the start dates for the five previous inverted yield curves along with the beginning of the ensuing recession:
There has been a substantial lag from the time of the inversion until the start of the recession in each of these instances. The average number of months was 17, meaning it took about a year-and-a-half for the economic slowdown to hit after the inverted yield curve. We can also look at the stock market’s performance in this lag period to see how the S&P 500 has performed after the yield curve inverted but before the start of the next recession:
The average return in these periods was a gain of more than 15 percent; there was just one downturn, which occurred after the dot-com bust in the early 2000s. Although the stock market doesn’t need to see a recession for a large correction, it’s a safe bet that an economic contraction will lead to a drawdown in stocks.
The old joke is that the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions but stocks have actually gone into correction, and even bear market territory, far more quickly than the economy has sunk into a recession following an inverted yield curve. This table shows that every one of the five times since the mid-1970s that long rates have fallen below short rates, the S&P 500 has experienced a double-digit drawdown:
The timing of these market corrections varies widely. In late-1980 and early-2000, the inverted yield curve signaled a quickly approaching stock market peak. In the other three instances, it was almost two years until stocks broke down.
These types of relationships are never written in stone, but you can see why investors and economists alike are wary of the possibility of an inverted yield curve. If history is any indication, the two- to 10-year spread is worth watching for both an economic and stock market downturn.

1605,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 10:32AM ET</span>","Banks Stocks Look Great From 30,000 Feet. Less So, Up Close","(Bloomberg) -- For financial stocks, it’s a Street divided.
Buy them, say strategists, the securities industry’s pundit class, whose top-down dissections lean on economic and policy trends for inspiration. Banks and insurers are their most-favored trade for 2018, with nine of 10 tracked by Bloomberg giving it the highest recommendation.
On the other side are analysts who concentrate on individual companies -- and see little upside. Combined price estimates for hundreds of forecasters tracked by Bloomberg imply the S&P 500 Financials Index will rise less than 2 percent in the next year, the worst expected return among 11 industries.
Once again, a market bifurcation has President Donald Trump at its center. Underpinning strategists’ bullish predictions are a greater expectation for easier regulation, tax cuts, and higher interest rates. Analysts see slow loan growth, a slump in trading revenue and flat profit margins hindering the group. While the benefits of lower taxes may be real, few have have factored them into their models.
Investors are siding with strategists. As Trump’s tax plan gathered momentum and the Fed raised interest rates for a third time this year, banks have bumped technology shares from the market’s lead. Up 12 percent over the past three months, the group’s return is almost twice that of the S&P 500’s. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) were all higher in trading Monday before the open of exchanges.
“Analysts are too caught up in the minutia of a quarter, the minutia of margin, and loan growth,” David Ellison, a Boston-based money manager at Hennessy Advisors Inc., said by phone. “It’s not about earnings now. Earnings are fine. It’s not about credits. Credits are fine. It’s about the long-term reasons to be in the industry.”
A deciding factor in the bull case is the improving prospects of banks relative to other industries, particularly technology, Ellison said. With taxes poised to fall and interest rates heading higher, the balance is tilting unfavorably for tech companies that already enjoy some of the lowest effective tax rates.
Divergent views are on display within Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). David Kostin, the firm’s chief U.S. equity strategist, last month downgraded tech stocks, touting banks as one of his top picks.
A reduction in effective corporate tax rates to 23 percent would boost financial earnings by 8 percent while driving tech income down by 3 percent, Kostin estimated. Rising interest rates and easier regulation will also help profits, allowing financial firms to boost dividends and buybacks, he said.
Richard Ramsden, Goldman’s banking analyst, isn’t as enthused, at least based on his share-price forecasts. Among seven stocks he covers, four traded below his targets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“Analysts are underestimating potential upside,” Kostin wrote in a Friday note to clients. “We expect the sector will outperform current analyst expectations.”
Part of the divergence rests in the definition of the two groups’ jobs. Strategists are charged almost exclusively with predicting broad market performance, while analysts have a greater obligation to the nuts and bolts of individual businesses. As such, it’s harder for the latter group to incorporate a tax plan that is still winding through Congress.
With the Republicans’ tax bill close to being finalized, some analysts have started to study the impact of tax and regulatory reform. In a Dec. 6 note, Erika Najarian at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). said bank stocks could rise an additional 30 percent under a “blue sky” scenario where both tax cuts and easier regulation materialize by 2019.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG’s Susan Roth Katzke followed a few days later with a similar assessment, saying tax cuts would mean at least 10 percent more upside in price targets. All the estimates will be reviewed once the bill is signed, she said.

(Reuters) - CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Corp's shares fell 3 percent on Monday as the death of Chief Executive Hunter Harrison left investors worried about the No.3 U.S. railroad's turnaround plan under acting CEO Jim Foote.
CSX shares have risen about 48 percent this year and about 6 percent since March 6, the day Harrison took over the reins at the company.
Harrison, 73, a railway icon known for turning around railroad companies, was in the midst of an overhaul to boost profits at CSX.
CSX Chairman Edward Kelly said Harrison's death was due to unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness, calling it a major loss to the company.
The railroad company brushed off questions about whether the board had been slow to disclose Harrison's health problems.
Seen using an oxygen tank when meeting investors last month, Harrison's sudden medical leave was announced by the company on Thursday, sending its shares down about 10 percent on Friday.
In November, Harrison stopped short of laying out a succession plan for the company but said he was ""trying to stay back a little bit"" to give his management team space to steer through a major operations overhaul.
Acting CEO Foote has been with the company for just about two months, but is known to be well-versed with late Harrison's working style from a previous job.
""The board's greatest near-term challenge in building investor confidence is deepening CSX's bench following the changes in 4Q,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bascome Majors said in a note.
Foote's hiring was announced in late October following the resignation of prominent female executives Chief Operating Officer Cindy Sanborn and Chief Marketing Officer Fredrik Eliasson.
Foote told investors on Friday he believes the ""real heavy lifting has been done"" and there will be ""modifications and changes that we will make"".
""Even though Jim Foote is a capable leader we do not see him as the long-term solution as the CEO given his strength is marketing and the company is embarking on an operations focused turnaround,"" Cowen and Company analyst Jason Seidl said in a note.
Cowen analyst believes CSX's board will consider hiring current industry executives, especially those with a background in Harrison's pet ""precision scheduled railroading"" method to improve railroad efficiencies.
CSX has been dogged for months with customer complaints, persistent service issues and increased federal scrutiny.

The company's shares were marginally down at $52.58.

More than 400 planned flights to or from Atlanta were scrapped and another 86 were delayed, according to the FlightAware tracking service. 
The airport lost power on Sunday morning after what  Georgia Power  (N:GPJA) believes was an equipment failure and subsequent fire in an underground electrical facility. Power for essential activities was restored by 11.45 p.m., the utility company said.
By then, miserable would-be passengers had posted pictures and videos that were widely shared online of their confinement inside planes stuck outside darkened terminals as boredom and hunger mounted. They were all disembarked safely by about 10 p.m., nine hours after the outage began. More than 1,100 flights were canceled on Sunday.
Officials at the airport, which is run by the city of Atlanta, sought to mollify customers on Sunday with thousands of free meals, water and parking spots as power began to return.
While some stranded travelers found rooms in hotels, city authorities also provided shelter at the Georgia International Convention Center. 
Delta said customers whose travel was disrupted could make a one-time change to travel plans within certain guidelines. Other airlines also offered waivers for flight changes. Delta said its flight schedule in Atlanta was expected to return to normal by Monday afternoon. 

More than 100 million trips and connections began or ended at the airport in 2015, according to Airports Council International.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey has argued that Sky (L:SKYB) should fetch a higher price following Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) $52 billion deal with Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (O:FOXA), adding to shareholder disquiet about the fate of the European broadcaster.
Rupert Murdoch's Fox agreed last December to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for 10.75 pounds-a-share but the deal has been delayed by a regulatory review. 
Fox's existing 39 percent stake in Sky is now part of a wider package of film, television and international assets being sold to Disney, a deal that Odey believes demonstrates that Sky is being sold too cheaply.
If approved by regulators, Fox's takeover of Sky is expected to close by the end of next June, before the completion of the Disney acquisition. That means Mickey Mouse-owner Disney would acquire all of the UK company following its deal with Fox. 
""Basically, here is Fox being bought-out on 12 times cashflow,"" Odey, whose hedge fund is a 0.9 percent investor Sky company, told Reuters. ""If we [Sky shareholders] were being sold on 12 times cashflow we'd be at 12.30 pounds.""
Sky shares were up 0.6 percent at 10.24 pounds on Monday.
A spokesman for Sky declined to comment. Fox and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Disney's deal with Fox, announced on Dec. 14, adds another complication to the 11.7 billion-pound ($15.6 billion) Sky deal, which has already faced fierce criticism from British politicians and is being investigated by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. 
Odey, who had previously criticized the planned Fox deal, joins fellow small shareholder Polygon in questioning the takeover of the FTSE 100 company in the wake of the Disney deal.
TWIST IN THE TALE
The UK's Takeover Panel said last week that it had been told by Disney that the U.S. giant did not believe it should be forced to make an offer for Sky if Fox is blocked from buying out the remaining 61 percent by the regulator.
Disney would hold a 39 percent stake in Sky if the Fox acquisition of the broadcaster fails. 
Rule 9.1 of the Takeover Panel's code stipulates that an investor buying 30 percent or more of a listed company must automatically make an offer for the rest of the shares, although exemptions can be agreed by the watchdog. 
The Panel's executive said it was seeking the views of Sky's independent directors before making a decision on Disney.
""In the case of Disney/Fox, if Disney had agreed to buy the 39 percent Sky stake directly from Fox, minority shareholders in Sky would have been entitled to an increase in the 10.75 pounds-per-share price already being offered by Fox to the price being offered by Disney,"" Polygon said. 
Given that Disney is paying about 12 times 2017 and 2018 enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the Fox businesses, the hedge fund said that the price for Sky should be more than 13 pound-a-share.
""But the Fox and the Mouse have been more clever than that,"" Polygon said. 
""They have wrapped the Sky stake with a number of other attractive Fox assets and tied it up with a bow and ribbon and told the Takeover Panel that Rule 9.1 does not apply – and therefore that no premium is due to Sky's minority shareholders.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) has sold two of its iced tea brands in North America as the world's biggest food maker presses ahead with reshaping its business to focus on new trends and consumer healthcare.
Private equity firm Fireman Capital Partners said on Monday it has linked up with Dunn's River Brands to buy the Sweet Leaf Tea and Tradewinds businesses from Nestle North America.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Nestle, which is also looking to sell its U.S. confectionery business, declined to say if other sales within the drinks business were planned.
Nestle said the sale was part of its strategy of focusing on its core waters brands in North America, which include Poland Spring and Arrowhead.
""We took this difficult but important step to position us to further deliver upon our healthy hydration ambitions,"" a Nestle spokeswoman said.
""We are confident that these changes to our portfolio will allow us to sharpen our focus on legacy brands, while identifying new areas of growth and innovation.""
She declined to give the size of the business, but said tea was only a small part of the company's overall operations.
Under Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who took over this year, Nestle has embarked upon an overhaul of its brands and strategy as it seeks to overcome sluggish growth in its traditional businesses which has come under the spotlight from activist investors. 
In September, Schneider said the company was intensifying its focus on high-growth categories such as bottled water, coffee, pet care and infant nutrition. 
The Swiss company this month announced the purchase of Canadian vitamin maker Atrium Innovations for $2.3 billion, its fourth purchase in recent months.
It bought Sweet Earth vegetarian foods and Blue Bottle coffee in September and Chameleon Cold-Brew coffee in November as it adjusts to a market in which customers favor smaller, independent brands.
The maker of Gerber baby food, Purina pet food and Nescafe coffee came under pressure this year to improve returns from shareholder Third Point. It has since announced a share buyback and a margin target.
As well as making acquisitions, Nestle has also been trimming its operations including cutting jobs in its skin health business.

Nestle said in June it might sell its U.S. confectionery business, which includes regional mass-market brands such as Butterfinger, Crunch and 100 Grand and could be valued at around $2 billion.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] has appointed U.S. investment bank Citi to lead a $2 billion financing backed by Britain, sources familiar with the deal said.
The loan mandate will not be particularly lucrative, the sources said, but is seen by some banks as a way of getting closer to securing work on Aramco's planned initial public share offer, which may value the company at $2 trillion - a sum some prospective investors have said appears unrealistically high.
""Banks look at these kinds of operations for relationship purposes,"" said a source at a European export credit agency in the Middle East. ""This kind of loan is a bit of a test that Aramco makes on the market and given the name, there’s high competition among banks,"" he added.
The loan financing, announced in November, is guaranteed by UK Export Finance (UKEF), the British export credit agency, and will enable Saudi Aramco to buy British goods and services more easily. 
""UKEF is engaged in finalizing the operational arrangements regarding a significant finance facility with Saudi Aramco. UKEF’s support will take the form of a $2 billion guarantee on bank lending,"" said a UK government spokesperson in an emailed response to a request for comment, adding that Aramco would select the banks involved in the transaction. 
Aramco and Citi declined to comment.
Citi is keen to win a much-coveted role in the IPO, expected to raise $100 billion as soon as late 2018 and a cornerstone policy in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from its over-dependency on oil. 
One source said proposals were due on Wednesday for the IPO roles but banks without an established lending role did not expect to be successful.
""We can't get on their loans so we don't expect to get a mandate. It's really frustrating,"" said one banker who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
Earlier this year Aramco formally appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and HSBC to advise it on the listing alongside independent advisors Moelis and Evercore.

Citi also recently received an investment banking license for Saudi Arabia after more than a decade out of the kingdom.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Dutch high-frequency trader drifts in becalmed markets,"By Alasdair Pal
LONDON (Reuters) - This year's unusually quiet markets may have soothed the nerves of many investors, but for Dutch market-maker Flow Traders (AS:FLOW) the lack of volatility spells bad news. 
The trading house, based in the fashionable Eastern Docklands area of Amsterdam, sold shares to the public in 2015 after honing a form of high-frequency trading of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and their underlying stocks in Europe and elsewhere. Bigger market gyrations meant bigger profits, the company says. 
But stock indices across the world have calmly hit multi-year highs in 2017, with little of the volatility that has characterised previous rallies. The Euro Stoxx Volatility index (V2TX) and the VIX index (VIX) tracking volatility in U.S. stocks are both near all-time lows. 
Shares in Flow Traders have fallen 38 percent year-to-date to an all-time low as its profits were depressed by a lack of market activity. 
(Graphic: Flow Traders' share price has tracked volatility lower - http://reut.rs/2kwTZeo)
Several analysts have cut their earnings expectations for the company in recent months, and are questioning whether the continued lack of market volatility will hurt business even more. 
UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) all downgraded the stock in September and October, no longer recommending its clients buy the shares. 
“With equity market volatility at decade-low levels, and little sign of recovery in the near future, Flow Traders’ revenues will remain depressed due to lower ETF trading activity,” UBS analyst Michael Werner said in a note. 
Investors too, have turned more cautious.
“At the time it was a reasonably attractive opportunity (to play) the rise of the ETF,” said Will James, a fund manager at  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Investments who sold his holding in Flow Traders in June. 
“When the investment case doesn’t come through or is proved to be wrong then we are quite happy to take a view we got it wrong and move on.” 
Flow Traders, which has annual revenue of around 350 million euros ($410 million) and some 300 employees, is confident volatility will pick up in 2018 and it can maintain its dominant position in Europe, where it accounts for around 20 percent of ETF trading. 
“Periods of relative quietness give us time to work on our business model more,” Chief Financial Officer Marcel Jongmans told Reuters. “What we have shown during the last few quarters is that we grow our market share.”
But it will take more than a spike in volatility to regain favor, Werner said: “We think earnings will have to improve before investors regain interest.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU state aid regulators will investigate whether Swedish furniture retailer Ikea's [IKEA.UL] tax arrangement with the Netherlands helped cut its tax bill - the latest crackdown on unfair tax deals between multinationals and EU countries.
The European Commission said on Monday it was looking into two tax rulings issued to Inter Ikea, which operates Ikea's franchise business and collects a fee of 3 percent of turnover from all Ikea shops via subsidiary Inter Ikea Systems in the Netherlands.
""All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax. Member states cannot let selected companies pay less tax by allowing them to artificially shift their profits elsewhere,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The Commission said the first tax ruling, which covered 2006 to 2011, resulted in a significant part of Inter Ikea Systems' franchise profits shifting to a Luxembourg unit where it was not taxed.
A 2011 ruling, brought in after the Commission declared the first deal illegal, allowed a substantial part of the company's franchise profits after 2011 to be transferred to its Liechtenstein parent.
Inter Ikea said it and Inter Ikea Systems were committed to paying tax in line with the laws of the countries in which they operate and it believed that the way it had been taxed was in accordance with EU rules.
Fast food chain McDonald’s (N:MCD) and French energy company Engie (PA:ENGIE) are also in the EU crosshairs over their Luxembourg tax deals.
The Commission has to date ordered Apple (O:AAPL) to pay a record amount of back taxes up to 13 billion euros ($15.3 billion) to Ireland, Starbucks (O:SBUX) up to 30 million euros to the Netherlands and Amazon (O:AMZN) 250 million euros to Luxembourg.
Belgium has been told to recover a total of 700 million euros from 35 firms, among them  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI),  BP  (L:BP) and BASF (DE:BASFn) because of an illegal tax scheme.

Last month the Commission launched an investigation into a British tax exemption for multinational companies set up in 2013 by the then-Conservative-led government to attract companies to set up headquarters in Britain. ($1 = 0.8482 euros)

(Reuters) - California homeowners and regulators have a new fear about wildfires ravaging the state: that insurers will drop coverage.
Massive, out-of-season fires in northern and southern California are causing billions of dollars in claims and challenging expectations of when and where to expect blazes. State law gives insurers more leeway to drop coverage than to raise rates, and some are taking the opportunity, concerning California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones.
Homes in the Sierra Nevada foothills were dropped after wildfires swept through the region in recent years, and some other Northern California homes also have been cut from rosters, Jones said.
""We may see more of it,"" he added in an interview. Insurers must renew fire victims' policies once, but after that homeowners could be driven to unusual, expensive policies.
Retired firefighter Dan Nichols of Oroville, California was surprised when Liberty Mutual dropped his coverage this year, following a wildfire in the region. 
""I was shocked and angry,"" said Nichols, 70, by email.
Liberty Mutual must ""responsibly manage"" its overall exposure to California's wildfires as part of a strategy to safeguard its ability to pay homeowners' claims, a spokesman said. The insurer still issues policies in California and its strategy is not in response to recent fires, he said.
Nichols found a better deal through AAA, but others are not as lucky. In San Andreas, a community northeast of San Francisco, homeowners typically use specialty insurers, known as ""surplus lines carriers,"" for policies that cost about 20 to 40 percent more than a mainstream insurer, said Fred Gerard, who owns an insurance agency in the area.
Insurers must be cautious by not covering too many homes in one area, said Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the industry's Insurance Information Institute. ""They tend to spread their risk so they can pay claims,"" Ruiz said.
COMPUTER MODELS
Drier weather and higher variability of weather patterns often seen as effects of climate change have led insurers to turn to new computer models that provide house-by-house predictions of risk, using factors such as local topography and brush cover, a change from past practices that were based on a region's history of blazes.
""Relying solely on company history leaves many (insurers) exposed,"" said Matt Nielsen, Senior Director, Global Governmental and Regulatory Affairs at modeler RMS. A new wave of models coming out next year will ""revolutionize the way insurers understand and manage risk for wildfires,"" he said.
""You can't control mother nature, but you can identify her target zones,"" wrote rival  Verisk Analytics Inc  (NASDAQ:VRSK) in a brochure for its FireLine model. 
Jones said the state was reviewing the new models, partly in light of drier weather conditions, more frequent, unpredictable and severe fires, and climate change.
A California poll by consumer advocacy group United Policyholders found that computer scoring was a reason for a significant number of policy cancellations in the last few years.
United Policyholders Executive Director Amy Bach said that the differences in scores generated by various models raised questions about their accuracy.

""We want to make sure it's a fair system,"" Bach said.

Thales' chief executive Patrice Caine made his move just days after Gemalto had knocked back a 4.3 billion euro offer from French rival Atos (PA:ATOS).
Thales shares surged 7.81 percent to 93 euros at 0952 GMT, while Amsterdam-listed Gemalto's shares were up 5.47 percent at 49.38 euros, just below Thales' 51 euro per share basic offer. 
The planned merger highlights the increasingly blurred lines between industrial and software companies as they try to grab a share of the fast-growing digital security market. 
""In terms of DNA, the two companies look much more alike,"" said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co. 
""It's not a financial deal, which was the case for Atos. They gave it a try, it was opportunistic.""
The takeover ends a difficult year for Gemalto, which has made a series of profit warnings that hurt its shares and overshadowed its attempt to shift from a slowing market for phone SIM cards toward security services such as data encryption and biometric passports.
""Our intention is to keep all of the assets in Gemalto's portfolio,"" Caine said in a call with analysts, suggesting that SIM card operations remained core alongside Gemalto's growing focus on cybersecurity.
Thales forecast that Gemalto's revenues would grow 5 percent annually and said it expected Gemalto's EBIT margin to exceed its own within two or three years of the merger.
Under the deal, unanimously recommended by the boards of both companies, Thales will merge its digital assets with Gemalto to create a business headed by Gemalto CEO Philippe Vallee.
Vallee on Monday said he would stick to a plan to cut 288 jobs in its struggling SIM card business in France. 
""This plan is maintained,"" he told BFM business radio, adding that he would try to redeploy staff internally where possible.
Caine later told a news conference that Gemalto's staff would have the opportunity to get jobs at Naval Group, part of Thales.
Atos said it would not engage in a bidding war but would be open to further discussions with Gemalto should the Thales deal collapse.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 06:51AM ET</span>",Thai beer magnate extends SE Asia push with $4.8 billion Sabeco deal,"By Mai Nguyen and Anshuman Daga
Ho CHI MINH CITY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thai Beverage (SI:TBEV) has won an auction to buy a majority stake worth $4.84 billion in Vietnam's top brewer Sabeco (HM:SAB), a lofty deal that adds a major asset to the beer-to-property empire of Thai magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.
The deal is a big step for Charoen, the son of a Bangkok street vendor, who is emerging as one of Asia's biggest power players in brewing. He dominates his home market with Chang beer and owns Singapore's Fraser and Neave Ltd (SI:FRNM). The Sabeco stake will give him control of brands like Saigon Beer and 333.
The Sabeco deal will also help Thai Beverage (Thai Bev) tap into Vietnam's beer market, worth about $6.48 billion last year, where a young population and booming economy are an attractive lure, despite political resistance, a high minimum bid price and a cap on foreign ownership.
Thai Bev's local unit, Vietnam Beverage Co Ltd, was named winner of the 54 percent Sabeco stake on offer at the auction on Monday after global brewing groups stayed away. It barely had any competition as the other investor, a Vietnamese individual, bid for only 0.003 percent.
Late on Sunday, Singapore-listed Thai Bev had said that the Vietnamese unit had submitted the registration form to participate in the bidding.
Vietnam Beverage is owned by Vietnam F&B Alliance Investment Company, which is 49-percent owned by BeerCo Limited - an indirect but wholly-owned unit of Thai Bev, official documents about the companies showed.
""We are very grateful for the opportunity to participate in the future of Sabeco,"" a legal representative for Vietnam Beverage told reporters after the auction. 
The government had set a minimum sale price of 320,000 dong or $14.1 per share for Sabeco, formally known as  Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp , whose shares have jumped almost three fold to 309,200 dong since its listing a year ago.
That priced the target at about 36 times core earnings, more than double the trading multiples for global peers, indicating Charoen had to pay a hefty premium to secure the prize.
""We see this as an example of a successful equitization process,"" said Fiachra Mac Cana, head of research at Ho Chi Minh City Securities. ""The sums involved are huge and this is also good news for government coffers at the end of the year."" 
Thai Bev, controlled by Charoen, was keen to buy Sabeco in a bid to expand outside its home market, sources told Reuters. 
Sabeco's foreign ownership is capped at 49 percent. With 10 percent already in foreign hands, only 39 percent was on the table for overseas buyers at Monday's auction. Local bidders could bid for a majority stake of up to 54 percent.  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) holds a 5 percent stake.
""DISCONNECT""
Reuters previously reported the auction was drawing interest from brewing groups such as  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), Kirin Holdings (T:2503), Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502) and San Miguel (PS:SMC), but in the end they all stayed away.
""There's a disconnect between what the government wants to achieve and how international brewers view this auction,"" said one person familiar with the matter.
""In a normal auction, bidders are fully aware of what stake they'll end up owning and bid for it accordingly,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak to the media.
Unlike similar sales in developed markets, where investors are whittled down over several rounds and offers can be adjusted, Sabeco bidders needed to submit a single offer for a specific number of shares in a sealed envelope in one round.
Truong Thanh Hoai, an official at Vietnam's trade ministry, said there was a level playing field for bidders in the auction, but added the price on offer was not attractive for everyone.
""Some investors see Sabeco fitting with their business philosophy and they can exploit its potential, while some others don't see it as a fit and feel they can't make a profit from the amount of capital they're paying, so they don't participate. ""
Charoen, who has shown an adept hand at cultivating ties with governments, started trading and supplying distilleries in the 1960s and was able obtain concessions to produce liquor at a time when production was under strict state control. 
The Thai King bestowed a royal name on the family in 1988, recognizing service to the country.
In Vietnam, Charoen already owns nearly 20 percent of the country's biggest-listed firm Vinamilk (HM:VNM) through Fraser & Neave. He has also acquired the Metro supermarket chain as well as other consumer goods and convenient stores in the country.
The current deal, however, looks expensive, a Singapore-based financial source said, but could bear fruit if Thai Bev had come to certain agreements with its Vietnamese partners.
""These multiples only make sense if there is a concession available,"" said the source, adding there would likely be job cuts and re-allocation of employees from Sabeco to other state firms, helping Thai Bev improve efficiencies.
Still, getting the firm in line with rivals' valuations would be tough, said the person, who did not want to be named due to rules on talking to media.
""He would have to double EBITDA to get the multiple below 20 times. That's where the highest global peers are trading.""

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 06:20AM ET</span>","Teva Pharm woes seen denting Israeli exports, economic growth","By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's export-dependent economy is expected to take a hit from planned job cuts and plant closures at its largest company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TA:TEVA), but overall growth should stay strong.
Teva (N:TEVA), the world's largest generic drugmaker, accounts for as much as 3 percent of Israeli economic output, according to economists. Teva, along with Israel Chemicals ( ICL ) (TA:ICL) and Intel's (O:INTC) Israel plants, accounts for close to half of industrial exports.
As such, Teva's announcement that it planned to slash its global workforce by a quarter, or 14,000 jobs -- 1,700 of those in Israel -- has caused concern, especially since ICL and Intel's exports have slipped in recent years.
""We intend to reduce our (Israeli) export and GDP forecasts for next year,"" said Bank Leumi chief economist Gil Bufman. ""In terms of GDP, it will mark down forecasts in 2018 by 0.3 percentage point. But it won't completely derail the economy.""
Israel's economy is poised to grow around 3 percent this year and economists had expected a faster rate of at least 3.5 percent in 2018. But Bufman believes it will be between 3 and 3.5 percent.
Over the first 11 months of 2017, pharmaceutical exports -- which are mostly Teva -- rose to $6.8 billion from $6.3 billion in the same period in 2016, although monthly pharmaceutical exports have slipped by 40 percent since peaking in August, government data showed.
Not only will Israel's exports be reduced by plant closings, Teva also sells to the domestic market and there is a multiplier effect of smaller companies selling to Teva, economists noted.
Exports make up more than 30 percent of Israel's economic growth, but industrial exports excluding diamonds -- $44 billion in 2016 -- have shrunk to around 16 percent of that. 
Fast-growing services such as those in the high-tech sector, which provide more added value and are less dependent on currency effects, are 14 percent of Israeli exports.
Even before the mass-layoffs were announced, financial woes at Teva worried policymakers at the Bank of Israel. Minutes of an Aug. 29 rates decision showed that committee members discussed developments at Teva.
""The developments won’t create a macroeconomic impact in the short term, but in the long term there will likely be some negative impact on exports and on GDP,"" the minutes said.
One potential silver lining for Teva, economists said, is that most of its laid-off employees in Israel would ultimately find new jobs. Between September and November, the number of job vacancies jumped an annualized 13.8 percent, based on trend data issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics on Sunday.
With a jobless rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter, Israel's labor market is deemed at or close to full employment -- but with excess demand for labor.

""The economy is poised nicely to absorb most of these workers that are laid off,"" said Jonathan Katz, chief economist at Leader Capital Markets. ""So the impact on the general growth picture should be minimal.""

BMW will assist in advancing Solid Power's technology to achieve performance levels required for high-performance EVs, Louisville, Colorado-based Solid Power said in a statement.
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
All solid-state battery technology is a high-capacity energy storage device that improves on today's lithium-ion batteries, replacing the liquid or gel-form electrolyte with a solid, conductive material. Among other benefits, the new technology offers more capacity and better safety.
Carmakers are trying to lower the cost of electric vehicles by investing in the development of affordable but powerful batteries. 
Established in 2012, Solid Power says its solid-state rechargeable batteries could lower costs because of the potential for eliminating many of the costly safety features associated with lithium-ion systems.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which has called the technology a ""game changer"" for EVs, plans to commercialize solid-state batteries and roll out an electric vehicle in the early 2020s powered by them.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",EU agrees new five-year mandate for German chair of bank watchdog SRB,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Monday to renew the mandate of Elke Koenig, the German head of the European Union's body in charge of disposing of failing banks, for another five years.
Koenig, who has chaired the Single Resolution Board (SRB) since its creation in 2014, currently has a three-year mandate that expires in December.
The decision to extend her term was formalized by EU governments on Monday after the European Commission and the European Parliament had backed the move.
Koenig has this year overseen the first wind-down of a euro zone bank under new rules aimed at reducing taxpayers' costs when lenders fail.
The SRB's decision, together with the EU Commission, to force the sale of Spain's ailing Banco Popular to rival Santander (MC:SAN) in June has sparked a record number of lawsuits from bondholders who have seen their investment wiped out in the process.
The decision also erased shareholdings but avoided a full liquidation of the bank and spared depositors. It was deemed a ""success"" by EU regulators.
A few weeks after winding down Banco Popular, the SRB decided not to intervene in the rescue of two smaller Italian banks from the Veneto region, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca.
The decision allowed the Italian government to provide state aid to the two lenders with laxer conditions than in an SRB rescue, prompting accusations that EU banking rules were being applied inconsistently. 
The SRB said it had declined to intervene because the banks were small and did not pose risks to the euro zone's financial stability. 

Koenig has also championed strict capital requirements for the 142 major euro zone banks under her watch to make sure they hold sufficient buffers that could be written off, or bailed-in, if they collapse.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 05:50AM ET</span>",German Vonovia climbs property ladder with $6.1 billion Buwog deal,"By Arno Schuetze and Maria Sheahan
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Vonovia (DE:VNAn), Germany's biggest residential property company, has agreed to buy Austrian counterpart Buwog (VI:BWOA) in a cash deal valuing the latter at 5.2 billion euros ($6.12 billion), the two companies said on Monday.
The deal will increase the size of Vonovia's portfolio to almost 400,000 flats from around 350,000 now and increase sharply its capacity for building new housing.
Buwog's share price was up 17.2 percent at 28.84 euros by 1008 GMT, slightly below the offer price of 29.05 euros per share.
Shares in Vonovia were flat, having risen 40 percent over the last year on increasing demand for housing in Europe's largest economy. 
Housing prices in Germany - relatively cheap compared with other European countries in the past - have spiked in recent years, prompting the Bundesbank to warn about the risk of a dangerous bubble developing earlier this year.
Average real estate prices in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt have increased by more than 60 percent since 2010, the Bundesbank estimates, reflecting solid growth, low unemployment and low borrowing costs.
The housing shortage had played a role in the run-up to Germany's parliamentary election in September.
""Politicians have voiced the legitimate request that we build more apartments,"" Vonovia Chief Executive Rolf Buch said.
The deal will help Vonovia intensify its construction activities, building on Buwog's extensive expertise in property development, he said, adding that the company will double its target of newly built apartments to 4,000 annually. 
Buwog CEO Daniel Riedl said that Buwog owns land on which 10,000 flats can be built, two thirds of which would likely be sold on after completion.
Buwog shareholders are to be offered 29.05 euros per share under the offer, an 18.1 percent premium to Friday's closing price, which Vonovia plans to finance with debt.
Buch said that the valuation was in line with that of comparable deals such as Unibail-Rodamco's (AS:UNBP) acquisition of shopping mall operator Westfield (AX:WFD) and Vonovia's own past deals.
Analysts at brokerage Baader said that the offer price was reasonable, adding that the move was not completely surprising as Buwog has been seen as a takeover target for some time.
The deal reverses Vonovia's strategy in Austria, where it had initially planned to sell its operations. While 55 percent of Buwog's property is located in German cities including Berlin and Hamburg, the rest is in Austria in cities such as Vienna, Graz and Klagenfurt.
Buch said that the companies did not expect major antitrust concerns as the market is still fragmented with Vonovia having a market share of only 2 percent.
Vonovia said it expected joint management of the two companies' flats following the deal would lead to cost savings of around 30 million euros a year, a substantial part of which is to be realized by the end of 2019.
The deal will also have a positive effect on Vonovia's underlying earnings per share and adjusted net asset value per share, Vonovia said.
Buwog will remain as a separate brand within Vonovia and keep its stock market listing.
Further details of the offer are to be announced in February, when the bid will be officially launched.
JP Morgan (N:JPM), Kempen, Victoria Partners and Freshfields advised Vonovia on the deal, while Buwog worked with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and Schoenherr.

Activist hedge fund manager TCI Fund Management, run by Hohn, is unhappy with Brydon's handling of the succession of Xavier Rolet, the LSE's former chief executive.
TCI is expected to lose the vote at the general shareholder meeting being held in London at 1200 GMT on Tuesday after a series of heavyweight investors came out in favor of Brydon.
Shareholder  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) will vote against the motion, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
Standard Life Aberdeen joins large LSE shareholders Qatar Investment Authority, BlackRock and  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors in saying they will vote against the motion.
TCI does not expect to pass the resolution to oust Brydon at the shareholder meeting and will send a representative, the source close to the firm told Reuters. 
Shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services have recommended shareholders vote against removing Brydon. 
But rival advisory firm PIRC has recommended shareholders abstain, describing the LSE board's handling of the succession as a ""major failure of board leadership"". 
Standard Life Aberdeen is a top-100 investor in the LSE with a 0.07 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon.
A majority of votes cast at the meeting would be needed for TCI's resolution to pass.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday, with merger and acquisition activity in focus and investor sentiment buoyed by expectations that a U.S. tax bill could soon pass.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) rose 8.4 percent after the French aerospace and defense company agreed to buy chipmaker  Gemalto  (AS:GTO) for 4.8 billion euros. Gemalto shares rose 5.4 percent. 
""It's a healthy premium and it looks like the sort of deal the Gemalto board will be happy with,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. 
Analysts at UBS said the deal would help Thales accelerate its strategy toward digital technologies and lift its earnings.
Both stocks were among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index, which rose 0.9 percent to its highest in nearly six weeks. 
Euro zone blue chips (STOXX50E) added 1.1 percent and the UK's FTSE (FTSE) rose 0.5 percent. 
 Unilever  (L:ULVR) slipped 0.2 percent after the consumer goods group agreed to sell its margarine and spreads business to U.S. private equity firm KKR for 6.8 billion euros to concentrate on faster-growing products.
Baader Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said the deal was expected and its terms roughly in line in expectations.
""Nevertheless, it is a further positive step that underpins management is delivering on promises and accelerated total shareholder returns,"" he wrote in a note.
Also in M&A news, German real estate group Vonovia (DE:VNAn) agreed to buy peer Buwog (VI:BWOA) in a cash deal valuing it at 5.2 billion euros and sending the Austrian firm's shares up 17 percent to the top of the STOXX 600. 
Among outstanding fallers, IG Group (L:IGG) was down 9 percent after the European Union's securities watchdog proposed curbs on core parts of its market.

""We sense things will get more difficult and there is more bad news coming through. It's hard for them to compete in the shift online,"" said Beauchamp.
Sales at the fashion chain unexpectedly fell in the past quarter as it attracted fewer shoppers to its stores, underlining its struggle to adapt to a shift to online retail.
The STOXX is up more than 7 percent so far this year and remains below a two-year peak hit at the start of November on profit taking and resurfacing worries over political risks in the region. 
Sentiment was supported on Monday by expectations that U.S. lawmakers will pass a tax bill in the coming days or early next year.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 05:00AM ET</span>","Workers at Israel's Teva Pharm block roads, continue protest over job cuts","By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Workers at Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TA:TEVA) protested pending job cuts for a second straight day on Monday, blocking roads and shutting down a number of the drugmaker's plants nationwide.
Hundreds of Teva (N:TEVA) employees, many wearing white lab coats, blocked the road and entrance to the finance ministry in Jerusalem, where union leaders were set to meet with finance and economy ministry officials and Teva representatives.
Debt-ridden Teva, the world's largest generics drugmaker, said last week it would cut its global workforce by more than a quarter, or 14,000 jobs, including 1,700 in Israel where it will also close a manufacturing site. The plans have angered unions and politicians, who believe employees should not pay for the company's failed investments abroad.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that he planned to meet with Teva CEO Kare Schultz this week to try and minimize the impact on staff, after thousands of workers belonging to public sector unions staged a half-day strike on Sunday to show solidarity with Teva workers. The strike forced closure of Ben-Gurion airport, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and all government ministries. 
Teva is one of the biggest employers in Israel. Avi Nissenkorn, head of the Histadrut, the umbrella organization for all public sector unions, said ""job cuts were a last resort"" and called on the government to minimize harm to workers and ensure Teva's plants remain in Israel.
Workers at Teva Medical blocked an entrance to the port city of Ashdod and the company's headquarters, and two other plants were shutdown. At its Jerusalem plant, hundreds of workers have been holed up since Sunday and the facility was likely to remain closed on Monday.
At a plant in Kfar Saba, 250 staff planned to stop work between 1200 p.m and 4 p.m (1000-1400 GMT) while protests will take place throughout the day at other Teva facilities, according to Histadrut.
The layoffs stem from Teva taking on $35 billion in debt to acquire Allergan’s (N:AGN)  Actavis  generic drug business for $40.5 billion last year, a move that coincided with rapidly declining generic drug prices in the United States and the start of competition to its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.
Under a two-year restructuring plan, Teva plans to reduce its cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019, from an estimated $16.1 billion for 2017.

(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) said that it hit its 2017 target to deliver 66 F-35 fighter jets to the U.S. and its allies last week, despite production problems as the defense contractor built 40 percent more jets this year.
In September and October, the U.S. Defense Department halted shipments of F-35s for 30 days after a production error allowed corrosion to form around fasteners attaching body panels to the airframe.
It was the latest of several production issues that have arisen in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program.
The F-35 is key for Lockheed, accounting for about a quarter of its total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed's aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, pulled higher by F-35 sales.
""I definitely see growth opportunities for the F-35 program and expect the program to grow much like the F-16 did, as countries look to recapitalize their fighter fleets,"" said Jeff Babione, the head of Lockheed's F-35 program.
The governments of Belgium, Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and others have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet as potential new customers. 
In Canada, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned in 2015 on a promise not to buy the F-35 fighter, saying it was too expensive.
But last week, in a move that could ultimately benefit Lockheed, Trudeau's government scrapped plans to buy 18  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Super Hornets and made clear the company would not win a contract for 88 jets unless it dropped a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb).
The U.S. and its allies are negotiating an annual purchase of a batch of 141 planes. As of Friday, they had more than 265 of the jets already flying.
In order to meet its planned growth to a fleet of more than 3,000 jets worldwide, the company has hired more than 1,300 of a planned 1,800 workers at its Fort Worth, Texas factory. There are also assembly facilities in Japan run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) and Italy, run by Leonardo (MI:LDOF).
The company is scheduled to deliver about 90 jets next year and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker aims to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.
Lockheed shares hit an all-time high of $323.38 on Friday, capping an almost 250 percent run over the last five years and showing that investors expect steady and strong profit growth from the world's biggest defense contractor. 
PRODUCTION DELAYS 
Despite the consistent growth, the F-35 has been widely criticized for being too expensive, including by U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials, who have also pointed to numerous production delays and cost overruns. 
A quarter of the operating F-35 fleet was temporarily grounded this year because of problems with pilots' oxygen supplies. 
The U.S. Government Accountability Office also published a report this year detailing a shortage of spare parts that could plague the F-35 program for several years.
The supply chain is already working at peak capacity.

Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners, including  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC), United Technologies Corp's (N:UTX) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (L:BAES), have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 01:40AM ET</span>","To thwart Amazon, Kroger and Walmart lure shoppers with curbside pickup","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As Amazon.com looks to upend the U.S. grocery market with home delivery, some veteran supermarket operators are betting on a different strategy: curbside pickup. Americans have long loved the convenience of drive-through service for burgers and coffee.  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) are tweaking that formula for groceries. 
The companies have invested heavily in online systems that allow customers to order ahead from their neighborhood store. Workers pick and pack the products, then run them out to shoppers in the parking lot, the grocery version of carry out pizza. For the retailers, the service is cheaper than delivery, because customers do the driving. For shoppers, it means skipping crowds and queues at their local market, and no worries about missing packages or melted ice cream if they are not at home to meet the delivery guy. 
Tony Sacco, who lives in the Los Angeles beach community of Playa Del Rey, is a regular user of the service at a nearby Ralphs supermarket, owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger. Each pickup costs $6.95, but the time-crunched married father of three says it is worth it. 
""This is easy. Time is money,"" said Sacco, 47, as a worker loaded bags into his SUV on a recent morning. 
Retaining customers like Sacco is critical for traditional grocery retailers as they battle an array of upstarts bent on turning groceries into the next home-delivery juggernaut. 
New entrants such as meal-kit company Blue Apron and organic food seller Thrive Market are peeling off coveted slices of their business. Amazon (O:AMZN), the nation's largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.
(For a graphic on U.S. online grocery sales, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2kwT9OU) 
But even mighty Amazon has struggled with the trickiest part of the trade: delivering fresh produce, meat, dairy and other perishables. Its AmazonFresh service started more than a decade ago, but has yet to make a major mark. 
Amazon is making another run at it with its $13.7 billion purchase of upscale grocery chain Whole Foods earlier this year. Amazon has said little about its plans. But analysts expect it will use Whole Foods' 450 locations as distribution hubs for home delivery, opening a new front in its campaign to disrupt the $700-billion U.S. grocery industry. 
Old-line players are responding with some new moves of their own. Kroger and Walmart are experimenting with delivery. But they are wagering that pickup is the true sweet spot in the industry's online evolution. Both are rolling out the service in thousands of their stores. 
""The way people are going to shop for groceries is going to be curbside, not delivery,"" said Jason Goldberg, a senior vice president at digital marketing firm SapientRazorfish. 
Amazon, too, is eyeing that channel. AmazonFresh has already tested pickup in Seattle and analysts expect Whole Foods to do the same. 
Nevertheless, researcher Packaged Facts says traditional retailers can win with real estate: ""Companies such as Walmart and Kroger have the advantage, because they already have stores all over the country in both urban and rural settings,"" it said in a recent report. 
CLICK AND COLLECT 
Kroger bought its way into pickup with its 2014 purchase of southeast grocer Harris Teeter, which had an established program. 
That same year, Kroger debuted its own offering, known as ClickList, adding features such as coupons and promotions based on detailed customer data. 
Pickup is now available at 1,000 of the chain's 2,800 stores and the company is adding the service at 400 to 500 locations a year, according to Matt Thompson, the vice president of ClickList. 
He said curbside customers spend 40 percent to 60 percent more than traditional shoppers, because they tend to stock up on bulky items such as bottled water. Users pay $4.95 to $6.95 for each order depending on their location. Kroger would not disclose how many shoppers use ClickList. It promotes the service in stores and online, while customers spread the word through social media. 
Users log into ClickList online. They put items into digital carts, pay and reserve a pickup time at least four hours in advance.
The order is sent to a terminal in a store's dedicated ClickList room, where ""pickers"" are dispatched with handheld devices that tell them exactly where to find each item. These workers bag the products and put them into labeled bins; perishables are kept in a nearby freezer or fridge. When customers pull into designated pickup parking spaces, they are directed to call a number to alert a ClickList staffer, who wheels the bags to their cars. 
Kroger gave Reuters a tour of its ClickList operation at a Ralphs supermarket in Los Angeles' Westchester neighborhood in late November. 
Miguel Lopez, who leads the ClickList team there, said it takes about 30 minutes to pick a $100 order; a $400 order takes an hour. The team tracks progress on a white board that showed weekly progress since the service debuted in January. The number of daily orders ranged from 13 to 36. Sales for the week Reuters visited, which included Thanksgiving Day, were on pace to hit a record of more than $12,000.
Analysts say typical Kroger stores have annual sales of around $30 million, excluding gasoline.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Shane Higgins said pickup already accounts for over 5 percent of sales in some locations. 
Kroger declined to comment on the overall performance of ClickList but acknowledged costs are initially higher for pickup orders because of the additional labor involved. Company executives said increasing sales and efficiency can virtually eliminate that gap in as little as three years. 
Another challenge to profitability is that pickup customers are not tempted by in-store impulse items. But the biggest risk, analysts say, is to do nothing and let customers drift to competitors that offer the service.
Shopper Kimberlee Isaacs says ClickList has kept her loyal to the Westchester Ralphs, where she drops $800 a month on groceries for her family of three. 
""We use it every single week. I don't go into the store unless I forgot something,"" Isaacs, 50, said. 
COMING ON STRONG
Meanwhile, Walmart, the nation's top grocery seller, aims to add free curbside pickup at 1,000 stores next year, bringing the total to 2,100 of its 4,700 U.S. locations. It declined to discuss profitability of the service. But spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company decided to expand it quickly based on encouraging results. Pickup is winning converts such as Hudson, Florida shopper Steve Mondock, who had previously shunned Walmart. 
""I hated the crowds, I hated the parking,"" said Mondock, 55, who now buys most of his basics there.
Virtually every food retailer is now testing or adding pickup, including Publix, HEB, Meijer and Safeway.  Target  Corp (N:TGT), which just bought delivery company Shipt, is testing drive up for non-perishable groceries and other items. 

""That's why you want to be early so you can capture someone else's customers,"" said Loop Capital analyst Andrew Wolf.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 12:20AM ET</span>",Japanese prosecutors raid more firms over maglev train contracts,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors on Monday raided the offices of two of the country's biggest construction firms as they expanded an investigation into suspected collusion over contracts for an $80 billion high-speed magnetic levitation (maglev) train line.
Investigators entered the offices of Shimizu Corp (T:1803) and Kajima Corp (T:1812) in Tokyo on Monday, spokesmen for the two companies said, in the latest scandal to hit corporate Japan following revelations of data fraud at major manufacturers.
The raids by prosecutors and anti-trust agency officials come a week after officials launched an investigation into Obayashi Corp (T:1802), another construction company, for suspected bid-rigging in maglev-related contracts.
While the scope of the probe broadened on Monday the scale of the suspected wrongdoing remained unknown and prosecutors declined to comment.
Kajima shares plunged as much as 4.6 percent and Shimizu shares fell as much as 3.7 percent on news of the raids, while the Nikkei 225 index was 1.5 percent higher.
Shares of Taisei Corp (T:1801), another member of the so-called ""big four"" group of Japanese construction firms involved in the maglev project, were also down 2 percent although a spokesman said it had not been raided. 
Japan’s large and politically influential construction industry has been a frequent source of scandals such as bid-rigging.
Legislation has been tightened in recent years to prevent collusion over contract bids, and Obayashi in 2006 required managers to sign a pledge to abide by antitrust laws. The next year, however, the firm’s top management resigned following a public works scandal.
Backed by cheap government loans and running in addition to Japan's extensive bullet train network, the maglev project linking Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka has drawn criticism for its cost and lack of export potential. 
Proponents led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe say the project will spark badly needed economic growth.
The big four contractors have won roughly an equal number of orders for about 70 percent of the projects, according to Japanese media reports.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 10:10PM ET</span>",Latecomers lose out as Nikkei's 18 percent rally surprises the unwary,"By Tomo Uetake
TOKYO (Reuters) - An 18 percent rally in Tokyo stocks since September caught some global investors badly under-invested in Japanese shares - and too late to cash in on the second best-performing major market this quarter.
They failed to anticipate that synchronized global economic growth, higher corporate earnings, and a market underpinned by political stability and expansionary monetary policy would drive growth quite as forcefully as it has. 
Many investors are turning bullish, Reuters learned from interviews with 10 European and U.S. asset managers over November to December, but some international long-only funds have yet to jump on the bandwagon because popular stocks are already highly priced.
""If you look around globally, there are still many investors who have missed the timing to buy because it was such a rapid rise,"" said Takashi Maruyama, chief investment officer Japan at Fidelity International, referring to the rally that started in mid-September. 
Goldman Sachs' data, via a sampling of 44 global equity funds, mostly U.S. mutuals, shows that their Japan exposure is 4-7 percent underweight versus the MSCI EAFE index at the end of September. 
""They probably have bought some shares since then, but have not yet reached neutral,"" said Kathy Matsui, vice chair and chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Japan. ""While they were underweight Japan, the market rallied more than those in their home countries - painful for those who under-invested. The so-called 'pain trade' has prompted recent massive buying by foreigners.""
Global investors' appetite for Japanese stocks ebbed after the initial excitement over the government's expansionary 'Abenomics' policies faded in 2015 and as other markets, such as emerging markets and Europe, appeared to offer better opportunities.
But an uptick in the global economy in recent months has improved Japan Inc's earnings outlook while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's election victory in October is expected to cement a few more years of political stability and easy monetary policy.
""Japan stands out as a calm area. The political backdrop looks a lot less certain in many other alternative equity markets. So I think investors will continue to like the Japanese market and you will continue to see flows,"" said Rod Paris, Aberdeen Standard Investments' chief investment officer.
Richard Kaye, portfolio manager at French asset management firm Comgest, said Japan can offer unique long-term opportunities for ""patient bulls"" because it is a misunderstood market plagued by persistent doubts.
""Although Japan does not offer FANGs, it does offer a host of quality growth companies in high-tech engineering, such as robotics, sensors, materials handling or semiconductors,"" he said. (FANGs is market terminology for superstar stocks such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL))
But many long-only stock pickers face a dilemma: They are positive on the overall Japan market but often many of the names they like, in cyclical sectors such as robotics and information technology, are too expensive. 
Large cap robotics-related shares Fanuc (T:6954), factory automation firms  Keyence  (T:6861) and Misumi (T:9962), all trade at price-earnings ratios above 30, a much higher multiple than the benchmark Nikkei's (N225) 15. 
The Bank of Japan's constant buying of exchange-traded funds has also put a floor under the stock market, supporting share prices but depriving active managers of opportunities to pick a bottom.
As overseas investors account for more than two thirds of trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, their participation is seen as a key factor in its success. 
Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment officer at Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners, says many foreign investors now favor Japanese shares as a tactical and cyclical play on the global economy, rather than long-term bets on Corporate Japan.
""They are far from convinced that Japan has really turned the corner and is already on a reflation path. If that conviction rises over the next couple of years, then I think there is another pool of money that could flow into Japan, but it's too early to say,"" he said.
Foreign and domestic bulls, ""patiently"" looking for buying opportunities, are setting up the Nikkei, which currently hovers near 26-year highs, for a barnstorming 2018.
Goldman Sachs expects the Nikkei to finish 2018 at 25,200 yen, a rise of 12 percent from current levels, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) expects the Nikkei to peak at 26,000 in 2018.

1680,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 09:31PM ET</span>",Growth-Blessed Southeast Asia Has More to Cheer About in 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- Southeast Asian nations are riding a global trade boom that’s set to underpin solid economic growth next year, supporting the region as it embarks on monetary policy tightening and braces for a spate of elections.
The Philippines and Vietnam will remain the star performers in 2018, with economic growth projected to exceed 6 percent again, according to the median forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Most of the region’s top six economies are set to sustain 2017 momentum, with growth in Indonesia seen mildly firmer at 5.3 percent next year, while Singapore and Malaysia will probably moderate.
Export-reliant Southeast Asia is ending 2017 on a high note, counter to fears at the start of the year that a U.S.-China trade war could blow up supply chains and send the region into disarray. Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore all posted third-quarter gross domestic product growth that was faster than at any time since 2014 and earlier.
While growth may ease from this year’s breakneck pace, the expansion that’s been concentrated in trade-dominated industries, such as manufacturing, should broaden out to other sectors in the economy. Combined with a benign inflation outlook, that’s set to support a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening across the region.
Here’s a rundown of what to watch for in the region next year:
Monetary Policy
Central banks in the Philippines and Malaysia are seen as the two most likely to raise interest rates next year, while Singapore may also move away from its neutral policy stance. It’s less clear what Indonesia and Thailand will do.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists predict the Bank of Thailand will probably stay on hold in 2018, with Bank Indonesia raising rates. It’s vice versa for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG economists, who predict Indonesia will stay on hold and turn to macroprudential measures to spur lending, while Thailand is seen hiking.
Fiscal Plans
Governments across the region -- particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia where economies are more reliant on domestic sources of growth than exports -- are spending more on road, rail and port projects to expand capacity, helping to underpin growth.
To keep their budget deficits in check, authorities are pushing to boost revenue from taxes. Philippine lawmakers last week ratified a tax bill that cuts some income taxes while raising levies on coal, vehicles and other goods. Indonesia is clamping down on tax dodgers, while Singapore is considering adjustments in its budget next year.
Consumer Recovery?
Household debt in parts of the region could hold back faster consumption and the broadening out of expansion, according to Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore.
“The worst case is, there are some macro shocks and these households already saddled with high debt stop consuming in an exuberant manner, so you have a drag on consumption,” he said.
Consumers in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have higher debt burdens compared to others in the region, with central banks in the latter two countries citing financial stability risks as a factor in deciding policy.
Investment Pick-Up
Business investment will be the bigger story in 2018, said Chua Hak Bin, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research in Singapore. While this year’s big surprise was the upturn in trade, that trend typically means a boon for investment that’s been languishing, as executives change their minds about global demand prospects. Fledgling projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative could help boost those figures, he said.
Political Risks
The threat of further North Korean military provocations and a series of elections add to uncertainty in the region.
Malaysia is gearing up for a vote next year, with speculation mounting it will happen before the end of May. Prime Minister Najib Razak is facing a tough contest, but has bolstered his chances of re-election with a stimulus-packed budget in October. The timing may also have a bearing on when the central bank raises interest rates for the first time since 2014, with some economists suggesting a pre-vote hike is unlikely.
Thailand’s military, which has held power since a coup in 2014, said it’s on course for an election in November, although doubts remain. That may influence investment decisions, with businesses remaining on the sidelines in recent years.
Indonesia is set to hold regional elections next year, which may help to boost consumers’ purchasing power and provide a a lift to overall spending in the economy, which has disappointed this year.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 07:12PM ET</span>",Air Berlin receiver says optimistic on last-minute rescue for Niki: Sueddeutsche,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A receiver of insolvent German airline Air Berlin (DE:AB1) told a newspaper he is optimistic about the sales process of the airline's subsidiary Niki after a number of would-be investors stepped forward under a fast-approaching deadline.
""I conclude from the great demand in the investors' process that there is a good chance of a last-minute rescue for Niki, despite the heavy time pressure,"" Lucas Floether was quoted as saying in Monday's edition of German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Niki applied to open insolvency proceedings last week after Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) dropped a bid for the Austrian holiday airline.
Floether said Niki's insolvency had created a new situation.
""The airline is becoming more interesting because disadvantages such as existing contracts can now be terminated,"" he said. ""Also, the double-digit million euros sum, which Lufthansa invested in Niki, does not have to be repaid because it has become an insolvency claim.""
The parties are under pressure to agree a deal before Niki loses its take-off and landing rights, its most attractive assets, which is believed to be at risk of happening within days.
While deadlines were ambitious, Austria's air navigation supervisor, the Austro Control authority, was at liberty to lengthen a seven-day deadline for the operating license to be withdrawn until after the upcoming holidays, Floether said.
Motor racing driver Niki Lauda, who founded Niki in 2003, joined the group of interested parties by telling German business daily Handelsblatt in its Monday edition that he aims to bid for the airline next Wednesday.
He said he had talked to another Air Berlin administrator, Frank Kebekus, on Friday, telling him he was ready to act quickly. 
On Saturday, German logistics firm Zeitfracht and maintenance group Nayak confirmed they were interested in some Niki assets, including Niki Technik, and crews.
Lauda also told Handelsblatt he would engage in the talks initially without British holiday group Thomas Cook (L:TCG), also among the interested parties, to speed things up. 
""But logically, I am in contact with Thomas Cook and its (German) subsidiary Condor,"" he added.
Irish low cost carrier Ryanair (I:RYA) has also expressed an interest.
Lufthansa scrapped plans to buy Niki due to European Commission competition concerns, even after providing the carrier with tens of millions of euros in financing to keep its planes in the air until the deal was completed. 

The administrators for Air Berlin have since been working to find a new buyer for Niki's assets - which include valuable take-off and landing slots at airports such as Duesseldorf, Munich and Vienna - trying to clinch a deal before Niki loses its slots.

A deal would provide the latest example of the growing convergence between consumer health and insurance, following CVS Health Corp's (N:CVS) agreement earlier this month to acquire  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) for $69 billion.
Humana has been investing significantly in its home health capabilities, Humana At Home, which the insurer touts as a compliment to its Medicare Advantage franchise. If the negotiations are successful, a deal could come as early as this week, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the talks, said the deal could value Kindred at $9 per share. On Friday, the company's stock closed at $8.60, giving it a market value of $750 million. 
Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and TPG would take over Kindred's facility-focused business, which includes long-term acute care hospitals and rehabilitation centers. The private equity firms together with Humana would get Kindred's home and hospice care operations, the WSJ reported, citing sources it did not identify.
Kindred and Humana did not immediately respond to requests for comment. TPG and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe also were not immediately available for comment. 
Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Kindred is the largest home healthcare provider and hospice operator in the United States. 
The company, which has long-term debt of $3.2 billion, has suffered due to its reliance on the Medicare federal health insurance program for revenue. It is also at risk for changes to how post-acute care services are reimbursed if U.S. President Donald Trump restructures the healthcare system.
Earlier this year, Kindred announced plans to coordinate skilled nursing operations with Genesis HealthCare Inc (N:GEN), one of the largest operators of skilled nursing facilities in the United States.
In 2015, Kindred acquired Gentiva Health Services Inc for $1.8 billion, turning it into the biggest U.S. provider of home health and hospice care, but also saddling it with debt.

Health insurance companies are exploring new ways to diversify their revenues with acquisitions in acute care, after federal regulators blocked two major mergers in the sector, and insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, came under pressure from Republicans.

The new Aon survey, which included responses from decision makers at 450 medium and large-size corporations, provided additional insight into how CVS and Aetna customers may view the deal. 
Sixty-one percent of survey respondents, including ones that are not customers of CVS or Aetna, said the deal would affect their decision-making process on health benefits, with 23 percent saying it would accelerate a reassessment of healthcare strategy and 38 percent saying it would delay any such moves until the transaction’s impact could be understood. 
Thirty-nine percent expected no change to their overall healthcare strategy. The survey did not determine whether major employers expect the deal to change the cost of their health benefits, which could affect how antitrust regulators view it. 
A majority of large employers contract with separate companies to provide prescription drug coverage and medical coverage, believing they can keep costs lower in that way. Combining CVS with Aetna would leave only one major pharmacy benefits company, Express Scripts Holding Co, operating as a standalone entity. CVS and Aetna argue they can offer bigger savings to customers by better managing prescription drug use and expanding lower-cost medical services offered at thousands of CVS pharmacies. 
Jim Winkler, Aon senior vice president for health, said he was surprised that as many companies thought they might make a change in their overall healthcare strategy, whether immediately or down the road.
""This is on their radar screen in a bigger way than I would have anticipated,"" Winkler said. ""Typically employers tend to look at this type of news and think 'it's too big, and it's too far off to matter to me yet.'"" 
The Aon survey was conducted during an online seminar with corporate decision makers on Thursday. Many participants focused their questions on what kinds of medical services CVS might introduce in its pharmacies, Winkler said. According to the survey, 71 percent of respondents expect moderate changes in where their employees access care, while 14 percent said they foresee significant changes. 

Among a smaller group of 210 respondents, 52 percent surveyed by Aon said they planned to keep their pharmacy benefits separate from medical coverage. An additional 15 percent said they are considering separating those contracts.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 10:21AM ET</span>",Strike over Teva Pharm job cuts briefly shuts down Israel,"By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's main public-sector labor union staged a half-day strike on Sunday, closing the airport, stock exchange, banks and all government ministries to protest at mass layoffs planned by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TA:TEVA).
Debt-ridden Teva (N:TEVA), one of Israel's largest companies and the world's largest generics drugmaker, said last week it would cut its global workforce by more than a quarter, or 14,000 jobs.
Some 1,700 jobs will be cut and a manufacturing site will be closed in Israel. This has angered unions and politicians, who believe Teva's employees should not pay for the company's failed investments abroad.
Sunday is the beginning of the Israeli work week. Hundreds of thousands of workers went on strike until 12 noon (1000 GMT) and many held solidarity rallies outside Teva facilities.
Protesters also blocked major roads across the country, including the entrance of Jerusalem, and burned tires outside many Teva offices. Demonstrators sat in the middle of streets and crosswalks, halting traffic in a number of cities.
The Histadrut labor federation said hundreds of Teva workers in its Jerusalem plant were squatting inside and would continue a strike again on Monday, while there will also be strikes at other Teva facilities. 
The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange shortened its trading day, opening at 1 pm and closed as usual at about 4:30 pm. Teva's shares fell 0.8 percent.
Departing flights at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport between 8 a.m. and at least 12 p.m. were either canceled or delayed. Similarly, no flights were allowed to land until after 12 p.m.
PUBLIC TRANSIT KEPT RUNNING FOR SOLDIERS
Trains and buses were initially supposed to strike as well, but the Histadrut allowed public transit to operate so that soldiers could get back to their bases as usual.
""We are fighting on behalf of Teva's workers to save Israel's industry ... and to convey the message that layoffs are the last and not the first step in the public and private sectors,"" Histadrut chief Avi Nissenkorn said.
He called the current crisis the fault of Teva's management and board, adding: ""It is the state's responsibility to prevent thousands of Israeli families from paying the price for this.""
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he planned to meet with Kare Schultz, Teva's chief executive, this week to try and minimize the blow to workers.
""We need to do everything possible to prevent the closure of plants in Jerusalem,"" Netanyahu said at the outset of a cabinet meeting, adding Teva should remain based in Israel.
""It employs thousands of workers,"" he said. ""It started as an Israeli company and we want it to remain as an Israeli company. We will use various means at our disposal to try and achieve these goals."" He did not elaborate.
Schultz said Teva would maintain its headquarters in Israel.
Saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt since acquiring Allergan's (N:AGN)  Actavis  generic drug business for $40.5 billion, Teva made a series of changes after Schultz joined as its new chief executive on Nov. 1.
Its two-year restructuring plan is intended to reduce Teva's cost base by $3 billion by the end of 2019, out of an estimated cost base for 2017 of $16.1 billion.
Nissenkorn said he would meet with Israel's finance and economy ministers, along with the Teva workers union, on Monday.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro signed the deal during a visit to Venezuela by Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, it said. 
During the visit, Sechin also discussed Rosneft's cooperation with Venezuelan state energy company PDVSA, the statement said.
Under the agreement, which is valid for 30 years, wholly-owned Rosneft unit Grupo Rosneft will become the operator of the Patao and Mejillones offshore gas fields, Rosneft said.
Rosneft will have the right to sell all of the fields' production for export, including in the form of liquefied natural gas, the Rosneft statement said.
It said total estimated reserves at the two fields are 180 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas, and that maximum annual production would be 6.5 bcm.
Venezuela's unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive. 
PDVSA has debts to state-owned Rosneft of $6 billion, the Russian company estimated in August.

Last month, Russia's finance ministry agreed to a restructuring of Venezuela's debt to Moscow, not including PDVSA's debts to Rosneft.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Oxford bond debut success shows UK universities another course,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The success of Oxford University's $1 billion bond, the first in its 1,000-year history, is good news for Britain's top academic institutions at a time of anxiety over Brexit-related funding shortfalls and calls to scrap student tuition fees. 
The 100-year bond, launched on Dec. 1 with a 2.5 percent coupon, has taken the market for deals for UK universities and colleges to a new level on a par with such big U.S. names as Harvard and Yale. 
Technically, the bond was the biggest from any university in the world. Buying interest equaled $2 billion or double its face value.
The day after its launch, it was among the top 20 traded issues in the whole of Europe, according to Trax, a subsidiary of debt trading platform MarketAxess. 
That is cause for celebration for peers contemplating bond sales, even if their credit scores are less impressive than Oxford's gold-plated triple-A rating. The oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford topped a global ranking by the Times newspaper for the first time last year. 
It's an uncertain time for Britain's academic institutions.
The cost of student tuition fees, which make up almost half of UK universities' revenues, has been catapulted to the top of the political agenda by young voters who deserted Britain's ruling Conservative party in a snap election in June.
Universities expect these fees - currently 9,250 pounds ($12,424) a year - to be reviewed in the new year, meaning they are unlikely to rise further and could even be cut.
""I think the whole higher education sector is worried about the debate around tuition fees,"" Oxford's Pro-Vice-Chancellor for planning and resources David Prout told Reuters after the bond sale earlier this month.
Britain's plan to leave the European Union in March 2019 is also weighing heavily.
UK universities are already finding it harder to attract and retain EU-born students and staff, with official figures showing undergraduate course applications from EU students fell 7 percent this year. The other countries in the EU send around 58,000 students, or 8 percent of undergraduates and 15 percent of postgraduate students, to the 'Russell Group' comprising 24 top tier universities in the United Kingdom. Around 25,000 of their staff come from other EU countries, too. Once Britain leaves, these institutions could also lose their places on EU-funded research projects after 2020. A big worry is how Brexit will affect the UK's ability to borrow from the European Investment Bank, UK universities' biggest source of lending.  The bank, the European Union's main development lender, stopped support in March after London triggered the Article 50 clause to formally start the EU withdrawal process.  LEARNING THE CURVE Some 36 British universities, including University College London, Edinburgh, Swansea, Bangor, Newcastle and Oxford, have borrowed almost 3 billion euros ($3.52 billion) from the EIB over the last decade to fund campus upgrades.  That's more than any other country and almost double the 1.7 billion that went to Germany and 1.5 billion to France. Last year alone, the EIB lent 671 million euros (590.21 million pounds) to UK universities.  But unless EU treaties are amended, Britain will have to leave the EIB after Brexit.  ""This (EIB funding) is an area where people (at universities) feel there might be changes, so they are looking at the option of the public and private placement markets,"" said Dominic Kerr, manager director of Debt Capital Markets for HSBC. Kerr has helped launch seven of the eight public bonds that have so far been issued by UK universities, including the first by Cambridge in 2012.  Kerr estimates there have been around 50 market-based funding deals for UK universities and individual colleges in total if 'private placements' - bonds offered directly to a just one or a few investors - are included.  Fraser Dixon, JP Morgan's executive director for UK & Ireland debt Capital Markets, said he had several interested calls after his bank arranged the Oxford bond.  ""Having seen what is able to be achieved in the markets and with the EIB possibly disappearing as an option, I think other institutions will be considering their options,"" Dixon said. ""The bond markets are offering greater capacity and longer-dated money than the EIB traditionally has."" Many still hope EIB funding will not vanish altogether.  An EU-UK 'divorce deal' outline published last week specifically stated: ""The UK considers that there could be mutual benefit from a continuing arrangement between the UK and the EIB,"" and that it wanted to ""explore"" the possibilities. The EIB does lend to non-EU universities in countries such as Morocco and Tunisia and the group is mulling an offshoot that would include the UK, sources have told Reuters. ""Looking ahead, if there were to be clarity on the future relationship with the UK, let's see, but from our side we would happily look at supporting higher education in the years ahead,"" an EIB source said.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",Vietnam to name buyer of up to $5 billion stake in top brewer Sabeco,"By Mai Nguyen and Anshuman Daga
Ho CHI MINH CITY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam is set to auction an up to $5 billion stake in top brewer Sabeco (HM:SAB) on Monday, with Thai Beverage (SI:TBEV) the only potential bidder to have expressed interest in a majority stake.
The keenly anticipated sale of the state-owned maker of Bia Saigon gained momentum in recent months after being hampered for years by political resistance, fickle policy-making and complications over valuations.
The government has set a minimum sale price of 320,000 dong or $14.10 a share for  Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp  (Sabeco), whose shares have nearly trebled to 309,200 dong since its listing a year ago. [L3N1OA060]
Thai Beverage, through a partly-owned Vietnam unit, is the only company which has expressed interest in owning more than 25 percent of the company, which has roughly 40 percent of the beer-loving Vietnamese market.So far no formal bid had been made. [L3N1OB4FA]
Vietnam's young population and booming economy should make Sabeco an attractive asset for global brewers hoping to expand in Southeast Asia, but a high minimum bid price and foreign ownership limits appear to have turned off potential buyers.
Sabeco's foreign ownership is capped at 49 percent. With 10 percent already in foreign hands, that leaves only 39 percent on the table for overseas buyers at Monday's auction. Local bidders can bid for a majority stake of up to 54 percent. Heinken (AS:HEIN) holds a 5 percent stake.
""There's a disconnect between what the government wants to achieve and how international brewers view this auction,"" said one person familiar with the matter.""In a normal auction, bidders are fully aware of what stake they'll end up owning and bid for it accordingly,"" said the person, who was not authorized to speak to the media.Unlike similar sales in developed markets, where investors are whittled down over several rounds and offers can be adjusted, Sabeco bidders need to submit a single offer for a specific number of shares in a sealed envelope in one round. Thai Bev, controlled by tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, was keen to acquire Sabeco as part of a strategy to expand outside its home market, sources told Reuters. The company had already lined up bank guarantees to support the bid by its Vietnam unit, sources said.
There was no immediate response from Thai Bev to a query from Reuters.

Reuters previously reported that the auction was drawing the interest of brewing groups such as  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), Kirin Holdings (T:2503), Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502) and San Miguel (PS:SMC), but there is no clear sign of whether they have participated in the auction so far.The government's minimum price for the 54 percent stake on offer valued Sabeco at about 36 times core earnings, more than double the trading multiples of around 15 for some global peers, according to Reuters data.Vietnam's trade ministry is expected to announce the bidding result on Monday afternoon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CSX Corp (O:CSX) Chief Executive Hunter Harrison has died, the freight railway operator said on Saturday, just a few days after announcing that the veteran rail executive hired earlier this year to boost its profits had taken a medical leave of absence.
Harrison, 73, died ""due to unexpectedly severe complications from a recent illness,"" the company said in a statement, adding that he would be succeeded for now by acting CEO Jim Foote.
""We are immensely grateful for the opportunity to have worked with the railroad legend,"" Foote said in a letter to employees of CSX, which has some 21,000 miles of track, mostly east of the Mississippi River, adding that it would ""honor his legacy by staying focused"" on his business plan.
Harrison, hired as CEO in March at the urging of activist investor Paul Hilal, had been in the midst of an ambitious and sometimes controversial effort to overhaul CSX by laying off employees and streamlining operations.
Seen using an oxygen tank when meeting with investors last month, he had been hired at CSX on a four-year contract with an estimated value of $300 million.
""The board will continue to consider in a deliberative way how best to maximize CSX's performance over the long term,"" CSX Chairman Edward Kelly said in a statement that called Harrison a ""larger-than-life figure.""
News of Harrison's leave, announced late on Thursday, sent the No. 3 U.S. railway's shares tumbling as much as 10 percent in Friday trading on the Nasdaq. Despite that, the stock is up 47 percent so far this year.
Harrison, who led turnarounds of two Canadian railroads, had previously taken a medical leave at Canadian Pacific in 2015 after surgery and a bout with pneumonia.
While the turnaround plan went over well with shareholders, its execution triggered service disruptions and ran afoul of regulators and customers.
The company, which on Friday brushed off questions about whether the board has been slow to disclose Harrison's health problems, provided no further details about his cause of death.
Foote, who also holds the titles of chief operating officer and chief sales and marketing officer, had worked with Harrison at Canadian National Railway (TO:CNR), but has never headed a major railroad. 

He has said he would follow through with the wide-ranging overhaul now under way, but some investors on Friday expressed doubts about whether he could deliver on Harrison's ambitious plan, which included closing numerous railyards where train cars are sorted and the potential sale of some short-line rail segments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. renewable energy industry expressed relief after a compromise Republican tax bill released late on Friday preserved key tax credits that had been at risk of being removed, but it raised concerns about a provision that may threaten investment in the sector.
The final tax bill retains the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy that have spurred investment in the fast-growth industries. It also eliminates the alternative minimum tax, which would have reduced the value of those credits.
The bill includes the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, which was intended to prevent multinational companies from abusing the tax code but has worried the renewable energy industry because it would limit the ability to claim a portion of production or investment credits.
The conference bill made changes to a more severe Senate proposal by allowing the credits to offset up to 80 percent of the BEAT tax, but renewable energy industry representatives said they were uncertain how the marketplace would react.
The original Senate version could have chilled investment by international companies like Vestas Wind Systems A/S, and banks in the renewable energy sector, industry experts said.
“We are grateful for the elimination of provisions that would have decimated future renewable energy growth and even penalized past investment in wind and solar power, but we remain concerned about the potential impacts of the new BEAT (tax) on renewable energy finance,"" said American Council on Renewable Energy President Gregory Wetstone. 
Solar industry group SEIA called the tax bill a ""great victory"" for the sector and its 260,000 workers.
Advanced Energy Economy, a lobby group for clean energy, said it was relieved that the bill retained the tax credits but called it a ""missed opportunity"" to bolster other technologies, such as fuel cells, energy storage, combined heat and power, geothermal, nuclear, and distributed wind power.
The U.S. tax overhaul, which picked up crucial support from two wavering senators ahead of planned votes by lawmakers early next week, would cut the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. 
Besides preserving the renewable energy tax credits, the bill would maintain a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit after automakers and other companies urged Congress to keep it.
The bill also gives a boost to oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic wilderness area with a provision to open a portion of Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

(Reuters) - A U.S. labor agency on Friday made it tougher for workers to form so-called micro unions made up of small groups of a company's employees, reversing an Obama-era decision that had been sharply criticized by companies.
It was the fifth time this week that the five-member National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Republican majority, which has been in place since late September, upended a decision issued during the Obama administration that business groups said unfairly favored unions.
The NLRB in a 3-2 decision on Friday said a unionized unit of about 100 welders and ""rework specialists"" at a manufacturing company in Oregon was improper, and should include all 2,500 employees at the company's facility.
Forming smaller bargaining units can be a key organizing strategy for unions, particularly when they lack support from a majority of an employer's workforce. But business groups say that smaller bargaining units fracture workplaces.
The board said on Friday that its 2011 decision involving nursing agency Specialty Healthcare gave too much power to unions to decide which workers should be included in a bargaining unit.
In Specialty Healthcare, the NLRB ruled that businesses challenging ""micro unions"" must show that workers left out of a proposed unit share most of their working conditions with those who were included. That is a high bar for companies to meet since workers with different job titles and duties often have distinct supervisors, working hours, and wages.
The board on Friday said that decision improperly allowed unions to handpick groups of workers who were likely to vote in their favor ""in all but narrow and highly unusual circumstances.""
Previously, the burden was on unions to prove that proposed bargaining units were proper. Friday's decision revived that standard, making it easier for companies to challenge ""micro unions.""
David French, the vice president of the National Retail Federation, praised Friday's decision, saying the board's 2011 ruling had ""undermined retail operations and limited opportunities for hardworking employees for the sole purpose of empowering Big Labor.""
Friday's decision went against rulings by eight federal appeals courts. Courts have approved units of FedEx (N:FDX) drivers that excluded warehouse workers, and a unit of cosmetic and perfume department workers at a Macy's Inc (N:M) store in Massachusetts, among others.

An appeals court in Washington is considering Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p)s challenge to a bargaining unit of skilled trade workers at the automaker's Chattanooga, Tennessee plant that excluded production workers.

Federal prosecutors said Rocha Loures, a former adviser to President Michel Temer, sought out Caixa Chief Executive Gilberto Occhi and then Antonio Carlos Ferreira, a Caixa vice president, to discuss the interests of Rodrimar, a company that operates Brazil's largest port.
A spokesman for Caixa Economica Federal wrote in an e-mail the bank would ""respond formally (to the prosecutors) in accordance with the legal deadline.""
Loures is in prison on allegations of accepting bribes from executives at JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), the world's largest meatpacker. In September, Brazil's Supreme Court authorized a different investigation into whether Temer signed a legal decree on ports because of Rodrimar bribes, an allegation both parties have denied.
In the document, which prosecutors sent to the Brazilian presidential chief of staff, they said they suspected bank vice presidents were involved in illicit activity regarding Loures and Rodrimar.

In addition to replacing Caixa's 12 vice presidents, prosecutors requested that the process for selecting high-ranking executives at Caixa be improved and that business meetings take place on bank property, among other measures.

Wells Fargo, which last year paid $190 million to settle a phony accounts scandal, is under investigation by two other financial agencies over whether the bank charged its customers too much for auto insurance and mortgages.
Quarles, who joined the Fed on October 13, is regarded as the country's top banking regulator and will be a critical voice as the central bank rethinks how it approaches bank supervision. 
He said in a memo that he and his family had sold their financial interests in Wells Fargo, and repaid a business loan to the bank - meaning he was legally allowed to oversee the lender. 
But the former Wall Street lawyer and private equity investor said he would still bow out from all Fed decisions on the bank.
""I have made this decision in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict,"" Quarles wrote the Fed's chief counsel Mark Van Der Weide.
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on Quarles' recusal.
Quarles has ties to Wells Fargo through his father-in-law, Spencer Eccles.
Eccles was the head of First Security Corporation when the Utah bank was bought out by Wells Fargo in a $2.9 billion deal in 2000. Since then, Eccles has held a non-executive position with Wells Fargo, according to several online biographies.
""Mr. Eccles is Chairman Emeritus of the Intermountain Banking Region of Wells Fargo & Co."", according to an online biography of trustees for Intermountain Healthcare, a nonprofit based in Salt Lake City.
The Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to make any comment on the position of chairman emeritus.
A Federal Reserve spokesman said the emeritus title was honorary and that Eccles has no formal role at the bank.
In September, the New York Federal Reserve faulted its president William Dudley for not disclosing that his sister-in-law worked for Wells Fargo.
Conflicts of interest have long been a point of contention between those who argue regulators benefit from hiring people with real-world experience, and critics who say the revolving door makes it impossible to regulate effectively.
That debate has heightened under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has stocked his administration with former business executives, and pledged to slash regulations.
