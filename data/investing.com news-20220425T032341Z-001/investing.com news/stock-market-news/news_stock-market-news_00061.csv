0,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Tencent Wipeout Topping $114 Billion Reveals Depth of Tech Gloom,"(Bloomberg) -- The tech rout is getting so bad that even Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) is struggling to hold above a key technical level.
The shares fell as much as 2.5 percent on Thursday to drop below their 200-day moving average for the first time since 2016. The Shenzhen-based giant, Asia’s biggest company by market value, has now tumbled almost 20 percent since its Jan. 23 high, losing some $114 billion. To put that into context, fewer than 3 percent of Europe’s biggest companies are worth that much.
Risk-averse traders have been dumping tech and Internet stocks worldwide for weeks, unwinding one of last year’s most profitable trades amid concern over lofty valuations. Increasing evidence of a slowing smartphone market added more fuel to the selloff on Thursday, as did a reported U.S. investigation into China’s Huawei Technologies Co. following a ban on ZTE Corp. earlier this month.
Hong Kong-listed Tencent has been a favorite among investors and analysts alike -- it hasn’t had a single sell rating in more than two years. While breaching the 200-day moving average shows just how bearish sentiment has turned on global tech, it doesn’t necessarily spell danger for Tencent, which more than doubled in 2017 after the last time it touched that level.
The shares pared losses to 1.2 percent at the close, to hover just above the 200-day average.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Tech giants including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will for the first time face rules governing their commercial relations with smaller businesses under a law proposed by the European Union on Thursday.
The new rules will specifically target app stores, search engines, e-commerce sites and hotel booking websites such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE), requiring them to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services.
The proposal would also give companies the right to collectively sue online platforms if they do not respect the new rules on non-discrimination and transparency. 
Music streaming services such as Spotify have been pushing for Brussels to address relations between platforms and businesses, saying the former have an incentive to disadvantage competitors' services.
Apple's entry into the music streaming field with Apple Music sparked concerns from other companies, such as Spotify, which have argued that the 30 percent cut Apple takes of subscriptions in its App Store gives its own service an unfair advantage. 
Under the EU's proposal, which will have to be approved by the European Parliament and member states before becoming law, online platforms will have to appoint mediators to deal with complaints and bear at least half the costs.
Platforms will also have to describe in their terms and conditions any differentiated treatment they give to their own services versus those offered by other businesses. 
""Platforms and search engines are important channels for European businesses to reach consumers but we must make sure they are not abusing their power, and thus bring harm their business users,"" said Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner for the Digital Economy.
""We are taking a very important step with clear rules on transparency, efficient dispute settlement and the launch of an observatory to analyze online platforms' practices in greater detail.""
However, music streaming companies said such transparency requirements did not go far enough.
""In order to be effective, the regulation must also address the discriminatory practices that arise when a platform provider is also the direct competitor with those third parties,"" said Hans-Holger Albrecht, President of Digital Music Europe which includes Spotify, Deezer and Soundcloud.
CCIA, which represents Google, Amazon and eBay, said online platforms go to great lengths to maintain good relations with their business users because it was in their own interest.

""There is no evidence of a systemic problem that would justify regulation through the strongest legislative instrument available to the EU. A more flexible approach, rather than an outsized, one-size-fits-all Regulation, would be more conducive to the growth of Europe’s digital economy,"" said Jakob Kucharczyk, Vice President, Competition & EU Regulatory Policy at CCIA.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 05:05AM ET</span>","European shares recover as earnings dominate, Lufthansa disappoints","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Encouraging results and a recovery among industrials helped European stock markets on Thursday, while earnings disappointments weighed heavily on some stocks including Germany's Lufthansa and Kion.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) inched up 0.2 percent by 0833 GMT, enjoying a timid bounce from the one-week lows hit in the previous session, when anxiety over rising bond yields jolted risky assets. 
As investors sifted through the heaviest week of earnings season, JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka said: ""Based on the results so far, the earnings delivery looks encouraging in the US, while the numbers in Europe and Japan are somewhat softer, but still positive.""
Bank earnings were a key focus.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) shares recovered after a 2.6 percent fall at the open, trading up 0.2 percent by 0833 GMT after the bank said it would scale back its bond and equities trading in a major overhaul of its investment bank, after reporting a 79 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter.
""The strategy potentially resolves the capitalization concerns of the bank, but profitability remains an issue,"" said KBW analysts. 
Deutsche Bank shares are down more than 27 percent year-to-date, the worst-performing of the European banks sector (SX7P). 
Meanwhile Norway's largest bank, DNB (OL:DNB), jumped 5.9 percent after profit beat expectations as a pick-up in activity in the oil sector wiped the bank clean of loan losses.
Among notable gainers, Finnish oil refining firm Neste (HE:NESTE) topped the STOXX, jumping 12 percent after reporting first-quarter sales that comfortably topped analysts' estimates.
Industrials were strong overall, with French engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) rising after results, but Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) weighed down the sector with a 6.1 percent fall.
The German airline's revenue growth disappointed due to expansion of its Eurowings budget carrier.
Investors are watching the European earnings season keenly for any signs of strain from slowing economic growth after recent business activity and consumer confidence measures faltered.
Analysts have downgraded their expectations for euro zone earnings. The euro zone STOXX (STOXXE) saw the biggest downward revisions to earnings estimates since July 2016 this week.
Oil majors moved in opposite directions after results. 
France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) rose a modest 0.4 percent after it reported that record production had lifted profits, while Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) declined 2.4 percent despite reporting a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit.
""First quarter free cash flow generation was at $4.4 billion, below our estimates on weaker than expected operating cash flow,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts on Shell.
Finnish mobile equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) tumbled 7.1 percent after profits fell short of expectations due to telecom operators holding off spending.
German forklift maker Kion blamed a slowing in the market for weaker than expected first-quarter order intake. Its shares tumbled 6.4 percent.
Shares in Philips Lighting (AS:LIGHT), the world's largest lighting maker, fell 11 percent after the firm reported lower than expected first-quarter earnings due to falling sales and margins.
BE Semiconductor Industries (AS:BESI) sank 12 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its results. Semiconductors across Europe have been under pressure recently as sentiment on the tech sector turns more pessimistic.
The autos sector (SXAP) was the best-performing after a report that China is considering halving duty on imported cars.

 Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) rose 1.5 percent and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) was up 1 percent. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) gained 2.8 percent to lead the DAX, boosted also by first-quarter results and optimism over its new CEO.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Teva to reduce size of board after June shareholders meeting,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Three directors are stepping down from the board at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TA:TEVA) (N:TEVA) and only one new director is being nominated to replace them, the company said on Thursday.
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, is in the midst of an overhaul to deal with the $35 billion of debt it amassed after buying Allergan’s  Actavis  (NYSE:AGN) generic drug business for $40.5 billion in 2016.
Analysts and investors have criticized the company's management and board of directors for overpaying for this deal.
Teva has since replaced most of its management and announced major job cuts. It has also reduced both the average tenure and age of its directors.
In the latest changes, Ronit Satchi-Fainaro, a Tel Aviv University professor who heads the Cancer Research and Nanomedicine Laboratory, will be the only new nominee at a June 5 shareholders meeting, the company said in a statement.
Current directors Galia Maor, Gabrielle Sulzberger and Dan Suesskind will not submit their candidacy for reelection. This will leave the board with 11 members, down from the current 13.
Suesskind, a former chief financial officer of Teva, was brought in last year as the company grappled with a financial crisis. Maor, a former CEO of Bank Leumi, has served since 2012.
Sulzberger, who has served since 2015, is a general partner of the Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners investment fund.
""We continue to evaluate the size and composition of our board of directors to ensure it maintains dynamic, exceptionally qualified members and that the mix of talent and experience on the board reflects all the challenges that the company faces,"" the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
At the June meeting shareholders will also vote on a proposal to give them more say in determining compensation for Teva executives.

Teva has repaid over $2 billion of its debt this year, mostly from the proceeds of the sale of its women’s health business. In March, it completed a $4.5 billion bond offering, which was used to repay existing loans.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 04:21AM ET</span>",Nokia sees weak first half but strong momentum later in 2018,"By Jussi Rosendahl and Eric Auchard
HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Nokia (HE:NOKIA) posted weaker than expected quarterly profits as telecom operators, particularly in North America, held off spending, but the company sees momentum building later in the year. 
Nokia said its mainstay networks business got off to a slow start in the first quarter and was likely to remain soft in the current second quarter. However, the market for next-generation 5G equipment would start to take off in the second half of 2018.
Shares in the Finnish company tumbled almost 8 percent to 4.55 euros at 0745 GMT.
""We expect an atypical seasonal trend, with softness in the first half of the year, offset by a very dynamic second half,"" Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told reporters.
""We are confident we can outperform a strengthening (network) market and meet our full year guidance,"" he added.
Nokia, which competes with Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE, both of China, said the battered network industry was poised to bounce back as commercial roll-outs of next-generation 5G networks start to take off later in 2018 in North America, its biggest market.
First-quarter group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell 30 percent from a year ago to 239 million euros ($291 million), clearly below analysts' average forecast of 369 million euros in a Reuters poll.
Struggling Ericsson last week stirred recovery hopes by beating quarterly profit expectations as its cost savings started to take effect.
""FAST AND BIG"" 5G
Most of Nokia's profit was generated by the company's profitable patent licensing business where earnings grew 136 percent.
Suri said the results were buoyed by patent royalty payments from newer Chinese smartphone suppliers and its licensing deal with HMD Global to market consumer devices under the Nokia phone brand.
The company has weathered several years of declining revenue since demand for the current generation of 4G network gear peaked around the middle of the decade and is betting on a new cycle of network upgrades to lift it starting later in 2018.
""We are at the very bottom of the pothole, right between technology cycles,"" said Mikael Rautanen, analyst at Inderes Equity Research, with a 'buy' rating on the stock.
""The short term looks weak, but … longer term, this report actually strengthened my confidence for them,"" he said. 
Nokia said it expected the global networks industry to fall 1-3 percent this year, a slight improvement from its previous forecast of a fall of 2-4 percent, and added its own sales would outperform the wider telecom equipment market.
""Although there are some sceptics, we see 5G coming fast and coming big,"" Suri told reporters. 
Commercial rollouts would start in the second half of 2018 in the United States and be followed by large-scale rollouts in a variety of regions in 2019, also including China, Japan, South Korea, the Nordics and the Middle East.
Of China, Suri said: ""Commercial deployments of 5G will start around the middle of 2019, although we know that if China decides to accelerate things, it changes very fast.""

11,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 05:37AM ET</span>",Nintendo switches president after forecasting best annual profit in nine years,"TOKYO/OSAKA (Reuters) - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) announced a new president on Thursday and said it expects annual profit to reach a nine-year high, as its Switch games console maintains sales momentum in its second year.
The initial success of the hybrid home-portable Switch has boosted Nintendo's gaming software sales and encouraged more third-party publishers to make games for the console, a cycle analysts expect to further push up console sales.
The strong sales has fueled investor hopes of the Switch repeating the success of Nintendo's first Wii console, leading to a doubling of the firm's stock price to nine-year highs earlier this year.
On Thursday, the Kyoto-based firm said it had named Shuntaro Furukawa - a 46-year-old managing executive officer in charge of global marketing and corporate planning - as president effective June to rejuvenate top management.
""My top priority is to keep and expand the momentum for the Switch,"" Furukawa said at an earnings briefing.
Incumbent chief Tatsumi Kimishima - a 68-year-old former banker who assumed the role after the death of predecessor Satoru Iwata in 2015 - decided to step down as he is ""close to fulfilling responsibilities"" to revive the firm, he said at the briefing. 
Nintendo estimated operating profit for the year through March to rise 26.7 percent from a year prior to 225 billion yen ($2.06 billion). If achieved, it would be Nintendo's highest profit since the year ended March 2010.
The outlook, however, missed the 308.72 billion yen average of 21 analyst estimates in a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Nintendo said it aims to sell 20 million Switch consoles in the financial year started April, confirming its previous forecast made in January.
Sales of the console reached 15 million units in the year ended March, bringing the cumulative total to 17.8 units since its global release in March least year.
YOUNGER AUDIENCE
Nintendo debuted its Wii console in late 2006 and sold over 100 million units, driving the company's annual profit to a record high of 555 billion yen in the year to March 2009.
The succeeding Wii U, on the other hand, flopped as third-party developers baulked at its complexity, leading to a shortage of titles and sluggish earnings.
""Third-party games publishers were cautious about developing titles for the Switch at first because they thought the Switch wouldn't sell well,"" said Hirokazu Hamamura, head of game magazine publisher Gzbrain Inc.
""They are now planning to release a bunch of new titles, and that would add to the momentum for Switch sales.""
Aiming to end its history of booms and busts, Nintendo is striving to broaden the gaming population. It launched this month ""Labo"" LEGO-style accessories for the Switch console that users can build themselves on cardboard sheets - a step analysts said could attract a younger audience raised on smartphone gaming.
Mizuho Securities senior analyst Takeshi Koyama said in a report to clients this month that Labo boosts ""potential for greater penetration of the Switch"". Its wide-ranging appeal is attracting families normally reluctant to buy their children console gaming systems, he said.

Air France is balloting staff over its offer of a 7 percent pay rise over four years, after unions rejected the proposal as too modest. Chief Executive Jean-Marc Janaillac has said it would be hard for him to stay if staff vote against the offer.
Philippe said Janaillac had shown ""courage"" by putting his job on the line and warned that a negative vote could further harm the company.
""If the consultation did not produce the results he hoped for and he took the consequences, everyone should fasten their seat belts because the turbulence will not be minor,"" he told Europe 1 radio. ""A company that loses its boss in these conditions is not well placed to face the future.""
The industrial action, affecting about 30 percent of Air France flights, has coincided with French railway strikes over the last month, resulting in widespread travel disruption.

SNCF workers have launched a series of protests against reform plans by President Emmanuel Macron's government, designed to stem the state-owned railway's losses and cut debt.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) first-quarter operating profit fell on Thursday, but optimism over its new chief executive and lower diesel emissions scandal provisions lifted its shares.
Two weeks after elevating brand chief Herbert Diess to group CEO as part of the biggest management shake-up in more than a decade, the German carmaker is shifting the focus to making its operating business more efficient.
""The Volkswagen group is in a robust economic position. The quarterly results confirm that we are on the right path,"" Diess said after VW posted group earnings before interest and taxes of 4.21 billion euros ($5.1 billion), a fall of 3.6 percent.
This was below the 4.47 billion euro consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of banks and brokerages.
VW said negative effects from switching to the IFRS accounting standard had contributed to the profit drop, adding that underlying earnings slightly exceeded last year's 4.37 billion if the changes were excluded. 
""The market is hoping for Diess to push further profitability gains and is taking joy from the fact that Dieselgate risks are abating,"" said NordLB analyst Frank Schwope who has a ""Buy"" recommendation on the stock, in reference to the diesel emissions test cheating scandal which has cost VW about $30 billion in fines and other costs.
The scandal has prompted major changes at Europe's largest automotive group, which is reorganizing its multiple car brands and carving out truck operations while shouldering billions of investments in battery-powered and self-driving vehicles. 
The group set aside no more significant funds between January and March to cover fines, compensation and vehicle refits related to its 2015 emissions scandal, after it raised provisions by another 600 million euros in the fourth quarter to a total of 25.8 billion euros.
VW shares were up 2.5 percent to 171.1 euros at 0824 GMT, outperforming Germany's benchmark DAX (GDAXI) index.
The carmaker stuck to its 2018 guidance published in February, predicting a return on sales of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent before special items, compared with 7.4 percent in 2017.
Revenue is expected to exceed the 2017 record of 231 billion euros by as much as 5 percent while group deliveries may moderately exceed last year's 10.7 million vehicles, VW said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Thursday reported a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit, its highest in over three years, boosted by higher oil prices and production.
Expectations are high for Shell to continue to generate strong profits and cash flow after the Anglo-Dutch company beat larger rival  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on both fronts in 2017 thanks to cost cuts and higher efficiencies.
The world's top oil companies are expected to generate more cash in 2018 than at any other time this decade after three years of cuts, but boards remain cautious amid uncertainty over near- and long-term prices.
""Shell's strong earnings this quarter were underpinned by higher oil and gas prices, the continued growth and very good performance of our Integrated Gas business, and improved profitability in our Upstream business,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement.
Shell in the fourth quarter scrapped its scrip dividend in a sign that it is confident of being able to maintain around $15 billion in annual dividend payments without resorting to borrowing after a three-year oil price downturn.
It plans to buy back $25 billion of shares by 2020 in order to offset the dilutive effect of the scrip and its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. 
It did not specify a time to start the program on Thursday.
After falling short of expectations in the previous quarter, Shell's cash flow from operations in the first three months of 2018 recovered to $9.43 billion, which was still slightly weaker from $9.5 billion a year earlier.
Free cash flow was little changed from a year earlier at $5.178 billion.
Net income attributable to shareholders, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose to $5.322 billion, topping a company-provided analysts' consensus of $5.277 billion.
A year ago, net income was $3.754 billion.
Production grew by 2 percent to 3.839 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Earnings for the segment almost tripled from a year earlier.
Income from the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, weakened due to lower refining margins and plant availability.
Gearing, the ratio between debt and Shell's market capitalization was slightly lower from the end of 2018 at 24.7 percent by the end of March.
Brent crude oil prices in recent months have risen to $75 per barrel, their highest since late 2014. 
Prices averaged around $67 a barrel in the first quarter, up nearly 25 percent from a year earlier.

As the rising yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries that topped 3% continued to weigh on investor sentiment, tech stocks remained in focus in the Asian stock market.
South Korea’s Kospi was up 1.12% to 2,476.22 at 01:18AM ET (05:18 GMT). South Korean telecoms giant  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) posted better-than-expectation profits that surged 52% in the first quarter. The increase was attributed to the strong demand for memory chips. Its stock price rose 2.78% on Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.39% to 22,303.00. Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974), a major company in Japan, is set to report quarterly earnings.

Chinese smartphone maker Huawei Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002502) dropped 1.53%.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 05:37AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank scales back investment bank as profit drops,"By Tom Sims and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) new chief executive Christian Sewing took firm action on its long-troubled investment bank on Thursday, cutting back bond and equities trading after a dramatic drop in quarterly profit.
"" Deutsche Bank  is deeply rooted in Europe – here we want to provide our clients access to global financing and treasury solutions,"" Sewing said, just weeks after becoming its CEO.
""This is what we will focus on more decisively,"" Sewing said, in a marked reversal from Deutsche Bank's global investment banking expansion over three decades, which ultimately landed it with costly regulatory fines.
The measures, which will result in job losses and higher restructuring costs and include a scaling-back of Deutsche Bank's business with hedge funds, are the initial product of a review of the investment bank, known internally as Project Colombo, which is likely to lead to further cuts, bankers said.
The bulk of the cuts will focus on the United States and Asia, Deutsche Bank said. It declined to elaborate further but senior executives said job cuts would be ""significant"" and that recent efforts to trim personnel would be accelerated.
The staff cuts were ""painful but regrettably unavoidable to ensure our bank's competitiveness in the long run"", Sewing, who has a background in retail banking, auditing and risk, said, adding that 2018 restructuring costs are expected to rise to 800 million euros from an earlier target of 500 million.
Deutsche Bank shares were up 0.8 percent by 0925 GMT.
Earnings from Germany's biggest bank fell short of analysts' expectations in the first quarter, with net income of 120 million euros below the forecast of 379 million, according to a Reuters poll.
It was also below the 575 million euros posted in the first quarter of last year.
TURBULENT TIMES
The cuts and weaker-than-expected earnings follow weeks of turmoil at Deutsche Bank, including the ouster of former chief executive John Cryan and the departure of senior managers.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's said this month it had placed the bank on ""credit watch negative,"" signaling a potential downgrade, because the change in chief executive could prolong the lender's restructuring.
But Thursday's announcements may have a positive impact on the bank's credit rating, which influences its financing costs, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said. 
Deutsche Bank said the cuts were expected to have a negative impact on 2018 revenues but improve returns in the medium term.
The bank said it would scale back U.S. rates sales and trading and it would undertake a review of its global equities business ""with the expectation of reducing its platform"".
""Commitment to sectors in the U.S. and Asia, in which cross-border activity is limited, will be reduced,"" it added.
Overall, the bank expects revenues in its bond trading activities to be flat this year and lower in its equities trading and in advisory business, after witnessing a steep slide in all three divisions in the first quarter.
By contrast, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) said this month that is so confident in its recent business boom, especially in trading, that it will pause share buybacks and instead use capital to facilitate trades, loans and deals for customers.

All major Wall Street banks have reported bumper first-quarter earnings thanks to a surge in stock trading activity, while Deutsche Bank conceded market share losses.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity firm Bain Capital LLC is targeting up to $4 billion for a new Asia-focused fund, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, adding yet more dry powder to the region that has enjoyed a two-year fundraising bonanza.
Bain Capital - which led the region's biggest ever private equity deal (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bain-japan/bain-capital-leads-the-charge-as-japans-private-equity-dealmaking-picks-up-idUSKBN1CH0KV) with the $18 billion purchase of Toshiba's (T:6502) memory chip unit last year - will begin fundraising in July, the source said on condition of anonymity.
Bain hopes to raise $3.5-$4 billion, said the source who did not want to be named as the information is confidential.
Bain Capital declined to comment.
The fundraising comes at a time when the region is flush with funds. A total of 342 funds raised a combined $107 billion in Asia last year, according to data provider Preqin.
As of last September, dry powder available to Asia-focused private equity funds - money committed but not yet invested - reached a record $248 billion, up more than 70 percent from the total available in 2016.
Other ongoing and planned private equity fundraisings could add more than $30 billion to that pile in the next year.
While Bain's fourth pan-Asia fund will be the firm's biggest so far in the region, it is still petite versus some of its peers. KKR & Co (N:KKR) raised a record $9.3 billion Asia-focused fund in 2016, while Carlyle (O:CG) is expected to soon close a $5 billion buyout fund.
Chinese fund Hillhouse Capital Group could beat KKR's record with its new fund, while Baring Private Equity Asia and PAG are each looking to raise up to $6 billion, people familiar with the fundraisings have told Reuters.
Bain's new fund will continue to invest in sectors including healthcare, industrial, financial services, technology, and media and telecom across major Asian markets, the source said.
In addition to its big bets on Japan, the firm's other portfolio companies in Asia include India's  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK) and Trans Maldivian Airways, a seaplane operator it bought together with a Chinese partner in December last year.
Bain's second pan-Asia fund, which raised $2.3 billion in 2012, saw a 19.7 percent internal rate of return by end-2016, according to disclosures by one of the fund's limited partners - the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System.

While the Persian Gulf nation is forecast to rake in as much as A$26.6 billion ($20.1 billion) in fiscal 2020 from taxes on the fuel, Australia is set to reap a paltry A$800 million, according to analysis by the Tax Justice Network’s Australian office.
Australia’s Petroleum Resource Rent Tax levies 40 percent on profits after company tax has been paid, a system that works pretty well for oil projects but is a poor fit for LNG projects. That’s because an oil venture can be cash positive within a few years of production, while LNG requires significantly more capital expenditure, prolonging the time before it generates enough cash to pay tax, a government report found.
The figures ""are an indication the fiscal regime for Australia’s LNG sector is broken,"" said Juan Carlos Boue, who made a submission to Australia’s inquiry on tax avoidance while working as an oil industry consultant at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. ""The incentives are simply too excessive.""
Australia is set to post its 10th straight budget deficit, even as receipts get a boost from higher commodity prices and strong employment growth. Treasurer Scott Morrison is tipped to flag personal cuts in the May 8 budget -- about a year out from a general election -- and should still be able to project a return to surplus by 2021. He announced the dumping of a planned tax hike on Thursday following a A$4.8 billion windfall in tax receipts.
The potential for greater stimulus is vast, especially in an economy that relies heavily on consumption. A “back-of-the-envelope” calculation by  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) shows that A$10 billion in tax cuts and spending could boost the economy by 0.6 percentage point of gross domestic product.
Lawmakers are gun shy on tackling resource taxes after a ferocious campaign by mining companies against such a proposal in 2010 that helped topple the then-prime minister. While the opposition Labor party has proposed curbing some loopholes such as tax breaks on property and cash refunds to retirees, the government has pledged to retain them. That just further limits its scope to provide relief.
“Every special treatment that’s in the tax code has an army of people who want to defend it to the death,” said Saul Eslake, an independent economist who has campaigned to overhaul the system of revenue raising for much of the past quarter-century. “It has become politically fraught in Australia.”
As politicians uphold the status quo, significant new LNG volumes are poised to start production this year.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX).’s gigantic Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects off Western Australia will pay no PRRT until the end of the next decade, according to an estimate by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital.
Not ‘Shortchanged’
Treasurer Morrison did take advantage of a community backlash against the finance industry to introduce a bank levy last year, but has shown little appetite to take on LNG multinationals. He last year argued that Australians weren’t being “shortchanged” by the industry, following a review of energy taxes.
Part of the problem with reforming Australia’s tax system is that every time a government moves to close a loophole, lobbyists emerge to fight it. Labor has managed to avoid much scrutiny of its recent plans due to the government’s frequent, self-inflicted crises.
With one recent exception. The retirement industry and government have kicked up a stink over the opposition’s latest plan to scrap a loophole that gives refunds to some shareholders, even if they’re retired and don’t pay tax.
“We’ve allowed ourselves to be bullied into thinking the tax code is inviolable,” said Eslake. “It’s not.”

22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 12:48AM ET</span>",China considering cutting duty on imported cars by about half: Bloomberg,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is considering cutting the import duty on passenger cars by about half as part of the country's plan to further open up the automobile market, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
China's cabinet is weighing proposals to reduce the levy on imported cars to 10 percent or 15 percent from the current 25 percent, according to Bloomberg. An announcement on the decision could be made as soon as next month, it added.
China pledged earlier this month to open up its auto market, the world's largest, announcing a timeline to remove long-standing caps on foreign ownership of automotive ventures and saying it would cut tariffs on imported cars soon.
China's State Council did not immediately respond to Reuters' phoned and faxed requests for comment on Thursday.
The high tariff - versus a 2.5 percent U.S. levy - has been a focus of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration amid a simmering trade standoff between Washington and Beijing. Trump has said the 25 percent tariff amounted to ""stupid trade"".
Trump said on Tuesday there was a good chance that the United States could reach a trade agreement with China and that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would head there for negotiations in a few days.
A major reduction in tariffs could prompt overseas automakers, especially luxury brand names, to import more cars made overseas into the Chinese market, boosting their competitiveness by helping close a price gap on local rivals.

China's main auto body said earlier this month a reduction to a 5 percent import tariff could knock around one-fifth off the domestic industry's profits, though it did not expect the tariff cut to be that severe.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>","Asia a bright spot for Japan carmakers facing sluggish U.S. sales, trade concerns","By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese automakers that rely heavily on exports to sell their models in the United States would be hardest hit by trade restrictions the country is threatening to impose, as rivals with more limited exposure focus on growing, niche markets.
Many Japanese automakers count the United States as their biggest market, so would be impacted to a degree by any trade constraints put in place as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's hard line on the issue.
Ahead of a flurry of Japanese automaker full-year results reports, analysts said Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) is most exposed to any trade restrictions in the world's biggest car market after China, and their knock-on effects.
Mazda's operating profit could be cut by 8.5 percent in the year to March 2019 as it faces risks from a stronger yen if the trade uncertainties weaken the U.S. dollar, while any trade restrictions would raise the cost of imported cars from Japan, they said. Higher research and development costs and other capital spending could also weigh.
One of Japan's smaller brands, Mazda counts North America as a top market but does not produce any vehicles in the United States, making it vulnerable to currency swings and changes in trade rules.
Japan's ""Big 3"" carmakers - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) - face risks if an updated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) raises tariffs on vehicles and parts made in Mexico, where all three operate plants, and Canada, where Toyota and Honda build vehicles.
But their relatively higher U.S. production levels than their smaller rivals and more diverse regional manufacturing and sales footprint could help to cushion any impact.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect Toyota to see a 2.6 percent slide in operating profit in the year to March 2019, a smaller decline than the one expected in Mazda results.
Nissan and Honda, among the Japanese automakers with the most production in North America, could see profit rises of 9 percent and nearly 6 percent, respectively, they forecast.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from multi-lateral TPP trade talks, wants to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Japan. He is also pushing for new terms for the NAFTA and has been considering tougher environmental rules for imported cars to protect U.S. automakers.
Japanese automakers are already struggling with sluggish sales in North America due to falling demand for sedans, a mainstay of their offering, and deeper discounts to shore up sales are hitting margins.
""(W)e see risks to the sustainability of export operations at Mazda Motor and Mitsubishi Motors, which are highly exposed to exports and have no production bases in the U.S. at present,"" Nomura analyst Masataka Kunugimoto said in a research note earlier this month.
While analysts expect Mazda to post a median fall in operating profit of 8.5 percent in the financial year underway, some forecasts are for a much steeper decline. A fall would reverse a 20 percent rise forecast for the year ended March 2018 as a weaker yen boosted its earnings.
Mazda sold roughly 1.6 million vehicles globally in the year to March 2017, nearly 20 percent of them - all imported - in the United States.
Both Mazda and bigger rival Toyota see roughly 30 percent of their global sales from the United States, Canada and Mexico, but around 70 percent of the nearly 3 million cars Toyota currently sells in North America are produced locally in North America.
Mazda, which operates a factory in Mexico, announced earlier this year that it and Toyota would jointly build a manufacturing plant in Alabama, although vehicle production will not begin until 2021.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp's (T:7211) plans to grow U.S. sales from low levels in the coming years but tighter trade rules could stymie those plans.
""I'd be surprised if we have a lot of companies forecasting significant growth,"" CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.
NICHE ASIA MARKETS
As U.S. sales growth stagnates, Japanese automakers are focusing more on Asia. Mazda has been growing sales in China, which is set to overtake the United States as its biggest market in the year just ended.
Nissan earlier this month launched its new Terra model, a crossover SUV designed specifically for the Asian market, while at the Beijing Motor Show this week, both Nissan and Honda showed new battery-electric models for the Chinese market which will go on sale later this year.
Nomura's Kunugimoto and other analysts see brighter earnings prospects for Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) given Japan's No. 4 automaker counts on India for roughly half its total global vehicle sales and production. Suzuki does not market cars in the U.S. market.
Suzuki is set to outperform most of Japan's major automakers, with a median consensus for a 6 percent rise in operating profit in the year to March 2019, following an expected 33 percent jump in the year just ended.
Mitsubishi Motors is also benefiting from a long-standing focus on Asian. This week, it launched exports of its Xpander multi-purpose vehicle across Southeast Asia following strong demand for the Asian model, which debuted in Indonesia last year.

Asia accounts for roughly a third of Mitsubishi Motor's global vehicle sales and the automaker has been increasing production capabilities in Indonesia.

Kim Jong Un will be the first North Korean leader to set foot in the south when he crosses the border on Friday for an historic meeting with President Moon Jae-in. While the easing of tensions may eventually benefit South Korean infrastructure companies, the mending of ties with China is the main reason the fund manager has become more bullish on Korean stocks, said Chetan Sehgal, director of portfolio management for emerging markets equity.
“The South Korea-China relationship is critical and vital,” Singapore-based Sehgal said in an interview. If relations with North Korea improve, “it’s a bonus,” he said, adding that Franklin Templeton was “slightly overweight” Korean stocks.
South Korea’s relationship with China -- its major trading partner and largest source of visitors -- soured over the last few years due to Beijing’s dissatisfaction with Seoul’s decision to deploy a missile defense system with the U.S. The relationship has improved recently, with President Xi Jinping’s special envoy Yang Jiechi telling President Moon on March 30 to expect “visible accomplishments” in bilateral economic issues.
The number of Chinese tourists visiting South Korea rose 13 percent in March from a year earlier, the first increase in a year. The Kospi index has climbed almost 6 percent from this year’s intra-day low on Feb. 9, with tourism-related stocks such as AmorePacific Group Ltd. among the better performers.
Franklin Templeton had increased its weighting to South Korean stocks over the last few months, Sehgal said. The mending relationship with China makes it “far more interesting” and the fund manager also sees “a glimmer of hope” that corporate governance reforms will lead to meaningful change, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China's ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week's U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call.
The Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions.
The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in ""a vacuum"" and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said.
The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead. The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans.
In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was ""a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,"" according to a statement provided by a spokesman.
The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said.
“It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.” 
U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE's equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.
Chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), which is one of ZTE's top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE's business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips. 
It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE's other major business partners include Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN) and GlobalFoundries [CSMF.UL].
LETTER TO BUSINESS PARTNERS
ZTE also sent a letter to its business partners on Wednesday, explaining why it believes the seven-year ban was a ""drastic action"" out of proportion to its misconduct.
According to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters, ZTE said the order should be ""very concerning to all,"" since it took effect without warning to the industry, without waiting for the results of an independent internal investigation due at the end of the month, and without recognition for all the improvements in its export compliance program.  
ZTE invested over $50 million in 2017 in improving its compliance program and planned to increase that spending this year, the letter says.
The Commerce Department ban was ignited when ZTE admitted in March that while it had fired four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to 35 others when it said it had. 
In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took ""immediate remedial action."" 
The order ""sends the wrong message"" to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said.  
It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations ""while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) president said on Thursday that it was very close to a resolution to fix its ailing South Korean unit, as its South Korean union accepted a wage deal.
""Over the last few months, over the last few weeks a lot of very good progress has been made,"" GM President Dan Ammann said in a meeting with South Korean ruling party lawmakers.
""We appreciate constructive efforts from all parties, and we stand here today very close to a resolution,"" Ammann said.
On Monday, the Detroit carmaker reached a preliminary deal with its South Korean labor union, winning concessions on pay and bonuses, allowing the money-losing operation to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.
Unionized workers at GM Korea approved a tentative wage deal agreed with the automaker, which includes a base salary freeze and no bonuses for this year.
The automaker is currently in talks with the South Korean government over an injection of public funds to support the unit.
GM and the state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) are considering increasing the size of their investment from a previously proposed $2.8 billion, a senior government official said on Wednesday.

The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea. KDB holds 17 percent and China's SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) controls the remaining 6 percent.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>","Chinese rental apartment firms issue REITs, but some may struggle to make payouts","By Samuel Shen, Yawen Chen and Clare Jim
SHANGHAI/BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese real estate companies have found a new tool to raise money - selling units in real estate investment trusts (REITs) backed by rental apartments. There is just one problem - in some cases the rental income may not be enough for the returns that REITs issuers indicated they will pay investors.
Over the past six months, nearly half a dozen developers have successfully applied to local stock exchanges for quotas to issue rental apartments REITs totaling 16 billion yuan ($2.53 billion). So far, 2.2 billion yuan of such REITs have been issued.
In March, for example, Poly Real Estate Group (SS:600048) raised 1.7 billion yuan issuing REITs with an indicated annual yield of 5.5 percent for the senior tranche of the securities. Hong Kong-listed developer CIFI Holdings Group (HK:0884) attracted investors with a tranche in its first batch of REITs that promised returns of roughly 6 percent.
The authorities are looking favorably on any real estate companies who have robust plans to develop or acquire rental apartment buildings as this fits with President Xi Jinping's pledge to reduce the speculative nature of the property market and help provide affordable housing for those who don't have enough money to buy.
Chinese developers have in the past couple of years been issuing REITs backed by other form of properties such as office buildings and shopping malls. The market has expanded to 68.7 billion yuan from virtually nothing four years ago, according to consultancy China Securitization Analytics.
But the rental apartment REITs market, and the home rental market itself, have not developed fully - and there is a mismatch between the cost of developments and what renters are willing to pay.
George Yang, a veteran investor in the U.S. apartments market, said he is concerned that rental income would fail to satisfy investors, given China's frothy property prices.
""Whether in the U.S. or Singapore, a net rental yield of 7 percent is the make-or-break threshold for REITs,"" said Yang, managing director of JIC Capital Management Ltd. 
But in China, average rental yields - the rate of income return over the cost of investment - are merely 2-3 percent, lower than the financing cost of 5-6 percent. In some cases, they are lower, or even negative. 
As a result, he says, he doesn't see how the model works in China. In Yang's eyes, China REITs are just another questionable way of borrowing by developers seeking to skirt tougher lending rules imposed in recent times by Beijing. He says the securities are backed more by the developers' credibility than rental income.
Public disclosure by REITs’ issuers about the underlying properties are limited, which is not the case in developed markets, such as the United States. China's REITs are not yet publicly traded. They only change hands among institutional investors.
""Nobody really does due diligence to evaluate the risks,"" said Joe Zhou, head of research at real estate consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle in China. He said even those who wanted to do it would find it difficult to get detailed information about the underlying assets.
Some investors are less concerned about the dividend as they are buying the REITs in hopes of gains in the value of the assets.
""Some investors are eyeing ... the prospect of connecting to the retail market,"" said a senior executive at CIFI, referring to expectations that China will open the REITs market to retail investors, potentially boosting valuations. 
""When there's more liquidity, investors' demand for yield will go down,"" said the executive.
CIFI itself is issuing REITs as a product that is sold in two structured tranches to investors with drastically different risk appetites - one for those who seek guaranteed fixed returns, and the other for those who bet on asset appreciation.
REIT FAILURE FEARS
The government is hoping that a booming REITs market can create a financial tool to help developers weaken their reliance on the traditional model of build-and-sell, said Wang Xi, executive vice president at developer Yanlord Land Group Ltd (SI:YNLG).
Liu Qiao, professor of finance and dean of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, forecast that China's rental apartment REITs market has the potential to expand to as much as 1.5 trillion yuan - but he warned that there are huge challenges ahead.
""One major problem is a shortage of assets with relatively high yields. You also need tax incentives to support the market,"" Liu said.
He also said he is worried that the market could be killed off in its infancy if there is a major REIT failure.
In November, China Young Professional Apartments Ltd, which was established as a specialist apartment rental firm and converts office buildings into apartments, raised 270 million yuan issuing REITs.
In March, it partnered with China Construction Bank to launch a 2 billion yuan fund to acquire properties which its founder Wang Gehong hopes will eventually be securitized in the form of REITs.
But Wang says other developers will struggle to back their REIT plans with actual rental apartments.
""Developers are applying (for REITs quotas) to raise 1 billion, 2 billion, 10 billion yuan, but where are the apartments?"" he asked.
""It's difficult for developers now to issue bonds or get loans, so suddenly they find this really handy tool to raise money.""

While still feeling the pressure from rising yields in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. markets managed to eke out small gains on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.25% and the S&P 500 rose 0.18%. The Nasdaq gave up just 0.05%, as tech stocks continued to struggle.
Treasury yields continued to rise on Wednesday, shoring up the U.S. dollar but also pressuring stocks. The yield on 10-year notes continued their rise after topping 3% on Tuesday, the highest level since January 2014.
Stock markets throughout Asia posted generally in the red by 9:50PM ET (01:50 GMT).
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 0.46% after finishing sharply lower on Wednesday, with losses across a variety of sectors including financials, insurance, oil and casinos.
One stock in focus is Lenovo Group (HK:0992), which has faced significant pressure, dropping after losing more than 10% in the last month. Computer-maker Lenovo Group (HK:0992)was down 0.81% to HK$3.69 in Thursday morning trade in Asia. Reports have that Lenovo is currently the most shorted stock on the Hang Seng Index at the moment have only added to the pressure. After the drop, Lenovo is close to losing its spot on the index that tracks the 40 largest companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
In China, the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.53% shortly after opening on Thursday. The Shenzhen Composite Index was down 1.15%.
Investors in Asia are still looking for clarity on the prospects for interest rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve and what that might mean for the greenback, which has been increasing. Oil prices are also rising, adding to costs and raising the spectre of inflation.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was trading up 0.46% halfway into the morning session. Investors in Japan are not looking to Friday and the latest policy decision from the Bank of Japan as well as its quarterly outlook.
South Korea's Kospi was up 1.14%, regaining lost ground from Wednesday. Investors there, as in much of the rest of Asia, are keeping an eye on a meeting Friday between the leaders of North Korea and South Korea, that could go some way towards alleviating some geopolitical worries. In focus was Samsung (KS:005930), which reported a sixth quarter of record profits Thursday and may have helped turn the slump in tech stocks. Samsung shares climbed more than 3% in the morning.
Coming off the ANZAC Day holiday, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 in Sidney was up a modest 0.23%."
29,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2018 05:26AM ET</span>",World stocks edgy as rising bond yields raise fears for growth and profits,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World markets remained edgy on Thursday, with shares eking out gains amid concern over the global economic outlook and with U.S. bond yields at four-year highs after breaking above the psychologically significant 3 percent line this week.
Investors will be watching the European Central Bank later for clues on when it will signal an end-date for its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.2 trillion) asset-buying program.
Equities enjoyed strong gains in South Korea, where electronics conglomerate and key tech bellwether Samsung (KS:005930) posted record quarterly profits, while Japan's Nikkei added 0.5 percent.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Dow Jones benchmark snapped a five-day losing streak thanks to more strong corporate earnings. While the Nasdaq tech index fell again, it could benefit from a strong after-market rise in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which posted forecast-beating results.
Equity futures were tipping Nasdaq to open 0.4 percent higher while the other two indexes are seen only marginally higher.
But the momentum fizzed in Europe where shares flatlined near one-week lows, as a mixed set of earnings weighed, including a 79 percent profit drop at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
All that kept MSCI's all-country equity index only marginally in the black after five straight days of losses.
Investors remain cautious even though company after company, especially in the United States, has posted record-shattering first quarter results. Instead, signs of ebbing economic growth momentum are preying on their minds, alongside higher global borrowing costs that could dent future earnings.
Oil's 11 percent rise this year, on top of last year's 18 percent jump, is adding to inflation fears.
""The music is still playing and we are still dancing, but we are reducing risk,"" said Pau Morilla-Giner, chief investment officer at London & Capital.
""The worry is about an overheating, leading to a rise in inflation, higher interest rates which bring on a textbook recession."" 
Ten-year Treasury yields, the reference rate for global borrowing, extended their yield surge. Having risen around 25 basis points since early-April, the yield is a whisker off the 3.041 percent mark that would be a new four-year high.
The yield has risen for six straight days - the longest upward run since September 2017, according to Reuters data.
(Graphic: U.S.-led bond selloff - https://reut.rs/2KdVhHe)
That, alongside the rise in commodity prices has led companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to warn of surging costs while heavy equipment maker,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) said its buoyant first-quarter earnings could be the ""high water mark"".
While 81.2 percent of U.S. earnings have beaten consensus estimates and Thomson Reuters data projects first-quarter earnings growth at 22 percent, investors fear such warnings from other companies.
""We have been on a real high with corporate profitability so people got psyched up about those numbers getting even better,"" said Peter Lowman, CIO of UK-based wealth manager Investment Quorum.
""But with Treasury yields rising, people are worrying we may be peaking on profits, or if GDP growth is peaking and we are now in a situation where markets are getting very nervous,"" he said, noting the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared to be in no mood to brake its rate-hike program.

ECB WATCH
The European Central Bank is expected to keep policy unchanged at its meeting ending on Thursday and will likely play down the recent softness in the euro economy.
Euro zone bond yields, swept up in the Treasury market momentum, inched down from multi-week highs before the meeting, and the euro firmed off eight-week lows against the dollar  .
Money-market pricing suggests investors expect the ECB to deliver a rate hike by June 2019, having pushed back expectations from early next year. 
(Graphic: ECB to kick off rate hikes in mid-2019? - https://reut.rs/2KbVFpP)
 Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) strategist Orlando Green said markets expected ECB President Mario Draghi to focus on the softer recent data and address concerns about euro strength and global trade tensions.
""The risk is that he is less dovish than expected,"" Green added.
That could provide a lift to the euro which has sold off in recent days against the dollar to approach its March 1 level of $1.2154 -- weakest since mid-January. It fetched $1.21775 before the ECB meeting.
Sweden's central bank meanwhile remained dovish at a policy meeting, pushing the crown to the lowest versus the euro since late-2009.

In contrast, the dollar has powered higher in recent weeks to hit 3-1/2 month highs against a basket of G10 peers, supported by rising debt yields. Against the yen it traded this week at 109.490, its strongest since Feb. 8.

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) said weakness in the global smartphone market would slow earnings growth, as it reported record quarterly profit on Thursday thanks to strong demand for semiconductors used in servers. 
The world's biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and television sets also flagged softer demand for smartphone OLED panels as a challenge for the second quarter, while its cash-cow chip business should remain strong. 
""Generating overall earnings growth across the company will be a challenge due to weakness in the display panel segment and a decline in profitability in the mobile business amid rising competition in the high-end segment,"" the South Korean giant said in a statement. 
Samsung Electronics shares were up 2.7 percent as of 0412 GMT, while the KOSPI benchmark share price index (KS11) was 1.3 percent higher, as investors shrugged off concerns about the smartphone market and seized on the outlook for memory chips. 
""Shares are rising as Samsung Electronics' outlook for its memory chip business appears more positive than we've heard from other companies,"" said Greg Roh, analyst at HMC Investment & Securities. 
South Korean rival  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330) separately warned this month of slower growth in smartphone chip sales. TSMC, a key supplier for Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhones, cut its revenue target last week.
But Samsung Electronics, a rival and supplier to Apple, forecast continuing strong sales not only of server chips but mobile chips as well. 
Sewon Chun, senior vice president at Samsung's memory business, said the trend toward ""high-density"" chips with more processing power and bigger storage capacity would underpin demand for mobile DRAM and NAND chips this year.
This was being driven by new applications such as high-performance gaming, he told an earnings call. 
Samsung Electronics said operating profit was 15.6 trillion won ($14.4 billion) in the first quarter, up 58 percent from a year ago and in line with the 15.6 trillion won the company had estimated. Revenue jumped 19.8 percent to 60.6 trillion won, also in line with its estimate. 
CHIPS UPSIDE
The chip business was Samsung's top earner again as it booked a record 11.6 trillion won operating profit in January-March, from 10.9 trillion won in the previous quarter, despite signs the recent boom in memory chips was tapering off. 
Samsung hinted at further potential upside after the United States banned U.S. firms from doing business with Chinese mobile phone and telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) (HK:0763). 
ZTE would be forced to look elsewhere for mobile chips if top supplier  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) is locked out by the U.S. ban. 
Ben Hur, vice president of Samsung's System LSI business, which competes with Qualcomm, said Samsung would ""actively respond"" to new clients when he was asked by analysts if the ban would help Samsung's chip sales in China.
Samsung said its mobile business booked 3.8 trillion won in quarterly profit, up 82 percent from a year ago. Its flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone hit the market in mid-March.
According to market research firm GfK, global smartphone demand fell two percent to 347 million units in the first quarter of 2018. Demand was especially sluggish in China and North America, it said. 
However, the average sales price grew 21 percent year-on-year in the quarter, leading to an 18 percent rise in global smartphone revenue to $129.8 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - British bank  Barclays  (L:BARC) and digital payments firm PayPal (O:PYPL) have announced a partnership that will see them explore ways to combine their services for customers, Barclays said on Thursday.
The pair aim to allow Barclays customers in the United States and Britain to use their PayPal accounts on the bank's online and mobile phone-based platforms while Barclays products will be used in PayPal accounts.
The move comes amid mounting concerns from bank industry executives that big technology companies such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and Apple (O:AAPL) in the U.S. or China's  Alibaba  (K:BABA) could come to dominate the $1.8 trillion global payments industry.
With their ever-expanding customer bases and nimbler platforms, the tech companies could supplant the banks as the face of an industry that accounts for 34 percent of all banking revenues, according to consultancy McKinsey.
The announcement from Barclays shows one route traditional lenders are taking, to try and collaborate with large technology companies rather than compete.
Amazon and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) are exploring offering a checking account together in the U.S., according to media reports in March, while those two firms plus Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) are mulling a collaboration on healthcare payments.
Barclays and PayPal made clear that they are still discussing possible ways the companies' services could be combined.
""By joining forces, we can make it much easier for people to manage their money and payments,"" Barclays UK Chief Executive Ashok Vaswani said in the bank's statement.
Tech firms face their own obstacles in trying to break into the financial sector, from stringent regulations on any activity resembling deposit-taking to customers trusting banks more than new tech firms to safeguard their money.

The announcement comes as Barclays prepares to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday, with investors focused on whether it can improve profits to match its U.S. rivals.

(Reuters) - Billionaire Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund firm was sued on Wednesday by a San Francisco money manager seeking to stop it from using its name on a new investing project.
Aperio Group LLC, which said it has more than $25 billion of assets under management, said Cohen's Point72 Asset Management LP has caused confusion among customers, causing them to believe the two firms are connected.
The complaint refers to Point72's planned use of the name for a ""quantitative investing project."" 
Aperio said sources of confusion have included a published article and television report discussing Aperio and Point72, and an abstract for a Stanford University seminar featuring a ""managing director and chief data scientist for Aperio"" who was also ""responsible for Point72's big data research team.""
Mark Herr, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based Point72, declined to comment.
In its complaint filed in San Francisco federal court, Aperio said Point72 has filed to register the trademark Point72 Aperio, and is causing ""irreparable and substantial injury in the goodwill that Aperio has developed in its Aperio mark.""
The complaint seeks to recoup unspecified damages for alleged unfair competition, and stop Point72 from using Point72 Aperio and similar names.
Aperio sued Point72 nearly four months after the end of Cohen's two-year ban on managing outside money, the result of a settlement with U.S. regulators following an insider trading probe involving his prior firm, SAC Capital Advisors LP.
Cohen was not criminally charged. In February, a female Point72 employee filed a separate lawsuit accusing the firm of discrimination. Point72 has denied her allegations.

The case is Aperio Group LLC v Point72 LP, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-02466.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Big data analytics are helping  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) helicopter unit improve the maintenance of its aircraft and cut costs by identifying patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed, Sikorsky President Dan Schultz said on Wednesday.
For instance, the company redesigned a wrench after a data-driven analysis of repairs on the CH-53E heavy-lift helicopter revealed that mechanics were damaging the swash plate part of the rotor if they slipped while tightening bolts. 
""We went to the assistant secretary of the Navy and showed him a wrench. We said, 'This is saving you $800,000 a year,'"" Schultz, a former Marine Corps helicopter pilot, told Reuters in an interview at the ILA Berlin Air Show.
""We're using health and monitoring data, coupled with analysis with big data, to make improvements and keep parts on the airplane longer,"" he said.
Lockheed was also beginning to use the same data-crunching algorithms to study data from its F-35 stealth fighter jet, he said. 
Sikorsky's new CH-53K King Stallion made its international flying debut at the air show on Wednesday, undeterred by a sudden rainstorm, and will perform a more ambitious flying program on Thursday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel got a chance to see both helicopters on the tarmac during a visit to open the air show on Wednesday, but the rain prevented her from clambering around inside the planes as initially planned.
Sikorsky said it leased the aircraft backed from the U.S. Marine Corps, shipped it to Germany in a C-17 transport plane, and has been flying it successfully for nearly a month.
The CH-53K will compete against Boeing Co's smaller (N:BA) twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook helicopter in a German military competition valued at around 4 billion euros.
Both companies have assembled industrial teams in Germany to build parts and service the planes if they win the bids. 
The defense ministry expects to release a formal request for proposals in the second half of 2018, with a contract award due in mid-2020, for deliveries to start in 2023.
Schultz said Sikorsky's approach to building helicopters, including building all its own transmissions, coupled with data analytics and other tools, had helped it boost readiness rates to well above 90 percent, a key selling point.
He said Sikorsky also remained in discussions with Israel, which is also considering buying the CH-53K helicopter for its military.

Nathalie Previte, Sikorsky vice president for strategy and business development, said a third country had requested a classified briefing on the helicopter from the U.S. government, but declined to identify it.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on Wednesday recommended investors vote to support a shareholder proposal calling for gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co to report on gun safety, which could put new attention on so-called ""smart gun"" technology.
In a note to clients, ISS also backed the election of all director nominees at Sturm Ruger ahead of its shareholder meeting scheduled for May 9.
The board of Connecticut company Sturm Ruger had recommended investors vote against the call for the safety report. Its proxy statement said that ""the intentional criminal misuse of firearms is beyond our control. Similarly, the constitutional right of firearms ownership carries with it certain responsibilities and the Company has long advocated the safe and responsible ownership and use of firearms.""
Sturm Ruger representatives did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
Second-ranked proxy adviser Glass Lewis made the same recommendations to Sturm Ruger investors on April 14, citing gun violence as a risk to the company's reputation.
Just what additional steps if any weapons makers should take on safety has drawn renewed interest in the wake of a shooting at a Florida high school in February in which 17 people were killed.
Banks including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) lately have restricted lending to clients involved with firearms. Also, asset managers including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group have said they would raise safety concerns with gunmakers whose stocks they own.
BlackRock and Vanguard are the top two investors in Sturm Ruger, together with about 25 percent of shares.
Representatives for both firms declined to discuss how they might vote at Sturm Ruger.
The shareholder proposal was filed by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary in Oregon. It asks the company report on gun safety such as how it monitors violence, research on safer guns, and its assessment of risks to its reputation.
The proposal mentions smart guns, designs with electronic limits on their ability to fire, which it says could help reduce accidental shootings and suicides.
Smart guns have faced opposition from gun rights groups concerned about their practicality and legislative implications.

ISS wrote the technology could make guns safer, and that a market for smart guns could help overcome engineering problems. ISS noted the proposal does not call for the production of smart guns, but only seeks evidence that Sturm Ruger's board is properly assessing risks.

(Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's on Wednesday maintained the United States' top-notch ""Aaa"" credit rating, saying the country's ""exceptional"" economic strength would counterbalance lower fiscal strength.
The ratings agency also kept its stable outlook on the United States and said it expects Washington to resolve its recent trade dispute with China. Massive tax cuts signed into law in December, which Republicans said would pay for themselves, will balloon the U.S. deficit in years ahead, the Congressional Budget Office said on April 9. Moody's said it expects U.S. federal budget deficits to widen over the medium term, but that the country's strong economy and strong institutions would counterbalance lower fiscal strength. ""The diversity, dynamism, and competitiveness of the U.S. economy, along with the U.S. dollar's status as the pre-eminent international reserve currency and very large size and depth of the U.S. Treasury market, offset rising fiscal pressures stemming from ageing-related entitlement spending, higher debt service payments, and recent policy actions that will likely reduce future revenues and increase expenditures,"" Moody's said in a statement. Moody's is watching the recent trade conflict between China and the United States, but does not expect tariffs announced by both countries to be fully implemented. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States would likely reach a trade agreement with China and that officials from both sides would sit down for negotiations in a few days. ""If things ultimately progress in a way that is outside of the base case, that would be negative for both countries and for the global market place, but our expectation is this will be negotiated back from the headlines you're reading,"" said Moody's Senior Credit Officer William Foster. Standard & Poor's is the only one of three major U.S. bond agencies that does not currently assign the top-notch AAA-rating to the world's biggest economy.  
In 2011, S&P stripped the United States of its coveted top rating over a debt ceiling showdown in Washington, citing ""political brinkmanship"" during the debate over raising the government’s legal borrowing limit.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Ford accelerates cost-cutting plan, will drop most U.S. sedans","By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Wednesday outlined a plan to cut costs and boost profit margins at a faster pace than previously announced, which includes dropping traditional sedan models in North America that have become increasingly unpopular with consumers.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it now plans to cut $25.5 billion in costs by 2022, up from $14 billion in cuts it announced last fall.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett told investors the company is undergoing ""a profound refocus"" of its operations and may exit unprofitable businesses. 
""We'll restructure as necessary, and we'll be decisive,"" he said. ""We're going to feed the healthy part of our business,"" and dispose of marginal operations, Hackett added.
Ford said it expects pretax profit margins of 8 percent globally and 10 percent in North America by 2020, ahead of a previous target of 2022.
The company's stock was up 2.6 percent at $11.40 in after-hours trading.
Responding to a shift in consumer demand to SUVs and pickup trucks, Ford said it planned to trim its North American car portfolio to just two models: the sporty Mustang, which debuted 50 years ago this month, and a new compact crossover called Focus Active starting in 2019. 
Ford ""will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America,"" including the midsize Fusion and full-size Taurus, the company said.
The automaker has been under pressure from Wall Street investors to improve its product lineup and lift flagging profit margins. In 2017, the company's pretax profit fell to $8.4 billion from $10.3 billion.
In March, Ford executives unveiled ambitious plans to shift the struggling automaker's product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and reduce development and manufacturing costs - aimed at boosting profits and the automaker's share price.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday as the company reported first-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said ""we have looked at every single part of the business . . . We are driven to turn this business around.""
Ford reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, with a 7 percent increase in revenue and a lower effective tax rate offsetting a jump in costs, especially higher commodity prices.
The company reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.74 billion, or 43 cents per share, up from $1.6 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 41 cents. 
Despite the higher profit, Ford's adjusted pretax profit margin fell to 5.2 percent from 6.4 percent in the same quarter in 2017.
CFO Shanks said the company expected that commodity costs would represent a $1.5 billion ""headwind"" in 2018, $500 million of which came in the first quarter. 
The lion's share of the automaker's quarterly profit was driven by high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs in North America. Europe was the only other region to turn a profit for Ford. 
The company's loss in its Asia Pacific region was driven by slumping sales in China, where Ford has just begun to introduce new models.
Shanks said the Lincoln brand still is losing money in China, where it launched in 2015, but now plans to begin local production there in 2020.

Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations, said Ford plans to build a new product its Hermosillo plant in Mexico when it quits production of the Fusion sedan, and will also build a new battery electric vehicle in Mexico.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 07:07PM ET</span>","PayPal quarterly profit beats estimates, shares rise","By Aishwarya Venugopal and Anna Irrera
(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc on Wednesday reported first-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates as the payment processor benefited from higher volumes of mobile payments and strong merchant services business. 
PayPal processed $132 billion in payments in the first quarter of 2018, up 32 percent from a year earlier. 
Mobile payment volumes were up 52 percent in the quarter to $49 billion, while merchant services payment volumes grew 30 percent and accounted for 87 percent of total payment volumes. 
Shares of the company, which closed down 1.7 percent, rose 3.3 pct to $76.43 after the bell.
""Overall we believe this was a solid quarter for PayPal,"" Josh Olson, a senior analyst at Edward Jones Research, said in a note. ""As the digital payments leader, we see PayPal benefiting from the fast-growing industry."" 
Since separating from online marketplace eBay in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from mostly processing transactions for its parent company to offering an array of global digital payment services. 
These range from small business lending to facilitating money transfers between merchants and customers, as well as friends and family. 
The company has sought to grow through acquisitions and partnerships with large banks and technology firms including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
PayPal recently introduced a Mastercard payments card to enable customers to spend their PayPal balance in millions of physical stores and partnered with popular Kenyan mobile payments service M-pesa.
""We are clearly transforming from a payments button to an open digital payments platform,"" CEO Dan Schulman said on an earnings call with analysts.
""The goal of that platform is to enable merchants to compete in the mobile, digital payments world,"" Schulman added in an interview. 
Venmo, the company's peer-to-peer payments app, processed more than $12 billion in payments in the quarter up 80 percent over the same period last year. 
The San Jose, California based company raised revenue forecast for the full year to $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion from $15 billion to $15.2 billion.
Net income rose to $511 million, or 42 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $384 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 57 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Net revenue rose about 24 percent to $3.69 billion, beating expectations of $3.59 billion.

54,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Jobless Claims, Durable Goods, Bond Yields in Focus
U.S. bond yields are expected to continue to monopolise investor focus as top-tier U.S. economic data could strengthen investor expectations for sustained economic growth and inflation.
The Commerce Department’s report on core durable goods orders due 8:30 am ET is expected to show a 0.5% increase for March, slower than the 1% rise seen in the prior month.
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended April 20, expected to show jobless claims fell to 230,000 from 232,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are forecast to fall to 1.850 million from 1.863 million the prior week.
Continued tightness in the labor market, leading to an uptick in wage growth has contributed to the turnaround in inflation, which is set to hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in the coming quarter, according to Wells Fargo.
“With real GDP accelerating in the coming quarter and core inflation reaching 2% around the same time, we believe the Fed will hike three more times this year,” Wells Fargo said Wednesday in a weekly note to clients.
Investors will also be watching EUR/USD as the European Central Bank on Thursday at 07:45 am ET is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates but could tout a willingness to consider a more hawkish outlook on monetary policy.
The dollar rose sharply against a basket of major currencies, as the U.S. 10-year treasury yield added to gains above 3%.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Crude Oil Rally in Focus
Natural gas prices traded roughly flat on Wednesday ahead of data expected to show an ongoing draw in natural gas storage.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage fell by 12 billion cubic feet last week.
Natural gas prices are expected to remain range-bound despite storage levels plunging to a 4 year-low.
Traders are also expected to monitor developments in oil markets as crude oil prices shrugged off an unexpected rise in crude supplies.
Crude futures settled at $68.05 a barrel, up 35 cents.
3. Facebook to Lift Nasdaq From Funk?
Shares of Facebook rallied in afterhours trade on Wednesday, after a strong quarterly report from the tech giant beat estimates on both top and bottom lines.
The tech giant reported earnings-per-share of $1.69 per share on $11.97 billion in revenue against analysts’ expectations of earnings-per-share of $1.35 on $11.41 billion in revenue.
Monthly active users (MAUs), one of the metrics that analysts use to gauge the health of the company, increased to 2.2 billion in the first quarter, in-line with Wall Street estimates.
Daily active users (DAUs), showed robust growth for the quarter, rising to 1.45 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates.
Facebook's quarterly results come as CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to implement changes to secure user data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
“We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good,” Zuckerberg said.
Investors remained keen to establish how the proposed measures to secure the platform and the recent fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal would impact future performance.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 07:56PM ET</span>",Qualcomm chip sales indicate some smartphone strength,"By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) quarterly profit and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from suppliers.
The results announced in Qualcomm's smartphone chip business contrasted to those from major mobile phone components makers in Asia, including TSMC (TW:2330) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660), which have warned of slower growth in their smartphone chip divisions.
While revenue from Qualcomm's chips division - its largest - rose 6 percent in the three months ended March 25, revenue from the licensing business plunged 44 percent, reflecting the withholding of revenue in a high-profile patent battle with Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Despite the strong quarter for chip sales, the company does see some signs of weakness. 
It forecast growth of about 5 percent in modern mobile handsets for the remainder of the year, which is lower than anticipated. Handset prices, however, are higher than expected. 
""Qualcomm posted solid results, but its guidance pointed to a softer handset market, particularly in China,"" said Moody's Senior Vice President Rick Lane.
Qualcomm also is waiting for Chinese regulators to consider its application to buy chipmaker NXP, a deal that Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf expects to go through. If it does not, Qualcomm plans to use the cash dedicated to the deal for a share buy-back. The deal was held up by diplomatic concerns between countries, rather than Qualcomm-specific concerns, he said.
The biggest spat is over a U.S. ban on exports to China's ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) after it was caught exporting to Iran. Qualcomm said it expects the loss of business with ZTE to lower its profits by 3 cents per share next quarter, though executives also suggested that other smart phone makers that it also does business with may make up for that lost revenue in the longer term.
The results come as San Diego-based Qualcomm tries to convince shareholders it can boost earnings by cutting annual costs by $1 billion and resolving the Apple dispute.
Qualcomm on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue of between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, and adjusted earnings of 65 to 75 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.32 billion and earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Qualcomm's quarterly net income fell to $363 million, or 24 cents per share, from $749 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, ahead of analysts' average estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue rose 4.9 percent to $5.26 billion, topping expectations of $5.19 billion.
Qualcomm shares rose 1 percent to $50.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

The sentiment also appeared to help boost other chipmakers in after-hours trading, with memory chipmaker Micron Technology (O:MU) up 1 percent to $48.12 after the announcement.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 07:58PM ET</span>","Facebook's rise in profits, users shows resilience after scandals","By David Ingram and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) shares rose on Wednesday after the social network reported a surprisingly strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign that business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of personal data.
After easily beating Wall Street expectations, shares traded up 7.1 percent after the bell at $171, paring a month-long decline that began with Facebook's disclosure in March that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had harvested data belonging to millions of users. 
The Cambridge Analytica scandal, affecting up to 87 million users and prompting several apologies from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, generated calls for regulation and for users to leave the social network, but there was no indication advertisers immediately changed their spending.
""Everybody keeps talking about how bad things are for Facebook, but this earnings report to me is very positive, and reiterates that Facebook is fine, and they'll get through this,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company. His firm holds about 73,000 shares in Facebook. 
Facebook's quarterly profit beat analysts' estimates, as a 49 percent jump in quarterly revenue outpaced a 39 percent rise in expenses from a year earlier. The mobile ad business grew on a push to add more video content. 
Facebook said monthly active users in the first quarter rose to 2.2 billion, up 13 percent from a year earlier and matching expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company reversed last quarter's decline in the number of daily active users in the United States and Canada, saying it had 185 million users there, up from 184 million in the fourth quarter. 
The results are a bright spot for the world's largest social network amid months of negative headlines about the company's handling of personal information, its role in elections and its fueling of violence in developing countries. 
Facebook, which generates revenue primarily by selling advertising personalized to its users, has demonstrated for several quarters how resilient its business model can be as long as users keep coming back to scroll through its News Feed and watch its videos. 
It is spending to ensure users are not scared away by scandals. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner told analysts on a call that expenses this year would grow between 50 percent and 60 percent, up from a prior range of 45 percent to 60 percent. 
Much of Facebook's ramp-up in spending is for safety and security, Wehner said. The category includes efforts to root out fake accounts, scrub hate speech and take down violent videos. 
Facebook said it ended the first quarter with 27,742 employees, up 48 percent from a year earlier.
""So long as profits continue to grow at a rapid rate, investors will accept that higher spending to ensure privacy is warranted,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. 
It has been nearly two years since Facebook shares rose 7 percent or more during a trading day. They rose 7.2 percent on April 28, 2016, the day after another first-quarter earnings report.
Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders rose in the first quarter to $4.99 billion, or $1.69 per share, from $3.06 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.35 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total revenue was $11.97 billion, above the analyst estimate of $11.41 billion. 
The company declined to provide some details sought by analysts. It has not shared the revenue generated by Instagram, the photo-sharing app it owns, and it declined to provide details about time spent on Facebook. Facebook also owns the popular smartphone apps Messenger and WhatsApp. 
Tighter regulation could make Facebook's ads less lucrative by reducing the kinds of data it can use to personalize and target ads to users, although Facebook's size means it could also be well positioned to cope with regulations. 
Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google together dominate the internet ad business worldwide. Facebook is expected to take 18 percent of global digital ad revenue this year, compared with Google's 31 percent, according to research firm eMarketer. 
The company said it was increasing the amount of money authorized to repurchase shares by an additional $9 billion. It had initially authorized repurchases up to $6 billion. 
Facebook shares closed at $185.09 on March 16, the day that the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke after the bell on a Friday. In the days immediately afterward, the company lost more than $50 billion in market value. 
The Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has sparked government investigations globally, was mentioned only once on an hour-long conference call between analysts and Facebook management, when one analyst asked Zuckerberg what he learned from testifying in U.S. congressional hearings. 

Zuckerberg said the two days of hearings this month were ""an important moment for the company to hear the feedback, and to show what we're doing.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) rallied on Wednesday ahead of the company's first quarterly report under a new chief executive hired to turn around the struggling burrito chain.
Chipotle has surged 36 percent since announcing in February that it hired Brian Niccol from Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) Taco Bell unit as CEO to win back customers lost after a series of food safety lapses.
Wall Street's recent optimism has focused on what Niccol is likely to do, rather than on Chipotle's performance during his short time at the helm.
Niccol, known for his menu and marketing prowess, could refresh Chipotle's limited offerings by, for instance, adding quesadillas, nachos or margaritas, and he could streamline operations across the chain's 2,408 restaurants. 
He replaced Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who failed to put Chipotle back on track following outbreaks of E.coli, Salmonella and norovirus in 2015 that sickened hundreds of U.S. customers and crushed sales. The stock has lost half of its value from record highs just before those mishaps. 
Niccol, who will lead his first quarterly conference call with analysts on Wednesday after the stock market closes, took the helm on March 5, with under a month remaining in the quarter. 
""It seems unlikely that the quarter really will matter here as the focus will be entirely on new CEO Brian Niccol's thoughts,"" Quo Vadis Capital President John Zolidis wrote in a client note. 
Chipotle's stock was up 2.1 percent at $340.20 at mid-day, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise in the S&P 500. Options activity implied traders expect a 6.6 percent swing in Chipotle's stock by Friday, according to Trade Alerts.
So far, Niccol has brought in a Taco Bell alum to replace long-time Chipotle marketing chief Mark Crumpacker, who in 2017 pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. He also announced plans to cut food and packaging waste and linked executive compensation to sales and margin growth at restaurants.
Under Niccol, Chipotle could also boost technology-enabled sales and increase catering and deliveries, Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson wrote in a report.

Analysts on average expect Chipotle to report a 1.3 percent increase in same-store sales, according to Consensus Metrix. Overall revenue is seen increasing 7.7 percent to $1.15 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.57, according to Thomson Reuters data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) has reached a $33.5 million settlement with Maryland over state claims related to the German automaker's excess emissions, court documents show.
Volkswagen previously agreed to spend more than $750 million to resolve various state environmental and consumer claims in the United States.
In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The Maryland settlement includes a $29 million cash payment and another $4.5 million payment if Volkswagen does not use a Maryland-based port facility for some logistical operations over five years.
Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said in an interview Wednesday that the state had received benefits valued at nearly twice the value per vehicle as states that settled collectively with Volkswagen in 2016.
Frosh said the settlement sends a ""clear message to auto manufacturers that violating laws designed to protect our environment and the health of our citizens is unacceptable and will result in harsh penalties."" He called VW's conduct ""outrageous.""
Volkswagen must also introduce three additional battery electric vehicle models in Maryland, including the currently available e-Golf or its successor or replacement models through 2019, a provision it previously agreed to with the state of California.
Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan called the agreement an ""important step forward for Volkswagen in resolving legacy exposure to state and local environmental claims related to the diesel matter in the United States.""
She added that ""following a recent federal court ruling, we consider the few remaining environmental claims pending in state courts to be preempted by federal law.""
Last week, a U.S. judge dismissed environmental lawsuits filed against Volkswagen over excess diesel emissions by Salt Lake County, Utah and Hillsborough County, Florida.

A Maryland judge must still approve the settlement.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Most AIB institutional shareholders back scuppered bonus plan,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Most of Allied Irish Banks' (AIB) (I:AIBG) institutional shareholders backed a proposal to introduce a deferred share plan for senior executives that the government used its majority shareholding to block last week.
AIB had sought to introduce the scheme to mitigate the risks it says it faces in retaining key staff and decided to put the plan to a non-binding vote at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday to gauge the view of investors who bought a 29 percent stake in Europe's largest initial public offering last year.
Most of those shareholders backed the proposal, narrowing the margin the vote was defeated by with 76 percent opposed and 24 percent in favor.
The bank fears it may lose staff to international banks that are moving operations to Dublin as a result of Brexit, and do not fall under the cap on executive pay and ban on bonuses that Dublin introduced during its banking crisis a decade ago.
The proposed plan would be worth as much as 100 percent of salary and vest only if the state was able to sell more of its 71 percent holding. 
While Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe acknowledged the restrictions could act as a barrier to the retention of some staff and launched a review of banking remuneration policy, he said the current policy remained appropriate.
As well as banning bonuses and capping bankers' pay at 500,000 euros ($609,000), the then government also passed a law in 2011 to introduce a so-called 'super tax' of 89 percent on any banking remuneration over 20,000 euros. 
""We've had very high turnover rates for senior positions and that's been true for a number of years, more than 20 senior executives from a team of about 10 have left over a five-year period,"" AIB CEO Bernard Byrne told reporters.
""We'd like to operate on a level playing field.""
In a trading update, AIB said its new lending in Ireland rose by 18 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, increasing its share of the local mortgage market to 33 percent, while its stock of non-performing exposures fell by 1 billion euros to 9.2 billion, representing 14.5 percent of gross loans.
The bank's net interest margin excluding cured loan interest - a measure of the profitability of a bank's lending - stood at 2.50 percent at the end of March, in line with the underlying position at the end of 2017. 
Its core tier one capital ratio fell a touch to 17.1 percent from 17.5 percent at the end of last year, still far above its medium-term target of 13 percent as strong profitability was offset predominantly by the impact of the new IFRS 9 accounting principle.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 02:17PM ET</span>",NYSE glitch forces Amazon and Alphabet traders elsewhere,"By John McCrank and Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday that trading was suspended on its exchange in five stocks, including Amazon and Alphabet, for the rest of the day due to a technical glitch involving trade reporting. 
The exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), said the suspension was due to a ""price scale code"" issue and any open orders in those securities would be canceled.
The securities can still be traded on other exchanges, including those run by Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ), where the affected stocks are listed, Cboe Global Markets (O:CBOE) and IEX Group.
Aside from Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and both Alphabet share classes (O:GOOGL) (O:GOOG), affected symbols included Booking Holdings (O:BKNG) and Zion Oil and Gas Equity Warrants . 
A spokeswoman for the NYSE, Kristen Kaus, said the issue affected a small subset of clients whose trading reports in the affected symbols were being returned in an unexpected format, so the exchange suspended trading in the five securities to minimize customer impact.
There are 13 U.S. stock exchanges, around 40 private trading venues known as dark pools and dozens of single-dealer platforms. The NYSE trading suspension highlights the complexity of the fragmented market, but also its resiliency, given that stocks can trade elsewhere when one exchange has a problem. 
The NYSE is one of last U.S. exchanges to have a physical trading floor, and prior to April 9, only securities that were listed on the exchange could be traded there. But following a recent technology upgrade, the NYSE said it would begin trading securities listed on other exchanges as well. 
The trading suspension was not likely related to the technology upgrade, Kaus said.

In March, the NYSE and two of its affiliate exchanges were fined $14 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, partly in response to a nearly four-hour trading halt in July 2015 that was the result of a flawed software roll out.

The bank, Germany's largest, has been under pressure to cut costs and return to profitability after three years of losses. Deutsche Bank had been seeking permission to use the deposits more freely for some time.
The funds will not be used for risky ventures in investment banking.
""Deutsche Bank received approval,"" the spokesman said.
The ECB, which supervises Deutsche Bank, declined to comment.
Deutsche Bank is in the process of integrating Postbank, the retail banking business once owned by the German postal service, with its own retail banking operations to save costs.
The new business will have 20 million customers with about 325 billion euros ($395.92 billion) in deposits, according to Deutsche Bank.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 01:12PM ET</span>",Millennials turn to parents to navigate money milestones,"By Andrea Januta
April 25 (Reuters) - - Amanda Farris got an ATM card from her father when she was about 13. Her dad told her to treat it like cash and taught her how to tap her allowance and the money she made working odd jobs.
Now, at 25, Farris and her husband are fully independent financially from their parents. But Farris, who works in branding and marketing for a Missouri bar association, has not stopped asking her father for guidance. When she bought her first home a year ago, he gave extensive advice.
As millennials navigate financial milestones – like buying real estate or switching jobs – the advice of those who raised them continues to guide their decisions. Despite being so-called digital natives, many millennials continue to rely on their parents and mentors more than on online information.
According to a 2017 Instamotor survey, 78.5 percent of U.S. millennials say their parents have given them financial advice, and more than half feel their parents prepared them well to make good financial decisions.
While Farris welcomes information from many sources, the advice she gets from her parents has a special advantage: trust. ""Those two people, especially, will always have my best interests at heart,"" she said.
TEACHABLE MOMENTS
What is the best way for parents to give money advice? ""Look for opportunities to create conversations about topics – rather than delivering lectures,"" said Rich Ramassini, senior vice president at PNC Investments. In addition to decades in the financial industry, Ramassini has first-hand experience with his millennial son.
Many financial principles prove applicable across generations – like the power of compounding interest. ""That is an eternal truth that remains true today. Time is your biggest ally when it comes to investing,"" said Ramassini.
But Ramassini also noted differences between millennials - often defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 - and other generations.
When Ramassini began in the business a few decades ago, he said, you had to go to a financial adviser to get any information. But now, with the proliferation of online data and advice, the opposite problem exists – too much information. ""People have trouble turning that information into knowledge,"" he said.
Technology has also opened up new ways of saving and investing, he added, such as through financial apps.
GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES
Besides having to deal with an abundance of technology and data, millennials also face different economic challenges than the baby boomers before them.
A 2017  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) study found that millennials face tougher borrowing rules, rising home prices and lower income mobility than their parents' generation.
Additionally, Americans now owe over a trillion dollars in student debt.
These concerns are reflected in the topics on which millennials seek advice. The most popular subject was saving, with 72 percent discussing it with their parents, followed by budgeting at 59 percent, according to the Instamotor survey. Half had discussed debt with their parents.
Millennials are twice as likely as the overall investor population to target social or environmental goals while making investments, according to a 2017 report by the Institute for Sustainable Investing.
HELPFUL CONNECTIONS
Experienced mentors can fill the void when parents are not available.
Tarah Rupp, who is an independent caregiver in Los Angeles, does not discuss money with her mother, and her father is deceased.
The most useful advice has come through her church and her in-laws. Before Rupp turned 21, an older friend from church sat her down to discuss budgeting, and before she bought her first car, her father-in-law taught her how to negotiate and to avoid high interest rates.
Katy Neylon, 27, said she is ""pretty much an open book"" when it comes to talking about money with her parents, although the conversations are mostly one direction. While Neylon does share salary and investing habits with her parents, she does not ask them about their own finances.

Beyond asking for money and job-hunting guidance, Neylon, a marketing administrator at a private golf community, also turns to her father for advice on more philosophical aspects of consumption, like how to maintain a basic level of happiness - specifically, how to avoid ratcheting up one's desires and expectations with every rise on the career and salary ladder.
Working in Durango, Colorado, a ""really tiny mountain town"" focused on hospitality, gives her a lifestyle where she can ski nearly every weekend, she said. But it also required giving up a potentially more lucrative career path elsewhere.
She and her father often share their feelings on the balance between happiness and financial success. ""We come to the conclusion that sometimes we pick lifestyle over pay, which is definitely what I'm doing,"" she said.

91,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","America Movil still wants TV license in Mexico, CEO says","By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil (MX:AMXL) remains interested in offering television in Mexico and continues discussing the possibility of obtaining a license with the telecommunications regulator, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. 
America Movil, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, has been barred from offering television in Mexico since Telmex's privatization in the early 1990s. Mexico's telecommunications regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), has said that the company will be eligible to apply for a TV license once it complies with the measures it is subject to due to its high market share in the country. 
The TV license could help America Movil better compete as companies increasingly seek to offer their customers voice, data and video in one package. 
""It's the only place in the world that we are not allowed to have TV, so I hope they understand and that they can give us a TV license,"" Hajj said. 
America Movil reported its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, registering a 50 percent drop in net profit due to currency swings.
But analysts said the fundamentals of the business were strong, particularly in Mexico, where mobile revenue surged 12.8 percent. 
The quarter marked the first time America Movil has been able to charge competitors interconnection fees since Mexico’s landmark telecommunications reform forced the company to let rivals use its network for free. 
The Supreme Court opened the door for America Movil to resume charging competitors in August, and the IFT set the fees, permitting the company to bill about a fourth of what its rivals can.
But the fees accounted for just a fraction of the growth in mobile revenues in Mexico during the quarter, Hajj said.
""The growth is because people are using more data and we have more customers,"" he said. 
Stronger demand for data has helped America Movil's average revenue per user in Mexico recover from the price war touched off by the telecom reform, Hajj said. 
Mexico is preparing to auction spectrum in the 2500-2690 MHz band, which has drawn strong interest from operators because it is well suited for broadband, 5g mobile networks and the so-called Internet of Things. But America Movil will sit out the auction because it already has spectrum in the band and the IFT put limits on its participation, Hajj said.

""If we don't have equal conditions, we are not so enthusiastic,"" Hajj said.

IMPERIAL, Pennsylvania (Reuters) -  General Electric  CO (N:GE) employees and shareholders voiced frustration on Wednesday with the company's poor performance, while attending the first annual meeting under Chief Executive Officer John Flannery, who has presided over a 43 percent decline in GE's stock price since taking over on Aug. 1. 
Several dozen union workers from GE factories in Pennsylvania, Canada and elsewhere protested outside a GE facility here, where about 450 shareholders gathered.
Inside GE's 125,000-square foot showroom for 3D printing machinery, shareholders called for the ouster of directors who served on the board as GE's performance declined. One said GE should audit operations to look for questionable actions and claw back pension and other payments to former CEO Jeff Immelt.
""It should be clear by now that those performance-related payments should never have been made,"" said the shareholder, Bill Freeda, a retired employee.
Flannery said GE is ""keenly aware of the pain"" caused by its poor performance and dividend cut last year. Executives are trying to turning around the ailing power and oil and gas businesses, he told shareholders, adding that there is evidence of ""green shoots"" of improvement. 
Shareholders elected a smaller board with three new members, and voted down six shareholder proposals. One measure would have required the board chairman and chief executive roles to be held by separate persons. Another would have required GE to exclude share buybacks when calculating whether the company met financial targets to qualify for executive bonuses. GE did not pay executive bonuses in 2017.
GE last week posted improved first-quarter earnings and affirmed its full-year earnings forecast, but warned its power business is still struggling and that the company will need time to restore the profitability it enjoyed three years ago. The company is shedding $20 billion in assets and still considering a possible break up.
""It's a back to basics story,"" Flannery said. ""We just have to improve our performance.""
Outside the building, union workers said they wanted to draw attention to GE's cuts to pension and healthcare benefits and to close facilities and lay off workers. GE has said it is cutting $2 billion in costs this year, including cutting 12,000 jobs in the power unit, as it tries to restore profitability.

""The shareholders should know what GE is doing,"" said Cheryl Armitage, a union chairperson who worked at GE's electric motor plant in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>","EU moves to tackle letter box firms' tax avoidance, social dumping","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed new rules to clamp down on firms that relocate within the bloc for the purpose of cutting their tax bills or reducing rights of employees, creditors and minority shareholders, setting up mere letter box companies.
Smaller countries in the 28-country single market, like Luxembourg, Ireland, Malta and the Netherlands, have traditionally attracted companies from other member states thanks to lower corporate tax and rights for workers and smaller shareholders.
Under the proposed rules, which need approval from EU states and parliamentarians, countries where companies are originally headquartered would be able to block their relocation to another member state if ""the operation constitutes an artificial arrangement"" meant exclusively to circumvent tax or workers' rights.
""In our thriving EU Single Market, companies have the freedom to move and grow. But this needs to happen in a fair way,"" The Commission's Vice President Frans Timmermans said. 
In some cases corporate relocation has resulted in the setting up of mere letter box companies which are not engaging in any economic activity but simply avoiding their obligations.
""Companies should relocate only when there is a genuine reason to do so, not simply as a way of shopping for the lowest tax rate or as a way of circumventing workers' rights,"" Socialist lawmaker Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann said, welcoming the commission's proposal as a ""step in the right direction"".
""Employees will in the future have a say on their companies' cross border operations,"" EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova said, stressing that the proposal is also aimed at countering social dumping - where production is moved to countries with lower wages or workers' rights.
While tackling abuses, the Commission expects at the same time to facilitate firms' legitimate relocation or division by introducing a new common transfer procedure that would replace the existing patchwork of national rules. 
States will be required to offer online procedures for corporate registration which in the 17 EU countries where they are already operational have significantly cut costs for firms, the Commission said.
BusinessEurope, a trade association for EU enterprises, welcomed the plan to simplify cross-border operations but warned against risks of ""overburdening check-ups"" on firms. 
Sven Giegold, an EU lawmaker for the Greens, said the proposal was a ""promotional programme for tax and social dumping in Europe."" 
""As long as we have very different tax and social systems within the EU, it is harmful to facilitate company relocations in the internal market,"" he said.

99,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump's bank watchdog bought financial stocks up until taking office,"By Michelle Price and Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee for Wall Street regulator Comptroller of the Currency bought financial stocks until he took office in November, according to financial disclosure documents filed with the Office of Government Ethics.
While not illegal, the trading activity by Joseph Otting's money manager could violate the spirit of ethics rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest, five experts in U.S. government ethics standards said. Nominees are required by law to disclose all assets to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) and divest any deemed a conflict of interest, or having the appearance of one, once they are confirmed. Otting gave the OGE a tally of his investments in March 2017 and agreed upon his June nomination to unwind millions of dollars in financial stocks within 90 days of being confirmed.
However, following his nomination Otting bought hundreds more financial shares, according to a Reuters analysis of OGE filings which list some of the stocks along with the number of shares Otting was required to divest upon taking office. 
The shares in the newly purchased stocks were together worth at least $160,000 around the time Otting sold them and others in January, based on prices from the date of the Jan. 19 paperwork.
""Mr. Otting divested holdings and has met all other ethical obligations of the office and remains committed to the highest ethical standard,"" Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) spokesman Bryan Hubbard said last week.
As Comptroller of the Currency, Otting is the day-to-day regulator for national banks like  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Hubbard said Otting's money manager purchased the shares on his behalf and that Otting is not involved in investment decisions. He said Otting's manager would continue to trade permitted shares. 
Reuters was unable to identify Otting's money manager.
Nominees may seek a certificate from the OGE that allows them to avoid an immediate tax hit on gains from assets they are required to shed. Otting claimed that right for stocks he had owned for years and stocks he bought in the nearly six months before taking office, according to the certificate filed with the OGE in January. 
Some ethics experts said that although the trades were not illegal, purchasing stocks after nomination undermined the integrity of the nomination process. 
""Nominees are supposed to shed investments before they take office, not gamble on stocks until the last moment,"" said Richard Painter, who served as ethics adviser to President George W. Bush. ""If I were handling this, I would have pulled the nomination.""
Painter also questioned Otting's judgment in seeking a tax deferment on recently bought assets since in his opinion that tool should typically be used to shield nominees from a tax hit on assets they already own, he said.
However, Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at non-profit Public Citizen, noted some ethics officials are reluctant to deem such trading problematic until nominees have been sworn in. 
In addition, he said, the rules are not as clear as they should be. ""So long as the OGE doesn't say the activity poses a conflict, then nominees are relatively unconstrained. So their defense is going to be that nobody told them.” 
A former career banker and close associate of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Otting is one of several Trump appointees whose ties to industries they regulate have raised questions about their ability to be impartial when enforcing rules. Otting also sits on the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), another banking regulator, and is a voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC, which is led by the U.S. Treasury, monitors a number of non-bank financial companies in order to identify risks to U.S. financial stability.        
Since holding stock in companies regulated by the OCC and FDIC-insured companies posed a conflict of interest once Otting took office, he recused himself from general policy and enforcement matters until late January when he sold those and other shares.
The FDIC declined to comment on Friday.
Among Otting's purchases were 366 shares of KeyCorp (N:KEY), one of the country's largest lenders directly regulated by the OCC, and 24 shares in  Brighthouse Financial  Inc (O:BHF), an insurance provider spun off from MetLife Inc (N:MET). 
The bulk of the $160,000 came from the sale of two German stocks, 441 shares of insurer Allianz SE (DE:ALVG) and 394 shares of stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn). The shares in KeyCorp, Brighthouse, Allianz and Deutsche Boerse were not disclosed in Otting's March filing, or listed as necessary divestments in his June 23 OGE ethics agreement. FSOC does not oversee Brighthouse, Allianz or Deutsche Boerse but it regulates some of their competitors, according to its website, and helps drive policies that affect sectors in which they operate.
""The Treasury's ethics office required Otting to divest in stocks that could create a potential conflict of interest with his role on FSOC,"" a spokesperson for the Treasury, which also represents the FSOC chair, said on Monday.

KeyCorp, Brighthouse, Deutsche Boerse and Allianz declined to comment on Otting's share purchases.

The potential for market volatility may soon close that window, however, with the European Central Bank set to signal how it’ll end quantitative easing in July.
""The threat of volatility is here to stay with many moving pieces on the economic and monetary policy front,"" said Kevin Foley, head of loan and high yield capital markets, EMEA at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank. ""For issuers, the key remains preparing in advance so that they are in a position to take advantage of issuance windows.""
The recent sales uptick is expected to continue into May, albeit at a slower pace, which should help boost volumes in a year that has so far underwhelmed. At 23.9 billion euros equivalent, issuance so far this year is 17 percent down on the same period of 2017. However, nearly a fifth of that priced in the last week alone, making it the busiest week for sales since Jan. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Credit spreads are expected to widen materially from here, according to Uli Gerhard, a senior portfolio manager at Insight Investment, which manages $791 billion of assets. ""But the conundrum that investors are facing now is that current valuations look attractive versus low default rates, yet we can all foresee a rate rise on the horizon so naturally investors are more cautious,"" Gerhard added.
Returns so far this year for high yield bonds are back in the black however at 0.41 percent, according to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Pan-European High Yield Index. This month option-adjusted spreads on the index have tightened by 25 basis points and yields have narrowed to 3.6 percent from a one-year wide point on April 4.
""After a period of weakness, which was largely sparked by trade tensions, fund flows are much more stable and have helped the high-yield market find its feet,"" said Tom Ross, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, who manages $2.7 billion of assets. ""And right now it seems at the moment that syndicates are very confident that they can get these deals done.""
Pick and Choose
But while the market is open for business, investors are making it clear they are remaining disciplined, especially around tricky credits. Bonds and loans are generally clearing at wider levels than they would have back in January, according to JPMorgan’s Foley.
A deal that caught investors’ attention for its 8.5 percent coupon and backstory is Yell Bondco Plc. The company was created via a corporate reorganization at Hibu Group Ltd, which twice restructured its debt in 2014 and 2016. Oilfield services company CGG SA was another company returning to the market after restructuring its debt. The borrower sold $300 million and 280 million euros of bonds earlier in the month with 9 percent and 7.875 percent coupons, respectively.
""The market is wide open and difficult credits with a checkered past such as Yell are taking advantage of this,"" Insight Investment’s Gerhard said. ""The deals in the market at the moment finally require more credit work, but one has to be selective and disciplined in this market.""
Signs of investor discipline have have also been evidenced by push back on aggressive covenants. U.K. watchmaker Aurum Holdings Ltd was recently forced to sweeten a 265 million pound bond offering by removing the clause that would have allowed it to pay additional dividends to its owner Apollo Global Management LLC. Consequently, Aurum had to increase the yield to 8.5 percent from 7.5 percent.
""The most egregious language we’ve seen recently allowed a company to access the restricted payments basket in the period after a coupon should have been paid and the end of the grace period,"" Janus Henderson’s Ross said. ""We pushed back on that in the Selecta deal and got the language changed.""

ANTALYA, Turkey (Reuters) - Qatar Airways made a ""substantial"" loss in its last financial year because of a regional dispute that has banned the airline from four Arab countries, its chief executive said on Wednesday without revealing the extent of the losses.
Qatar Airways has been blocked from flying to 18 cities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since June when those countries cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the charges.
""We have increased our operating costs. We had to also take a hit on revenues so we don't think that our results for the last financial year will be very good,” Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters at the Eurasia Airshow in Antalya, Turkey.
""I don't want to say the size of the loss but it was substantial.""
Other parts of the business were profitable though that was not enough to make up for the airline loss, Baker said.
Qatar Airways has several subsidiaries including airport ground handling services and catering units.
The airline had warned of the loss for several months. [nL5N1QP3PU]
The state-owned airline will need another eight weeks to finalise its books and make adjustments before it announces its financial results for the year to March 31, Baker said.
Qatar Airways made 1.97 billion Qatari riyals ($541 million) profit in its previous fiscal year.
Neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the UAE were popular routes for Qatar Airways, which has also been banned from the airspace of the four boycotting states.
That has forced the airline to fly longer flights on many routes to the west and south of Qatar which requires more fuel and increases costs.
Qatar Airways has no immediate plans to ask its sole shareholder, the government of Qatar, for a capital injection but may do so if the airspace ban continues and there is pressure on its debt equity ratio, Baker said.
Qatar Airways wants to set up a new airline, he said, without disclosing any details, and remains interested in establishing an Indian domestic carrier.
Qatar Airways owns stakes in several airlines including Cathay Pacific and British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) (IAG).

Baker said that when Qatar hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2022 the airline would have a passenger and cargo network of nearly 250 destinations. It currently flies to more than 150 destinations, according to its website.

LIPETSK, Russia (Reuters) - French fries at McDonald's restaurants from Moscow to Murmansk will be Russian from now on, as the American fast-food chain turns to homegrown potatoes to deal with rouble volatility caused by fluctuating oil prices and Western sanctions.
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), which opened in Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union collapsed, has been gradually turning to local ingredients in its Russian outlets for everything from Big Macs to chicken burgers since it opened its doors there.
But till now it had relied on frozen French fries from the Netherlands and Poland as Russian spuds weren't quite right.
""There was no potato which would suit us in terms of quality - color, taste, size – these are all the details that are important for us,"" Khamzat Khasbulatov, chairman of McDonald's Russia, told Reuters. 
The firm had worked on a project to use local potatoes in 2011 but the plan fell through when European financing was frozen in a row over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The rouble has gyrated since then with oil price swings and due to Western sanctions.
""The rouble's volatility was one of the major components of our interest in localization,"" Khasbulatov said. 
Now a new plant near Lipetsk, a city 450 km (280 miles) south of Moscow, using potatoes grown on local farms will supply frozen fries to the chain of 651 outlets across Russia under a long-term contract, raising the share of the chain's locally sourced products to 98 percent.
“This gives us the possibility to continue our development in a more stable way,"" the chairman said. ""It minimizes the risks connected to customs and administrative decisions, and guarantees stable, predictable prices in roubles.""
The plant, worth 8.7 billion roubles, was built jointly by Russian agricultural group Belaya Dacha and the Netherlands-based Lamb Weston Meijer, both long-time partners of McDonald's.
The factory has capacity to process 200,000 tonnes of potatoes a year, washing, cutting and freezing the vegetables.
The rouble has recovered some ground as the price of oil, a major revenue earner for Russia, has risen from a low in 2016. 
Russia's response to Western sanctions included a 2014 ban on a range of Western food imports.
""Sanctions as well as counter sanctions not only affect our company but the whole industry and the economy,"" said Khasbulatov, whose firm has 50,000 Russian employees and more than 160 domestic suppliers.

""But in any case we continue our development, continue to build new restaurants and modernize existing ones,"" he said, adding that firm opened 41 restaurants in Russia in 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump last month imposed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, but provided temporary exemptions until May 1 for the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and South Korea. 
Carlos Brito, chief executive of Budweiser-maker AB InBev, which sells many of its beers in the United States in aluminum cans, said the company had been very disappointed by the introduction of tariffs, which he said had put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage.
""We are very hopeful on the other hand that the list of allies continues to get populated because then you could maybe get to the situation where 80 percent of the aluminum supply - Canada being the biggest supplier - could be exempted from the tariff,"" Brito said after a meeting of the company's shareholders on Wednesday.
The brewing chief also said he was concerned about a spike of what is known as the Midwest premium, a surcharge to cover aluminum delivery.
The CME front-month Midwest premium contract  has more than doubled from 9.4 cents per lb at the start of January to its current 21.5 cents.
""The other thing on which we are hopeful is that the U.S. Congress sheds light on the Midwest premium,"" Brito told reporters.
Brito said the price was normally linked to market fundamentals and recalled that it last surged in 2015 due to speculation, prompting Congress to intervene. 

""It went down to fundamentals as it should be and now it's again way up, disconnected from fundamentals. So we'd love it if the U.S. Congress would take an interest,"" he said.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors in New York have been investigating whether Chinese tech company Huawei [HWT.UL] violated U.S. sanctions in relation to Iran, according to sources familiar with the situation. 
Since at least 2016, U.S. authorities have been probing Huawei's alleged shipping of U.S.-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of U.S. export and sanctions laws, two of the sources said.
News of the Justice Department probe follows a series of U.S. actions aimed at stopping or reducing access by Huawei and Chinese smartphone maker ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) to the U.S. economy amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. 
The Justice Department probe is being run out of the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, the sources said. John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the investigation. The probe was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.
Huawei, the world's largest maker of telecommunications network equipment and the No. 3 smartphone supplier, said it complies with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.""
The probe of Huawei is similar to one that China's ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) says is now threatening its survival. [nL3N1RX1NT]The United States last week banned American firms from selling parts and software to ZTE for seven years. Washington accused ZTE of violating an agreement on punishing employees after the company illegally shipped U.S. goods to Iran.
ZTE, which sells smartphones in the United States, paid $890 million in fines and penalties, with an additional penalty of $300 million that could be imposed.
U.S. authorities have subpoenaed Huawei seeking information related to possible export and sanctions violations, two sources said. The New York Times last April reported the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control subpoena, issued in December 2016, following a Commerce Department subpoena that summer.
Both companies also have been under scrutiny by U.S. lawmakers over cybersecurity concerns.
In February, Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, cited concerns about the spread of Chinese technologies in the United States, which he called ""counterintelligence and information security risks that come prepackaged with the goods and services of certain overseas vendors.""
Huawei and ZTE have denied these allegations.
Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton have introduced legislation that would block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from Huawei or ZTE, citing concern that the Chinese companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials. 
In 2016, the Commerce Department made documents public that showed ZTE's misconduct and also revealed how a second company, identified only as F7, had successfully evaded U.S. export controls.
In a 2016 letter to the Commerce Department, 10 U.S. lawmakers said F7 was believed to be Huawei, citing media reports.
In April 2017, lawmakers sent another letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking for F7 to be publicly identified and fully investigated.
The U.S. government’s investigation into sanctions violations by ZTE followed reports by Reuters https://reut.rs/2H3p0Vl in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.

Reuters also previously reported on suspicious activity related to Huawei. In January 2013, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-skycom/exclusive-huawei-cfo-linked-to-firm-that-offered-hp-gear-to-iran-idUKBRE90U0CA20130131 that a Hong Kong-based firm that attempted to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator has much closer ties to China's Huawei Technologies than was previously known.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","Number of Russians converting currency quadrupled after new U.S. sanctions, VTB says","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's second-largest bank VTB (MM:VTBR) said on Wednesday it saw a fourfold increase in the number of Russians converting currency after new U.S. sanctions earlier this month led to a collapse in the value of the rouble. 
Washington imposed fresh sanctions against Moscow on April 6 in response to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other ""malign activity"". 
The new round of penalties triggered a sell-off on Russian markets, pushing the Russian rouble to its weakest levels versus the dollar since late 2016 [nL8N1RV213].
VTB Deputy Chairman Anatoly Pechatnikov said the increased market volatility had been alarming.
""The total volume of cash and non-cash currency-exchange operations increased by four times to $200 million a day in Russia, in all our branches,"" he said. 
Pechatnikov did not say whether the transactions were to convert foreign currency into roubles or roubles into foreign currency.
The number of transactions peaked between April 9-11, he said, when the rouble slid by more than 10 percent against the dollar to its weakest since November 2016.
The Russian central bank has said ordinary Russians are increasingly using swings in the value of the rouble to sell and then buy back foreign currency in order to make money.
Pechatnikov said he believed that was the cause of the increase in exchange transactions.
""I don't rule out that this activity was related ... with new opportunities which appeared for savvy and active currency market participants, they simply used this opportunity to enrich themselves,"" he said.

111,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 10:08AM ET</span>",NBC owner Comcast gate-crashes Fox's takeover of Sky with a £22 billion bid,"LONDON — The US entertainment giant  Comcast has made a £22 billion ($30.7 billion) bid for  Sky, gate-crashing Rupert Murdoch's takeover attempt for the British and European broadcaster.
Comcast on Wednesday said it was offering £12.50, or $17.45, a share for the company. The bid represents a 16% premium on the latest offer from Murdoch's  21st Century Fox. Comcast's deal values Sky at £22.1 billion ($30.9 billion).
Sky's board responded by withdrawing its recommendation for investors to approve Fox's December 2016 bid, which has been repeatedly hit by regulatory hurdles.
Comcast, which owns TV networks such as E! and NBC, as well as Universal Pictures,  first announced plans to make a bid in February. It said the deal represented a ""strategic opportunity to acquire a leading content and distribution business in the UK and Europe.""
 Sky shares jumped 3% on news of the offer.Sky is known in Europe for its live football (soccer in the US) broadcasts as well as for premium content such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and in-house productions such as ""Fortitude"" and ""Britannia.""
Murdoch's 21st Century Fox owns 39.1% of Sky, which Murdoch helped found in the 1990s. Murdoch has long coveted the remaining 61%, with a previous £8 billion takeover attempt derailed by the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in 2011.
21st Century Fox restarted takeover plans  at the end of 2o16, but it has repeatedly run up against regulatory hurdles. The UK's competition watchdog said in January that the deal would be  ""against the public interest,"" giving the Murdoch family what it considered too much control over UK media.
Fox has already agreed on paper to sell its stake in Sky to Disney  as part of a $52.4 billion (£37.5 billion) package of film and TV assets. When the deal was announced, 21st Century Fox said it remained ""committed to completing its proposed acquisition of the shares in Sky it does not own.""
Comcast was one of the interested bidders in Fox's entertainment assets, according to multiple reports.
Comcast said it was planning to keep Sky headquartered in Osterley, would maintain its staffing levels, and would invest in creating more high-quality content. The company said it saw $500 million of synergies from the deal.
""We have long believed Sky is an outstanding company and a great fit with Comcast,"" Brian Roberts, the chairman and CEO of Comcast, said in a statement. ""Sky has a strong business, excellent customer loyalty, and a valued brand. It is led by a terrific management team who we look forward to working with to build and grow this business.""
21st Century Fox said in a statement it ""remains committed"" to its December 2016 bid but added that it was ""currently considering its options.""
 The boutique London firm Robey Warshaw advised Comcast on the offer along with the investment banks Evercore and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC)."

On Sunday, the furniture retailer City Furniture announced on Twitter that it had reserved five Tesla Semis. The company said it plans to use the trucks to carry merchandise from its distribution center in Tamarac, Florida, to a forthcoming distribution facility located in Central Florida.
""We expect all-electric trucks to change the playing field in the years ahead,"" City Furniture chief operating officer Andrew Koenig said in a statement. ""Based on the ROI we’ve already seen by converting most of our delivery fleet to alternative fuel vehicles, we anticipate the Tesla Semis will bring major savings in energy costs and maintenance, while taking performance and reliability to a level that hasn’t yet existed.""
While some had doubts about Tesla's ability to break into the trucking industry before it introduced the Semi, early orders indicate Tesla may beat expectations.
The electric trucks have impressive  features, including a 500-mile range per charge, the ability to travel 400 miles on a 30-minute charge, impact-resistant glass, an innovative cabin design, and the ability to go from 0-60 mph in five seconds without any cargo and in 20 seconds while carrying 80,000 pounds of cargo. But Tesla will ultimately be judged on the number of clients who buy and use the trucks over the long term.
These are the companies who have placed orders for the Tesla Semi so far:"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and two top aides talked about trade issues with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) chief Tim Cook on Wednesday as the White House prepares to try to avert a trade war with China, a manufacturing hub for the iPhone maker.
Cook, who has urged calm during the recent flare in U.S. trade tensions with China, held private talks with Trump in the Oval Office. He also spoke with the president's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Trump is preparing to send a delegation to China to try to head off a trade war that stands to harm Apple, the world's largest technology company, and other hardware makers that build products in China.
Trump has threatened a new round of $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese products that could target cellphones, computers and other consumer goods. China retaliated against an initial round of $50 billion in tariffs. 
The meeting, which the White House said had been in the works for a couple of weeks, came the day after Cook sat at Trump's head table at his first state dinner, held in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron.
A White House official described the meeting as ""good"" but neither the White House nor Apple provided details of the discussions.
Trump said earlier on Wednesday that he was looking forward to seeing Cook. ""We will be talking about many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade,"" he said on Twitter.
Cook also had strong relations with Trump's predecessor in the White House, Democratic President Barack Obama. He sat at the head table for Obama's 2015 state dinner honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Cook has been to China at least three times since October, including paying a visit to Xi.
'GOOD GUY'
Cook has become one of Trump's favorite CEOs to name-check in speeches. This was a surprising turn after a rocky start to their relationship. During his election campaign, Trump urged supporters to boycott Apple and criticized the company for making its products in China.
As president, Trump has called Cook a “good guy” and mentioned him by name at least 10 times during public remarks, including during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and during several high-profile interviews.
The president frequently uses Cook and Apple as an example of how he says his tax cut package is creating jobs because it spurred the company to repatriate earnings it had held overseas.
Trump has frequently said he would not consider his presidency successful unless Apple builds manufacturing plants in the United States.
Apple has a market capitalization of $835 billion and 123,000 employees, 84,000 of whom are in the United States. The company said in January it plans to spend $30 billion in capital expenditures in the United States over the next five years, $10 billion of that on data centers.
Apple said its spending will create 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses in Cupertino and Austin as well as at a planned new campus.
Cook has also developed ties with Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, both senior advisers at the White House who work on tech training and government IT modernization issues.
His praise for Cook aside, Trump, a Republican, has had a sometimes tense relationship with the U.S. technology industry, based in Democratic strongholds such as California's Silicon Valley and in Seattle. He has clashed with the tech sector on issues including trade, immigration and the environment.

Cook has publicly objected to Trump's decision to end a program protecting from deportation young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children. He was also among business leaders who criticized Trump after the president cast equal blame on white nationalists and anti-racism activists for violence last year in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has been expanding its Eurowings business via the Austrian unit, known as Eurowings Europe, for which there was no collective agreement in place, although it has been in talks with the union for around 18 months. 
However, with the carrier seeking to hire more flight crew to add more flights and fill the gap left by collapsed domestic rival Air Berlin, it late last year agreed a new collective deal with its German unit to allow expansion. [nL8N1OK1HA] 
Eurowings did not provide details of the deal with Vida on Wednesday. The union told an Austrian paper that cabin crew would get a starting salary of 1,700 euros ($2,071) a month, up from under 1,500 euros previously. 
""We have agreed on substantial pay increases for crew - making it the perfect time to apply for a job with us,"" Eurowings personnel head Joerg Beissel said.

A rise in bond yields could lead to a fall in equities, as the increase in yields dampans investor appetite for riskier assets.

“The problem is that some of these big hedge funds and macro funds, they keep jumping onto the same stuff over and over again,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. “The boat gets very lopsided very quickly.”
Discontent has been building in the mega-cap tech sector as Facebook comes under growing scrutiny after a controversy surrounding users’ personal data, leading the likes of DoubleLine Capital’s Jeffrey Gundlach to recommend shorting the stock. Google parent Alphabet added to the angst Tuesday as first-quarter results sparked concern that the Internet company is embarking on a spending binge, sending shares plunging.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed 0.5 percent Wednesday, adding to an advance that’s now exceeded 2 percent since April 17.
Thirty-three percent of respondents in the Bank of America survey -- representing asset managers including institutional funds, hedge fund and mutual funds -- said being long FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) shares was the most crowded trade in markets this month, compared with 21 percent who said it was being short the dollar, the no. 2 response.

But the damage isn’t equally spread. Europe and Japan are anchored by some serious reluctance to let benchmark borrowing costs rise.
Neither the European Central Bank nor the Bank of Japan look set to deviate from their negative interest rate policies anytime soon. The contrast with Federal Reserve couldn’t be sharper, with Chairman Jerome Powell forecasting three to four quarter-point rate increases over the next year.
That’s not the only gulf. The difference between the U.S. and the other two major global bond markets could get a lot wider.
Though 10-year German yields have doubled this year, they’re still only at 0.65 percent. This has pushed the spread to U.S. 10-year yields to more than 235 basis points from 170 basis points in July.
But it is in the two-year where the gap is the widest. There, the spread between the U.S. and Germany has widened to over 300 basis points.
A three percentage point difference in interest rates is a big gulf in the cost of financing. You may think that this would completely undermine the attractiveness of European fixed income for investors who have been starved for yield for years. You’d be wrong. What matters is the hedging strategy.
A 3 percent 10-year yield looks attractive for a Japanese investor facing 10-year yields at home of just 0.05 percent. The issue is the currency risk – if the yen were to strengthen versus the dollar investors could suffer a substantial capital loss. The problem is that, as U.S. interest rates rise and Japanese rates remain static, hedging costs for U.S. dollar investments become more expensive.
Which is where European bonds suddenly become a lot more attractive. The currency-hedged yield on 10-year French government debt is 117 basis points, compared to just 54 basis points for hedged U.S. 10-year notes. On this basis, the debt of Spain and Italy are even more attractive, so this seems enough to get Japanese investors over the credit quality hurdle and start buying.
This is the impact of negative European money market rates. And given that the German 2-10 year yield curve, at 120 basis points, is twice as steep as the U.S. curve, there’s an extra benefit for longer maturities.
So it is no surprise to see the 2018-2019 financial year investment plans of the large Japanese life insurers showing a renewed interest in buying foreign bonds on both a hedged and unhedged basis. In March, life insurers bought a net 764 billion yen ($7.1 billion) of overseas securities, the second-highest monthly net purchase amount ever – and the trend looks to be continuing in April.
For Europe, bondaggedon looks like it will be delayed for a good while yet.

138,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>","Schools, water are priorities as Saudi launches privatization plan","By Andrew Torchia
DUBAI (Reuters) - School buildings and desalination facilities producing fresh water will feature in some of the first deals as Saudi Arabia transfers a quarter of its economy to private hands, an official overseeing the process said on Wednesday.
Turki A. Al Hokail, chief executive of the National Centre for Privatisation and Public-Private Partnerships, was speaking as the government formally launched a vast privatisation program focusing on 10 sectors of the economy.
Riyadh is working on new rules to attract foreign as well as local capital to the scheme and will address potential investors' concern about their level of control over projects, including their ability to hire and fire workers, Hokail said.
""This is a big change in the economy. The government is moving from operating projects to monitoring and regulating them,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Operations will be the job of the private sector.""
Riyadh announced on Tuesday that it aimed to generate 35 billion to 40 billion riyals ($9 billion to $11 billion) of non-oil state revenues from the privatization program by 2020, part of a drive to cut Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil exports.
Some of the money is to come from asset sales in sectors such as education, water, telecommunications and health care. Some of those sales could occur through initial public offers of shares, while others might be direct transfers. 
Hokail said Riyadh was willing in principle to consider sales of 100 percent stakes in state firms, but decisions on each deal would depend on investor demand and market conditions.
The rest of the money would come from public-private partnerships (PPPs) - deals in which private companies invest in infrastructure and are paid to operate it for a period, before eventually transferring it to the state.
DRAFT LAW
Eventually, the privatization program aims to boost the private sector's contribution to Saudi gross domestic product to 65 percent from 40 percent, easing pressure on government finances that have been strained by low oil prices.
“It seeks to eliminate all obstacles that may limit the private sector from playing a larger role in the development of the kingdom’s economy,"" Hokail said, adding that Riyadh was also revising rules on state procurement, markets and other areas.
Authorities hope to offer a draft law on PPP frameworks for public consultation and feedback within a week or so, before implementing a final version later this year, Hokail said.
The lack of such a law, and other legal uncertainties over ownership of state assets, have prevented significant progress in the privatization program since authorities began talking about it two years ago.
The relatively modest financial targets for the initial years of the scheme suggest authorities may have scaled back their expectations because of legal and other difficulties. 
Initially, officials talked of raising $200 billion over an unspecified period. Both the old and the new revenue targets are separate from Riyadh's intention to raise about $100 billion from the sale of a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, which is to take place this year or next.
Hokail said authorities aimed by 2020 to completed five asset sales, 14 PPPs and four corporatisation exercises, in which state projects would be converted into independent firms in preparation for their possible sale at a later date.
Among plans in the pipeline are the sale of the Ras Al Khair desalination and power plant, as well as flour mills and football teams; a PPP for private companies to build and operate facilities for 60 schools; and the corporatisation of ports.

Hokail said authorities would be choosy about the identity of buyers of state assets, vetting them on issues such as their intention to add value to the economy, boost employment and develop local talent among staff.

(Reuters) - Financial and technology stocks led Wall Street lower on Wednesday as concerns about rising U.S. bond yields eclipsed gains from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) following strong results.
Shares of the world's biggest planemaker rose 2.5 percent after its profit jumped by more than half in the first quarter and the company raised its full-year forecasts for cash flow and earnings.
After  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) spooked investors by warning about higher material costs on Tuesday, Boeing executives, on a post-earnings call noted that it was not seeing a material effect from raw material costs.
""With earnings reports that are coming out, the focus is on the forward guidance for where the interest rate environment is going,"" said William Norris, chief investment officer at CIBC Bank USA. 
""Investors are seeing a lot more cross-currents impacting the markets ... we knew that earnings were going to be very good and people are looking beyond the first quarter.""
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global interest rates, held above 3 percent after crossing the level for the first time in four years on Tuesday, stoking concerns about higher borrowing rates for companies.
Comcast rose 3.7 percent after the U.S. cable company topped Wall Street's profit estimates and offered $30.7 billion in a bid for Sky.
Twitter, initially up 10 percent after a strong set of quarterly results, flipped to a 5 percent fall on the day. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which is set to report after market on Wednesday, was down 0.14 percent. Investors will watch for any update on the social network's plan on data protection after it became embroiled in a huge scandal surrounding the misuse of its users' data by a consultancy.
""There's pending regulation, we don't know how exactly it's going to play out and there's a lot of uncertainty,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
Reuters data shows that analysts are now estimating 22 percent profit growth in the first quarter among the S&P 500 companies, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season.
At 13:08 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.18 points, or 0.11 percent, at 23,996.95, the S&P 500 was down 0.91 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,633.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.34 points at 7,007.01.
Financial stocks were the biggest laggards, falling 0.4 percent on the S&P 500, after a 5 percent drop in shares of Capital One as the credit card issuer reported a drop in net interest margin.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) fell more than 4 percent after Moody's changed its ratings outlook on the company.
The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility, jumped to a more than 1-week high of 18.72 points.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 1.79-to-1 ratio and for a 1.60-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

140,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",Equity Swoon Looks Different From 3 Percent Yield Skittishness,"(Bloomberg) -- For all the saber rattling over the dreaded 3 percent Treasury yield, don’t overplay the role of bonds as the proximate cause for bearish equity moves.
Sure, U.S. stocks dropped 1.3 percent Tuesday. But look under the surface, and pain actually bypassed bond-proxy stocks -- dividend payers that investors typically dump for higher-yielding debt.
Companies with the highest payouts returned 1 percent yesterday, the fourth-best performing investing style out of the 160 U.S. factors tracked by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, the market’s highest fliers sank lower and investors shied away from more volatile shares -- another indication of indiscriminate selling rather than a bond-driven rotation in equity markets.
Possible catalysts for risk-off trading range from a weak outlook for industry bellwether  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT)., extended positioning, slowing growth momentum and short-term inflationary pressures.
As such, 3 percent or not: markets were primed to get spooked, according to Tim Emmott, executive director at Olivetree Financial Ltd. in London.
“The fact that high-yielding, defensive utilities were the best-performing sector in the U.S. last night, in an environment where Treasury 10-year yields are backing up above 3 percent, would suggest that equity mindsets were defensively skewed in the U.S.,” Emmott wrote in a note.
Another case in point: Value stocks, those with cheap book value to price ratios, gained 1.3 percent, the best out of all factors tracked by Bloomberg. As such, the declines don’t reflect a cyclical rotation on rate risk, but principally angst over lofty prices, according to Evercore ISI’s Dennis DeBusschere.
“The more obvious culprit is the very high starting equity valuations, the Fed tightening and strong earnings being discounted,” DeBusschere wrote in a note. “The story is multiple contraction in that context, not the 10-year hitting a magical number that forced a steep decline in stocks.”
Positioning data also suggest a broad-based easing in equity exposures. The most shorted stocks outperformed yesterday, dropping only 0.3 percent, while favored long positions adopted by hedge funds fell 1.8 percent, according to baskets compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Fast-money investors typically increase short positions to offset losses in their long books. But Tuesday’s price action suggests managers actually reduced short positions, taking profit across the board, Emmott said.
By the end of last week, data from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Prime Services also show equity long-short managers had the highest net exposure since at least 2010 -- suggesting hedge-fund positions were overextended heading into the selloff.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) profit jumped by more than half in the first quarter, surging past Wall Street forecasts, and strong sales of commercial jets led it to raise its forecasts for cash flow and earnings after a record 2017.
After fellow manufacturer  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) unnerved stock markets by warning of rising metals prices on Tuesday, the world's biggest planemaker said in its quarterly results on Wednesday that margins had improved at the start of 2018.
Core earnings, which exclude some pension costs, jumped to $3.64 per share from $2.17 per share a year earlier, dwarfing a consensus forecast of $2.58 per share according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Shares jumped as much as 4.5 percent to $344.01 in response.
""It's not every day that a mega cap company beats consensus by 40 percent. In normal circumstances we would expect a very positive share price response,"" Vertical Research Partners Robert Stallard wrote in a note.
Boeing sold a record 763 aircraft last year and has already announced a rise in commercial deliveries in the first three months of the year. 
It raised its full-year operating cash flow forecast to $15.0 billion-$15.5 billion from about $15 billion, previously.
The company also increased its 2018 core earnings per share forecast to $14.30-14.50 from its previous projection of $13.80-$14.00.
Core operating margin rose to 10.7 percent from 8.5 percent a year earlier while revenue rose 6.5 percent to $23.38 billion, beating expectations of $22.26 billion. 
The results follow those of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, which cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased costs of material such as steel.
U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on steel and aluminum imports, with tariffs of 25 percent for some steel products and 10 percent for aluminum products, has constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating costs of the metals. 
""Trade war impact will be a topic for the call,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said.
""The good thing is that Boeing tends to have multi-year contracts in place, general inflationary adjustments on sales, and raw materials are a relatively modest portion of a plane's costs."" 
Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) have been pressing suppliers to cut prices on aircraft parts, as they seek to stay competitive amid burgeoning demand from airlines for more capable planes at lower prices.
Boeing has introduced automation in its factories, streamlined production, wound down development costs and shed jobs to dramatically improve profit and cash flow.
""We believe that investors had already been modeling higher cash flow and EPS than Boeing's initial guide, but it is unlikely Boeing would stuff its last raise of the year into Q1,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities analyst Seth Seifman said.
Boeing's commercial aircraft deliveries rose 9 percent to 184 in the first quarter ended March 31, due to strong demand from airlines dealing with booming passenger air travel.
The company also said it planned to increase production on its 767 aircraft program from 2.5 to 3 per month beginning in 2020, reflecting strength in the global cargo market.
Global freight traffic grew on average by 7.7 percent in January and February, marking the strongest start to the year since 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Up to Tuesday's close, Boeing's stock had risen 11.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.1 percent decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJI).

Goldilocks, which holds an 8.1 percent stake, also seeks to propose directors to Noble's board, according to the lawsuit.
Noble did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The commodities trader said earlier this week it rejected Goldilocks' request to elect directors as the fund failed ""to submit legally effective nominations"".
Last week, Noble bowed to criticism from the Singapore Exchange (SI:SGXL) and other investors and removed a provision in its $3.4 billion debt restructuring proposal that penalized shareholders voting against the plan.
Goldilocks, backed by Abu Dhabi Financial Group, has filed a separate lawsuit seeking measures including preventing Noble, its board and supporting creditors from appointing an administrator in the UK and moving ahead with the restructuring agreement, it said in a statement. 
Goldilocks filed a lawsuit in March alleging that Noble inflated its assets.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 09:28AM ET</span>",GM banks on Chinese vehicle family to boost Brazil sales,"By Nick Carey and Brad Haynes
DETROIT/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is planning for long-term profitability in South America built on the back of draconian cost cutting during Brazil's recession and the same low-cost vehicles it is developing for Chinese consumers, which are due to hit dealerships in 2019.
""We have been refreshing the vehicle family (in South America), building up market share and getting the cost point right, all in preparation for one vehicle family,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in a recent interview.
That ""one family"" will consist of an expected 2 million units made annually for South America and China that will lower production costs.
""That is an unprecedented level of scale,"" Ammann said.
GM is doubling down in South America, where it is already the top-selling automaker, thanks largely to two Chevrolet models, the subcompact Onix and the Prisma sedan. It expects better margins from rising sales and new lower-cost production models, including SUVs and crossovers increasingly favored by consumers. 
The automaker's plan, which GM has not previously disclosed, is part of an overarching strategy focused on profitability instead of trying to compete in every market.
The U.S. automaker has pulled out of unprofitable operations in Europe and countries such as India. 
But GM is still betting on Brazil, a country just starting to come out of its deepest recession in decades. Carlos Zarlenga, head of the automaker's operations in Brazil and Argentina, recalls that during the downturn executives scrutinized every purchase request over $10,000.
GM cut its Brazilian labor force 35 percent, persuaded unions to agree to multiyear contracts with wages pegged to inflation, reworked its supply chain and ditched a slick Sao Paulo building for offices at a nearly 90-year-old auto plant. 
""The whole purpose was to make sure we maximized every inch of expenditure,"" Zarlenga told Reuters in a recent interview.
Ammann says the cost reductions lowered GM's breakeven point in Brazil by 40 percent. 
After hitting a record of 3.80 million units in 2012, auto sales in Brazil - the world's eighth largest market, accounting for a majority of South American sales - plunged 46 percent to 2.05 million in 2016.
The economy began to gradually rebound in 2017, lifting auto sales by 9 percent. GM's South American operations posted a profit of $100 million in 2017, the first since 2013.
""South America can become a meaningful contributor"" to GM's overall profits, Ammann said. 
GM also passed  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) last year to become Brazil's top-selling automaker for the first time since 2004, according to data from industry group Anfavea. 
Brazil auto sales rose 16 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, Anfavea reported. GM's Zarlenga said at an event in Sao Paulo this week that Brazil auto industry sales will hit 2.7 million units in 2018, 2.9 million in 2019 and 4 million by 2027. 
Rival Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has also invested in new plants in Brazil and is working to become more competitive in South America.
In January, U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) hinted at possible significant changes for its money-losing South American business.
""DIFFERENT FOUNDATION""
Last year, GM halted car sales in India - where it had less than 1 percent market share - and pulled out of parts of Africa to focus on profitable operations.
In 2017 it sold Opel, its struggling European arm, to France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP).
In an April 20 client note,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas said GM could ""follow a similar path"" in South America.
""The precedent of GM exiting a region with little or no chance to generate positive returns for shareholders has been set,"" Jonas wrote.
But exiting other markets has freed up capital for GM. In August, it said it plans to invest $1.4 billion at three plants in Brazil.
GM was in a better starting position in South America than in markets like India, said Ammann. 
""That's a foundation that's different than some of the other markets in the world where we've decided we don't see a path to long-term success,"" Ammann said.
He said South American consumers tend to like similar vehicles to their counterparts in China, where the automaker is developing a new family of cheaper vehicles with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104). 
Some of those vehicles will join GM's South American lineup in 2019.
""We can get a level of scale that we couldn't in Europe,"" said Ammann.
Lower production costs mean GM can add features - safety, infotainment and connectivity - normally standard in more expensive models, he added. 
Guido Vildozo, IHS Markit's senior manager for the Americas, cautioned that South American drivers have decades more driving experience than Chinese consumers and higher expectations.

""There is always a risk when you develop a vehicle for China where driving dynamics are not such a high priority and sell it in a market where they are priority,"" Vildozo said. ""A lot will depend on how these vehicles evolve.""

(PPC) (AT:DEHr) took to the streets on Wednesday urging lawmakers to rescind the planned sale of power stations which they have branded a ""national crime"".
Hundreds of workers gathered outside parliament, as lawmakers debated legislation which paves the way for PPC to begin selling plants in May.
""Privatizing PPC means fewer jobs, lower wages,"" said Spyros Nikolopoulos, 54, a PPC worker for 32 years. ""PPC belongs to the Greek people, it cannot be sold to any private investor.""
Some of the protesters emptied sacks of coal outside parliament.
Greece is implementing reforms and asset sales in exchange for loans from the European Union. It has agreed with its lenders to sell 40 percent of the coal-fired capacity of the PPC, which is majority state controlled.
A coal fired unit and a license for a second in Florina, northern Greece, will be sold along with two units in southern Greece. Under bailout terms, PPC should launch an international tender for a buyer at the end of May.
Workers fear the sale will lead to job losses and hurt their labor rights, despite PPC assurances that jobs will be protected.
The country is to divest the capacity to comply with a European court ruling which said that PPC had abused its dominant position in the dirty but cheap coal market.
EU competition regulators which put out feelers for interest in the asset in a so-called 'market test' got interest from fifteen investors, PPC said.,
Wednesday's protest was organized by PPC's most powerful union GENOP-DEH, which kicked off rolling strikes this week.
Lawmakers were expected to vote on the bill later Wednesday.
Asset sales is a sensitive issue within the ruling leftist Syriza party, which was catapulted to power in 2015 promising to reverse privatizations. The conservative opposition accused the government of bringing PPC ""to the brink of disaster"" and lying to its voters.
""We feel betrayed,"" said Nicos Siakotos, a 46-year old father of two who has been working at one of PPC's plants in the Peloponnese since 1992 and now slated for sale.
""I'm afraid of losing my job like the other 1,100 workers in my town.""

The companies, already long-term partners on projects such as the A350 passenger jet powered by the Trent XWB engine, will work together on aircraft architecture to test the engine and on maximizing its efficiency. 
""It is great to have Airbus expertise to further strengthen our ability to deliver this important development program,"" said Andy Geer, chief engineer on the UltraFan, said in a statement.
Rolls-Royce is looking to UltraFan to secure its long-term future. In the shorter term it is focused on fixing problems with its Trent 1000 engines on Boeing's (N:BA) 787 Dreamliner planes, where some parts have been wearing out sooner than expected.
Some of the funding for the testing phase on the UltraFan will be provided by Clean Sky 2, a European Union research program focused on developing technology to reduce emissions, the companies said. 

Rolls-Royce added that UltraFan is a ""scalable"" design, meaning it will be suitable for widebody or narrowbody aircraft. Currently Rolls only makes engines for widebody jets.

Prosecutors seized an unknown number of files at Porsche during searches carried out by around 160 officials on April 18 as part of an investigation into employees at the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)-owned carmaker suspected of fraud and fraudulent advertising tied to manipulated emissions control systems of diesel passenger cars.
Porsche has appealed in full against the seizure and consequential inspection of the files, the prosecutor's office in Porsche's home town of Stuttgart said on Wednesday.
The second-largest contributor to Volkswagen group profit is the latest VW division to find itself in the cross-hairs of public prosecutors after VW admitted to cheating emissions tests in the United States in 2015 and related investigations that have since engulfed luxury brand Audi.
Last week, German police arrested the head of powertrain development at Porsche and are holding him on remand on concerns he could try to destroy evidence or flee, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A local court will now be tasked with deciding whether Stuttgart prosecutors are entitled to process the seized files, a spokesman for the prosecutors said, adding that Porsche has a right to lodge a complaint should the court uphold the seizure.
Porsche said the sheer quantum of files seized by the prosecutors which also included confidential data for the carmaker's own lawyers and information irrelevant to the inquiries have caused it to file a blanket appeal against the seizures.
""The reason (for the appeal) is the large number of seized files that is making it impossible for Porsche to carry out an assessment in the short time available,"" a spokesman said. ""Porsche fully cooperates with the relevant authorities and takes an interest in clearing up the matter.""

154,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>","Twitter shares fall on outlook of slower growth, rising costs","By David Ingram and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) shares fell on Wednesday after the social network said its revenue growth would slow this year and costs rise as it works to fight the spread of hate speech and allegations of election manipulation through its service.
That outlook overshadowed the second profitable quarter in the 12-year-old company's history, which topped Wall Street estimates for revenue, profit and users.
Quarterly revenue jumped 21 percent from a year earlier, but Twitter said revenue growth for the remainder of 2018 will be similar to the slower rates of 2016, when annual revenue rose 14 percent. 
Twitter said its tally of daily active users grew 10 percent year-over-year, lower than the 12 percent to 14 percent maintained in recent quarters, a change that ""has spooked investors,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.
International sales accounted for 48 percent of revenue, growing 53 percent year-over-year, compared with 2 percent growth in the United States. It added 5 million new foreign users in the quarter, five times as many as at home.
""We are not that far away from international becoming more than half of revenue at Twitter,"" Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told analysts on a conference call, highlighting strength in Japan, Britain, Brazil and the Middle East.
But analysts pointed out foreign users are often less profitable for the company.
""Adding users in far reaches of the world has very little value for Twitter,"" said Ross Gerber, chief executive officer of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.
LAWMAKER PRESSURE
The social media sector is under pressure from lawmakers around the globe for inflaming political debates, allowing abusive language and failing to safeguard personal data, and tighter regulation could mean higher costs.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) has come in for particular scrutiny on that front, with its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, sitting for two days of Congressional grilling this month about how its users' data was improperly shared with a political consultancy.
Twitter said it expected to increase its workforce by 10 percent to 15 percent in 2018 to make discussions on the service more civil, increase ad sales and meet other priorities. Twitter cut its headcount 6 percent last year. 
Its shares traded down 3.5 percent in afternoon trading in New York at $29.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Tuesday's close, they were up 26.9 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the S&P 500 Index (SPX).
Twitter shares trade at 42 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, roughly double the 20.5 times ratio of Facebook, according to Thomson Reuters data
Total revenue rose to $664.9 million, beating analysts' expectations for $607.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Twitter swung to a net profit of $61 million, or 8 cents per share, in the first quarter, from a loss of $61.6 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 16 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 12 cents per share.
Twitter has tried tweaks to its core product to try to broaden its appeal. Last year it doubled the maximum length of tweets in most languages to 280 characters, and it added customizable anti-harassment tools such as the ability to mute tweets with certain words. 

The company has developed live shows and broadcast live events to get people to spend more time on the service and to sell video ads to marketers. Videos accounted for more than half of ad revenue in the quarter.

A rise in bond yields could lead to a fall in equities, as the increase in yields dampans investor appetite for riskier assets.

158,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 12:45PM ET</span>","Comcast confirms $31 billion bid for Sky, sparking battle with Fox","By Paul Sandle and Sheila Dang
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. media group Comcast (O:CMCSA) submitted a 22 billion pound($30.7 billion) bid for Sky (L:SKYB) on Wednesday, prompting the European pay TV group to drop its support for a lower offer from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA).
Sky's independent directors welcomed Comcast's 12.50 pound per share bid and said they would now engage with both Comcast and Fox. They cautioned that neither bid could yet be put to shareholders and advised them to take no action for now.
The bid formalizes an offer first made in February and puts pressure on Fox, which already has a 39-percent stake in Sky, to raise the 10.75 pound per share cash offer it first announced in December 2016. It said on Wednesday it remained committed to its offer and was considering its options. 
The Fox-Sky deal has been held up by concerns about the influence Murdoch could wield over public opinion through owning all of the broadcaster as well as British newspapers including The Times and The Sun.
The proposed combination has been further complicated by Fox's agreement to sell many of its TV and film assets to Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), including its stake in Sky, for $52 billion. Disney did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
On Wednesday, Sky also welcomed commitments the U.S. cable giant had made to address potential public-interest concerns over Sky News, its influential 24-hour news channel.
PJT Partners is advising Sky alongside  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
SKY SHARES RALLY
Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said Sky withdrawing its recommendation was what it wanted to achieve by formalizing its offer on Wednesday.
""The board confirming they are going to focus on the shareholders, that's the perfect step as far as we are concerned today,"" he told reporters.
Sky is chaired by Murdoch's son James, who played a key role in building the company into a major European broadcaster with operations in Germany, Austria and Italy as well as Britain.
Sky formed a committee of independent directors to consider the bids, given James Murdoch's role as chief executive of Fox.
The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney’s blessing, raises its bid. Fox has to at least match Comcast’s offer, but analysts estimate a final winning bid could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. 
Sky’s shares rose 3.9 percent on Tuesday, closing at 13.59 pounds, above Comcast’s offer, implying that some shareholders anticipated a bidding war. Comcast shares, which had fallen 14 percent since February, were 3.5 percent higher, while Fox's rose 2 percent and Disney gained 1.6 percent.
""We think (Comcast) could reasonably take the offer up to 1300p, but they would be giving away value at anything above that,"" New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said.
Morningstar analyst Allan Nichols said Comcast's offer fully valued Sky, and any increase would be negative for Comcast, Disney or Fox shareholders. That would likely keep a lid on a bidding war, he wrote in a research note.
'UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY'
Hedge fund Elliott has taken a stake of almost 3 percent in Sky, according to its latest filing, and other shareholders have also argued that Disney's agreement to buy Fox implies a higher value for Sky.
Little known in Europe, Philadelphia-based Comcast is the biggest U.S. cable operator, owning broadcasters NBC, CNBC and MSNBC. It also owns movie studio Universal Pictures, home to ""Minions"" and ""Jason Bourne"" movies and some theme parks.
It said it had formalized its offer to coincide with its own results, giving it an opportunity to explain to investors the merits of the bid.
Its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday.
Roberts said Comcast had been built through bold investments since it was founded by his father in 1963.
""When you see opportunities that won't come around again - unique opportunities - you have to consider that with extra focus,"" he said. ""Sky will be our platform for growth across Europe.""
He said Comcast was continuing to work with the European Commission on the regulatory process, and he did not believe a British investigation would be required.
""We believe in the importance of news and the integrity that underpins it (and) we have a proven track record of stewardship and investment,"" he said.
Comcast said it had secured a bridge loan of up to 16 billion pounds and a term loan credit agreement of up to 7 billion pounds to fund the deal. ($1 = 0.7160 pounds)

They are awaiting details from the French and German governments on the exact requirements for the program, which is set to include a fighter jet, unmanned aerial vehicles, connectivity and secure communications. 
""It's a really important moment to stabilize the European defense industry and work together in a structured manner,"" Airbus Defence and Space CEO Dirk Hoke told reporters at the Berlin air show. 
Germany and France have agreed on the central requirements for a new fighter jet to replace Eurofighter Typhoon and Rafale warplanes beginning in 2040, and officials from the two countries will sign an outline document on the sidelines of the show, military sources said on Tuesday.
The two companies want to ensure that Europe retains control over its future weapons systems, Eric Trappier, CEO of Dassault Aviation said. 
""I don't feel that if other European countries buy off the shelf American products that you contribute to strategic autonomy,"" Trappier said. 
Whether the French and German governments decide to involve Britain in future projects would likely depend on the conditions around its exit from the European Union, Hoke said. 
France is working with Britain on an unmanned combat aerial vehicle, but that project has not yet progressed as expected. 
""It was supposed to go up to the extent of joint demonstrator. For some reason this has not yet been decided,"" Trappier said.
He said the Franco-German cooperation was different, with it being for a larger system for a manned fighter, whereas the Franco-British project was for an unmanned aircraft.
The two companies have not yet announced who will lead the partnership for the Franco-German FCAS. Trappier said they would each decide who had the best skills and competencies to lead each part of the system. 
""The role on both sides is to find the right compromises. If we play egos we will end up with a project that won't be successful,"" Hoke said. 
Airbus and Dassault said it was important for France and Germany to launch an initial joint study this year so they could get demonstrators done for 2025. 
The fighter aircraft will replace the current generation of Eurofighter and Rafale aircraft.
Trappier said it would not be a copy of the U.S. F-35 fighter, but would be more ambitious. 
Hoke said if Germany decided to buy the F-35 to replace its Tornados, that would mean the FCAS would no longer be feasible.

Last week, U.S. rival  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) Sikorsky said it had also linked up with more German firms as part of its attempt to land the deal.
Foreign defense companies often offer work to local firms to try to win major government contracts. 
Should the German government select the Boeing H-47 Chinook, the local companies will offer maintenance and training, Michael Hostetter, director, Vertical Lift Programs in Germany, said at a press conference at the Berlin ILA air show.
Hostetter said he expected the full list of requirements (or RFP) from the German government to be presented at the end of this year or the beginning of 2019, but added it seemed as though Germany was looking for a ready-made product.
""The customer has made it very clear that they are looking for low-risk off the shelf solution,"" he said, adding Boeing was able to produce a Chinook every five days at its production site in Philadelphia. 
He said Boeing could offer either the Foxtrot model or an extended range version, with both offering the air-to-air refueling requirement that Germany is likely to seek.
The Chinook has already been selected by the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Spain, Turkey, Britain, and Canada, and Boeing said it had eight active contract campaigns ongoing with plenty of interest. 
The German companies - or German units of foreign companies - that Boeing has partnered with are AERO-Bildungs GmbH, Aircraft Philipp, CAE Elektronik GmbH, COTESA, Diehl Defence, Honeywell, Liebherr-Aerospace, Reiser Simulation and Training GmbH, Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR).
""There is potential to have additional partners onboard to join us depending on what comes out in the RFP,"" Hostetter added.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Shire bid marks Takeda's latest - and biggest - push for global status,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd's (T:4502) $64 billion bid for London-listed rare disease specialist  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) bolsters its credentials as Japan's most outward facing drugs firm, a mould-breaking image that has been more than a decade in the making.
Under chief executive Christophe Weber and his predecessor, Yasuchika Hasegawa, Takeda has cut its exposure to Japan, brought in expertise through overseas acquisitions and thrown open its leadership ranks to foreign talent.
Some investors worry that Takeda, with only $4.3 billion in cash on hand for the Shire deal, may be overreaching.
The company's shares dropped more than 7 percent on Wednesday after Shire said it was willing to recommend the offer to shareholders, and are down 18 percent since news of Takeda's interest in a deal became public in late March.
But few argue that Takeda's management isn't ready to go global. 
Already only 30 percent of the company's drug sales come from Japan, and 70 percent of its workforce is based overseas. The Shire deal would radically accelerate that shift, adding more than $9 billion in U.S. revenue.
""Takeda has been, is and will continue to be the truly international pharmaceutical company of Japanese origin,"" said Philippe Auvaro, Tokyo-based president of rare disease specialist OrphanPacific Inc and a friend of Weber's.
To get there, the company reshaped its corporate culture, along the way fending off a revolt against Hasegawa, who saw a focus on foreign business as the future.
Takeda declined to make Weber or Hasegawa available for this story. Shire declined to comment. 
SHOCK TACTICS 
Hasegawa was the architect of Takeda's shift. He took the company's reins from Kunio Takeda, the last member of the founding family to run the 237-year-old drugmaker.
Hasegawa was determined to look overseas for growth as well as leadership. His philosophy propelled the company onto its continent-straddling path as it acquired U.S. biotech business Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 2008 and Swiss drugmaker Nycomed in 2011.
His pursuit of foreigners to fill Takeda's executive ranks cut against the grain of Japan's insular corporate world.
The surprise decision to appoint Weber - then the company's chief operating officer - as his successor led to open revolt among some of Takeda's old guard.
In 2014, more than 100 former executives and investors signed a letter of objection, calling Weber's appointment a ""hijack by so-called foreign capital... something that should never be allowed."" 
But Hasegawa was unwavering. Acquisitions were essential if the drugmaker was to rebuild its pipeline as drugs lost patent protection, he told shareholders. Weber was the best choice to take Takeda's new products out into the world, he said. 
In the end, Weber's appointment sailed through the annual shareholders meeting, with more than 90 percent of the votes in favor. 
QUIET REVOLUTIONARY 
At first glance, the mild-mannered Weber might not seem the most likely choice to orchestrate the biggest overseas acquisition in Japanese history. 
But those who have worked with him praise his ability to convince others of the need for radical change, making him ideal for a company trying to expand globally. 
Peter Feldinger, who worked at Nycomed and Takeda before becoming a consultant, said the union of the two companies had stalled until Weber took charge.
""It was complicated to take an inherently old, conservative Japanese organization"" and get it to understand the world had changed, he said. 
Brought up in the Alpine city of Annecy, the son of two doctors, Weber spent two decades at GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK), including a stint as head of its vaccines unit.
He took over as chief executive in 2015 after joining Takeda a year earlier as chief operating officer.
Hasegawa stayed on as chairman, using his position to act as a ""shield"" while Weber pushed through unpopular moves, said Tosh Nagate, formerly at Takeda and now chief executive of e-Projection, a company that helps foreign drugmakers expand in Japan. Hasegawa stepped aside into an advisory role last year. 
One of the most difficult decisions was to reduce the number of research and development areas. The company also retrenched in two key sites: Boston and Shonan, southwest of Tokyo.
Under Weber, Takeda's involvement in the Japanese market has continued to wane. The U.S. now accounts for 35 percent of drug sales, but Takeda has promised to keep its headquarters in Japan.
Weber has also been proactive in chasing down cross-border deals, announcing the $5.20 billion purchase of U.S. cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc last year and Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV in January as it tries to rebuild its drug pipeline.
While questions remain over whether Takeda overpaid for its past acquisitions, drugs on the market as a result are feeding stronger recent results. [nL4N1PR2AM] 
ESCAPE VELOCITY
Acquiring Shire would transform Takeda's position in rare diseases, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs. 
For now, many of its peers remain highly exposed to Japan, although a shrinking population and annual drug price revisions have encouraged them to consider overseas expansion plans of their own. 
Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4528), which co-developed the blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY), recently said it was looking to build its own sales network in the U.S. and was considering acquisitions. 
Eisai Co Ltd (T:4523) favors a different approach. Last month it signed a deal to collaborate with Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) to develop and sell its cancer drug Lenvima, both alone and in combination with Merck's immunotherapy product, Keytruda. [nL2N1QP262]
Weber will be under pressure to prove his strategy is the right one - particularly as one of the best-paid executives in Japan. His annual pay is more than 1 billion yen. 
""Highly paid and saying he will stay on until 2025, it's possible he feels that he needs to do something big for his reputation as CEO,"" UBS analyst Atsushi Seki said. 
Complicating matters is that chief financial officer Costa Saroukos, who had overseen the finances of Takeda's Europe and Canada businesses, only started in his new role this month.

Takeda's previous CFO, James Kehoe, quit abruptly in March, citing Japan's high tax rates and a desire to return to the U.S.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","Kering, Credit Suisse earnings fail to boost European shares","LONDON (Reuters) - European shares declined on Wednesday in early deals as worries over rising bond yields trumped a slew of well-received earnings updates from  Kering  and  Credit Suisse , while  Shire  bounced after accepting an improved offer from Takeda. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.5 percent, pulling further away from its highest level since the beginning of February, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was down 0.4 percent.
Concerns over higher bond yields continued after the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury breached the symbolic 3 percent level on Tuesday, raising questions over the relative attractiveness of equities and sectors which pay steady dividends.
On the day, almost every European sector was in negative territory, with shares in oil and gas stocks among the biggest fallers as the oil price inched away from recent highs. 
Even some upbeat earnings reports failed to boost sentiment. Shares in Kering (PA:PRTP) were the biggest STOXX gainers, up 7 percent after the luxury goods company posted an impressive performance in its first quarter results thanks to flying demand for its Gucci clothing and handbags.
Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) stood out among banks, its shares jumping 4.6 percent after beating first-quarter profit expectations as a revamp at the bank bore fruit.
While concerns around semiconductor stocks, in particular those in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain, have weighed on chipmakers this week, STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) saw its shares rise 4.8 percent after an upbeat assessment on second-half demand for its smartphones-focused products.
In M&A news, shares in Shire (L:SHP) popped 1.4 percent after saying that it would recommend Takeda's (T:4502) sweetened $64 billion bid offer to shareholders.

But a number of companies saw their shares punished. Osram Licht (DE:OSRn) dropped 11 percent after cutting its guidance, while Atlas Copco (ST:ATCOa) fell 7.2 after reporting results.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 03:21AM ET</span>",Global banks fear China will limit JV control through new rules,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Engen Tham
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Western banks are seeking clarification from China's securities watchdog on proposals to allow them to take over their onshore securities ventures, amid concerns about high asset value requirements and limits to ownership by non-financial investors.
Giving foreign financial firms a controlling stake in their China securities joint ventures is a key part of China's pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs, especially in the country's trillion-dollar financial sector.
But draft rules released for consultation last month by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) could have the opposite effect and stymie broadening participation, people with knowledge of the matter warned.
Under the proposed rules, controlling shareholders must have a net asset value (NAV) of at least 100 billion yuan ($16 billion), and non-financial Chinese investors would be limited to a one-third shareholding. 
If the NAV rule applied to the Western banks' local units, as opposed to the global entity, most international banks would be ruled out. 
Bankers are rushing to submit requests for clarification of the rules by Sunday, when the consultation period closes.
Lyndon Chao, head of equities at the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA), which represents global banks in Asia, said that while China had opened the door to foreign capital it appeared to be reluctant to welcome overseas securities firms.
""(The door) welcoming foreign securities firms to enter China onshore on a level playing field appears less open than what we had originally thought, based on the second consultation and the net asset value requirement for firms seeking majority ownership,"" he said.
Bankers are unhappy too with the one-third limit on non-financial Chinese investors, which means that if a Western bank linked up with such an investor, it would still need to find another partner for the remaining 16 percent. 
""That doesn't fly with the spirit of what was intended based on the comments from different Chinese regulators,"" said one person with knowledge of the proposed rule changes. ""Three may be a crowd.""
The people who spoke to Reuters declined to be named due to sensitivity of the issue. They said the final rules, expected to be announced by end June, could change to reflect their concerns.
CSRC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
China surprised bankers and lobbyists in November when it said foreign investment banks could raise stakes to 51 percent in their securities joint ventures, which offer underwriting and trading services, from a 49 percent cap.
Banks including Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and UBS (S:UBSG) run joint ventures with varying degrees of operational control but all have pushed for majority ownership. In 2016, a lack of control was a factor in JPMorgan's (N:JPM) decision to sell out of its joint venture.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Whitbread to spin off Costa Coffee,"By Paul Sandle and Rahul B
LONDON (Reuters) -  Whitbread  (L:WTB) will spin off Costa Coffee after activist investors pushed for Britain's biggest coffee chain to be listed as a separate business.
It said Costa Coffee, second in the global coffee shop market after  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), had attractive long-term international opportunities.
The move leaves Whitbread with its Premier Inn hotels operation and the split is expected to be completed within 24 months.
Investors, lead by activists Paul Singer's Elliott and U.S.-based Sachem Head, have been pressuring the British company to split itself up to help unlock value.
""Given the progress Whitbread is making, we are confident that both Premier Inn and Costa will soon be businesses of sufficient strength, scale and capability to enable them to thrive as independent companies,"" Chief Executive Alison Brittain said.
She said the split would be pursued as fast as practical to optimize value for Whitbread's shareholders. 
Elliott Advisors - part of U.S. investor Paul Singer's hedge fund firm which disclosed a 6 percent stake in the company - had estimated the separate businesses to have a total market capitalization of 10 billion pounds, up from around 7.7 billion pounds now.
Brittain, however, the timing of the decision was not influenced by shareholder pressure.
She said it was important that both businesses had strong international growth prospects before they separated, and large acquisitions for both in the last year had achieved that aim.

The announcement came after Whitbread reported growth in full-year revenue of 6.1 percent to 3.3 million pounds and a 4.5 percent rise in underlying profit before tax to 591 million pounds, beating a company-compiled forecast of 585 million pounds.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",'Small-town kids' shape future of China's consumption,"By Stella Qiu and Elias Glenn
XINXIANG, China (Reuters) - The bright lights of Beijing or Shanghai have never held much allure for Wu Tongxu, a 24-year-old civil servant earning a modest salary in the nondescript city of Xinxiang in China's central Henan province. 
But his lifestyle is anything but parochial. 
Wu drives a 370,000 yuan ($58,800) Cadillac sedan, owns a downtown apartment and dines out at restaurants. He can sometimes be found at rock concerts in Hong Kong or on jaunts up Mount Fuji in Japan - financed by his doting parents.
""If I were to live in Beijing or Shanghai, I'd never be able to afford the lifestyle I'm having now,"" said Wu.
Until now, China's consumption has been led by residents of the capital and free-spending coastal cities. But the hinterland has been catching up fast, transformed by industrialization and rapid urbanization in the last 10 years.
In 2016-2020, around 50 million households will enter the middle and upper classes, with half of them likely to be located outside China's top 100 cities, according to a report by The Boston Consulting Group and AliResearch, a unit of the e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA).
That transformation has already helped spur a spending surge in the hinterland. 
In a report by UnionPay/JD.COM, consumption in third- and fourth-tier cities, generally cities with gross domestic product of less than $70 billion, soared 58 percent last year. Taken together, the cities have a total population of nearly 700 million. 
Much of that spending is happening in cities like Xinxiang, a city of 6 million, that has benefited in recent years from the rapid development of nearby Zhengzhou, Henan's capital.
The rise of cities like Xinxiang has coincided with soaring living costs in big metropolises, particularly over the past 18 months as rents hit historic highs. 
Beijing and Shanghai are also tightening controls on migrants in an effort to control urban sprawl and curb the growth of their 20 million-plus populations. 
As a result, so-called ""small-town kids"" around the country are increasingly staying in their hometowns. 
They are splurging on cars, fashion and entertainment, reshaping China's consumption landscape as their peers in Shanghai and Beijing contend with high living costs.
Retail sales in Xinxiang soared 12 percent last year, exceeding Beijing's growth of 5.2 percent. Xinxiang's gross domestic product (GDP) was about 240 billion yuan ($38 billion) last year.
BIG POPULATIONS
For decades, migrants from smaller cities headed for large urban centers where the country's economic boom first took root. 
That is changing.
In Xinxiang, some 90 percent of millennials are staying put in the city, its mayor, Wang Dengxi, said in a statement, when asked by Reuters about demographic changes in the city.
That sort of shift has attracted companies like H&M (ST:HMb), Fast Retailing (T:9983), JD.com (O:JD), China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) and Dalian Wanda Group.
Magnus Olsson, the country manager for H&M China, said in March that the fashion retailer is looking to improve brand recognition in cities where it is not present. [nL8N1R34B6]
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects China's private consumption market will more than double to $11.8 trillion in 2030, from $4.7 trillion currently, with two-thirds of the increase coming from third- and fourth-tier cities. 
A survey of over 3,300 households showed that compared with big cities, third- and fourth-tier city residents are more inclined to spend on leisure travel, cars and online entertainment, according to Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley. He added that much of the spending was led by millennials. 
More than 32 percent of General Motors' Cadillac sales in China in the first quarter were in third- and fourth-tier cities, GM said in a statement, while about 45 percent of its customers are between 25 and 34 years old.
""Many locals here drive Cadillacs,"" said Wu in Xinxiang, sporting a pair of trendy black-rimmed glasses. ""Now, I want to buy a Tesla (O:TSLA).""
Small-town kids also spend more money on online games and live-streaming websites than their peers in first-tier cities, a report by the internet giant Tencent (HK:0700) shows.
This has also led to a cinema boom in lower-tier cities. Box office receipts in third- and fourth-tier cities rose 22 percent last year, surpassing the 11 percent growth in first- and second-tier cities, according to calculations by Reuters, based on data from the online ticketing service provider Maoyan.
China Evergrande Group (HK:3333) is aiming to build 200 cinemas nationwide in the next five years.
In Xinxiang, millennials are also swarming new western-styled bars and clubs at night. 
Tian Zeng, a coffee shop owner, frequently hits the bars with his wife and their friends after a night out in the movies. 
""My philosophy towards life is to enjoy it to the fullest, so I spend money as long as it makes me happy,"" the 30-year-old said. 
SOURCE OF WEALTH
Much of the spending power in China's lower-tier cities comes from rising property values over two decades, analysts say. 
An analysis of 45 Chinese cities of all tiers by Haitong Securities showed a 1 percent increase in property prices in relatively cheap markets brought about a 7.9 percent increase in local consumption growth in 2016. 
Rising property prices have also enriched older Chinese people, like Wu's parents, many of whom are happy to finance the lifestyle of their often only child, according to interviews with over a dozen young people in Xinxiang.
Many young people are also finding their own business opportunities at home. 
Li Jiao, who owns four apartments, started renting them out under Airbnb last year. 
Li, 24, who holds a master's degree from the University of Manchester, said business is so brisk that she is considering hiking rental fees to 300 yuan a night from 250 yuan, almost on par with prices in cities like Beijing.
""A lot of my renters are local students here who have been longing to try something new and different,"" she said.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) delivered its best quarterly results on Wednesday since Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam launched his restructuring plan for Switzerland's second-biggest bank in 2016, driven by its wealth management business. 
After 6.6 billion Swiss francs ($6.7 billion) of losses in 2015 and 2016, and a big tax writedown that wiped out gains last year, Credit Suisse posted 694 million francs in first-quarter net income, beating expectations.
The results showed the bank gaining from Thiam's three-year plan to focus on wealth management over investment banking and settle legal cases.
Net new money inflows - a closely watched indicator of future earnings in wealth management - totaled 14.4 billion francs across its three wealth management businesses, the highest in seven years.
""With these first-quarter results, we got off to a good start in our third and final year of restructuring, and we are looking ahead to the future with confidence in our new business model and in our execution capabilities,"" Thiam said in a statement.
The bank's shares were up 4.9 percent at 16.985 francs in early trade as markets welcomed the results. The stock still trades well below the level when Thiam took over, but has been steadily recovering from a low of 9.4 francs in mid-2016.
""Market estimates are not particularly demanding and, in our view, will be revised upwards each time the bank proves to reap fruits from all the self-help measures,"" Baader Helvea analyst Tomasz Grzelak said in a note.
ADVICE SOUGHT
Gains in Credit Suisse's core business catering for the world's wealthy came amid a spike in market volatility and a slowdown in corporate deals, as a changing geopolitical landscape has made investors cautious and hit investment banks.
Thiam said the need for advice had measurably risen among its private banking clients, who were seeking more contact with their relationship managers as the bank helped wealthy families diversify their assets.
Confirming its 2018 targets, the bank flagged periods of heightened volatility amid geopolitical uncertainty, global trade tensions and monetary policy tightening. ""Client activity levels remain sensitive to these factors, specifically within our more market dependent activities,"" it said.
Swiss rival UBS on Monday posted 1.5 billion francs in quarterly net profit as its investment bank navigated volatility better than Wall Street peers, snatching up a bigger share of corporate deals and placements within a declining market.
Credit Suisse saw revenues fall 8 percent in its investment banking and capital markets division, but said it had a strong pipeline of prospective deals that remained ""dependent on constructive market conditions"".
Earnings at its global markets trading unit, which has been the focus of Thiam's cuts and the source of billions of dollars in losses over recent years, rose to 295 million francs. Thiam had flagged a slowdown in the division's revenues since equities markets plunged in mid-February.

The proposed transfer will provide the fast-growing ride-service firms access to the Vision Fund's resources, hoping to work closely and create synergies in businesses across the world, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the talks.
SoftBank was not immediately available for comment.
SoftBank's stakes in Uber, China's Didi, Brazil's 99, India's Ola and Singapore's Grab could be transferred into the fund within months, the newspaper reported.
The Vision Fund, the world's largest private equity fund, is run by SoftBank board member Rajeev Misra and has become a powerful investor within the technology sector since its close to $93 billion establishment last year.
Due to the restructuring in investment, the invested capital of the Vision Fund is expected to increase but financial details of the transaction are not clear, FT said.
Through its investment arm centered on the Vision Fund, SoftBank has already funneled billions into tech firms around the world.
Owing to direct investment in Uber by Saudi Arabia's state-owned sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), investments have been kept separate to the Vision Fund, FT said.

The PIF, which has assets totaling over $220 billion, paid $3.5 billion for a stake in Uber in mid-2016.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 03:54AM ET</span>",Hostile takeover? Daimler CEO says no fears about Chinese magnate Li Shufu,"By Ilona Wissenbach
BEIJING (Reuters) - German car maker  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) boss said on Wednesday there was no indication the firm's largest shareholder, Chinese auto magnate Li Shufu, was planning a hostile takeover after he took a $9 billion stake in the firm earlier this year.
Dieter Zetsche, Daimler's chief executive, said Li, the head of Chinese carmaker Geely, had told the firm he had no intention to go beyond his current 9.7 percent stake in Daimler, which he announced in February.
Zetsche added that he was not concerned about the firm's top shareholder wrestling further control of the company, which owns carmaker Mercedes-Benz.
""We have no indication of plans for a hostile takeover, therefore we don't need any specific plans (against one)"", he told reporters when asked about the matter during an event at China's main auto show being held in Beijing.
Li's deal for the stake in Daimler raised fears in Germany about the country's most-prized assets falling into Chinese hands, especially because the deal had not triggered normal disclosure thresholds and so caught market insiders unaware.
Earlier this month Germany's spy chief urged vigilance over increased moves by Chinese companies to invest in and acquire high-technology German companies, warning the loss of key technologies could harm the German economy.
Li, a well-connected entrepreneur, had used Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and carefully structured share options to keep the plan under wraps until, at a stroke, he become Daimler's single largest shareholder.
Zetsche added the firm was not currently considering cooperation with Li or his company Geely. Daimler already has a Chinese joint venture partner BAIC (HK:1958).
Li and his firm Zhejiang Geely Holding control Sweden's Volvo Cars, London black-cab maker LEVC as well as its own Hong Kong-listed unit Geely Automobile Holdings (HK:0175). It has also agreed to buy a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks.

Several major deals last year raised German sensitivities about multi-billion euro foreign takeovers, notably Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group (SZ:000333) buying German robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G), and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing buying German metering firm Ista.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 12:57AM ET</span>",Kobe Steel says under investigation over data tampering scandal,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406) said on Wednesday that it is under investigation by Japanese authorities over its data tampering, widening a scandal that undermined faith in Japan's industrial sector last year.
In a statement, Kobe Steel said that ""investigating authorities"" were conducting an inquiry, without elaborating on who was carrying out the probe or what was being investigated, and that it is cooperating with the investigation. A company spokesman confirmed the investigation concerned the data tampering but declined to say when the probe started.
Earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office's special investigative unit has already subpoenaed documents from Kobe and suspects the company, Japan's third-largest steelmaker, of criminally misrepresenting data.
The Kobe Steel spokesman declined to comment on the Nikkei report.
The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office and the Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on the Nikkei report.
A criminal investigation opens up a new phase of the scandal that began when Kobe Steel last October admitted to widespread tampering of quality data for its products causing disruptions in global supply chains as customers re-tested their goods. The company's shares fell 4.3 percent by 0349 GMT.
Kobe Steel, which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, has admitted to supplying products with falsified specifications to more than 600 customers and admitted the data fraud has been going on for nearly five decades.
The case was one of the country's biggest industrial scandals in recent memory, which set off a rash of malfeasance revelations by other Japanese companies, denting the country's reputation for manufacturing excellence.
In addition to the Japanese investigation, Kobe Steel is also the subject of a U.S. Justice Department probe. Additionally, Japanese government-sanctioned seals of quality have also been revoked on some of its product.
In its defense, Kobe has said it sold products that met safety and other standards but did not fulfill contract specifications agreed with customers.
However, Nikkei reported that the Tokyo prosecutors believe the shipping of mislabeled materials to clients may have violated product misrepresentation laws.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>",China carmaker GAC says trade war could hurt plans to enter U.S. market,"By Pei Li and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd (GAC) (SS:601238) on Wednesday said a brewing trade war between China and the United States could hurt the Chinese automaker's plans to break into the U.S. market if tariff barriers were raised.
Feng Xingya, GAC Group president, told reporters at the Beijing auto show that increased U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese vehicles would have a ""significant"" impact on its plans and strategy to break into the United States by 2019.
In a standoff over trade, the U.S. government has said it could add a 25 percent tariff to some 1,300 products from China, including gasoline- and electric-powered motor vehicles. China levies a similar tariff currently on imported U.S. cars.
""If the United States really levies a 25 percent tariff, it would have significant impact on us. We are now doing studies on our price competitiveness and profit potential (after any tariff increase),"" Feng said at Asia's largest auto show.
Chinese automakers export relatively little overseas to markets such as the United States, but manufacturers like GAC and Volvo cars-owner Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) are increasingly looking abroad.
GAC Group and subsidiary GAC Motor presented its Trumpchi brand at the Detroit auto show last year, though it subsequently considered changing the name for the American market due to its unintended similarity to the name of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Feng added that the specter of tariffs made the current climate risky for all Chinese firms seeking to do business in the United States.
""Chinese companies should exercise more caution when they enter the U.S. market and make strategies (for any risks),"" he said.
There is broad hope that China and the United States can reach an agreement on trade to avert the possibility of extra tariffs. Otherwise, China is prepared to retaliate with its own list of tariffs on U.S. goods.
Trump on Tuesday said the United States would likely reach a trade agreement with China and that officials from both sides would meet for negotiations in a few days' time.
China has also pledged to loosen rules for foreign ownership of domestic automakers, previously capped at 50 percent, and allow firms to have more local partners.
GAC's Feng, however, said it may not be in foreign firms' best interests to change current arrangements.

""If the law now says you can at most marry four wives, you are not really going to do that,"" he said.

Speaking at the Beijing auto show, Audi head Rupert Stadler said the automaker would look to offer 10 new sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in China by 2022, and that by 2025 it expected 30 percent of its sales in the market to be electric vehicles.
He also said Audi would expand the range of vehicles it builds with SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104) and to double its engineering staff in China to 750-800, without giving a time frame. 
The comments reflect how foreign automakers have been going out of their way to show their commitment the Chinese market amid simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
China is considering adding duties to U.S. car imports in retaliation to the United States' proposed tariffs on Chinese goods, though Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month pledged to lower import tariffs on products such as cars. 
The country also plans to scrap limits on foreign ownership of automotive ventures by 2022 in a major policy shift. 

Audi sales chief Marco Schubert said manufacturers will likely ship in more cars if China reduces import duties on vehicles. About 10 percent of Audi vehicles sold in China are imported, and that share would likely rise for Audi and its rivals, he said.

186,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",Treasuries’ March Above 3% Faces Challenge From Stock Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- The 10-year Treasury yield finally reached 3 percent, a milestone that bond traders were eyeing for months to guide their next moves.
Then that pesky stock market got in the way.
After all the hoopla surrounding 10-year yields touching the highest in four years, they couldn’t sustain their highest levels of the day, ending at 2.9995 percent. That’s in part because of the dive in equities, driven both by losses in technology shares and by  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT). effectively saying its first-quarter profit will be as good as it gets in 2018.
It’s the latest manifestation of the tug-of-war between stocks and bonds that’s already been evident this year. In February, the specter of accelerating wage growth sent U.S. yields to four-year highs just below 3 percent, which played a role in the equities correction that followed. Last month, Treasuries finally rallied through key resistance levels amid turmoil around  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and other tech companies.
So even though hitting 3 percent may point to higher yields in the world’s biggest bond market, it’s a reminder that they may not come as fast as the last few months.
“I tend to think yields are going to keep rising in general, but with the break of 3 percent I still don’t think we are going to be at, say, 3.5 percent right away,” said John Briggs, head of strategy, Americas, at NatWest Markets. A 10-year yield of about 3.2 percent at year-end is more reasonable, he said.
Rates Consensus
The consensus across Wall Street agrees: Rates are rising, but perhaps not in a hurry. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. estimates the 10-year yield will end 2018 at 3.15 percent, the same as the median forecast of 56 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
In some ways, the Treasury market still hasn’t tested the true high-water mark of the recent past. That would be 3.0516 percent, the peak from Jan. 2, 2014. For Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, 3 percent is just a passing point.
“We’ve consistently been saying we expect 3.5 percent before 2.5 percent,” Sheila Patel, chief executive officer of GSAM’s international division, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “If it’s a measured reasonable pace, and if the reasoning is because of growth, it doesn’t mean a debacle.’’
The 10-year yield flitted around 3 percent on Wednesday.
Deluge Week
For now, bond traders are dealing with a deluge of new debt. This week alone, the Treasury is issuing a combined $96 billion of two-, five- and seven-year notes, the largest slate of fixed-rate coupon sales since 2014. In its $32 billion two-year sale, the notes drew a yield of 2.498 percent, the highest since 2008.
The market is also assessing how quickly the Fed will raise rates. Policy makers’ most recent forecasts are for two additional rate increases in 2018. Traders are pricing in even more than that.
“Other parts of the yield curve have broken out well before this move in 10-year yields,” Briggs said. “The Fed is more confident that it will keep raising rates and that inflation will move to target. The conversations are now that maybe the Fed doesn’t do three but four hikes this year, and maybe three next year.”
Fed officials have largely been sanguine about the stock markets, looking through the pickup in volatility relative to the past couple of years.
But it doesn’t necessarily look like Treasuries will take equity losses in stride, too. So it’s no foregone conclusion that the 10-year yield will rip through 3 percent.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2018 12:15AM ET</span>","GM, South Korea weigh raising investment plan in unit from $2.8 billion: source","By Shinhyung lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) and South Korea are considering increasing the size of their investment in the U.S. automaker's local unit from a previously proposed $2.8 billion, a senior government source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
GM Korea averted bankruptcy on Monday after striking a last-minute wage deal with its labor union. The U.S. automaker has been in talks with the South Korean government on providing financial support, and a preliminary deal on the assistance is likely to be signed on Friday. 
GM had said it would fund its ""portion of the $2.8 billion investment"", paving the way for two new sport utility vehicles to be built in South Korea. The investment was to be over a 10-year period and was conditional to the company winning union concessions and getting government financial support. 
State-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) previously said it may offer about 500 billion won ($468.4 million), proportional to its 17 percent stake in GM Korea, to help fund GM’s investment in the unit. 
""GM has expressed its intention to increase the size of new money injection from its previous plan to normalize management, and asked the KDB to expand its funding proportional to its stake,"" the source told Reuters, requesting anonymity as the matter was confidential.
He declined to comment on the size of the investment.
South Korean online media MoneyToday reported on Wednesday that GM said it would expand the investment to more than 4 trillion won, meaning that KDB's spending would also rise to 700 billion won. 
GM and KDB declined to comment. 
GM shocked South Korea in February when it unveiled a major restructuring plan for the money-losing unit, involving shuttering one of its four plants in the country and voluntary redundancies for 2,600 workers.
On Wednesday GM Korea started receiving applications for a fresh voluntary redundancy program targeted at mainly the remaining 680 workers at the Gunsan factory which faces closure by May. 
The automaker had earlier said it would file for bankruptcy protection should it fail to gain concessions from the union by its extended deadline of Monday evening. 

An hour before the deadline expired, the union reached a preliminary deal to freeze base wages, skip bonuses this year and trim benefits, subject to a vote by its members on Wednesday and Thursday.

All major indices in the U.S. experienced significant drops Tuesday as the yields on 10-year Treasuries topped 3%, pushing up the dollar and increasing the prospect of inflation.
Hong Kong, China, Japan and South Korea all started Wednesday in the red, while Australia was closed for ANZAC Day.
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 0.58% at 9:35PM ET (01:30 GMT), giving up some of their gains from the day before.
Hong Kong shares climbed Tuesday, with the Hang Seng Index rising 1.26%, thanks to energy firms getting a lift from gains in oil prices and airline stocks climbing. A focus was United Company Rusal Plc (HK:0486), the Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminium group, whose shares skyrocketed by 40% after the U.S. offered to lift sanctions on the firm.
In China, the Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.37% shortly after the opening while the Shenzhen Composite Index was down 0.36%.
Shares in both of China’s exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen put in solid performances on Tuesday, as did Hong Kong. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.99% and the Shenzhen Composite Index raked in 2.28%.
Both Hong Kong and Chinese stocks were given a lift Tuesday by declarations from the Chinese government in Beijing that the country is determined to hit its economic targets, increase domestic demand and continue to shore up credit markets, equity markets, bond markets, forex markets and property markets. The assurances may go some way towards reassuring investors jittery about trade tensions between China and the U.S.
But big drops in the U.S. soured at least some of the mood and put pressure on most Asian bourses.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was trading down 0.42% halfway into the morning session while South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.52%.
Facing pressure from rising bond yields, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.74%, while the S&P 500 lost 1.34%. Tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.7%. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 gave up their gains for April after their losses Tuesday."

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were on their longest losing streak of the year on Wednesday, as a rise in U.S. bond yields above 3 percent and warnings from top global firms about rising costs fed fears a boom in earnings may have peaked. 
All eyes will be on scandal-hit social media firm Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) later when it reports its results though there was plenty keeping investors occupied till then.
Falls in Asia's and then Europe's main bourses pushed the 47-country MSCI world share index (MIWD00000PUS) down for a fifth day running to its lowest level in over two weeks. (EU)
Tech-heavy Taiwan shares (TWII) had hit two-month lows as global worries about a slowdown in gadget demand spread, while fast charging oil firms (SXEP) also eased back as crude prices (LCOc1) came off 3-1/2 year highs. [O/R]
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was still pushing further beyond 3 percent (US10YT=RR) in early European trade though, having broken the key level on Tuesday for the first time since the start of 2014. [US/] 
It has been down to a mix of factors. A strong U.S. economy and rising commodity prices which are upping the chance of more U.S. interest rate hikes, as well higher debt and improving relations between Washington and China and North Korea.
""The now healthier global economy justifies these higher yields,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management's Seamus Mac Gorain.
""We expect 10-year Treasuries to end the year between 3 and 3-1/2 percent. A move beyond this level would likely require an acceleration of inflation in the euro zone and Japan, which is not yet evident.""
Euro zone bond yields -- yields are a proxy of borrowing costs -- were dragged up in the slipstream of the U.S. moves though Thursday's looming European Central Bank meeting ensured there was a touch of caution. 
Markets want to know when the ECB plans to wind down its 2.55 trillion euro stimulus program. One of its policymakers, France's Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said on Tuesday the weaker run of recent economic data was expected to pass.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) equity index was last down 0.6 percent, as worries over rising bond yields trumped a slew of well-received earnings updates from  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
S&P E-mini futures (ESc1) slipped 0.2 percent too. Wall Street shares had skidded on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (SPX) slumping 1.34 percent, the most in two-and-a-half weeks. (N)
Industrial heavyweight  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) beat earnings estimates due to strong global demand but its shares tumbled 6.2 percent after management said first-quarter earnings would be the ""high water mark"" for the year and warned of increasing steel prices.
""We've seen quite a lot of companies announcing above-estimate earnings and their shares falling sharply,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Reuters data shows that analysts are now estimating bumper 21.1 percent growth in the Jan-March quarter among U.S. S&P500 firms. 
Fujito noted major financial shares such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Citigroup  (N:C) as well as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) parent Alphabet (N:GOOG), the first major tech firm to report earnings, have followed a similar pattern.
""The market reaction so far feels as if we are starting to see an end of its long rally since 2009. Investors could be thinking that the best time will be soon behind us,"" he said.

EMERGING PRESSURE 
Creeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are also fuelling nerves that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets like stocks and emerging markets.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield (US10YT=RR) rose to as high as 3.02 percent. A break of its January 2014 high of 3.041 percent could turn investors even more bearish. 
Fed Funds rate futures prices <0#FF:> have been constantly falling this month, pricing in a considerable chance of three more rate hikes by the end of this year.
The impact is already reverberating in many emerging markets, with JPMorgan's emerging market bond index <.JPMEPR> hitting a two-month low.
Turkey's central bank holds what is seen as a crucial rate decision later. The lira has tumbled to all time lows this year, spiking up inflation and anything less that a 50 basis points hike in its rates to 13.25 percent could rattle its markets again.
In Indonesia, a market with one of the largest exposures to foreign portfolio holdings, the authorities have been intervening heavily to put a floor under the rupiah , which has been flirted with two-year lows.
The Indian rupee hit a 13-month low too  while China's yuan  has eased back in line with its bond yields as it has tweaked its policy settings.
The dollar also continued gaining against the major currencies. [/FRX]
It traded at a new 2-1/2-month high of 109.21 yen  and knock the euro back to $1.2205 (EUR=), not far from Tuesday's more than 1-month low of $1.2182.
Oil prices were nudging north, but were below the more than three-year highs hit in the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise heavily bullish market.

Brent (LCOc1) fetched $74.01 a barrel, up 15 cents. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) traded flat $67.88 while aluminum sagged another 1.3 percent as it continued its recent sanctions-driven rollercoaster run. [MET/L]

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd forecast higher panel shipments and more stable prices in the second quarter as it reported its first operating loss in six years on Wednesday, hit by a flood of supply from Chinese rivals.
Sluggish sales of liquid crystal displays for TVs and investment costs of shifting production to meet growing demand for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels also weighed on earnings in the first quarter. 
But CFO Don Kim said the second quarter was looking brighter, with panel area shipments expected to grow on-quarter as consumers upgraded to bigger screens to watch major sporting events. 
LCD panel prices should stabilize while demand for large-size OLED panels was also expected to remain strong, he added. 
""The market situation has changed more rapidly than expected,"" he said in a statement, adding the company had underestimated the impact of new Chinese supply. 
""We will be focusing on efficient and flexible management in capital expenditure and maintaining operational performance including intensified cost reduction."" 
The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier posted an operating loss of 98 billion won ($91 million) for January-March. That compares with a 1 trillion won profit in the same period a year ago and an average forecast of a 58.1 billion won loss drawn from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Revenue fell 19.6 percent to 5.7 trillion won. 
LG Display shares, which have been trading near three-month lows so far in April, were up 0.2 percent by 0303 GMT compared with a 1 percent fall in the wider market.
""Investors are betting that this is the last bad result, and it can only go up from here,"" said Kim Hyun-soo, analyst at Hana Financial Investment. 
Chinese panel makers, bolstered by government subsidies, are ramping up production and putting pressure on panel prices, analysts have said. 
Prices of key LCD panels are estimated to have fallen between 6 percent and 10 percent in the first quarter, they added.
Concerns about a glut in the market had driven LG Display shares down about 17 percent so far this year. 
LG Display said that while it expected 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly lower than previous guidance of 9 trillion won, investments would partly depend on the strength of the smartphone market.
Flagging the possibility of deeper cuts in capex, it said would take a ""flexible"" approach to investing in smaller OLED panels for mobile devices due to ""increased uncertainty"". 

Less-than-expected sales of Apple's OLED-screened iPhone X led rival Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics' display business, which has near 100 percent market share in mobile OLED, to lower the utilization of its production lines in the first quarter, according to research provider WitsView.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>","Biotech CEO, two associates accused by U.S. of securities fraud","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of a biotech company that said it was developing a non-opiate pain treatment was arrested along with two associates on Tuesday on U.S. charges that he misled investors and participated in a stock manipulation scheme.
Federal prosecutors in Boston said PixarBio Corp  CEO Frank Reynolds solicited investors with false and misleading claims that he was a successful inventor with a product that would end ""thousands of years of morphine and opioid addiction.""
They said Reynolds, 55, promoted investing in PixarBio with misleading claims about its financial status and progress in seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a non-opiate pain treatment called NeuroRelease.
Prosecutors said two of his associates, M. Jay Herod and Kenneth Stromsland, beginning in November 2016 while in close communication with Reynolds made manipulative trades in PixarBio stock to artificially push up its trading price.
Reynolds and Herod, who authorities said was Reynolds' friend, were arrested in Massachusetts. Stromsland, PixarBio's vice president of investor relations, was arrested in New York.
Joshua Hanye, Reynolds' lawyer, at a hearing in Boston federal court said he denies the allegations. Leonard Milligan, Herod's lawyer, said he has no current involvement with PixarBio. Stromsland's attorney could not be identified.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related lawsuit that said PixarBio raised $12.7 million from 211 investors during the scheme.
All three men were charged with securities fraud. A federal judge meanwhile at the SEC's request issued an order freezing the assets of PixarBio and Reynolds.
Reynolds founded PixarBio after resigning as chief executive of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company  InVivo Therapeutics Holdings  Corp (O:NVIV) in 2013.
According to the criminal complaint, Reynolds in a 2015 email to potential investors claimed PixarBio had a $1 billion valuation that was expected to increase as ""we prepare to replace morphine in the clinic in late 2017 or early 2018.""
In reality, PixarBio was never worth $1 billion and had not even finished the work required to seek permission to conduct human drug trials, the complaint said.
In January 2017, at Reynolds' direction, PixarBio issued a press release entitled ""It's Time to Make US Pharma GREAT Again,"" announcing a $77 million takeover bid for Invivo, the complaint said.
PixarBio in fact lacked the ability to make the bid, the complaint said, yet a day later announced it had upped its offer to $100 million. The SEC subsequently suspended trading in PixarBio.

The S&P 500 bank sector closed down 0.2 percent or roughly 10 percent below its Jan. 29 intraday high, which was its highest level since Oct 2007. In comparison the S&P 500 closed down 1.3 percent for the day.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was the biggest drag on the sector with a 0.5 percent decline, followed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which fell 0.4 percent, and Citibank, down 0.5 percent. Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) rose 4 percent after its profit beat expectations.
Bank stocks often trade higher on the prospect of rising rates as higher interest rates tend to boost bank profits.
The rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to its highest in over four years reflected the durability of the U.S. economic expansion, signaled Tuesday by stronger consumer confidence and new home sales figures.
At least one analyst covering the sector said the modest declines were just a reaction to the broader market decline.
""Investors will get past it and realize fundamentals are still improving and the banks' stock price outperformance will be realized again,"" said Marty Mosby, analyst at stock broker-dealer Vining Sparks, of Memphis, Tennessee. ""Rates are historically low and we haven't gotten to that tipping point yet. The eventual down-draft or recession is a couple of years away."" 
But Charles Peabody, a partner at research firm Portales Partners LLC, in Chatham, New Jersey, said high rates could dampen credit and take a toll on banks as soon as this year.
""We've already seen an inflection point in the consumer side,"" Peabody said. ""We've not yet seen it in the corporate side. That's what we're going to see in the second half of the year.""
Peabody is watching for the point when corporate credit quality starts to deteriorate. 
""You're in a topping process for profits and stocks,"" he said. ""Markets are already discounting it.""
Peabody said a 2016 Bank of America forecast that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates could add $7 billion to net interest income annually compares with a January 2018 forecast that a 100 basis point rise would add $3 billion. 

    ""It's still positive but substantially less,"" he said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Top U.S. weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) welcomed a push by U.S. President Donald Trump to speed up approvals of arms sales, saying it would reassure allies who had been frustrated by bureaucratic delays in the past.
The Trump administration last week rolled out an overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.
Rick Edwards, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin International, told Reuters the initiative should help speed up progress on foreign weapons sales that have already helped fuel his company's growth in recent years.
""It will reassure some of our allies that we're going to move the process faster,"" he said in an interview on the eve of the ILA Berlin Air Show. ""They get frustrated with how long it takes to get through all the wickets.""
Foreign sales accounted for about 30 percent of Lockheed's revenues in 2017 and should expand further in coming years, Edwards said, although he declined to name a specific target.
Lockheed on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast, helped in part by sales of its stealthy F-35 combat jets.
Edwards said that he would not be surprised if U.S. allies in the Gulf began requesting information about the F-35 during the Trump presidency, although future sales would depend on political decisions in that region and the United States.
""These countries are very strong allies, and they're buying a lot of American equipment, so the logical next step is that they'll pursue the rest of American capabilities,"" he said.
At the same time, he said, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors were working to beef up their air and missile defense capabilities and meet other military needs, which would probably take precedence before they moved ahead on any F-35 purchases.
A planned sale of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system is currently in the contract review process in Saudi Arabia, he said.
Lockheed is working closely with Saudi Arabian Military Industries, or SAMI, to work out details on local jobs and local sovereignty, and is likely to wind up with hundreds of Lockheed employees in the kingdom, Edwards said.
Saudi Arabia has announced ""ambitious"" plans to increase the percentage of local work done on weapons contracts to around 50 percent from 2 to 3 percent currently by 2030, he said.
Lockheed is also ""bullish"" on sales in Europe, where it already has 3,500 employees and eight offices, Edwards added.
The company is focused heavily on several German competitions, including a multi-billion-euro heavy-lift helicopter competition in which its CH-53K King Stallion will square off against Boeing's twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. The CH-53K will make its international debut at the air show this week.
Edwards said he was confident that the company's joint venture with European missile maker MBDA would be able to make a deal with Germany for a missile defense system after years of negotiations. ""I don't see any showstoppers and the messaging from our customers has been great,"" he said.

Lockheed is also hoping to score Germany as a new buyer for its F-35 stealth combat jets. The U.S. government on Tuesday provided data to the German defense ministry on the F-35 and the F-15E and F/A-18E/F fighter jets built by  Boeing Co  (N:BA).

201,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. US Treasury Rally Fear Overblown? 
US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as the rise in the U.S. 10Y Treasury yield above 3% spooked equity investors. Yet, some analysts remained adamant that the slump in equities on the back of rising bond yields was somewhat of an overreaction.
US Treasury 10-year yield above 3% is not enough to end the secular bull equity market, according to financial services firm Raymond James.
Rates, although rising, are still very low and investors are going to have to own stocks to have any hope of meeting their long-term return goals, said Raymond James.
Still, rising bond yields do pose a threat to certain areas of the equity market: High-dividend stocks.
Investors had sought dividend-heavy stocks, or bond proxies, during recent years as government bonds offered paltry yields but with bonds yields on the rise investors are expected to shun sectors such as utilities, real estate, and telecom.
Earnings will also be focus on Wednesday amid quarterly reports from a raft of companies including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), AT&T (NYSE:T) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY).
The Dow Jones closed 1.74% lower at 24,024.13 on Tuesday.
2. Traders Eye Second-Straight Weekly Draw in US Crude Supplies
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show a second-straight weekly draw in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 2.0 million barrels in the week ended April 20.
Investors on Tuesday appeared to cut their bullish on Middle East supply disruptions after Trump hinted that the U.S. and France were nearing an agreement to preserve the Iran nuclear deal.
Crude oil futures settled 1.4% lower at $67.70 a barrel.
3. Bitcoin $10,000 Eyed
Bitcoin rose to a more than one-month high on Tuesday as ongoing upbeat sentiment on cryptos and fading fears of regulatory pressures kept demand steady.
The rally in bitcoin since its slump on April 1 to $6,432.4 has lifted investor expectations that the popular crypto was set to test a key psychological level of $10,000.
“After fighting regulation headwinds and tax selling, the path of least resistance is higher, and I believe the sector still has much more upside in the long run,” President of Blue Line Futures Baruch told CNBC. “The ultimate upside is $11,500 to $11,800.”
Renewed investor demand for cryptos has been evident by a resurgence of inflows into the crypto space as the total cryptomarket cap has nearly doubled to about $432 billion in just under two weeks."

203,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",Saudi privatization program targets $11 billion non-oil revenues by 2020,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to generate 35 billion to 40 billion riyals ($9 billion to $11 billion) in non-oil revenues from its privatization program by 2020 and create up to 12,000 jobs, according to a document published by the official Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday.
The initiative targets 14 public-private partnership (PPP) investments worth 24 billion to 28 billion riyals. It includes the corporatization of Saudi ports and the privatization of the production sector at the Saudi Saline Water Conversion Corp (SWCC) and the Ras Al Khair desalination and power plant, the document showed.
The government has said it plans to raise about $200 billion through privatization in coming years as part of ""Vision 2030"" reforms that aim to transform the economy of the world's top oil exporter. It separately wants to raise another $100 billion through the sale of a five percent stake in Saudi Aramco .
""The privatization program aims to strengthen competition, raise the quality of services and economic development, improve the business environment, and remove obstacles that prevent the private sector from playing a bigger role in the kingdom's development ..."" Economy Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri said in a statement.
The delivery document released on Tuesday charts the way forward for the period ending in 2020, during which the government plans to privatize the national football league, flour mills at the General Silos and Flour Mills Organization and part of SWCC.
It will also work on corporatizing ports, privatizing some services in the transportation sector, and transforming King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center into a non-profit organization.
Most processes will be limited to corporatization and preparatory procedures, with full privatization not expected before 2020, according to the document.
The government also plans to introduce a new indicator to evaluate the privatization process in each target sector based on the number of bids submitted by the private sector and their value compared with the original financial value.
The full program has over 100 potential initiatives in more than 10 sectors.
It targets 60.99 billion riyals in non-government investments by 2020 with a goal of contributing up to 14 billion riyals to gross domestic product and up to 33 billion riyals worth of savings in the government's capital and operating expenses from PPP investments.
John Sfakianakis, a former adviser to the government and director of economic research at the Jeddah-based Gulf Research Center, called the delivery plan an important milestone.
""Privatization would improve efficiency and productivity, internally, allowing the kingdom to employ all material and human resources,"" he said.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Shire says willing to recommend Takeda's $64 billion offer to shareholders,"By Ben Martin and Carl O'Donnell
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - London-listed drugmaker  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP) said it was willing to recommend a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co to its shareholders, after the Japanese company sweetened its acquisition offer to 46 billion pounds ($64 billion).
The development, first reported by Reuters, represents a major breakthrough for the companies in their negotiations, following a pursuit that started on March 28 when Takeda said it was considering a bid for Shire. Since then, Takeda has made five offers, the latest on Tuesday.
Shire said in a statement it had agreed to extend a Wednesday regulatory deadline for the deal talks to conclude to May 8 in order to allow Takeda to carry out more due diligence and firm up its bid. Shire added that the deadline could be extended further, if needed.
Takeda's shares slid almost 6 percent in early Tokyo trade on Wednesday as investors fretted over its ability to finance the cash and stock deal. 
Any deal between the two companies is still subject to the resolution of several issues, including completion of due diligence by Shire on Takeda, Shire said.
Takeda added in its own statement that it intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating following the deal.
Shire focuses on treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A deal would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.
It would significantly boost Takeda's position in gastrointestinal disorders, neuroscience, and rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise.
But the transaction would be a huge financial stretch, since Shire is worth considerably more than the Japanese group. Ambitious cost cutting will be required to make the deal pay.
Dealmaking has surged in the drug industry this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. A Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest. Shire has long been seen as a likely takeover target and was nearly bought by U.S. drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) in 2014, until U.S. tax rule changes caused the deal to fall apart. Shire also has a track record of acquisitions, but its biggest ever deal - the $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016 - was widely criticized by shareholders. 
Dublin-based Shire, a member of Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 stock index, said Takeda's fifth offer was worth 49.01 pounds per share, comprised of the equivalent of 27.26 pounds per share in new Takeda shares and 21.75 pounds per share in cash. Under these terms, Shire shareholders would own half of the combined company.
ALLERGAN BOWED OUT
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) Plc, the U.S. maker of Botox, had been considering a rival bid for Shire but ruled itself out of making an offer last week. 
Shire also announced last week it was selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
Takeda has lost more than 17 percent since the news broke that it was considering a bid for Shire, reducing its market value to 3.6 trillion yen ($33 billion). 
Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.
Weber was promoted to CEO in 2015, becoming the drugmaker's first non-Japanese boss.

Shire traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire. Since then it has grown rapidly through acquisitions to generate revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Toys 'R' Us sets up $156 million fund for trade claims: lawyer,"By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Toys 'R' Us will set aside about $156 million to pay vendors for toys and merchandise shipped after the U.S. retailer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last September, a lawyer for the company said on Tuesday. 
The vendor reserve fund will be carved out of a broader budget meant to cover some expenses as the retailer winds down its business in the largest-ever U.S. retail liquidation, Toys 'R' Us lawyer Joshua Sussberg said at a hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia. 
However, the amount fails to cover total trade claims worth roughly $760 million, lawyers who represent trade vendors said at the hearing. 
Vendors ranging from heavyweights such as handicraft company Crayola to smaller toy manufacturers have said in court papers that they were taken by surprise when Toys 'R' Us announced the largest-ever U.S. retail liquidation in March, putting payments at risk.
Many vendors believed that payment for shipments after the Sept. 18 Chapter 11 filing would be covered by a $3.1 billion bankruptcy loan, but that loan gives priority to lenders and other expenses such as legal fees, lawyers said on Tuesday. 
""It's a really hard pill to swallow,"" said Erika Morabito, a lawyer who represents a group of trade vendors. At the hearing, she said vendors remain in a ""dire"" situation even after laying off employees and closing stores. 
More than a dozen executives, specialists and lawyers have told Reuters that many small vendors are at risk of bankruptcy due to the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us in the United States.
In a court filing late Monday, Morabito said that absent a more comprehensive settlement, the group's members and other vendors will likely pursue litigation ""against the persons or entities responsible for the severe losses suffered."" 
Both Morabito's group and an official committee of unsecured creditors are pushing for reserve funds to be paid on a pro rata basis. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Keith Phillips approved the proposed wind-down budget at the hearing.

Phillips also authorized the sale of Toys 'R' Canada to Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd for $237 million. The company has said it is in talks over the sale of its Asian and Central European businesses.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) dropped nearly 2 percent on Tuesday as investors worries intensified about soft demand for iPhones after a warning from a company that supplies components for smartphones.
South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc said following its quarterly report that it expected smartphone demand to stagnate, echoing a similar warning last week from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. 
Concerns ahead of Apple's quarterly report next Tuesday have shaved 9 percent from its stock price in the past five sessions, erasing $80 billion of its stock market value.
""The bar may not have been set low enough,"" Wedbush senior trader Joel Kulina said of Wall Street's declining expectations for iPhone shipments. ""There's still no visibility, and that's going to keep a lot of money on the sidelines."" 
SK Hynix sells memory chips across the smartphone industry, as well as to companies making laptops, servers and other kinds of computers.
Also rattling Apple investors, European chipmaker AMS on Monday warned of a downturn owing to weak orders from one of its main customers. AMS did not name the customer, but analysts estimate that Apple is responsible for half of the Austrian company's revenue.
GBH analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note on Tuesday he now expects Apple to ship 212 million iPhones in fiscal 2018, down from a previous estimate of 221 million.
Apple and investors had been betting that the high-end iPhone X, released last November, would rejuvenate iPhones sales in a global smartphone market that has become saturated in recent years. 
""It's not a flop, but it's a mild disappointment relative to previous upgrade cycles,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley. 
Smartphones account for two thirds of Apple's revenue, about the same as three years ago, despite Chief Executive Tim Cook's attempts to expand further into markets like music and smart watches. 
When Apple reports next week, investors will look for details about how much of Apple's repatriated foreign cash it will give to investors through dividends and share buybacks. 
Apple in January said it would make about $38 billion in tax payments to bring profits kept overseas back to the United States under new federal tax laws, suggesting it may repatriate around $245 billion.

Analysts on average expect Apple's March-quarter revenue to expand 15 percent to $61 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.69, according to Thomson Reuters data.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>","United Airlines CEO forgoes 2017 bonus, board chairman to step down","By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines' (N:UAL) chief executive decided to do without his 2017 annual bonus and the carrier's board chairman will step down, United said in a regulatory filing on Monday, amid ongoing fallout surrounding its customer-service failures.
United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz requested that he not be given his performance-based 2017 bonus payment, the company said. The airline also slashed other executive bonuses by 20 to 30 percent as part of an incentive program designed to tie executive compensation more directly to improved customer satisfaction.
""I felt it was important to send a message about the culture of accountability and integrity that we are building here as a United team,"" Munoz said in a letter to employees on Monday. 
""We had some incredible successes in 2017 but also some setbacks.""
United, the third-largest U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, suffered a public-relations debacle last year when a video of a passenger being violently dragged from his flight went viral. The April 2017 incident sparked widespread consumer outrage and prompted intervention by the U.S. Congress. [L1N1HZ25Y]
In response to the episode, Munoz's employment agreement was amended last year to reverse his planned 2018 appointment to board chairman, instead leaving ""future determinations related to the Chairman position to the discretion of the Board.""
In the months since, the airline has struggled to regain consumer and investor trust, as missteps continued into the new year.
Last month, the death of a puppy in the overhead bin of one of its flights renewed public criticism of the airline and attracted the unwanted attention of federal regulators, including the introduction of a bill in Congress to regulate more tightly in-flight storage of animals.
In the Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, United said two board members, Chairman Robert Milton and director Laurence Simmons, would step down. 
United gave no reason for the moves, and a company representative declined to elaborate.
The board will elect a new independent chairman, but will not replace the head count, reducing the size of the group to 14 directors from 16. 
In 2017, Munoz's total compensation was $9.56 million, including a base salary of $1.25 million and $7.84 million in stock awards. 
Shares of United Continental Holdings Inc were down 3.6 percent at $67.77 on Tuesday afternoon.

Police estimated that about 450 members of trade union Verdi gathered outside the headquarters of the media company  Axel Springer  (DE:SPRGn), where Bezos was to receive an award at a glitzy ceremony attended by German politicians and celebrities.
""We have an Amazon boss who wants to Americanise work relationships and take us back to the 19th century,"" Verdi leader Frank Bsirske told the crowd of Amazon workers, some carrying placards reading ""Make Amazon pay"".
Verdi has organized frequent strikes at Amazon in Germany since May 2013 to press demands for the retailer to raise pay for warehouse workers in accordance with collective bargaining agreements in Germany’s mail order and retail industry.
Earlier on Tuesday, Andrea Nahles, the leader of Germany's Social Democrats, the junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, also hit out at Amazon, calling it a ""world champion in tax evasion"" and criticizing warehouse working conditions. ""That should not earn a prize,"" Nahles said.
Amazon has repeatedly rejected Verdi’s demands, saying it believes warehouse staff should be paid in line with competitors in the logistics sector, not as retail staff.
An Amazon spokesman said on Tuesday: ""Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people across Germany with competitive pay and benefits from day one.""

Germany is Amazon’s second-biggest market after the United States and last year launched deliveries of fresh groceries in Berlin and neighboring Potsdam for members of its Prime subscription service.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","Express Scripts targets Amgen, Lilly migraine drugs in pricing shift","By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits is telling drugmakers that the current pricing model is broken, and taking aim at  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN), Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) and other makers of new migraine medicines to try and fix it.
Express Scripts (O:ESRX) told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don't work within a defined timeframe.The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as ""middlemen"" in the drug supply chain. 
The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.
Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs.
""If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don't do that to patients who have high co-pays,"" Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. ""Let's be more balanced. Let's get back to where gross-to-net is not so different.""Amgen's Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Lilly that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States. 
Lilly has been pushing PBMs ""for years"" to create contracts that take drug performance into account, Chief Executive David Ricks said when analysts asked about the Reuters story on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings.
Ricks said he was happy that Express Scripts ""is now changing their view and support this kind of construct. We'll be happy to work with them on it.""
The new injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.
Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors.
But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available.
Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: ""Should they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.""
Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn't work or caused major side effects. Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with  Novartis  (S:NOVN), declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model. 
Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said. ""It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,"" Harper said. ""No one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time"" until they pay off their insurance deductible.
Shares of Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon, fell 1 percent in midday trading. Lilly declined 0.5 percent. 
TAKING OUT COSTS Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs. 
To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer  Cigna Corp  (N:CI), while PBM rival CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) plans to buy insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) . In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment. 
Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years. 
The biotech company's last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year. Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O:REGN), launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.
As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million. ""If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,"" said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca. Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency's decision on Teva's treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly's galcanezumab is expected later in the year.

218,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","Tech Firms Like Facebook, Twitter to Be `Held to Account' by G-7","(Bloomberg) -- Group of Seven nations are searching for ways to crack down on “disinformation campaigns” that threaten democracies -- and suggesting tech giants could face consequences if they don’t cooperate.
Foreign and security ministers met in Toronto this week, discussing a range of issues, including Russian interference in elections. The security ministers are scheduled to meet Tuesday with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an industry group that includes  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and others.
While the group’s focus has been on counter-terrorism, Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale suggested it could be expanded to include how governments and companies in the internet and technology sector could work together to thwart attacks against democracy. The U.S. has said Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a hacking and disinformation campaign to influence the 2016 U.S. election, while the Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised questions about the use of social media to influence campaigns.
“This is a conversation that is just beginning in many ways but it is a very important conversation where the companies will be held to account for their behavior and their responsibilities,” Goodale told reporters during a press conference in Toronto on Monday.
‘Disinformation Campaigns’
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declined to specify whether countries would consider new penalties for social media platforms that don’t do enough to stop efforts to destabilize democracies, whether in the G-7 or abroad.
The internet and social media have “created new vulnerabilities and new opportunities for actors that wish to pursue disinformation,” Freeland said. Ministers will “prepare some concrete ideas on how to make our democracies more resilient and indeed how to make democracies more resilient around the world.”
Any new measures will respect free speech, political dissent and freedom of expression, she said. “Even as we work to make our democracies more resilient, I think that point is very important to underscore and ministers certainly did,” Freeland said.
The Washington-based Internet Association, a group that represents big technology firms, didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.
G-7 Communique
In the U.S., the Democratic National Committee has sued Russia, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks for what it called a ""brazen attack on American democracy."" The Cambridge Analytica scandal also has a Canadian link, with a Victoria-based firm alleged to be the technology behind harvesting social media data to help win elections.
U.S. legislators have proposed a bill requiring online political ads to disclose who paid for them.
Foreign ministers issued a joint communique on Monday that criticized a “pattern of irresponsible and destabilizing Russian behavior, including interference in countries’ democratic systems.” And they pledged to fight terrorism “while safeguarding the democratic character of our countries, promoting the rule of law, and upholding established national and international human rights norms and obligations.”
Security ministers will wrap up their meeting Tuesday afternoon. Goodale said Monday the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism is “very useful” and includes all major internet companies.
“The focus is what they and we can and should do together to counter terrorist use of the world wide web,” he told reporters. “When we get into those conversations, it is very obvious that there are other harms that need to be addressed as well, like child sexual exploitation, like human trafficking, and like the use of the internet for disinformation and for purposes that interfere with democracy and freedom.”"
219,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Herbalife prepared secret report to get into Ackman's thinking: book,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Herbalife  Ltd. (N:HLF) commissioned a secret report to understand what made activist investor William Ackman tick as he accused the company of being a fraud and bet its share price would collapse to zero, a new book shows.
Nearly two years after Ackman first began researching his $1 billion short-bet against Herbalife, the nutrition company paid $100,000 in 2014 for a 30-page dossier to help management understand and then react to its adversary, television journalist Scott Wapner wrote.
Ackman alleged in public presentations that the company was running an illegal pyramid scheme where members were paid more to recruit new people than for selling the actual product and said many times that the stock price would tumble to zero once the government investigated. Herbalife denied the allegations and its share price traded at $102.37 on Tuesday.
Wapner's book ""When the Wolves Bite; Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle"" is being published on Tuesday. The existence of the dossier had not been previously reported. Herbalife did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.
Ackman is described in the dossier as being ""fiercely competitive,"" ""extremely smart,"" and ""aggressive and competitive in all things,"" Wapner writes, quoting the report. Ackman ""believes he is in the right and stubbornly, inflexibly, sticks to his positions,"" Wapner adds, quoting the report.
The battle over Herbalife's future pitted Ackman, who runs $8.2 billion Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, against Wall Street rivals including Carl Icahn, who bought a big stake in the company in 2013, making it one of Wall Street's most expensive and enduring fights.
Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz relied on media reports and television clips to compile the dossier and did not interview his subject directly, Wapner wrote.

Ackman exited the Herbalife short bet this year, ending his six-year long mission. While Ackman lost money on the bet, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Herbalife and settled with the company in July 2016. Herbalife paid $200 million to compensate consumers who had been deceived into believing they could earn ""substantial money"" by selling Herbalife products, and the company was forced by the FTC to restructure its business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) luxury unit Audi said on Tuesday that it was recalling 1.16 million vehicles worldwide because of concerns that an electric coolant pump could overheat or short-circuit from moisture within the pump and pose a fire risk.
Audi told U.S. regulators the recall covers some 2013-2017 Audi A5 Cabriolet, A5 Sedan and Audi Q5 vehicles, 2012-2015 Audi A6 vehicles and 2013-2016 Audi A4 Sedan and A4 Allroad vehicles with 2.0-liter Turbo FSI engines.
A spokesman for Audi in Germany, Udo Ruegheimer, said the recall covered 1.16 million vehicles worldwide.
Audi said the pump can become blocked with debris from the cooling system, adding that there had been no reports of injuries or crashes related to the issue.
Dealers will replace the pumps but the company did not say when parts will become available, according to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States. 
The recall covers 342,000 vehicles in the United States, NHTSA said. The company said it did not have a breakdown by country of the remaining affected vehicles.
This is the second Audi recall related to the pump issue.

In January 2017, Audi recalled the same group of vehicles in the United States to update the software so that the power supply to the coolant pump would be deactivated if the pump became blocked with debris.

LONDON (Reuters) - Huge payouts to customers mis-sold mortgage and credit card payment protection insurance (PPI) have cost British banks dearly for years, but the end may be in sight and income fund managers are starting to show renewed interest in the sector.
Millions of borrowers were sold unsuitable PPI policies, but a deadline for customer compensation claims has been set for August 2019 and investors are already becoming more bullish about the prospects of capital returns from the banks through dividends or buybacks. 
""What we're anticipating ... is actually that PPI hindrance goes away and we can get significant yield growth from these companies,"" said Ed Meier, who runs the Old Mutual UK Equity Income Fund.
Meier increased his position in Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) in February and  Barclays  (L:BARC) in December.
British banks have spent heavily on conduct, litigation and restructuring since the global financial crisis, but the biggest single sum was for PPI mis-selling.
A total of 30 billion pounds ($41.9 billion) has been paid in compensation to mis-sold customers since January 2011, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Lloyds had by far the biggest exposure to the scandal, with total PPI provisioning of almost 19 billion pounds, dwarfing shareholder returns of 7.9 billion pounds over the same period.(GRAPHIC - Lloyds PPI: https://reut.rs/2FddG39)
Having halted dividends after its government bailout during the financial crisis, the bank resumed payouts in 2014 and launched a 1 billion pound share buyback last month. 
For the first time since 2014 Britain's banks all avoided having to increase their capital reserves after annual stress tests last November, with the Bank of England saying they could cope with a ""disorderly"" Brexit without curbing lending or being bailed out by taxpayers. [nL8N1NY12V]
The banks are now free, therefore, to decide how to spend their profits, with the return of cash to shareholders among options that also include M&A activity and investment in their businesses. 
Barclays has said it could launch a share buyback after it reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) over alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed bonds. It has already reinstated its dividend.
Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) has said it will move quickly to resume dividends once its own case with the DoJ is settled. 
Banks in Britain have so far set aside more than 44 billion pounds to cover such claims and it is likely more of them will have to disclose increased provisions. 
Mid-sized bank CYBG (L:CYBGC) recently said it has increased PPI provisions. [nL3N1RV3QZ]
Lloyds is set to issue a first-quarter trading update early on Wednesday, with Barclays and RBS reporting first-quarter results later in the week.
Eric Moore, who runs Miton's Income Fund, has been gradually building holdings in the banks. He says that dividend yields at both Lloyds and HSBC (L:HSBA) look reasonably good at 4.6 percent and 5.2 percent respectively.
He bought shares in Lloyds from 2015-2017 and in HSBC from 2016-2018. He also hold Barclays stock.

The options include having Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat taking on the additional role of chairman, O'Neill said at the Wall Street bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.
O'Neill added he was ""a bit agnostic"" about keeping the roles of chairman and CEO separate.
Citi's board of directors preferred to have different people in the two roles, O'Neill had said at last year's shareholder meeting.
Corbat, 57, has spent at least 20 years at Citigroup and was installed as CEO with O'Neill's backing in October 2012 when the board fired Vikram Pandit. O'Neill was named chairman in April that year after becoming a board member in 2009.
Wall Street welcomed the O'Neill-Corbat pairing in part because of O'Neill's record boosting shareholder returns a decade earlier when he overhauled Bank of Hawaii Corp, which had businesses sprawling across the Pacific Ocean.
STEINER PROPOSAL FAILS
At Tuesday's annual shareholder meeting, a proposal to lower the stock ownership threshold required to call a special meeting of shareholders failed narrowly with 49.8 percent of votes cast in favor, a preliminary count showed.
Citigroup investor Kenneth Steiner had submitted a proposal to lower the threshold to allow shareholders owning 15 percent of Citi's outstanding common stock to call special meetings. The current threshold in Citi's by-laws stands at 25 percent.
Special meetings can be held between annual shareholder meetings, and can be called by investors to vote on important matters such as electing new directors.
""Our board continues to believe that a 25 percent threshold strikes an appropriate balance,"" Citi said in its proxy http://citi.us/2qYn4Tr statement, and recommended shareholders vote against Steiner's proposal.
Influential proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc had recommended that Citi lower the threshold.
More than 94 percent of votes cast at the meeting backed the 2017 executive pay awards, Citi said.
The compensation included a 48 percent raise for Corbat in 2017, a year in which Citi made more money, but fell short of earlier targets.

The bank said all director candidates were elected with at least 97.9 percent of votes cast.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 05:23PM ET</span>",Google-owner Alphabet's shares fall on rise in costs,"By Arjun Panchadar
(Reuters) - Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc lost more than 5 percent on Tuesday as a surge in costs drove what analysts said was its biggest ever contraction in gross margins, overshadowing strong first-quarter ad sales.
The dive in first-quarter operating margins, to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago, follows a troubling six weeks for major U.S. tech players, now facing a more questioning public and the prospect of tighter official scrutiny on privacy issues.
The fall in Alphabet shares following its first-quarter results on Monday evening turned them negative for the year and amounted to a roughly $37 billion reduction in the value of the Mountain View, California-based firm.
Other members of the FAANG group of tech stocks that include Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) , Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also tracked that move lower.
At least nine brokerages cut their price targets on Alphabet shares, compared to five who raised.
But analysts were reluctant to place the blame as yet on the row over user data which has engulfed Facebook and threatens to encourage more regulation of internet companies.
""There is regulatory risk, though we have yet to find evidence that regulations will adversely impact the usefulness of Google for consumers or advertisers,"" RBC analysts said.
Longer-term capital expenditures at Google nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago. 
The company said that continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube's new TV service and marketing new products.
Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services.
""With YouTube's rapid growth (also in non-ad-supported services) and a greater emphasis on hardware made by Google, we think this gross margin contraction will continue,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham wrote in a client note.
""Gross margin contracted ~370 bps y/y, (that is) the largest contraction in company history.""
Ad sales also suggested that there were no immediate signs of the privacy concerns affecting profits.
Alphabet's shares have risen 25 percent in the past year, making it the third best performing of the FAANG group, trailing only Amazon and Netflix.
The sharp declines in FAANG stocks pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower on Tuesday afternoon.
Facebook and Amazon were each off nearly 4 percent, Netflix dipped 5 percent and Apple shed 1.6 percent.
The technology sector sank 1.47 percent, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. (N)

251,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Forget 3% Treasuries. Hedging Pain Pushes Pimco to Tout Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s but a siren song for Andrew Bosomworth.
Treasury yields near a record high relative to bunds as the 10-year benchmark grazes the 3 percent threshold are little temptation for Pimco’s head of portfolio management in Germany. Bosomworth is more enticed by Italian government notes, Danish mortgage debt and Swedish covered bonds, which he says “offer compelling alternatives to similar quality U.S. dollar securities.”
The reason? Hedging costs. They’re rising as short-term dollar interest rates swell to crisis-era highs -- and may rise further. In fact, on a swapped basis Treasury yields are actually lower compared to bunds than they were a month ago.
As U.S. President Donald Trump’s fiscal easing fuels economic growth, the hedging pain will intensify, according to an emailed note from Pimco’s Bosomworth Tuesday. The firm estimates the cost of hedging dollar exposure for euro investors could rise closer to 4 percent next year from just below 3 percent.
Given the rising rate to neutralize currency risk on U.S. securities, Asian investors have been turning to European bonds -- particularly France, Spain and Italy -- at the expense of Treasuries, according to Mohit Kumar, head of rates strategy at Credit Agricole.
Chasing higher-yielding U.S. government bonds with longer maturities or corporate bonds with lower ratings also comes with caveats, according to the Munich-based investor at Pimco. Late-cycle risks make bonds sold by companies with fragile balance sheets a questionable proposition, while a flattening yield curve makes long-dated government bonds unappealing, he said.
""As the Fed raises rates further, adding to dollar currency hedging costs, European investors will need to reconsider their currency hedged U.S. dollar bond allocations,"" Bosomworth wrote."

The maker of giant industrial equipment said it earned $2.82 per adjusted share, topping the forecast for $2.12 according to Bloomberg. Revenue rose 31% year-on-year to $12.9 billion, beating the estimate for $12.04 billion. 
Caterpillar raised its full-year guidance because it expects continued economic growth and higher demand for its products. It now expects full-year earnings-per-share to be between $10.25-$11.25 per share, better than analysts' median forecast for $9.27. 
""The combination of strength in many of our end markets and our team’s continued focus on operational excellence— including strong cost control — helped us deliver improved margins and a record first-quarter profit,"" Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said in the earnings  statement. 
Caterpillar's commentary on the global economy is often used as a bellweather because its machinery like excavators and bulldozers are used in massive, expensive capital projects. 
The company said it expects the strongest growth in construction to come from North American infrastructure projects and China. The rebound in oil prices should help Latin American economies recover, Caterpillar said.

255,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Google-parent Alphabet slides after earnings,"Shares of  Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slumped more than 2.5% at the opening bell Tuesday after the company reported first quarter earnings that beat expectations on Monday afternoon. 
The stock originally popped as high as 4% before quickly reversing course back into the red. 
For the first quarter of 2018, the search engine giant posted adjusted earnings of $13.33 per share where analysts had expected $9.30, on revenues (ex-traffic acquisition costs) of $24.9 billion, where analysts had expected $24.5 billion.
""Our ongoing strong revenue growth reflects our momentum globally, up 26% versus the first quarter of 2017 and 23% on a constant currency basis to $31.1 billion,"" said CFO Ruth Porat in a press release. ""We have a clear set of exciting opportunities ahead, and our strong growth enables us to invest in them with confidence.""
Shares of Alphabet are flat for 2018 so far as worries about online privacy and regulatory risks weigh on the stock.
""If there is structural risk rising to the leading Internet Platforms, it is likely to come from government,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note ahead of the earnings report. ""And that risk does seem to be rising. Based on numerous discussions with investors, we believe the market may be under-appreciating the regulatory risk facing GOOGL.""
This is the first earnings season since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Like many other companies reporting this quarter, Alphabet said its effective tax rate dropped, from 20% last year to 11% for the first quarter. 
The report was also Wall Street's first look into Google's Nest business, the smart-thermostat and other digital home appliances maker that it bought for  $3.2 billion in 2014. The unit $112 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2018, it said. 
""While fundamental worries coupled by regulatory black clouds continue to be overhangs on the name, we believe 1Q advertising and 'bread and butter' search revenues were healthy and a good barometer of potential strength heading into the rest of 2018,"" Dan Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights wrote in a note to investors following the earnings announcement on Monday."

""I do not see that we kind of pick up and move somewhere else. But of course for future activities, future production, future development, that is open for discussion,"" Tom Enders told reporters on the sidelines of the Berlin Aviation Summit. 
Airbus employs 15,000 people in Britain where it makes all the wings for its commercial aircraft.
The planemaker has previously said it needs to decide whether to spend more on parts in order to build up an extra buffer of stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019.
Asked about Airbus's possible role in a new European fighter jet project, Enders said the group was in ""good discussions"" with other companies that may take part, especially with Dassault (PA:AVMD).
France and Germany are expected to announce initial details about the planned new warplane development program at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which starts on Wednesday, with France's Dassault aiming to take the lead.
Enders said Airbus aimed to avoid the problems seen on the multinational A400M military transport program.
""We never want to come to a situation again where the program is heavily burdened by too many somewhat conflicting requirements or governments telling us which engines or suppliers to take,"" he said.
""That means clear requirements, joint requirements from the customer side, not everybody having 12 different versions,"" he added.
He also stuck with a target for Airbus to deliver 800 aircraft this year, saying he was encouraged by upbeat comments by U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTC) (N:UTX).
UTC's Pratt & Whitney unit halted deliveries of its Geared Turbofan engine for the Airbus A320neo for almost a month this year, but group finance chief Akhil Johri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group expected to meet its full-year target for engine deliveries to Airbus.

""It is no secret that this will be a challenge for the rest of the year, but the positive comments from UTC are certainly an additional encouragement to believe that we can make our guidance,"" Enders said.

259,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",Treasury 10-Year Yield Tops 3% for First Time Since January 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose above 3 percent for the first time since January 2014, snapping out of a months-long trading range amid an onslaught of supply and a Federal Reserve intent on boosting interest rates.
“It’s a big psychological level that has held for quite some time and is a level that global investors are focusing on for direction,” Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said before the level was breached. “Once the dust settles, do we hold above that level and continue to head higher in rates, or does the market hold in?”
Investors including Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital and Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners have highlighted the 3 percent 10-year yield as a critical level for the bond market. It only exceeded it briefly in 2013 and January 2014, toward the end of the bond-market wipeout known as the “taper tantrum.”
The yield rose as high as 2.95 percent in February, before retreating into a range for the past two months. But the prospect of a deluge of new government debt has weighed on the $14.9 trillion Treasuries market. It climbed as high as 3.0014 percent on Tuesday.
The U.S. budget deficit will surpass $1 trillion by 2020, two years sooner than previously estimated, the Congressional Budget Office said this month. At the same time, the Fed is trimming its balance sheet, meaning the amount of net new debt is poised to surge in the years ahead. Treasury has asked primary dealers to give forecasts for America’s borrowing needs over the coming three fiscal years, ahead of the next quarterly refunding on May 2.
Yields were already heading higher at the start of 2018 amid Fed rate hikes, and policy makers have shown no signs of slowing their tightening even with U.S. stock markets fluctuating in recent months.
The increase in longer-term Treasury yields interrupts a relentless flattening of the U.S. yield curve seen in recent months. Central bankers expressed concern this month that the curve was headed toward inversion, a phenomenon that has historically served as a harbinger of recession.
Fed officials’ most recent forecasts are for two additional rate increases in 2018. Traders are pricing in slightly more than that.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 10:46AM ET</span>","Lockheed Martin beats profit estimate, raises 2018 forecast","By Mike Stone and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast Tuesday, but the Pentagon's No.1 weapons supplier failed to raise its outlook for cash flow, pushing shares lower.
While higher sales were driven its stealthy F-35 combat jets, shares of the company fell 3.2 percent to $346.77 on concerns the company did not raise its annual outlook for cash from operations.
The outlook for annual cash flow was the only major financial category that Lockheed did not revise higher.
""There could be some modest disappointment that the cash guidance has not been raised, but it is early in the year and cash is trickier to predict,"" analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research said in a note. 
Revenue from the company's aeronautics business, which makes the F-35 jet, rose 6.7 percent to $4.4 billion. The business accounted for about 38 percent of its total revenue in the quarter.
The F-35 jet is central to the company's growth and already delivers about a quarter of its sales. 
The program has been in the news recently after Reuters reported this month that the U.S. Department of Defense stopped accepting most deliveries of the F-35 over a dispute about who will cover costs for fixing a production error.
The dispute centers around whether Lockheed or its customer should pay what a source said was $118 million dollars to fix a corrosion issue discovered last year. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Lockheed confirmed on April 11 that the Pentagon had halted deliveries of the jet over a contractual issue, but did not give further details.
During Tuesday's earning's conference call with Wall Street analysts there could be a ""focus on recent F-35 newsflow,"" Stallard said in his note.
He added that ""this was a good operating quarter from Lockheed, with an operations/tax boost to the earnings per share.""
Following the U.S. tax law change passed last year, Lockheed reported its effective tax rate was 14.9 percent compared with 23.8 percent for the same quarter last year. The rate was helped in part by a $1.5 billion contribution to the company's pension plan this quarter.
Profits were up at Lockheed's Missiles and Fire Control business unit, as well as its Rotary and Mission Systems business unit, which makes Sikorsky helicopters. The Space unit saw profits fall modestly from 12 percent to 11.3 percent in part because of lower sales of a space-based infrared sensor system. 
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised its 2018 net sales forecast to a range of $50.35 billion to $51.85 billion from a range of $50 billion to $51.50 billion. 
Full-year profit is now expected to rise between $15.80 and $16.10 per share, compared with its earlier estimate of $15.20 to $15.50 per share.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>","South African Airways says it needs capital injection ""now""","CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African Airways (SAA) needs a new capital injection ""now"" to stay afloat and is in discussions with banks and the National Treasury for ""an open credit line"", its chief executive said on Tuesday.
State-owned SAA, which has not generated a profit since 2011, is regularly cited by ratings agencies as a drain on the government purse and has already received state guarantees totaling nearly 20 billion rand ($1.6 billion).
""We do need access to capital to sustain the operations and we are having discussions with Treasury, as well as the banks around how we have an open credit line,"" Chief Executive Vuyani Jarana told parliament.
Asked by an opposition lawmaker when the airline would need to access billions of rands of extra state support, Jarana responded ""Now"".
He later told reporters that SAA would need around 5 billion rand this year to pay down debts and for operational costs. The struggling airline has not had credit facilities since August when bank lenders pulled the plug after a debt repayment scare. 
""Over the next six months we will need... in the range of 5 billion rand to make sure we can support the working capital,"" Jarana said, adding that amount included arrear payments.
The National Treasury said that SAA needs an equity partner to pump money into the company to address a liquidity crisis and to help with the implementation of a turnaround plan.
The company's results for the year to March 31, 2017 - which had been delayed after the company received a 10 billion rand government bailout last year - showed a deepening loss of 5.6 billion rand, a more than threefold increase from the previous year's 1.5 billion rand loss.
SAA will need to repay bank debts of 9.2 billion rand by March 2019, Jarana said, adding that this figure could increase.
""SAA has not been able to pay the principal amount, we've always been able to service the interest payments on this, so part of the strategic options we are looking at... is an optimal capital structure,"" he told reporters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) has sweetened its $62 billion bid for  Shire  (L:SHP) as it races to agree terms with the drugmaker before a deadline to strike a deal expires on Wednesday.
Dublin-based Shire, a member of Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 stock index, said it had received a fifth takeover proposal from Takeda on Tuesday but gave no details of the revised bid. It said its board was considering its position.
Takeda, which confirmed the new proposal without providing details, said there was no certainty a firm offer will be made. 
It comes after Takeda's fourth bid for Shire on Friday, which was pitched at 47 pounds per share and made up of 26 pounds in Takeda stock and 21 pounds in cash. That valued Shire, which is led by Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov, at 44.3 billion pounds ($61.8 billion).
Under British rules, Takeda has until 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Wednesday to make a firm offer or walk away from Shire. 
However, that deadline can be moved back at the request of the FTSE 100 drugmaker and Takeda had said on Friday that it hoped negotiations with Shire would lead to an extension of the cut-off date.
Shares in the London-listed company were up 3.4 percent at 39.30 pounds in afternoon trade.
The latest bid came just before Shire held its annual shareholder meeting in Dublin on Tuesday.
""As of now we can only say that discussions between the advisers of Shire and Takeda are ongoing,"" Susan Kilsby, the drugmaker's chairwoman, told investors at the meeting, which lasted less than 15 minutes.
Shire focuses on treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a takeover would catapult Takeda into the top ranks of global drugmakers. 
BIGGEST OVERSEAS ACQUISITION
It would also mark the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese firm and an audacious move by Takeda's French chief executive, Christophe Weber.
Allergan (N:AGN), the U.S. maker of Botox, had been considering a rival bid for Shire but ruled itself out of making an offer on April 19. Shire also announced last week it was selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion. 
Takeda's shares closed down 1.5 percent on Tuesday, giving it a market value of 3.86 trillion yen ($35.5 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data. That is much smaller than the value of the fourth bid for Shire that Takeda disclosed last week.
Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.
Weber was promoted to chief executive in 2015, becoming the drugmaker's first non-Japanese boss.
The Japanese firm said last month that buying Shire would bolster its position in the United States, in gastrointestinal diseases and neuroscience.
Its bid comes amid a surge in dealmaking in the pharmaceuticals industry as the biggest players hunt for promising assets to bolster their pipelines.
Shire traces its roots back to 1986, when it began as a seller of calcium supplements to treat osteoporosis, operating from an office above a shop in Hampshire. Since then it has grown rapidly through acquisitions into a giant that generated annual revenues of about $15.2 billion last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street dropped sharply on Tuesday as warnings by bellwether companies of higher costs reverberated as the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield pierced the 3 percent level for the first time in four years.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), an industrial heavyweight, tumbled 6.20 percent after management said first-quarter earnings would be the ""high water mark"" for the year and warned of increasing steel prices, although the company beat earnings estimates due to strong global demand.
The S&P 500 and the Dow fell the most in two-and-a-half weeks, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down for a fifth day in a row. The S&P 500 is down 1.5 percent year-to-date.
Other companies, including Lockheed and 3M, also gave disappointing updates, adding to the sting of rising Treasury yields. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs.
""It makes borrowing costs more expensive for corporations. This market rally for the last nine years has been driven by low interest rates, accommodating monetary policy and excess liquidity,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist for Bruderman Asset Management in New York.
Higher bond yields could also prompt portfolio managers to weigh moving money into more attractive fixed-income securities at the expense of equities. The stock market had already been spooked by a climb in bond yields earlier in the year, sliding sharply in February..
Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M Co (N:MMM) was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI). Shares fell 6.83 percent after the company posted in-line profits as lower taxes offset a miss in operating profits and the company lowered its 2018 earnings forecast. 
""We're seeing some of the earnings numbers have come out, and after further review, (investors) realized where all this revenue was coming from,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""They didn't see it as recurring or indicative of the core business. 
""I think what investors had hoped the benefit from taxes would get redeployed back into the company. That's not happening,"" Nolte said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 424.56 points, or 1.74 percent, to 24,024.13, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 35.73 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,634.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35.
Technology (SPLRCT) stocks also weighed on the major indexes.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) fell 3.7 percent. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares fell 4.77 percent, erasing the stock's year-to-date gains as rising expenses and shrinking margins overshadowed the company's better-than-expected quarterly profit.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares lost 1.39 percent as worries over softening demand for high-end smartphones were underscored as  Corning Inc  (N:GLW) reported a drop in screen glass sales for the first time in at least four quarters.
Fellow technology stocks Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) also weighed on the Nasdaq.
""They're kind of pulling each other down,"" said Nolte. ""Investors are saying, 'You know, the group has had a tremendous run over the last two to three years, maybe we should take some money off the table here.'"" 
Shares of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), the Pentagon's largest weapons supplier, dropped 6.17 percent. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and boosted its full-year sales and profit forecast but did not raise its 2018 cash-flow projections.
So far, 24 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter results, with 77.1 percent coming in above the Street consensus, versus the 64 percent average since 1994. Analysts estimate 21.1 percent growth in earnings for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
On the economic front, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April, according to the Conference Board, as short-term optimism improved and the share of consumers expecting their incomes to decline in the coming months hit its lowest level since December 2000.
Oil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest level since November 2014, but then reversed course as U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged to try to resolve U.S.-European differences on Iran, easing concerns that the United States might reinstate sanctions against Iran.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.94-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 90 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.80 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier lost fewer monthly phone subscribers than feared, and the company's chief financial officer said it was continuing to explore a new video service.
Shares of the company rose 1.8 percent to $49.55.
Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at ""over-the-top"" options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels.
Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) assets, which Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) is trying to buy for $52.4 billion.
The company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) and AOL, Ellis said. 
That could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview. 
Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T Inc (N:T), which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus.
Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said. 
Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.17 per share. Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier.
Analysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Verizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers. 
Verizon's first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included about 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition. 

The company said it expected savings from tax reform to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","Coke warns of pain from UK sugar tax, U.S. freight costs","By Nivedita Balu and Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) said on Tuesday it would take a hit in the second quarter from the introduction of a British sugar tax on soft drinks and rising freight costs in the United States, overshadowing modestly better than forecast results for the first three months of 2018.
The somber forecast undid an initial rise in shares of the world's biggest drinks maker after it topped forecasts for revenue and profit, helped by a reboot of its Diet Coke brand that has introduced new flavors and cans. 
The company said it had reformulated recipes and launched smaller packaging to ensure that two-thirds of its major brands would not be subject to the new tax, but Coca-Cola Classic, its top-selling U.K. brand, will still face the levy, which kicked in on April 6.
Company executives during a post-earnings call also cautioned that rising freight costs in North America, up 20 percent from a year earlier, would reduce revenue in the first half of the year.
""People assumed that Coke sold to bottlers, and so some didn't realize how much exposure the company has on freight,"" said Brittany Weissman, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones. ""But they do distribute and are affected.""
U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs. 
A jump in volumes due to the timing of Easter holiday shipments and price cuts in North America helped Coca-Cola top first-quarter revenue estimate by $300 million.
Total volumes rose 3 percent in the first quarter, with growth in both sodas and teas and coffees driving much of the gains. 
Organic sales, which exclude gains from acquisitions or divestitures, rose 5 percent in the quarter.
""While it's good to see the underlying volumes improve, people are concerned on the pricing side, if those volumes are gaining at the expense of the price and mix,"" said Weissman.
First quarter net revenue fell 16 percent to $7.63 billion, due to the divestment of its bottling operations, but beat analysts' estimates of $7.34 billion.
Despite the strong results, Coca-Cola retained its full-year outlook for organic sales growth and earnings per share, which could also have disappointed investors, brokerage Macquarie said.

Excluding items, net profit of 47 cents per share beat consensus forecasts by 1 cent, the company said.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 07:05AM ET</span>",GM Korea averts bankruptcy but how long will it stay?,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM)' South Korean unit has averted a bankruptcy filing, but analysts and customers, as well as the South Korean government, are debating how long the loss-making company will remain in business.
GM Korea agreed a last-minute wage deal with its union on Monday, paving the way for nearly $500 million in fresh capital injection by the government.
But the government remains unconvinced about the company's longer-term commitment to remain in business and is pressing GM for a detailed plan. It worries that the U.S. auto giant's strategy of exiting unprofitable markets may lead to a complete pull out from South Korea.
""Our condition for the support is a long-term viability plan from GM. When we say long-term, we are talking about 10 years and more,"" a government official familiar with the GM issue told Reuters.
GM said the plan will help it restructure and eventually halt slumping sales and shrinking factory operations.
""This provides a way for us to turn around the business in the short term and allow us to look at the long-term viability of our business and our product lineup,"" GM spokesman David Albritton told Reuters.
But it could be a tall order, as the three remaining out of GM Korea's four factories are running below full capacity due to GM's exit from Europe, waning demand for small cars, its mainstay, and consumer concerns about the company's future in South Korea.
GM has said it will add two new sport utility vehicles in South Korea as part of an $2.8 billion investment over the next 10 years, but production of those new models will start only from late 2019.
""We cannot comment on specific product plans, but you have to think about these two new models as just the beginning,"" GM spokesman Albritton said.
COMPLETE EXIT?
Once the backbone of GM's global expansion strategy, GM Korea produced close to a fifth of its global output of Chevrolet vehicles at its peak.
But a sharp rise in labour costs, and GM's shift in strategy to scale back its presence in unprofitable markets following its emergence from 2009 bankruptcy, have prompted speculation that it may pull out in South Korea.
A source close to GM's Detroit management said the company had been looking for a complete exit from South Korea in line with CEO Mary Barra’s strategy of focusing the company on the United States and China, a view echoed by some analysts.
""Our base case now assumes that GM substantially exits GM Korea. Restructuring in Korea is extremely expensive, and it may take many years to play out,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report on Friday.
""GM doesn't have the time or the resources to devote to regions that lack visibility into generating a positive return or even a positive margin,"" it said.
GM denied it was contemplating such a move.
""We are at a starting point with our 10-year long term plan,"" an executive at GM Korea told Reuters.
""There has been long controversy whether we will pull out of Korea, but our plan has become more concrete now,"" he said.
South Korean government officials say they have no choice but to salvage GM to protect jobs.
A senior government official told Reuters even in the worst case scenario of GM pulling out, it would not be a bad deal if South Korea can save hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next five years in return for taxpayers' money.
However, the official added that the government wanted to regain veto powers of state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) that allow it to block GM's potential sale of its assets. The veto expired last year.
KDB is the second biggest shareholder of GM Korea with a 17 percent stake. The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while China's SAIC Motor Corp Ltd controls the remaining 6 percent.
ABYSMAL STATE
When GM acquired 42 percent of Daewoo Motors in 2002 to get a foothold in South Korea, it bought the failed carmaker at a ""ridiculously low"" price of $251 million, as it was ""in the most abysmal financial state possible,"" former GM executive Bob Lutz wrote in a book.
But it proved to be a ""highly capable engineering and design source"" which formed the backbone of GM's Asian strategy under the Chevrolet brand and the brand's global growth, he said.
GM Korea made a spectacular turnaround, boosting volume by over three-fold to a record 940,000 vehicles in 2007 from 2002.
But it got into trouble in 2014, hit by GM's exit from Europe announced a year earlier. Its production volume slipped to just 520,000 cars last year and prompted it to post a net loss of $1.1 billion, its fourth straight year in the red.
Earnings will come under pressure again this year, as domestic vehicle sales have slumped over 50 percent since February when it announced the restructuring.
""For the moment, GM may need South Korea to fill up a shortage of engineering resources after GM's sale of Opel in Europe,"" Park Pyong-wan, a former GM Korea executive, told Reuters, adding the company has not made any new hires since 2013.

""But in the long term, GM Korea will not last long.""

Alleged intellectual property theft was one of the main issues German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron last month in a call over China's trade practices.
More than 70 percent of companies surveyed by VDMA said they were affected by product or brand piracy, the trade body said.
""Aside from the loss of revenues and jobs there are also consequences for the affected companies that are difficult to quantify, such as damage to their image, loss of competitive advantage and unjustified compensation claims,"" Steffen Zimmermann, the head of VDMA's Competence Center Industrial Security, said at the Hannover Messe trade fair.
The scale of damage was identical to that recorded in VDMA's survey for the previous year. But VDMA said counterfeiters were becoming more brazen, increasingly copying not only a product's technical details but also its brand and appearance.
More counterfeit products were also distributed over the internet than in the previous survey.
German shoe maker Birkenstock earlier this year stopped supplying Amazon (O:AMZN) in Europe because of counterfeit products being sold on the website.
China was both the largest manufacturer and the largest market for counterfeit products, VDMA's survey showed. Competitors from within Germany itself came second.
Almost 140 small and medium-sized engineering companies participated in the survey, which was conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security in March and April this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares had a choppy opening on Tuesday as a batch of first-quarter corporate results failed to set a clear upward trend and chipmakers were weighed down by AMS' warning of a downturn in orders. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.2 percent by 0840 GMT after spending some time in negative territory as it moved towards a heavy week of earnings.
Falls in business morale in Germany and Italy had little impact on trading but rising oil prices buoyed shares in the energy sector and offered some support to European indexes. 
Consumer staples stocks, which investors have held as proxies to bonds for their stable revenues and income stream, rebounded after a session of losses on Monday when U.S. 10-year treasury yields threatened to cross the 3 percent benchmark and make their returns less attractive. 
Austria-based chipmaker and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  supplier AMS (S:AMS) tumbled 13 percent after reporting lower orders from one of its main customers which it did not name, sending shares in other companies in the sector down. 
""It is reasonable to assume that this will have a negative impact on STM's Q2 guidance as well"", Liberum analysts said as shares in STMicro (MI:STM) fell 2.3 percent and peer Dialog Semi (DE:DLGS) tumbled 4.1 percent.
These results come as a strong growth in ad sales for Google despite a surge in costs at its parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) brought some relief to the sector after a ropey few months for leading U.S. tech companies.
Germany's SAP (DE:SAPG) rose 3.5 percent after saying it was gaining ground on competitors Salesforce (N:CRM) and Oracle (N:ORCL) in the cloud and that its margin recovery was firmly on track.
The banking sector (SX7P), down 0.37 percent, got little support from the results of Santander (MC:SAN), the euro zone's biggest bank by market value, whose shares fell 2.2 pct after profits in the UK disappointed.
 Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) however added 1.6 percent. It may spell out strategy changes for its investment bank on Thursday along with first-quarter earnings.
Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) had failed to cheer up investors on Monday after its flagship wealth management business missed forecasts.
The automobile sector (SXAP), which has been a clear outperformer since the beginning of the year, edged down 0.5 percent, dragged down by AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb).
The truck maker cautioned that its supply chain was coming under pressure and saw its shares fall about 4 percent. 
Results from French tyre maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and automaker PSA Group (PA:PEUP) also disappointed with shares down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively.

Dutch paints and coatings maker  Akzo Nobel  (AS:AKZO) lost 4.5 percent after reporting a larger-than-expected 28 percent drop in first-quarter core profit.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Express Scripts targets new migraine drugs to change U.S. pricing dynamic,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits is telling drugmakers that the current pricing model is broken, and taking aim at  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and other makers of new migraine medicines to try and fix it.
Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don't work within a defined timeframe. The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as ""middlemen"" in the drug supply chain. 
The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.
Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs.
""If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don't do that to patients who have high co-pays,"" Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. ""Let's be more balanced. Let's get back to where gross-to-net is not so different."" Amgen's Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Eli Lilly & Co that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States. 
The injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.
Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors.
But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available.
Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: ""Should they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.""
Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn't work or caused major side effects. 
Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy. Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model. 
Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said. 
""It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,"" Harper said. ""No one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time"" until they pay off their insurance deductible.
TAKING OUT COSTS 
Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs. 
To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), while PBM rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) plans to buy insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET) . 
In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment. 
Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. Officials at Lilly did not respond to a request for comment. 
The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years. 
The biotech company's last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year. 
Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi (PA:SASY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.
As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million. 
""If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,"" said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca. 
Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients. 
The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency's decision on Teva's treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly's galcanezumab is expected later in the year.

Amgen will report quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>","Softbank, Google join $1.9 billion investment in China truck-hailing firm","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Japan's Softbank Group and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's venture capital fund CapitalG are among investors pouring $1.9 billion into a truck hailing service platform Manbang, the Chinese company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Manbang, formally known as Full Truck Alliance Group, said the investment was led by SoftBank's Vision Fund - which counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Foxconn and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund among its backers. 
Investors also include state-backed private equity firm China Reform Fund and Hong Kong-based investment firm Ward Ferry, said Manbang.
The investment will help Manbang develop new business areas and markets, the company said. Around 5.2 million out of China's 7 million trunk line trucks are members of the Full Truck Alliance, Manbang added.
Manbang, often described as China's ""Uber for trucks"", runs an app that allows shippers to connect with truck drivers, tapping into demand for haulage in one of the world's busiest markets for goods transport.
The investment was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing sources, who said the fund raising would put the company's valuation north of $6 billion.
Manbang CEO Wang Gang said in a statement that the firm would use much of the funds ""to recruit talent"", which when necessary could include making acquisitions.

""The deal has brought Manbang's development into a new stage,"" Wang said, adding it would help the firm ""become the world's largest platform in terms of transportation capacity.""

308,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs Says Insurers' Risk Appetite Cooling on U.S. Fears,"(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s asset-management unit, which oversees $250 billion for insurers, said an economic slowdown in the U.S. is the biggest investment risk for the industry for the first time since the financial crisis.
“Insurers expressed a growing consensus that we are in the late stage of the U.S. credit cycle,” the Goldman unit said in a report following a survey of 300 senior insurance executives. “With rates expected to rise and equity valuations high, insurers are concerned with achieving adequate returns without leaving their portfolios exposed in the event of a downturn.”
Inflation expectations have also risen in the U.S. as rising protectionism damps prospects for global growth, adding to the concerns about the economy. That could be a double whammy for insurers, cutting the value of their portfolios in the short term and probably increasing the claims paid by non-life insurers over the long term.
In 2017, “people were expecting inflation to become an issue in five years,” Etienne Comon head of insurance in the Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said at a media briefing. ""Now this has been brought forward -- more view inflation becoming an issue within the next two to three years.”
Executives plan to cut risk in equities and credit, increase liquidity in their portfolios and reduce the duration of their exposures as interest rates rise, the survey shows. High-yield debt, tax-exempt municipal bonds and U.S. equities are among the investments that managers plan to decrease. Infrastructure debt, commercial mortgage loans and corporate credit for mid-market firms are areas where they want to allocate more capital.
Cryptocurrencies, while being much debated, are not believed to be suitable investments for portfolios at this stage, while a third of those surveyed view them as a potential risk to financial markets.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>","Chinese tech giants, government under fire for 'men only' job ads","By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - Top Chinese tech firms and some government departments have been singled out in a report that says discriminatory hiring practices based on gender are widespread in China and are linked to a shrinking proportion of women in the labor force.
Job ads posted by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent Holdings Ltd were among those that deterred female applicants or objectified women, said Human Rights Watch in a report released on Monday.
In many of the adverts, prospective employers boasted of ""beautiful girls"" at their workplace as a selling point for new employees, while others included specific height, appearance and temperament requirements for women that were unrelated to the roles.
""We have investigated these incidents and are making immediate changes. We are sorry they occurred and we will take swift action to ensure they do not happen again,"" Tencent said in a statement. 
An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company ""will conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements to ensure compliance with our policy.""
A Baidu spokeswoman said the postings were ""isolated instances"". 
The report comes amid a larger Chinese movement against gender-based discrimination and harassment, buoyed by the global #MeToo movement, which has since been heavily censored online in the country.
The #MeToo movement began last year as victims of discrimination and sexual harassment took to social media to share their stories under the hashtag #MeToo. Silicon Valley firms have since been accused of discriminatory behavior, turning the focus on tech worldwide.
Human Rights Watch, which analyzed 36,000 Chinese job advertisements largely posted since 2013, also criticized adverts for government roles, construction workers and kindergarten teachers.
It said that so far in 2018, 19 percent of the Chinese civil service job adverts it reviewed were ""men only"" or at least said men were preferred. Only one job posting this year listed a preference for a female candidate, it said.
Reuters sent a fax seeking comment to the Ministry of Public Security, a bureau mentioned in the report, but did not receive a response.
Some firms looked to avoid scrutiny of their practices, including using code words to show a male preference, Human Rights Watch said. One used the Chinese word for south, ""nan"", which in Chinese has the same pronunciation as the word for ""man"", it said.
It added discriminatory hiring behavior was a key issue behind the relatively low numbers of women in the workforce and growing gender disparity over urban pay.
Chinese laws ban discrimination based on gender, but ""enforcement is low and Chinese authorities rarely proactively investigate companies that repeatedly violate relevant laws,"" Human Rights Watch said in the report.
The country's #MeToo movement has, however, been gaining momentum on university campuses since late last year, and several schools have cut ties with professors amid claims of harassment and assault dating back decades.
The Human Rights Watch report received a muted response on Chinese social media on Tuesday, with almost no posts commenting on the issue on popular microblog platforms such as Alibaba-backed Weibo or Tencent's mobile chat app WeChat.

Chinese social media firms are often required to censor civil rights discussions, including previous Human Rights Watch findings and posts related to the #MeToo movement.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 04:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's HNA Group seeks up to $1.5 billion in new fund - document,"By John Tilak and Matthew Miller
(Reuters) - A unit of debt-laden Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIR.UL] is seeking to raise as much as $1.5 billion by the end of this year in an investment fund that will serve as the group's primary vehicle for global acquisitions, a document reviewed by Reuters showed. 
The Overseas Aviation and Tourism Industry Fund will target travel, aviation and real estate assets around the world, according to the document. HNA Aviation and Tourism Group is the division of the company that is behind the fund, the document showed. The fund raising comes as the Chinese conglomerate is unloading assets and partnering with other companies as part of a wider reorganization, sparked by mounting debts levels after announcing more than $50 billion worth of global M&A deals over 2016 and 2017. The group has traditionally made direct acquisitions, and that strategy has resulted in higher debt. 
HNA also has been pushed back by regulators in several countries, concerned about its murky ownership structure. Capital control restrictions placed by Chinese regulators in recent years have also been weighing on HNA's deal activity. 
The company has started to raise external capital for the fund this month, according to the document. HNA's aviation and tourism division and or its affiliates will be the general partner of the fund, with a group-related limited partner initially committing about $100 million to $150 million, it showed. 
HNA is also trying to attract limited partners to invest at various stages. HNA is guaranteeing to investors a minimum return of 8 to 10 percent, calling that a competitive advantage, the document showed. 
HNA Group in Beijing declined to comment for the story. 
The fund raising plan indicates that HNA is looking to move away from using its own balance sheet to do deals – thereby reducing its risk profile – and instead adopt a model where institutional investors make significant contributions, the document showed. And the fund will be based in an offshore location. 
The Chinese aviation-to-financial services conglomerate’s restructuring includes selling overseas real estate and equity investments totaling more than $10 billion in assets, such as stakes in Hilton Worldwide, Hilton Grand Vacations and Hilton Park Hotels & Resorts. 
""This is in response to the Chinese government's prohibition of future investments and concerns that their debt levels are untenable,"" said Frank Turner, co-chair of law firm Osler's Asia Pacific practice. ""They're trying to protect their balance sheet,"" he added. 
HNA hopes that its aviation industry expertise will attract limited partners for the fund, the document showed. 
In recent weeks, HNA's various units also have announced asset transfers and purchases as part of the reorganization, which is expected to be completed in the first half of the year. 
Seven of the group’s 17 listed units in mainland China and Hong Kong remain suspended. HNA also announced at the end of February that it signed a deal to raise two funds totaling 20 billion yuan to focus on investments linked to China’s Belt and Road initiative. The funds deal was signed with China Asia Pacific Assets & Property Rights Exchange Ltd. 

On Monday, HNA Group said it will remain a ""major investor"" in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), after the conglomerate reduced its stake in the German lender to 7.9 percent, from about 8.8 percent.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance to mainly invest in foreign credit products this FY,"By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co [MITSID.UL] plans to mainly invest in foreign credit products for this fiscal year, a senior company executive said on Tuesday.
The main arm of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings (T:8725) will invest about 30 billion yen ($275.81 million) in U.S. credit products in particular for the financial year ending March 2019, Tomonori Mano, manager of the investment planning department at Mitsui Sumitomo, told Reuters in an interview.
""Since this is the beginning of our mid-term business year, we want to establish a solid investment plan, and start managing foreign credit products and monitoring their performances,"" Mano said.
The insurer, which had 6.7 trillion yen in total assets as of March 2018, does not plan to increase investment in foreign government bonds and foreign stocks this fiscal year, after investing about 25 billion yen and 20 billion yen, respectively, in the previous year.
""Foreign stock prices have risen sharply. We are not expecting them to keep rising, so we will be taking profits gradually,"" Mano said.
The insurer plans to invest 100 billion yen in domestic corporate bonds this fiscal year, the same amount it invested last fiscal year. The total asset in this category will stay the same as most of them will be redeemed.
Mitsui plans to invest in 10-20 billion yen in domestic bonds this year but the total balance has been decreasing. It added that it will cut its investment in super-long bonds due to falling demand in long-term insurance products.
Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance plans to continue cutting holdings of domestic stocks as it is now in the second year for MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings' five-year plan to reduce such exposure by a total of 500 billion yen.
Many Japanese insurers have been slowly unwinding their cross-holdings of shares, recognizing the risk they pose to their financial health.
The insurer expects the 10-year Japanese government bond yield <JP10YTN=JBTC> to trade between minus 0.05 and 0.1 percent for this fiscal year.
It also expects the dollar to trade between 105 and 112 yen.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 03:32AM ET</span>",SAP bullish on outlook as it beats path from back to front office,"By Douglas Busvine and Eric Auchard
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's SAP (DE:SAPG) announced upbeat results in the seasonally tough first quarter, saying it was gaining ground on competitors Salesforce (N:CRM) and Oracle (N:ORCL) in the cloud and that its margin recovery was firmly on track.
SAP, Europe's largest tech company by stock market valuation, also raised its sales and profits guidance for 2018 to take into account the $2.4 billion acquisition of U.S. sales software firm Callidus that was announced in January.
Investors welcomed the results, with SAP shares gaining 2.7 percent in early trading - even as hardware-focused tech stocks suffered in Europe on growing signs that Apple's (O:AAPL) latest iPhone is underperforming.
""We're gaining share fast and we're outpacing our toughest competitors pretty handily,"" Chief Executive Bill McDermott told reporters on a conference call, calling the results strong both at the top and bottom line.
SAP now expects total non-IFRS revenues at constant currencies this year of 24.8-25.3 billion euros ($30.3-$30.9 billion), representing growth of 5.5-7.5 percent, up from an earlier expectation of 5-7 percent growth.
McDermott, a hard-driving New Yorker who is Germany's highest-paid CEO, is leading SAP through a transition away from selling software licenses that generate up-front fees to hosted cloud services paid for by subscription.
Yet its cloud business, where quarterly revenues for the first time topped 1 billion euros, is still just a third the size of the legacy license operation and must grow rapidly for years to come to achieve comparable scale.
The key growth metric watched by analysts, non-IFRS cloud revenues at constant currencies, came in at 31 percent - clearing a 30 percent threshold set by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) ahead of the results as a 'buy' signal for the stock.
""SAP's performance at constant currency was quite remarkable, keeping in mind the tough comps from last year in mind,"" Baader Helvea analyst Knut Woller said in a flash note.
BACK TO FRONT
McDermott, with the Callidus deal, is beating a path from the back office - SAP's traditional domain - to outward-facing functions such as customer relationship management (CRM). He told reporters SAP would introduce a new strategy for sales and marketing tools at its annual customer conference in June.
""Our resolve has never been stronger to retake the CRM marketplace,"" McDermott told reporters, referring to Salesforce.com's core sales and marketing software franchise. 
SAP has faced currency headwinds due to the strong euro, and both the company and analysts focus on key metrics after adjustment for currency effects to get an underlying picture of performance.
Had SAP reported in U.S. dollars, like its competitors, the growth numbers would have turned out even better, said Chief Financial Officer Luca Mucic. Cloud subscriptions, for example, would have shown year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 37 percent in U.S. dollar terms, he said. 
""We grew faster than every 'best-of-breed' cloud (competitor) out there,"" McDermott said. ""Faster than Workday, a lot faster than Salesforce, and a lot faster than Oracle.""
Salesforce reported cloud subscription and support revenue grew 25.8 percent to $2.66 billion during its fourth quarter ended in January.
Oracle posted 33 percent growth to $1.15 billion in its cloud Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues during its third fiscal quarter ended in February. 
Salesforce said it had 19.9 percent of the worldwide market for CRM applications in the first half of 2017, citing data from market research firm IDC. By the same measure, Oracle had 8.4 percent and SAP had a 6.1 percent share.
SAP's cloud growth accelerated outside the United States, with Germany and, to a lesser extent Britain, being highlights in Europe. In Asia, China and Japan stood out.
Mucic said that an expansion of 1.1 percentage points in operating margins in the first quarter boded well for SAP after a strong showing in the same quarter a year ago.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2018 06:05PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo investors back leaders despite protests,"By Ross Kerber and Elizabeth Dilts
DES MOINES, Iowa/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) investors gave strong backing to the bank's directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating they are ready to give its revamped leadership time to rebuild from scandal despite a noisy annual shareholder meeting.
Wells Fargo executives said each of the bank's 12 director nominees received more than about 89 percent support from investors and about 92 percent of shares were cast in favor of the pay of Chief Executive Tim Sloan and other leaders. 
The figures amounted to a relatively strong outcome, especially when compared with last year. 
At the bank's 2017 meeting in Florida, the first since the sales scandal drew sustained national attention, only three of the board's 12 directors received more than 90 percent of shareholders' support and then-Chairman Stephen Sanger received just 56 percent approval.
On average, S&P 500 directors usually get around 92 percent, and pay is backed by around 89 percent of votes cast, according to pay consultant Semler Brossy.
The results signal investors are giving the new board members and other changes a chance, said Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor and corporate governance expert.
""The company has made a lot of dramatic moves, and shareholders seem to be saying they appreciate it and are going to wait to see if they are successful,"" Fisch said.
Though occasionally confronted by protesters and skeptics, Sloan and bank Chair Elizabeth Duke mostly stayed on their message of atonement during the 2-1/2 hour meeting. 
They faced tough questioners on topics including environmental issues and their business with firearms makers at a time when other banks have reviewed or cut back on those relationships. 
But they received loud applause a number of times from the audience of several hundred in the Des Moines Marriott hotel ballroom. 
When California State Treasurer John Chiang rose to challenge Sloan's pay, Duke responded that ""I disagree with your analysis of it. Tim's time with the company is an advantage,"" a comment that received louder applause than Chiang received.
Speaking before the meeting, individual investor Cherie Mortice of Des Moines said she voted for Sloan and other directors, saying it was worth giving the bank a chance to recover. 
""I think he's kind of hoping to restore trust. I'm really hopeful,"" she said.
None of three shareholder measures on the bank's proxy received a majority of support, bank executives said.
The event came days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion to settle matters related to mortgage and auto lending abuses.
About 100 protesters marched into the lobby of the hotel before the meeting, holding signs for various causes. 
In 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp. 
The Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells Fargo to halt growth until governance and controls improve.
Wells Fargo, though based in San Francisco, has held the meeting in other locations in recent years.
Tuesday's meeting at moments laid bare divisions in Iowa over one of the state’s largest private employers. State leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, a Republican, spoke to welcome executives.
Others questioned whether Sloan and others were right for the task of reform. 
""If I ran my farm the way Wells Fargo ran their business, I'd be kicked out of Marshall County. I'd be a failure,"" said one speaker, who identified himself as a retired Iowa farmer.
Wells Fargo's home mortgage and home equity businesses have about 14,500 workers in and around Des Moines.

Wells Fargo shares ended down 0.2 percent at $52.51 on Tuesday.

Deutsche has been conducting a global review of its investment bank to determine the way forward as revenues shrink. Initial results of the review, known internally as Project Colombo, are expected soon.
""We've always said that we want to be a more corporate-led bank,"" said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of any possible announcement. 
Deutsche is considering cuts to equities trading, known as cash equities, and prime brokerage, which serves hedge funds, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday. Cuts to U.S. municipal bonds trading and parts of its Asia business are also being considered.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.
Earlier this month, the bank got a new chief executive, Christian Sewing, who faces the same strategic problem that has long preoccupied its top management - whether or not to override the rainmakers and big earners at the investment bank to shrink that business.
The appointment of Sewing - who has a background in retail banking, auditing and risk - along with the recent resignation of one of Deutsche's top investment bankers, Marcus Schenck, suggests a shift away from the investment bank, analysts and investors have said.
The company's finance chief last month warned that a strong euro and higher funding costs would have a 450 million euro impact on the bank in the first quarter of the year.
Analysts expect the bank to report first-quarter net income of 327 million euros, according to a consensus of analysts' expectations on Deutsche's investor relations website. That would be down from net income of 575 million euros in the first quarter of 2017.
Shareholders have become increasingly critical of the bank's performance after it has made annual losses for the past three years.
One private investor, Jens Kuhn, has filed a motion to the bank's annual shareholder meeting on May 24 urging investors to vote against ratifying the actions of the management and supervisory board for the past year. Such a move is equivalent to calling a vote of no confidence.
""The bank really is utterly incompetent,"" Kuhn wrote in his proposal posted this week.
Deutsche Bank, founded during the Industrial Revolution to finance Germany companies, has expanded over the years into investment banking to compete with Wall Street. Investment banking has higher returns than retail and commercial banking, but is also higher risk and, after the financial crisis, landed Deutsche in hot water. 
Some analysts and investors have said that Deutsche Bank should return to its roots and curtail its investment bank operations.

SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Hynix Inc became Asia's second major semiconductor maker this earnings season to warn of slower growth in smartphone chip sales, but said this would be offset somewhat by robust demand for server and other high-end chips.
Increasing signs of a maturing global smartphone market have fueled expectations that last year's boom in chip demand is moderating and so will earnings growth.
The South Korean chipmaker met market expectations with a 77 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit to 4.4 trillion won ($4 billion). That was just short of last quarter's best-ever result, ending a run of four consecutive quarters of record profit.
Its shares were down 3 percent in afternoon trade while those of large rival Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd lost 2.4 percent.
""SK Hynix' first-quarter shipments fell much steeper than previous company guidance, which seems to have fanned concerns about slowing mobile demand,"" said Song Myung-sup, analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
Worldwide smartphone shipment volumes shrank for the first time late last year, according to search provider Strategy Analytics, with high-end brands coming under increasing competition from the likes of low-cost Chinese vendor Xiaomi.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd also warned last week of softer smartphone demand, cutting its revenue target and sending shares of key client Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and as well as other chip firms lower.
But SK Hynix, the world's No. 2 memory chip maker, was quick to stress it also had areas of strong growth up its sleeve.
""Although overall growth in smartphone sales will stagnate, China's big four smartphone firms are leading the accelerated adoption of high-capacity chips,"" SK Hynix head of DRAM marketing Sean Kim told an earnings briefing.
""As for servers, North American internet data center firms as well as Chinese firms led by Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent are increasing investment,"" he added.
Prices for DRAM chips, which help devices perform multiple tasks, have risen as servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices demand more firepower to process large amounts of streaming data.
SK Hynix said growth for server DRAM chips was expected to outpace the overall DRAM market for the next two to three years, adding that compared to other chipmakers, server DRAM accounts for a bigger portion of its revenue. 
Addressing concerns that DRAM prices could start to flatten out or even drop, the company said the industry needed to ramp up production capacity of complex DRAM memory chips as currently supply was constrained by the technological difficulty of producing them.
Although prices for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, have fallen, SK Hynix said it did not expect supply to outstrip demand this year.

322,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 11:31PM ET</span>","After Weeks of Mayhem, U.S. Raises Hopes for Aluminum Sector","(Bloomberg) -- After two weeks of convulsions caused by U.S. sanctions against United Co. Rusal, the metals market was braced for more mayhem: many traders were betting the Russian aluminum giant was just days away from having to shut plants from Sweden to Jamaica.
Then on Monday, the U.S. Treasury threw a potential lifeline by making clear it’s not pushing for the company’s collapse.
“The U.S. government is not targeting the hardworking people who depend on Rusal and its subsidiaries,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
The Treasury softened its position in three ways. Mnuchin said it was considering a request to lift the sanctions against the company, it extended the period during which companies could keep trading with Rusal by almost five months, and it clarified exactly what dealings were permissible during that time.
Rusal’s shares in Hong Kong, which sank to a record low last week, surged as much as 37 percent Tuesday, their biggest ever gain, after jumping 18 percent in Moscow. Aluminum prices headed in the opposite direction, dropping 0.9 percent in London and extending Monday’s slump of 7.1 percent, which was the biggest fall since 2010.
The speed of the reaction showed how far the sanctions had roughed up the aluminum market. As the biggest supplier of the metal outside China, Rusal found itself shut out of international markets and the impact had started to cascade through the entire industry: traders stopped buying Rusal’s metal, shipowners refused to carry its products and miners couldn’t supply its plants with raw materials.
Now, some of those things may be possible -- for a few months, at least.
“The market is clearly taking this as light at the end of the tunnel for Rusal,” said Oliver Nugent, a metals analyst at Dutch bank  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
The latest twist was expected but came sooner than expected, according to a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). report that said a restructuring of Rusal’s assets is the likeliest outcome. While the bank kept its three-month price estimate of $2,500 a metric ton, it acknowledged downside risks to the forecast.
It’s not clear whether the Treasury’s moves on Monday will automatically allow international companies to resume their deals with Rusal. Mining majors  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc have already declared force majeure on some contracts, while many traders, banks and shipping companies have frozen all dealings with the Russian company.
“Things have ground to a halt in terms of Rusal’s dealings with major western companies,” said Maximilian Hess, a senior political risk analyst at AKE International. “This extension going out until October will allow some of the supply contracts to be completed.”
Cautious Counterparties
In particular, the Treasury’s clarification of its stance on international companies’ dealings with Rusal over the next six months resolved some key issues that had made counterparties wary of continuing dealings.
For example, in updated ""Frequently Asked Questions,"" the Treasury said that non-U.S. entities wouldn’t be subject to sanctions for transactions related to the winding-down of contracts with Rusal in the period to Oct. 23, and that payments related to such dealings wouldn’t have to be paid into a blocked account.
That may help buyers, suppliers and shipping companies that have existing contracts with Rusal continue to do business.
Trade Flows
It’s important because the sanctions had all but frozen trade flows -- most critically in the market for alumina, the raw material used to make finished aluminum. Rusal is a vital cog in a global interlocking supply chain that’s been thrown into chaos. For example, Rusal’s Aughinish alumina plant in Ireland buys bauxite that Rio mines in Guinea and sells to smelters across Europe.
“It’s the alumina market that’s really got to get through this perfect storm right now,” said ING’s Nugent. “If this gives any respite to the raw materials market, it does justify some of the weakness today” in aluminum prices, he said.
Nonetheless, while the Treasury’s moves on Monday may give some respite to Rusal, traders are likely to remain cautious. The license allowing companies to continue transactions applies only to existing contracts, not new ones, and it’s not clear whether companies that have already wound down dealings with Rusal are allowed to restart.
“If I were an employee of the Aughinish plant, I’d be looking at this as better news, but the storm is still there,” AKE’s Hess said.
In the longer term, the U.S. put the resolution of the sanctions in Moscow’s hands, saying it would drop the curbs on Rusal if billionaire owner Oleg Deripaska were to sell his stake and relinquish control. It’s not yet clear if that’s a solution the Russian government will be prepared to endorse.
“If it turns out that the sanctions do not stop plants from operating or workers from receiving salaries and sales volumes are maintained, then Deripaska suits the government as the owner,” said Andrei Margolin, an economist at the Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration in Moscow.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) said on Tuesday it is considering selling its financial advice business, as a major inquiry into the country's financial sector continued to reveal widespread misconduct by advisers with the big banks.
Andrew Hagger, a member of NAB's 11-strong executive leadership team, said the bank was ""continually looking"" at its portfolio mix as he responded to questions at the inquiry about the future of its financial advice business model. 
Facing mounting regulatory pressure and public disgust at their abuse of market power, Australia's major banks are increasingly moving to exit non-core business with high compliance risks, such as wealth management. 
""NAB is continually looking at our overall portfolio, but ... there's no announcement to make here today,"" Hagger told barrister Rowena Orr assisting the Royal Commission inquiry into the financial sector.
NAB's wealth management assets are worth about A$4 billion ($3 billion), according to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts.
Commissioner Kenneth Hayne, whose recommendations at the end of the year-long inquiry could include tighter rules on the financial planning industry, then pressed Hagger about an internal NAB document from 2017 talking about the need to review the ""business model associated with aligned advisers"".
Hagger said that legislation in 2012 designed to ensure financial planners acted in the best interests of clients had changed the ""risk-reward equation"" for the bank and made it less attractive for NAB to remain in the business.
NAB has admitted to the inquiry that some of its advisers had engaged in dishonest and illegal conduct such as misappropriation of client funds. It has paid A$19 million in compensation to customers, Haggard said.
It has also admitted that for years it charged advisory fees to hundreds of thousands of clients without providing them with services or allocating them an adviser. 
The inquiry has heard that such practices were rife throughout Australia's financial industry, leading to calls for much higher penalties and tougher oversight.
The inquiry had previously heard that Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) had decided to sell its wealth management and advisory businesses after years of failing to have adequate controls to ensure its advisers were complying with the law by acting in the interest of clients. 
ANZ said on Monday it would book a loss of A$632 million on the divestment of two of its wealth businesses in 2017, which will be reflected in its half yearly results, due May 1.
Under questioning at the inquiry on Tuesday, ANZ head of wealth solutions and partnerships Kieran Forde admitted the bank had failed to properly investigate alleged fraud by one of its financial advisers because of concerns about potential commercial damage to its wealth management unit.
REGULATORY CAPTURE
With revelations of bank wrongdoing making headlines almost daily, Australia's corporate watchdog, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has been accused of being ""litigation shy"".
""Where it does go to court, it tends to have a fairly heavy emphasis on small fry,"" Allan Fels, former head of the competition regulator, told ABC radio.
ASIC representatives declined to comment. 
On Friday, the government vowed to double prison terms for financial crimes, dramatically increase financial penalties and ramp up ASIC's investigative powers. 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims on Monday lent his support to the push to increase penalties, saying banks should not be allowed to treat fines ""as a cost of doing business"".
In 2016, ASIC sued ANZ, NAB, and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) for rigging a key interest rate, one of the few times it has taken any of the major banks to court. 
It settled the case with NAB and ANZ without charging any individuals after the banks admitted the accusations. 
In January, it also filed a suit against Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) over similar claims. Westpac and CBA are still defending the claims in court.

The Chinese computer maker has slumped 56 percent since being added to the Hang Seng Index in March 2013, wiping out $5.8 billion in value. Companies removed from the gauge in the past decade have seen their value fall a median 48 percent before being excluded, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Lenovo sank to its lowest level since October 2009 on Monday as a U.S. ban on communications-equipment maker ZTE Corp. and a global selloff by hardware manufacturers added to jitters about China’s technology sector. Its shares were up 0.5 percent as of 9:52 a.m. in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
The stock is one of the most shorted on the Hang Seng Index: 13.8 percent of Lenovo’s shares available for trade on loan to short-sellers, according to IHS Markit Ltd. Removal from the gauge could spur more outflows from Lenovo, as at least $107 billion worth of passive funds track the Hang Seng Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“Risks that Lenovo will lose its seat are on the rise,” said Kenny Wen, a strategist at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. in Hong Kong. “Lenovo is having trouble in all key areas, from issuing cool smartphone models to keeping market share in computer businesses. The short-sellers may have picked the right target this time.”
Dropped Before
The Beijing-based company was previously dropped from the Hang Seng Index in 2006, six years after first joining. Its decline since it was added back in 2013 is the biggest on the 171-member Bloomberg World Technology Index.
Lenovo said in an email that it doesn’t comment on its share price or speculation. The company’s chief executive Yang Yuanqing is maintaining a bullish stance, saying in a WeChat post last week that Lenovo was back on track for growth. The firm posted a loss in the December quarter after it was hit with a U.S. tax charge and as its mobile business continued to struggle having rapidly surrendering market share.
Concern is rising that Lenovo will have to write off the value of its intangible assets, as smartphone unit Motorola (NYSE:MSI) is delivering lackluster results, according to Kevin Chen, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. The company’s data center business is being closely watched as that’s the most promising area for helping a turnaround and cushioning the stock’s decline, he said.
“Last year was supposed to be the year for Lenovo to hit the bottom and start seeing improvement -- but we didn’t see it,” Chen said. “Investors are losing patience.”

Hong Kong, China, Japan and Australia all were in the black at or shortly after opening despite some modest losses in the U.S. overnight, where both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ Composite gave up some ground and the S&P 500 gained just 0.01%. South Korean markets were the exception, quickly giving up modest early gains.
Putting pressure on Asian equities was a rally in the U.S. dollar, which hit a three-month high as yields on 10-Year U.S. Treasuries reached 2.99% for the first time in more than four years – although the dropped a little shortly after.
Also in focus in the morning in Asia were tech stocks, with semiconductor makers continuing to slide. On Friday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took a hit in U.S. trading, falling 4.1%, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) , Apple’s main chip supplier, gave up 7% the same day after it trimmed its full year revenue target.
One company in focus on Tuesday was South Korea’s  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660)., the second largest maker of memory chips in the world after Samsung Electronics (KS:005930). Hynix released earnings on Tuesday that met market expectations with operating profits rising 77%. The company’s stock still dropped 4.03% on South Korea’s stock exchange as of 9PM ET (01:00 GMT). Earnings season continues this week with Samsung among the companies expected to release results Tuesday.
Hong Kong shares are coming off a loss Monday that followed on the heels of a weekly loss last week, the fourth in five weeks. The Hang Seng Index ended Monday down 0.54% and was trading up 0.26%.
Investors in Hong Kong as well as mainland China remain concerned about the prospects for increased trade tension between China and the U.S.
Trade tensions between China and the U.S. are still in focus and are likely to remain a motivator for investors. On Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.1% but the big news was the fate of tech company ZTE Corp-H (HK:0763), which the U.S. has banned from selling parts and software. ZTE stock is currently halted from trading in both Hong Kong and Mainland China bourses.
In Shanghai, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 was trading up 0.37% shortly after the opening on Tuesday, after closing the day flat on Monday. The tech heavy SZSE Component was up 0.42% Tuesday morning.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 moved up in the morning, climbing 0.56% to 22,211.50.
Japanese stocks were supported by a weaker yen. The USD/JPY dropped as the dollar climbed thanks to increases in yields of US Treasuries. Yields on United States 10-Year notes are close to 3%, the highest level since early 2014.
Australian stocks also moved up, with the S&P/ASX 200 rising 0.26%.
The South Korea KOSPI was marginally down in morning trade, giving up early gains to drop 0.58%."

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks steadied on Tuesday after three sessions of losses thanks to strong earnings from the likes of Google and as a rise in U.S. bond yields towards the key 3 percent level stalled, while oil prices stretched to fresh highs above $75 a barrel. 
European stocks opened broadly higher (STOXX) with blue-chip stock markets in London (FTSE) and Frankfurt (GDAXI) 0.3 percent higher, while shares in Paris (FCHI) were flat.
Markets brushed off further signs that Europe's biggest economy Germany is losing some of its momentum, with the Ifo business climate index falling in April.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei (N225) added 0.9 percent as a lower yen supported export-heavy firms and Chinese shares posted their strongest gains in two months (CSI300) (SSEC).
That left MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) marginally higher on the day after three days of declines.
The recovery in stocks came as bond markets also bounced back from a selloff. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields came within striking distance of the key psychological barrier of 3 percent (US10YT=RR) on Monday, a level in the past that has triggered market spasms.
""The U.S. yield spike story has been a theme for the last 24 hours but we don't expect a sharp surge as the U.S. continues to be in a late economic cycle,"" said Christin Tuxen, a currency strategist at Danske Bank. 
Earnings meanwhile, especially from the tech sector, were in focus after a turbulent few months for leading U.S. tech firms.
Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) was up slightly in volatile after-hours trading on Monday after the tech giant reported a 73 percent jump in profits in the first quarter. 
Chipmaker AMS (S:AMS) reported first-quarter sales towards the lower end of its guidance range on Monday and warned of a downturn owing to weaker orders from one of its main customers.
AMS did not name the customer, but the Austrian company is a big supplier to Apple (O:AAPL), making components for the iPhone.
SAP (G:SAP), Europe's largest tech company by stock market valuation, announced upbeat results in the seasonally tough first quarter. 
Of around 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 that have already reported, 78.2 percent beat consensus estimates. 
OIL SURGE
Brent crude oil rose for a sixth day to hit its highest since November 2014 at over $75 a barrel (LCOc1), buoyed by expectations that supplies will tighten just as demand reaches record levels.
Brent's six-day rising streak is the longest such string of gains since December, with prices up more than 20 percent from 2018 depths plumbed in February. [O/R]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were at $69.15 a barrel, up 0.7 percent. On Thursday, WTI rose to its strongest since Nov. 28, 2014 at $69.56.
A rally in oil and crude prices and renewed focus on the inflation outlook has added to upward pressure on bond yields recently. 
""It is this move higher in crude oil prices, along with the rise in demand, that is helping fuel the recent rise in yields as well as the positive tone for equity markets,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
""However if it continues too far we could start to see it act as a drag on equity markets, if prices along with yields start to move even higher.""
DOLLAR SHADE FIRMER
The fallout from rising U.S. bond yields, which have helped lift U.S. financial stocks, was also felt in currency markets.
The euro fell to a two-month low as concerns that rising U.S. Treasury yields would push the currency to break below a range it has been stuck within most of this year, prompting hedge funds to unwind some of their record long bets.
It stabilized around $1.22 (EUR=EBS), having plumbed to a low of $1.2185 in Asia, its lowest since March 1. 
The dollar set a two-month high of 108.87 yen  and was holding near those levels.
In commodities, aluminum extended losses after tumbling 7 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day drop in eight years.

Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange  last stood at $2,255 per tonne after the United States extended the deadline for sanctions on Russian aluminum producer Rusal (HK:0486).

327,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Inside Deripaska's scramble to soften Russia sanctions blow,"By Polina Devitt, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Julia Payne
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - In December, as news reports emerged about potential new U.S. sanctions against Russia, aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska instructed advisers to draw up contingency plans, according to people close to the businessman and his firms.
Senior executives, lawyers and aides working for the Russian tycoon met almost weekly to develop a game plan for different sanctions scenarios, the people said.
They even took preemptive steps to mitigate the impact of sanctions, including switching most dollar payments and loans of Deripaska's En+ Group PLC into euros and pounds as well as planning to replace U.S. equipment suppliers with European ones, according to one of the people involved in the planning.
But they concluded there was one scenario so severe that there would be little they could do if it came to pass: the stiffest sanctions being applied to his business empire, not just Deripaska himself.
""People inside the room had a cold sweat,"" when that scenario was mentioned, the person said. ""You cannot prepare for this.""
It was this scenario that Washington chose. On April 6, it announced sanctions against Deripaska and his eight companies, along with other Russian individuals and firms, in response to what the United States called ""malign activities"" by Russia.
By adding Deripaska's businesses to its Specially Designated Nationals blacklist – the first time Washington had done so with a publicly-listed Russian company - the U.S. effectively choked off their access to the international financial system.
The move sent reverberations around the world. Deripaska's business empire – which includes United Company Rusal PLC, the world's second largest aluminum producer by volume of production – has a global footprint and counts major international companies as customers.
The extent of the impact shows the power the United States exerts over the global financial system through the dollar clearing process.
Rusal, the largest part of Deripaska's empire, has seen customers stop buying its aluminum and creditors scramble to offload debt. Hong Kong-listed Rusal has lost more than 60 percent of its share value. Deripaska's En+ Group PLC, which owns part of Rusal and supplies power and coal, has also seen its London-listed shares more than halve in value. 
Deripaska has called the sanctions ""very unfortunate but not unexpected."" He added that his inclusion on the list was ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd."" 
A spokeswoman for Deripaska declined further comment.
Rusal has said its inclusion on the sanctions list could leave it unable to pay billions of dollars it owes to its lenders – some of the leading Western and Asian banks.
On Monday, the United States opened the door to sanctions relief for Rusal when the Treasury said in a statement it could soften the measures if Deripaska ceded control in the firm.
The Treasury said its goal was to avoid hitting businesses around the world which depended heavily on supplies from Rusal.
The news sent shares in Rusal up more than 13 percent in Moscow, but they remain far below pre-sanctions levels.
""ROAD BLOCK""
The team assembled in December consisted of about a dozen top managers - including executives from finance, legal and human resources - and aides to discuss ways to mitigate the impact of sanctions on Rusal. A similar team gathered to focus on En+, according to the people familiar with the planning.
The groups met in their separate Moscow offices and gave regular updates to Deripaska, in person and by emails, the people said.
The biggest concern was that tough sanctions against Deripaska's businesses would stop Western banks and clearing houses from interacting with them, impacting everything from raising debt to sales on world markets, according to the people.
Deripaska took pre-emptive steps. In February, the billionaire announced his resignation from executive positions at En+ and Rusal.
The hope, according to one source close to Rusal, was that he would protect the companies from sanctions even if he was put on the list himself.
Deripaska made other changes out of the public eye. In a previously unreported move, En+ had by March switched most of its dollar payments and loans into euros and pounds, according to a person familiar with En+ preparations.
That means the company can service its debts and receive payments which otherwise would have stopped if they remained dollar-denominated.
Another key concern was the impact sanctions would have on suppliers of equipment to Deripaska's firms, as tough sanctions against his entities would prohibit U.S. companies from doing business with them.
The En+ team of advisers put together a plan aimed at cutting exposure to U.S. turbines suppliers such as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and replacing them gradually with European firms, the person familiar with En+ preparations said.
""But on a number of other issues we hit a road block,"" the person said.
He cited a failed pre-sanctions attempt to find a non-U.S. bank to act as a depositary for En+'s London-listed shares, known as Global Depository Receipts or GDRs, a role then held by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
""We tried EU banks, Hong Kong banks, even an Israeli bank - but as soon as we mentioned possible sanctions, it wasn't going anywhere,"" the person familiar with En+ preparations said, without naming the banks.
""All transactions are done through the dollar and no one wanted to take the risk of being cut off from dollar clearing.""
The person added the En+ group also looked into moving trading of its GDRs to Moscow from London but concluded a new initial public offering would be needed to achieve that.
""We simply didn't have that time,"" the person said.
When the sanctions were announced in April, Citigroup, the custodian for GDRs at En+, suspended all transactions. The move rattled investors because the sanctions require that U.S. citizens must divest of any stocks, bonds or other holdings in the targeted firms by May 7.
Several days later, Citigroup informed En+ that it had begun facilitating transactions again with its GDRs, according to a statement from En+. Citigroup declined to comment.
But, according to the person familiar with En+ preparations, holders of En+ GDRs have not been able to sell because the designated clearing house Euroclear is not settling the trades, the stage at which cash and securities trade hands.
Belgium-based Euroclear declined to comment.
FEWER OPTIONS
The Rusal contingency team felt like it had fewer options than their En+ counterparts because the metals producer had a much larger portion of debt and contracts in dollars due to the nature of the aluminum market, according to three people close to Rusal.
One of these people also said the aluminum company didn't prepare well for the toughest sanctions, because Deripaska and the contingency team believed the United States would not want to disrupt the aluminum markets and because the U.S. had not levied sanctions against a publicly traded Russian firm before.
Rusal had no plan in place for requesting immediate help from the Russian government to assist in refinancing debt or paying its employees, according to the three sources close to Rusal.
Russia's industry and trade minister told reporters last week that the government had not received a detailed request for help from any of Deripaska's companies.
The people close to Rusal also said such requests have not been filed, although two of them added that the company was working on such a request.
A Kremlin spokesman said on Thursday that a temporary nationalization of Rusal was among options the Kremlin was studying to help the company navigate sanctions.

328,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:54PM ET</span>",Glenview's Robbins says talk of Amazon's entering pharma is overblown,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins said on Monday at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York that he still likes a trio of stocks he already owns, citing CVS Health Corp (N:CVS), McKesson Corp (N:MCK) and Express Scripts Holdings (O:ESRX).
He also said speculation that Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) might be looking to enter the pharmacy business and possibly threaten these companies' business is overblown. 
Amazon has not made significant hires in the pharmacy business and does not have the licenses needed to enter the business, Robbins said. Amazon's entry into the business of selling medications, is ""neither imminent, assured, nor likely to succeed,"" he said.
Speculation mounted late last year that the online retail giant might be ready to target pharmacies and the selling of drugs next after buying grocer Whole Foods earlier in 2017.
The speculation about Amazon has weighed on CVS's stock price. But Robbins was confident his stock picks could rise.

Within two year, Robbins said, Express Scripts' stock could climb 69 percent while McKesson's stock could post returns of 136 percent and CVS could climb 96 percent. ""Amazon fears are dramatically overblown,"" he said.

1. Housing Data, Consumer Confidence, Richmond Fed Manufacturing on Tap 
Amid easing geopolitical tensions following improving U.S-China trade relations and signs of progress toward peace talks on the Korean peninsula, investor attention will likely remain on top-tier economic data, corporate earnings and rising U.S. bond yields.
The Commerce Department is expected to report new home sales in March rose 1.9% to 625,000 units from 618,000 units in February.
Economist forecast the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge due 10:00 am ET to show a cooler reading of 126.0 for April from 127.7 in the previous month.
The Richmond Fed manufacturing index data for March due 10:00 am ET is expected to increase to 16 from a reading of 15 in March.
The 10Y US Treasury yield will also be in focus as it neared a key 3% level Monday amid growing investor expectations for a continued uptick in U.S. economic growth and inflation.
The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, hitting a more than seven week high, supported by rising U.S. bond yields and a slump in both the yen and Aussie dollar against the greenback.
2. API Data to Extend Crude Oil Rally?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday after data last week showed a draw in U.S. crude stockpiles.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles fell by 1.047 million barrels. The Energy Information Administration’s weekly report showed a 1.071 million barrel decline in crude supplies closely matching the API figure.
Crude oil futures started the week on the front foot rebounding from intraday weakness which followed bearish comments on OPEC cuts from Iran.
3. Alphabet to Lift Sentiment on Tech?
Google-parent company Alphabet traded roughly flat in afterhours after posting first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates but investors weighed the tech-giant’s ramp up in capital expenditure, which was more than double analysts’ estimates.
Alphabet posted first-quarter earnings of $9.93 per share on $31.15 billion in revenue, topping analysts’ expectations for earnings of $9.28 per share on $30.29 billion in revenue.
Capital expenditures for Alphabet's Google division rose to $7.7 billion for the first quarter of 2018, more than triple last year's expenditures of $2.41 billion and more than double the $3.5 billion analysts had expected for all of Alphabet’s divisions.
Advertising revenues, which forms a large chunk of Alphabet’s revenues, was $26.6 billion for the quarter.
Cost-per-click, the price Google charges for its ads, fell 7% year-on-year while the price for views of ads sold rose 8%.
Shares of Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose 0.19% in after hours trading to $1,069.50 after closing 0.33% lower at $1,073.81.
The report from Alphabet kicked off what is expected to be the busiest week of earnings which will include reports from tech behemoths Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter."

341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Nasdaq proposes letting companies decide where their shares trade,"By John McCrank
(Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) on Monday said it will ask regulators to let it give thinly-traded companies that list on its main U.S. stock exchange a choice as to whether their shares can be traded on other exchanges, with the aim of making it easier for investors to buy the stocks. 
There are 13 U.S. stock exchanges and currently, regardless of where a company is listed, its shares trade on all of them, as well as around 40 private broker-run trading venues. Critics say this fragments trading activity, making it more difficult for buyers and sellers to find each other.
Allowing smaller companies to concentrate the trading of their shares on a single exchange would create trading efficiencies and also force listing markets to compete more vigorously to list and trade the shares, executives from Nasdaq told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
""Our markets are no longer able to support small growth companies,"" said Frank Hatheway, Nasdaq's chief economist, referring to the U.S. markets overall. He was taking part in a roundtable discussion hosted by the SEC in Washington on the topic of improving the markets for thinly-traded companies. 
Under the Nasdaq plan, trading on private venues, such as dark pools, would be allowed to continue as usual.
Rival exchange operator Cboe Global Markets (O:CBOE) balked at the idea of exchanges being allowed to have monopolies on the trading of certain stocks, saying it would carry the risk that exchanges would begin charging higher fees for things like market data and exchange connectivity. 
""The exclusive listing concept is interesting but it is a bit of a blunt instrument,"" Cboe President Chris Concannon told the roundtable, made up of industry experts and academics. 
Of the 13 U.S. stock exchanges, 11 are owned by either Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE unit, Nasdaq, or Cboe. Another is in the process of being bought by NYSE. 
IEX Group, which runs only one exchange, recommended to the panel giving thinly-traded companies the option of having their stocks trade on one exchange per exchange group, which would mean a stock would trade on four exchanges instead of 13. 
In October, the U.S. Treasury Department recommended that the SEC allow companies to decide how many stock exchanges their shares trade as part of a broader regulatory review.

The SEC is seeking public comment on the issue.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>","Amid drug price worries, earnings to test U.S. pharma, biotech shares","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, whose shares have been laggards even in a sluggish market, face a litmus test in the corporate earnings season as investors already gun-shy over concerns about pressures on drug prices prepare to give a sharp eye for both hits and misses.
As a group, pharmaceutical stocks in the S&P 500 <.SPLRCCARG> are down about 4 percent so far this year, while S&P biotech stocks <.SPLRCBIOT> are off about 6 percent. Even in a choppy overall market, biotech and pharma have underperformed the broader S&P 500 (SPX), which is little changed for 2018.
Shares of Biogen Inc (O:BIIB),  Celgene Corp  (O:CELG) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY) are all down at least 14 percent this year. 
While various companies have suffered regulatory and other setbacks of their own, taking a toll on their stocks, analysts say worries over prescription drug prices continue to cloud shares of pharma and biotech companies in general.
""We need something that will breathe excitement in the group,"" said Kevin Gade, a portfolio analyst who follows pharmaceutical and biotech stocks at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.
This week, Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY), Biogen and  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) report quarterly results on Tuesday, with  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) and Bristol-Myers due on Thursday.
For the 10 largest drug and biotech companies by market value, first-quarter earnings per share are expected to rise an average of 8.7 percent, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters data, ranging from an expected rise of nearly 41 percent for AbbVie to a decline of 25 percent for  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD).
In the earnings reports, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover will be tracking growth of important drugs, such as Merck & Co Inc's (N:MRK) Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' rival cancer treatment, Opdivo; Lilly's Trulicity diabetes drug and Taltz psoriasis therapy; and  Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) Ibrance cancer medicine.
Gade said that ""given low sentiment"" for the stocks, he will be looking for the companies to at least hit analysts' earnings estimates and ideally raise their financial outlooks.
Indeed, big biotech and pharmaceutical stocks overall are trading at much steeper discounts to the broad market than they have on average over the past five years.
S&P 500 biotech companies recently traded at 12.6 times forward earnings, while S&P 500 drug companies traded at 14.2 times, compared with 16.4 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
""The group is extremely cheap historically,"" Gade said.
While pharma and biotech stocks have been laggards this year, two healthcare industries generally seen as more immune from concerns about pricing, medical device companies and makers of life-science research tools, are up over 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
Those healthcare industries have been outperformers since a watershed moment for healthcare investing: when Hillary Clinton as the Democratic presidential candidate tweeted about ""price gouging"" in the specialty drug market.
Since that tweet in September 2015, medical device and life-science tool stocks have soared, more than 50 percent and 65 percent, respectively, while pharma stocks are up only about 4 percent and biotech is down 6 percent.
Drug pricing was expected to again be in the spotlight on Thursday, with President Donald Trump due to address the topic. But Trump postponed his speech to a date in the near future, the White House said on Sunday.
""One of the concerns people still have are pricing pressures for drugs, whether or not that will intensify either through the government channels or through"" pharmacy benefit managers, Morningstar's Conover said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Strong growth in ad sales on Google search and YouTube were not enough to offset a surge in costs at parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc that shrank the first-quarter operating margin, leaving shares flat after hours on Monday.
Alphabet got a boost from how it values investments in Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and other startups. That accounting change and a one-time benefit cut its effective tax rate nearly in half.
Investors are uncertain about future profit at Alphabet as the company navigates the move to a phone-based computing world and invests in small, fast-growing initiatives from self-driving cars to selling hardware and cloud computing services. The quarterly results did not clarify the outlook.
Alphabet's operating margin of 22 percent, down from 27 percent a year ago, missed expectations because of the growth in expenses.
Alphabet is investing to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and having to share more of its revenue with phone and browser makers, said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.
""The jump in profits is purely due to one-time items,"" he said. 
Longer-term capital expenditures nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago. 
Still, worldwide sales increased to $31.1 billion, above the average analysts' estimate of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Those ad sales showed investors that there were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns had affected profits, even as concerns over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's use of privacy cast some suspicion on Google. 
Officials across the world seek to force changes in Google's business practices, such as giving customers more control over their data.
""The strong economy has companies spending more on advertising,"" said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. ""Google continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search"" and there will be ""very little effect"" from Facebook privacy data fallout, he said. 
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts Monday that, ""It's important to understand that most of our ad business is search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad."" 
STARTUP INVESTMENTS BOOST PROFITS
Alphabet's quarterly profit of $9.4 billion, or $13.33 per share, exceeded estimates of $6.56 billion, or $9.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
About $2.4 billion in earnings were attributable to a new accounting method for unrealized gains in Alphabet's investments in startups such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. Alphabet now records estimates of the current value of its startup investments rather than waiting to report income once it has opportunity to sell those shares.
That change and a one-time benefit drove the effective tax rate in the quarter to 11 percent from 20 percent a year earlier.
Excluding the investment-related gains and other items, adjusted earnings were $9.93 per share.
Google had several one-time costs including acquiring 2,000 employees in Taiwan for $1.1 billion from HTC Corp and moving up when it awards equity to employees.
Continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube's new TV service and marketing new products.
Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services. 
Revenue from Google's non-advertising units was $4.4 billion in the first quarter. 
Alphabet is paring back on ""other bets,"" a set of ancillary projects in areas such as medical technology and drones. Operating loss from ""other bets"" fell to $571 million, from $703 million a year ago.
Investors are counting on one other bet, the Waymo self-driving vehicles effort, to generate noteworthy revenue this year as it begins offering ride-hailing services. 

Google revealed smart thermostat maker Nest generated about $726 million in revenue in 2017, above some analysts' estimates. Financial results for Nest had not been released since its acquisition in 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) canceled more flights on Monday as it worked to complete inspections of engines like the one that failed last week in a deadly accident over Pennsylvania.
Flightaware.com, a website that tracks aviation cancellations, said Southwest canceled 129 flights on Monday, or 3 percent of its total flights, and delayed 468 other flights, or 11 percent. By contrast, other major U.S. carriers had each canceled four or fewer flights on Monday, the website said.
Southwest said the cancellations were the result of the company’s announcement last Tuesday that it would begin voluntarily stepping up inspections of some CFM56-7B engines over the next 30 days. The airline said on Sunday it canceled about 40 flights.
It said on Monday it anticipated ""minimal delays or cancellations each day due to the inspections.""
The company added it ""will continue our work to minimize flight disruptions by performing inspections overnight while aircraft are not flying, and utilizing spare aircraft, when available.""
The Federal Aviation Administration and European regulators ordered emergency inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to the one involved in the fatal Southwest engine blowout.
Southwest said the cancellations were not a result of the emergency directive. The engine explosion on Southwest flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. airline passenger fatality since 2009. Southwest has declined to answer questions about its CFM56-7B inspection program, including how many engines were inspected before the accident, and if the engine that failed had been inspected and if the new inspections turned up any problems.

The FAA said on Friday the ""unsafe condition"" was ""likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design."" A Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing prompting two service bulletins from engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture co-owned by  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France’s  Safran  SA (PA:SAF).

375,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 03:02PM ET</span>",How 3 Percent Yields Could Reshape the Investing Landscape,"(Bloomberg) -- Ten-year Treasury yields sit closer to 3 percent than at any time in the past four years, prompting investors to dust off their playbooks for how to trade in an era of relatively higher rates.
Rising rates isn’t exactly a new problem for markets -- the 10-year yield jumped 30 basis points in January alone -- but this time the spike’s driven by surging commodity prices, not heady economic gains. And that’s thrown a wrinkle into the discussion, particularly when it comes to equities.
“Historically, the stock market has done OK with rising inflation, provided economic momentum was also rising,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, wrote in a note to clients Monday. “Stocks also have performed well even when economic momentum has faded, if inflation also moderates. However, periods of stagflation have produced poor results in both the stock and bond markets.”
Here’s how some markets may react to the rise in rates:
Since the financial crisis, stocks have paid out more than fixed income, but the premium is waning: The spread between the S&P 500’s earnings yield and that of the 10-year Treasury bill is hovering near the lowest levels in eight years.
If yields push past 3 percent, that could alter the value proposition for equities versus fixed income for years to come, according to Chris Verrone, the head of technical analysis at Strategas Research Partners.
“This is a 35-year trend change in bonds, we think it’s just begun,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Monday. “We would encourage investors to consider that 1950 period, the last time bond yields went up. It took a while to go from 2 to 5 percent, but the trend was up and you stopped making money on the long side of the bond trade. That’s where we think we are right now.”
Emerging market investors are taking note, too. Unlike three months ago, when the spike in rates came left them sanguine, there’s more reason for worry now, from trade spats to signs synchronized global growth is slowing. Commodity-driven inflation could also lead to a faster pace of monetary tightening which would disproportionately harm emerging markets, according to Per Hammarlund, chief emerging-markets strategist at SEB in Stockholm.
Corporate Credit
The least creditworthy companies have benefited from low benchmark yields, but if easy money disappears and borrowing costs rise, servicing debt would become more expensive. For now, corporate credit is hanging in, with high yield spreads remaining off the tightest level since before the financial crisis.
“The question of course is how long can this last,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, noting that current debt levels for S&P 500 companies outside of banks are at extremely high levels. “Stating the obvious, high debt levels along with higher interest rates is not the best combination.”
Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co., also says staggering levels of investor leverage pose a risk. As rate rise, lenders increase costs on margin accounts which in turn prompt a gradual unwind of leverage that’s become too expensive, he said.
“When everyone has been talking about whether higher rates impact the economy, the more important thing is how it will impact leverage,” Maley said by phone. “It creates a headwind for the market.
Debt in New York Stock Exchange margin accounts is the highest on record, yet the measure necessarily rises when the value of stocks -- which are used as underlying collateral -- rises. And it looks relatively small: Margin debt is less than 3 percent of the total NYSE market capitalization. For that reason, leverage levels can’t be used as a timing tool for downturns, but rather pressures markets during periods where investors need to unwind, Maley said.
U.S. Dollar
As for the U.S. dollar, higher yields -- particularly real U.S. borrowing costs -- have slowly lured investors back to the greenback. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is in the midst of its best four-session stretch since the 2016 U.S. election, and has seen its one-month correlations with both 10-year Treasury yields and inflation-protected peers trend higher.
Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research LLC, attributes the pick-up in the dollar and real yields to the U.S. economy’s brighter outlook compared to the rest of the world. The continuation of this dynamic would paint a mixed, but positive, picture for risk assets.
“Our sense is that in coming quarters we see the dollar strengthen against most of the majors and for U.S. real rates to continue rising,"" he writes. ""Stocks should like the stronger growth environment, but dollar strength and higher real yields imply tighter financial conditions, providing some offset.”
Indeed, this dollar strength stemming from rising inflation-adjusted yields could also prove self-regulating. An advancing greenback tends to weigh on commodity prices, and the jump in West Texas Intermediate prices has been the key driver of the advance in breakeven inflation rates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers at the high-profile 2018 Sohn Investment Conference in New York pitched stock ideas on Monday that they said should benefit from the growing clout of the millennial generation, ranging from online food ordering to homebuilders.
John Khoury, founder and managing partner of the $2.7 billion Long Pond Capital hedge fund, revealed a long position in U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc, which he said should rise as more millennials age into the first-time home buyer market. 
D.R. Horton, the country's largest homebuilder, has been increasingly focused on its entry-level segment, which the company in January said should grow strongly over the next three years. 
Two investors pitched online food ordering companies. Alexander Captain, who runs Cat Rock Capital Management, introduced Netherlands-based Takeaway.com NV while Li Ran, who runs Half Sky Capital, pitched GrubHub Inc, the parent company of Seamless. She said GrubHub averages $30 per order and earns 15 percent of each order, with spending growth at restaurants outpacing spending at grocery stores. 
""I like to call this chart 'millennials can't cook,"" Ran said, to laughter. 
Millennials, a term for those born between 1981 and 1996, are expected to become the largest generation in the United States in 2019, according to estimates from Pew Research. 
Jeffrey Gundlach, one of the world's most closely watched investors, recommended a short position in social media giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and a long position in the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration ETF.
""Facebook used to be a place people felt good going to,"" Gundlach said. 
Facebook has come under pressure as the company acknowledged misuse of users' data. 
RISING CONFIDENCE
Investors were confident about their stock picks at a time when the broad S&P 500 has been lagging and retail clients have expressed nervousness about the durability of the stock market's long-running gains. 
Long Pond Capital's Khoury suggested that D.R. Horton has more than 60 percent upside, while Ran of Half Sky Capital said GrubHub could hit $160 a share, up about 55 percent from its Monday closing price of $102.17. 
Among technology-focused investors, Glen Kacher, founder and chief investment officer at Light Street Capital, announced a long position in online security company Palo Alto Networks Inc, which he said has a 164 percent upside through 2020. 
Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and chief executive officer at Social Capital LP, offered a bullish take on cloud management company Box Inc, predicting the stock could grow 10-fold over the next 10 years. 
""If you believe in and if you care about A.I. [Artificial Intelligence] and its role in the world, be long Amazon, be long Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), but be long Box,"" Palihapitiya said, calling Box a ""really interesting disruptive company.""
Shares of Box closed up nearly 11 percent on Monday, turning it positive for the year to date. 
Organizers of the Sohn Conference said they were expecting as many as 3,000 attendees at New York's Lincoln Center, making Sohn one of the most high-profile investment conferences of the year. 
Against a background of more volatile markets and worries that some of the biggest hedge fund managers are nursing losses this year, many in the audience focused on the smaller, better-performing investors like Oleg Nodelman. 
Nodelman, founder and managing director of EcoR1 Capital LLC, whose fund returned a reported 53 percent last year, announced a long bet on drug company Ascendis Pharma A/S.
Larry Robbins, of Glenview Capital Management LLC, threw cold water on the notion that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will enter the drug distribution business and reiterated the bullish case for his existing positions in McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS). 
""Amazon doesn't always win,"" he said. 
David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital was down 14 percent in the first quarter, presented an existing short position in bond insurance company Assured Guaranty Ltd. The stock fell 6 percent in after-hours trading, wiping out its gain for the year-to-date. 

Assured Guaranty is ""a melting ice cube that is paying out the drops while it still can,"" Einhorn said.

378,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Pier 1 shares slump to eight-year low after analyst warning,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Pier 1 Imports  Inc's (N:PIR) stock plunged to its lowest level since 2009 on Monday after an analyst recommended investors avoid the shares until the furniture and home decorations retailer reverses falling sales.
Shares in the seller of wicker chairs and scented candles were down 9.8 percent in early afternoon trading on New York Stock exchange, bringing losses to about 31 percent since the company last Wednesday posted disappointing quarterly results and scrapped its dividend.
Pier 1 on Thursday detailed a three-year turnaround plan aimed at reducing store clutter and inventory, better-targeting different kinds of consumers and improving marketing, but it warned that the plan would lead to a net loss for 2018.
But in a client note on Monday, Raymond James analyst Budd Bugatch cut his rating on Pier 1 to ""underperform"" from ""market perform,"" and recommended that investors ""exit the shares now.""
""We believe there will be ample time and opportunity to revisit the recommendation if and when it becomes clear that management's plan is working and a favorable investment opportunity exists,"" Bugatch wrote.
Pier 1 has struggled in recent years to keep up with surging competition between sellers of home goods, including Williams-Sonoma (N:WSM) and  Target  (N:TGT), as well as online sellers  Wayfair Inc  (N:W) and  Overstock.com  Inc (O:OSTK). 
Home decor superstore At Home Group's (N:HOME) stock has more than doubled since its initial public offering in 2016. Since that time, Pier 1's stock has lost half of its value, and on Monday it traded at $2.37, its lowest price since 2009. 

Stiff competition has led Pier 1 and some of its rivals to offer nearly permanent discounts, which cannibalize earnings. Typing ""Pier 1"" into a Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search bar on Monday, the first word that autocompleted was ""coupon.""

380,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:25PM ET</span>","Gundlach says buy oil producers, bet against Facebook: Sohn Conference","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach on Monday said investors should consider betting against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) because the prospect of regulation still hangs over the social media company's stock.
Speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the closely-watched DoubleLine Capital LP chief executive officer recommended a pair trade of shorting, or betting against, Facebook while betting on gains in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks oil-and-gas explorers and producers who could benefit from rising inflation.
Facebook shares are down nearly 10 percent since the New York Times and London's Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company's users.
Gundlach said the worst likely is not over for Facebook, saying it is not unprecedented for equity bubbles being ended by regulation. Facebook's strengths are being redefined as weaknesses, he said. 
""We hear the good things about Facebook, which is 2.2 billion users,"" said Gundlach, known as Wall Street's ""Bond King."" 
""I hear 2.2 billion compliance breaches.""
Facebook shares were down 0.3 percent on Monday, giving up earlier gains.
Meanwhile, inflation is perking up and will likely continue to rise even if the U.S. economy is headed for a pullback, Gundlach said. That can be a boon for companies like those held in SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (MX:XOP) ETF, which Gundlach recommended buying in conjunction with the Facebook short.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.
Gundlach's presentation revealed an investor preparing for the later stages of an economic expansion that has featured both low inflation and skyrocketing stock prices. But rising interest rates and the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet - what Gundlach characterizes as ""Quantitative Tightening"" - are changing the investment backdrop. 
Last May, Gundlach, speaking at the same conference, recommended a comparable late-cycle trade of buying emerging market stocks and shorting the technology-led U.S. S&P 500 benchmark.
Emerging markets from China to Brazil are heavily, though not uniformly, influenced by commodity prices; as riskier assets, they tend to do better as economic growth cycles age. U.S. stocks and emerging markets both rose over the last year, but equities in developing markets led.
In addition to flashes of inflation building in economic statistics, oil prices have been among the best-performing major assets in 2018, with the major crude-futures benchmarks up more than 11 percent.

Trump on Friday accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of ""artificially"" boosting oil prices, drawing rebukes from some of the world's top energy exporters.

384,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO's pay details spark pushback by some employees,"By Patrick Rucker and Ross Kerber
WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) disclosure of how its chief executive's pay compares to the rest of its workforce has drawn criticism from some company employees ahead of the scandal-plagued bank's annual shareholder meeting. 
More than a dozen employees made posts criticizing pay details the bank released in March, according to comments on an internal communications website seen by Reuters. Separately, a worker advocacy group said it plans to raise pay issues on Tuesday at the shareholder meeting in Des Moines, Iowa. 
Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan earned $17.6 million for 2017, according to its proxy filing, an estimated 291 times the median of the annual total compensation of all the bank's workers.
It is easy for Sloan to be optimistic about the future of the bank considering he is collecting a raise “on an already enormous salary,” wrote Vernes Rasidkadic, who left a job at Wells Fargo in Omaha, Nebraska, shortly after posting comments in mid-March. 
Rasidkadic told Reuters he stands by his posted comments.
After several days, Wells Fargo closed the notice board to new posts, writing that some comments do not comply with company policies, according to the internal discussion. A company spokeswoman confirmed the discussion had been closed.
When asked about the postings on Friday, a Wells Fargo official said the bank values constructive feedback.
""We will continue to invite team member participation and encourage dialogue,"" said spokeswoman Diana Rodriguez.
The bank in 2016 admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts for customers in order to hit sales targets, which led to the departure of its previous CEO. Sloan did not collect a cash bonus in 2016 and in 2017, although his total compensation for 2017 was 35 percent higher than for 2016.
Wells Fargo's CEO pay ratio was higher than Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) but lower than JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), according to data U.S. public companies must report starting this year. Those lenders have different business mixes and Wells Fargo skews more than some toward lower-paid retail workers. 
Wells Fargo raised its minimum hourly wage to $15 an hour in March, an 11-percent hike for about 36,000 workers, it announced in December on the heels of the U.S. tax code overhaul. 
The Committee for Better Banks, a group that includes labor unions and consumer and community advocacy groups, is calling for the bank to raise that wage again to $20. 
A representative for the group said Alex Ross, a Wells Fargo employee and activist with Better Banks, plans to comment on pay at the shareholder meeting and say that a raise would in turn help the bank's mission of rebuilding community trust following the scandal. 
On Friday, the bank said it agreed to pay U.S. regulators $1 billion to settle probes into customer abuses in auto lending and mortgages. A review of bank pay by executive compensation data firm Equilar shows Sloan earned roughly 20 percent less than Bank of America and  Goldman Sachs Group  (N:GS) paid their leaders for 2017.
Among top Wells Fargo shareholders, representatives for  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) did not respond to questions on how it planned to vote its roughly 9-percent stake in the bank. A representative for the second-largest investor, Vanguard Group Inc, with a roughly 7-percent stake, declined to comment on its votes at the bank.

Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommend investors cast non-binding advisory votes in favor of the compensation of Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",European shares supported by financials; UBS disappoints,"By Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged up on Monday as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields helped lift bank stocks to nearly 5-week highs, more than offsetting a disappointing update from UBS (S:UBSG) and losses among bond-proxy sectors.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index rose 0.35 percent, reversing initial losses, as gains in financials gathered pace and Wall Street opened in positive territory.
Swiss bank UBS fell 2.5 percent, among the top STOXX losers despite reporting first-quarter earnings ahead of analysts' estimates.
The bank struck a cautious note for the coming quarter, its CET1 ratio of capital requirements slightly fell short of expectations and the wealth management business disappointed.
""While the IB unit delivered a strong beat, other units, particularly Global Wealth Management (with a small, approximately 1 percent miss on both assets under management and gross margin) slightly disappointed,"" said Baader Helvea analysts. 
Financials, which benefit from rising yields, however, were broadly positive with the banking index (SX7P) up 0.75 percent. Italian banks (FTIT8300) rose 1 percent to their highest level in more than 2 years after a report said the ECB was considering shelving planned rules that would have forced bank to set aside more money against their stock of unpaid loans.
Consumer staples stocks, which investors have held as proxies to bonds for their stable revenues and income stream, took the most points off the STOXX index after U.S. yields hit their highest level since January 2014 before paring gains.
Nestle (S:NESN), AB InBev (BR:ABI) and  Unilever  (L:ULVR) were among the worst-hit, falling 0.2 to 1 percent 
 Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) shares tumbled 1.9 percent, dented by a price target cut from JP Morgan. 
""Despite weaker economic growth momentum, defensives have struggled to consistently outperform and we remain generally negative given our forecasts that bond yields will rise again,"" wrote Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategist Peter Oppenheimer.
(GRAPHIC: Consumer staples stocks and bond yields April 23 - https://reut.rs/2K9OjmO) 
Results spurred the biggest moves on Monday. Overall, MSCI euro zone companies are expected to report earnings growth of 4.9 percent from the first quarter of 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.
A spate of broker rating cuts bruised German retailer Metro (DE:B4B), down 9.3 percent at the bottom of the STOXX after Friday's profit warning on poor performance in its Russian operations.
Baader Helvea, JP Morgan, Kepler Cheuvreux and Bernstein all cut their price targets on the stock, while HSBC cut it to ""reduce"" from ""buy"". 
Fresenius Medical (DE:FMEG) declined 4.2 percent after the German dialysis specialist cut its 2018 sales target. 
Strong growth in its Chinese market helped boost Philips' (AS:PHG) first-quarter results above expectations, sending its shares up 5.5 percent. The Dutch health technology company's CEO said he saw rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China having a negative impact on its results, however.
And in an incipient sign of this year's surge in crude oil prices trickling down to component makers,  Rotork  (L:ROR), which makes valves for the oil and gas industry, reported strong first-quarter results sending its shares up 10.9 percent.
M&A news also rumbled on. Shares in Swiss banking software business Temenos (S:TEMN) gained 5.5 percent after it said it would not raise its bid for Fidessa (L:FDSA). 

The British financial trading systems firm ditched Temenos in favor of a 1.5 billion pound deal with rival bidder Ion.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court divided over challenge to SEC in-house judges,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared divided over a challenge to the constitutionality of the Securities and Exchange Commission's selection of in-house judges to enforce investor protection laws in a case involving a former radio host and investment adviser backed by the Trump administration.
The court heard arguments in an appeal by Raymond Lucia, who was given a lifetime ban from investment-related work by an SEC administrative law judge for misleading investors in his ""Buckets Of Money"" retirement wealth presentations. The case could expand the control by the president and political appointees over officials in various federal agencies.
California-based Lucia argued that the SEC exceeded its authority in its hiring of the judges, violating part of the U.S. Constitution that gives the president the power to appoint certain types of federal officials.
A ruling favoring Lucia could reverberate through the federal government, which has nearly 2,000 administrative judges who decide matters as varied as unfair trade practices, veterans benefits and patent infringement. Such a ruling could make it easier for these judges to be fired by political appointees.
Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, both liberals, and Anthony Kennedy, a conservative, raised concerns about the need to protect the judges' independence and impartiality.
Kagan suggested administrative judges might need insulation from political pressure. ""You want to ratchet that down,"" Kagan told Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, arguing for the Trump administration. ""Isn't that interfering with decisional independence?""
Breyer said the government's position that agency heads should be able to fire administrative law judges if they fail to follow agency policies might not guarantee the judges sufficient independence. 
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts suggested the judges need to be held more accountable because currently no one, neither the president nor the SEC, is responsible for their conduct or misconduct. 
""The commission can say, 'Don't blame us. We didn't do it.' The president can say, 'Don't blame me. I didn't appoint them,'"" Roberts said.
The dispute centers on the whether administrative law judges are merely SEC employees or are ""inferior officers"" who wield significant decision-making authority and should be covered by the Constitution's ""appointments clause.""
Inferior officers must be appointed by the president, the head of a federal agency or a court. 
The SEC has said its judges are merely employees in part because their decisions are not final and still subject to review by the commission. 
Republican President Donald Trump's administration, which has sought to roll back the power of agencies in a push toward deregulation, took the unusual step last November of switching sides in the case, no longer defending the SEC's actions and instead backing Lucia. 
The case is being closely watched by the business community and corporate rights advocates beyond Wall Street. Some business groups complain that as the SEC's enforcement powers have expanded, it has sent more cases to its own judges rather than federal district courts, giving the agency an unfair ""home court"" advantage.
A ruling is due by the end of June.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators opened an investigation on Monday into Apple's bid for British music discovery app Shazam, concerned the deal might give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage in poaching users from its rivals.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the deal in December to help it better compete with industry leader Spotify. Shazam lets users identify songs by pointing a smartphone at the audio source.
The European Commission said it was concerned about Apple's access to data on Shazam's users who use competing music streaming services in Europe.
""Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors' customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,"" the EU competition enforcer said.
The investigation will also examine whether Apple Music's competitors would be harmed if Apple halted referrals from the Shazam app to them.
The Commission set a Sept. 4 deadline for its decision.
Apple could offer concessions such as a pledge to allow fair access to Shazam to address regulatory concerns.
The EU executive launched a preliminary review of the deal in February following a request from seven European countries including France, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

Apple did not give a value for the deal when it announced it in December. Technology news website TechCrunch said at the time the price could be as much as $400 million, far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately-held Shazam.

414,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 09:41AM ET</span>",The pro-privacy backlash against Facebook might actually make it even stronger," Battered over privacy issues in recent weeks, Facebook faces tough new regulations in Europe and potentially elsewhere, including at home.
But rather than curtailing the social networking giant's power, the rules could leave it stronger than ever.
That's the take of Morningstar Equity Research analyst Ali Mogharabi. The new regulations could actually create hurdles that will be a bigger burden for potential competitors to Facebook than for Facebook itself, Mogharabi said in a research note Friday.
""Future regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe or some bills being proposed in the United States, are likely to create barriers to entry,"" he wrote. ""This might actually make it harder for competing social networks to collect valuable user data to sell ads, and in turn may help Facebook maintain its dominant position as the social network of choice for advertisers.""
Set to take effect next month, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) promises to give European consumers more control over their private information. Following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, some US lawmakers  are discussing putting in place similar rules.
While some have seen such rules as a way to rein in Facebook, GDPR and similar potential regulations in the US could prove to be a financial windfall for the company, especially if they help weed out its competitors, Mogharabi said.
""Further regulations could limit Facebook's access to and/or utilization of user data, which could lower its advertising prices,"" he wrote. But, he added, ""we think they could also ... help Facebook maintain its dominant position in the social network space, possibly resulting in higher Facebook ad prices as advertisers find even fewer digital alternatives.""
The analyst estimates Facebook's stock, which closed regular trading Friday at $166.28, has a ""fair value"" of $198.
But other Facebook analysts aren't as optimistic about how the company will fare under new regulations. Instead, they argue that stricter privacy rules could precipitate a broader transformation in the market that may or may not work in Facebook's favour.
GDPR will likely cause ""a general slowdown in digital spending in Europe,"" Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser said in his own research note Thursday. While Facebook ""may very well grow its share, growth will likely slow along with the market share.""
Wieser has been far more bearish on Facebook than Mogharabi and other financial analysts. He has a rare ""sell"" rating on the company's shares and a price target of $138.
Mogharabi's analysis of how Facebook might benefit from regulations is ""plausible,"" Wieser told Business Insider. But, he added, the analysis is also ""willfully optimistic.""
GDPR and similar regulations will make it more difficult for Facebook and other companies to use customers' data. That could lead to an increased stream of ad dollars into Facebook, Wieser said. But it could also spark a broader shift in online advertising.
If advertisers see user-targeting through Facebook and similar services as increasingly difficult, they might fall back on older strategies, such as placing ads next to content — videos, articles, and the like — that itself is targeted at particular audiences. Traditional publishers can accommodate that kind of strategy, but Facebook can't, he said.
Similarly, you might see companies emerge that are ""legitimately GDPR-privacy-friendly-by-design,"" Wieser said. These would be Facebook alternatives that wouldn't be reliant on user-targeted advertising and so wouldn't be constrained by GDPR or similar regulations. Such companies might also see a boost from increased consumer awareness of privacy issues, he said.
More radically, if the new regulations are accompanied by a sea change in attitudes towards public data sharing, Facebook and other social networking services may see their use and relevance diminish.
""They exist today, and something different could exist in the future. People can get tired of Facebook,"" Wieser said. ""You can't take it as a given that it persists. It probably does, but it could just as easily fade away."""
415,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>","Abu Dhabi, Shanghai plan exchange focusing on China trade","DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the emirate's international financial center, has agreed in principle with the Shanghai Stock Exchange to cooperate in establishing an exchange focusing on China's foreign trade and investment, ADGM said on Monday.
The partners signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the exchange in Abu Dhabi. It would cater to companies and investors involved in China's Belt and Road initiative, a Beijing-backed drive to win trade and investment deals along routes linking China to Europe.
""At ADGM, we have the international platform to serve different kinds of enterprises and investors - global, regional and local - seeking exposure to the Middle East and North Africa and Belt and Road projects,” said Richard Teng, chief executive of ADGM's Financial Services Regulatory Authority.
Teng said he could not give specifics of which instruments the new exchange would trade or when it might open, saying this would depend on demand among stakeholders in both ADGM and Shanghai.
Chinese financial institutions have approached ADGM to discuss the financial environment in Abu Dhabi and their development needs in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), he added.
Trade and investment ties between China and the GCC have been growing rapidly. The region is a big oil supplier to China, and Sino-United Arab Emirates trade exceeded $46 billion in 2016, according to Beijing's official Xinhua news agency.
Ultimately, the new exchange will support not only the Belt and Road initiative but also the internationalization of the Chinese yuan in the region, Teng said.

Abu Dhabi is trying to build up ADGM, which opened in October 2015 and is smaller than the international financial center in neighboring Dubai, as part of a drive to develop its economy beyond oil exports.

416,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Tesla's problems are mounting — here's everything that has gone wrong so far this year," Tesla has a history of beating the odds. 
CEO Elon Musk has said he believed the company  had around a 10% chance of success when it was founded in 2003. Since then, the company has won awards for its vehicles, built an enthusiastic fanbase, and watched its market capitalization approach and temporarily top those of General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford, and Fiat-Chrysler.
Part of the company's success can be attributed to Musk's rare gift for storytelling. Since taking over as the company's chief executive in 2008, he's outlined a vision for the company that extends beyond selling cars to transforming global energy grids. Investors have bought that story, which is why the company has been able to raise money without much difficulty despite posting consistent deficits.
But that story has taken a hit in recent months as the company has faced concerns over its finances, ability to build cars at scale, and public comments attributed to Musk and Tesla. Now, the company is at an inflection point. Elon Musk says the company will be profitable by the end of the third quarter and won't have to raise money for the rest of the year. Some analysts and investors disagree with him.
Whether Musk lives up to his assertion could determine whether 2018 sets the stage for another improbable triumph or raise serious questions about the company's future.
Here are the moments that have led to Tesla's latest moment of reckoning.
In February, Tesla's Amazon Web Services account was hacked to mine cryptocurrency. The hack, which was brought to Tesla's attention by the cybersecurity startup RedLock, also reportedly exposed some of Tesla's proprietary data related to mapping, telemetry, and vehicle servicing.
According to Fortune, Tesla paid RedLock over $3,000 as part of its bug bounty program, which rewards people who find vulnerabilities in the company's products or services that could be exploited by hackers.
""The impact seems to be limited to internally-used engineering test cars only, and our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way,"" a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider in an email.
In March, Tesla  issued the largest recall in its history. The recall involved power-steering systems in 123,000 Model S sedans. Tesla said five bolts responsible for holding the power-steering motor in place could corrode, break, or come loose, which could result in the loss of power steering.
But the company also said the problem was rare and most likely to happen in colder areas that use a specific kind of salt to lessen the amount of ice and snow on the road. According to Tesla, the problem was only relevant to Model S vehicles built before April 2016 and had affected just 0.02% of Model S vehicles at the time the recall was announced.
In March,  a Model X crashed into a highway barrier in Mountain View, California. The driver, Walter Huang, died after being taken to the hospital. 
Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous system, was engaged during the accident, and Huang's wife said he had complained about the system not working properly near the area where the crash occurred. 
Tesla released a statement blaming Huang for the accident. The company said ""the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.""
Huang's family said  they plan to sue Tesla. 
While Tesla pointed to statistics that indicate fatal accidents are 3.7 times less likely to happen in Tesla vehicles that have Autopilot than in other vehicles, the crash highlights the difficulties automakers face as the industry slowly shifts toward autonomous vehicles."

LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge has ordered that Ivica Todoric, founder of beleaguered food production and retail conglomerate Agrokor, be extradited to Croatia to face allegations of fraud totaling tens of millions of euros.
Agrokor, which accounts for 15 percent of Croatian GDP and is the largest employer in the Balkans, was placed under emergency state administration a year ago after it came close to collapsing under a mountain of debt.
Todoric, who founded the company in 1976, has denied accusations of fraud and said the Croatian investigation into his financial affairs was politically motivated.
But judge Emma Arbuthnot, the chief magistrate of England and Wales, said in a judgment delivered at Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday that she had seen no evidence to support that argument, which she dismissed as a ""conspiracy theory"".
""I accept that the Agrokor affair has a political dimension as it represents 15 percent of the GDP of Croatia, but the prosecution is based on the evidence uncovered and is not being pursued because of political pressure,"" she said.
The fallout from the Agrokor crisis extends beyond Croatia's borders. The single biggest creditor is Russia's Sberbank, which has a claim of more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) and has lodged a criminal complaint of forgery against Todoric and the company.
Arbuthnot said that a Zagreb prosecutor had provided 15 pages of closely typed descriptions of alleged offences, including that Todoric had instructed Agrokor to settle his and his family's personal expenses to the tune of millions of euros.
She said the evidence suggested that despite not being profitable since 2006, Agrokor had picked up the tab for items such as Todoric's big-game hunting in Africa and the cost of stuffing the animals he killed.
SEVEN DAYS TO APPEAL
Todoric, who was present in court for the judgment, has seven days to lodge an appeal against Arbuthnot's extradition order. If he does not appeal, he will be extradited within the following 10 days.
His lawyer told the court that Todoric had run out of money because his assets were subject to international freezing orders and he was reliant on the kindness of friends and family to pay rent, bills and legal fees.
Todoric, who was granted bail on stricter conditions than before the judgment, told reporters outside the court that he would use all legal means at his disposal in the UK ""to pursue his further plans"". 
The new bail conditions require him to report to a London police station daily and he will be under a nightly curfew from 2000 to 0600 GMT.
Arbuthnot said that though Todoric had yet to be formally charged, it was clear from evidence received from a prosecutor in Zagreb that investigations were at an advanced stage and there was an intention to try him and 14 others.
She said that, as of April 10, Croatian investigators had interviewed 53 of a potential 65 to 70 witnesses and she quoted the Zagreb prosecutor as saying there was ""strong evidence"" that Todoric had committed the alleged offences.

Earlier in April Agrokor's creditors agreed draft settlement terms aimed at saving the company from bankruptcy. They are due to vote on the deal before July 10.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Volvo Trucks plans to share battery technology across its brands to tame development and production costs for the crucial but expensive component, as the world's second-largest truck maker ramps up electric offerings, the company told Reuters on Monday.
As vehicle makers face growing costs to develop lower-emission vehicles and automated driving capabilities, Volvo Trucks, owned by Sweden's Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb), said it would ""absolutely"" make sense for its brands - which include Japan's UD Trucks and Mack Trucks in the United States - to share battery technology.
""We're really striving to reuse a lot when it comes to expensive components, which are expensive when it comes to development and production costs ... not only between the truck brands but also the bus brands and construction equipment,"" Lars Stenqvist, chief technology officer at Volvo Group Trucks Technology, said in an interview.
""The benefit of the group is that we can get high volumes when we re-use components across the group.""
UD Trucks said it planned to launch an electric version of its Quon heavy-duty truck around 2020, after Volvo Trucks earlier this month announced it would launch lithium-ion battery powered, medium-duty trucks for deliveries and refuse collection in Europe in 2019.
""Since we share technologies and platforms, it won't be difficult for us to do this,"" said Douglas Nakano, senior vice president of UD Trucks Technology during the same interview.
""Technologically speaking, we are ready."" 
 Daimler  AG-owned (DE:DAIGn) Japanese rival Mitsubishi Fuso began selling an electric version of its Canter delivery trucks in Japan and the United States last year, expanding into Europe earlier this year, while Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) truck division has said it plans to launch a medium-duty truck in North America by late 2019.
New technologies which have been disrupting the traditional auto industry are also affecting the truck and heavy equipment industry, as electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is expanding into electric trucks, announcing last year it planned to start producing a heavy-duty model by 2019. 
To stay competitive, a growing number of vehicle makers are trying to reduce development costs by leveraging scale, with the truck units of Volkswagen and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) announcing earlier this month that they were forming an alliance.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:07PM ET</span>","U.S. extends deadline for Rusal sanctions, aluminum prices dive","By Susan Heavey and Polina Devitt
WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States on Monday gave American customers of Russia's biggest aluminum producer more time to comply with sanctions, and said it would consider lifting them if United Company Rusal Plc's major shareholder, Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, ceded control of the company.
Aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange tumbled 8.7 percent on the U.S. Treasury Department announcement, which gives Rusal longer to sell off large quantities of aluminum it had been stockpiling in the wake of sanctions. 
Last week, aluminum prices rallied to their highest in years after Washington, in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia, imposed the sanctions that will in effect choke off access for Deripaska's businesses to the international financial system.
Treasury gave Americans until Oct. 23 instead of June 5 to wind down business with Rusal. It said it would not impose secondary sanctions on non-U.S. entities engaged with Rusal or its subsidiaries. 
Shares in Rusal, one of the world's largest aluminum companies, jumped 17.7 percent on the Moscow Exchange. Earlier, Rusal had ended Hong Kong trading down 8.4 percent. Shares of its U.S. rival  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp slid 13.5 percent on the New York stock exchange.
""Rusal has felt the impact of U.S. sanctions because of its entanglement with Oleg Deripaska, but the U.S. government is not targeting the hardworking people who depend on Rusal and its subsidiaries,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
Workers at one of Russia's biggest aluminum smelters say their Siberian town is doomed unless Moscow mitigates U.S. sanctions against Rusal, a predicament mirrored across the company's sprawling operations.
Deripaska owns a 48 percent stake in Rusal ""and controls the company via his shareholder agreement with other owners,"" said Oleg Petropavlovsky, a senior analyst at BCS Global Markets. ""It is not clear whether potential cancellation of this shareholder agreement would be enough"" to satisfy U.S. officials, he said. 
Rusal declined to comment on the Treasury Department announcement. The Kremlin and Deripaska did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
NO LONGER 'RADIOACTIVE'
European leaders have worked to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump to ease sanctions on Russia, with the president of France poised to visit the White House this week.
Mnuchin said ""impact on our partners and allies"" factored into the reprieve. French sources said initial feedback had been ""constructive."" 
Rusal now has more time to sell off its supply. Even if sanctions are not ultimately lifted, buyers also have more time to seek other suppliers. 
Last week, aluminum rallied to its highest since mid-2011 on fears the global market could face shortages as a result of the U.S. sanctions. It remains up more than 16 percent this month.
Wood Mackenzie analysts said Treasury's announcement provides ""much-needed breathing space"" for the aluminum market, adding ""We expect near-term correction and volatility"" in prices.

Edward Meir, an analyst at INTL FCStone, said there is potential for Rusal to survive and that ""the 5 mln (million) tons of Rusal production that a week ago was arguably radioactive, will no longer be so.""

(Reuters) - Consumer products maker Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL) and hedge fund Starboard Value LP have agreed to end a months-long proxy fight through a deal brokered by fellow activist investor Carl Icahn that will add three new independent directors to the board.
Icahn, who has amassed a nearly 7 percent stake in the Sharpie maker, said on Monday he agreed to give up two of the four seats he secured last month to pave the way for the addition of two new independent directors, Gerardo Lopez and Robert Steele, to Newell's board.
In a combined statement, Newell and Icahn said they also planned to nominate Bridget Ryan Berman, a Starboard nominee, for election to the board at the company's 2018 annual meeting.
With the three additions, the board will expand to 12 from 11 now. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said the end of the proxy battle with Starboard should remove an element of uncertainty.
""With a new board in place and a transformation plan underway, we see a good setup for Newell shares looking forward,"" she wrote in a note to clients. 
Newell's shares rose as much as 2 percent in early trading as investors cheered the deal, just weeks ahead of the company's annual meeting, scheduled for the middle of May.
Starboard had signaled only a few weeks ago that it would push ahead with a proxy contest it started earlier this year, even after Icahn received board seats. 
The settlement comes ahead of two separate key meetings that Starboard and the company were supposed to hold this week with proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which will now be canceled, according to people familiar with the matter.
Icahn said on Monday the decision to give up seats was to ""facilitate peace"" between Newell and Starboard's Jeff Smith, who runs the $8 billion hedge fund.
""The company reached out to us and requested that we give up two board seats to avoid a potentially disruptive proxy fight, which could have been especially bad at this important time for the company,"" Icahn said in the statement. 
Starboard said it has agreed to withdraw its slate of directors and vote all of its shares in favor of the Newell nominees at the annual meeting.
""Nine of the twelve directors will be new to the board, and we are confident this newly reconstituted Board will bring a refreshed sense of urgency, oversight, and accountability to Newell,"" Starboard's Smith said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Monday as concerns about soft smartphone demand weighed on tech stocks and pulled the Nasdaq lower while earnings optimism protected against deeper losses.
Tech stocks dragged on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ahead of a big week of earnings for the sector. Chipmaker shares dropped after the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), cut its full-year revenue target due to softer demand for smartphones. 
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries (US10YT=RR) rose to their highest level since January 2014 amid concerns over the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation.
""The markets are clearly spooked by this move in the bond market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""Ultimately if these long-term interest rates continue to move higher, that's going to continue to be a stumbling block for markets and I think we'll continue to see markets trading down,"" said Massocca.
Earnings provided a bright spot, with 18 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 78.2 percent of which have beat consensus estimates.
""By and large earnings have been very good, they continue to be supportive of the market,"" Massocca added.
Analysts expect earnings growth at S&P 500 companies of nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, the strongest showing in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) was up slightly in volatile after-hours trading following its earnings release; the company reported a 73 percent jump in profits in the first quarter. 
Quarterly results are expected this week from 181 S&P 500 companies, including technology heavy-hitters  Facebook Inc  (O:FB),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC). 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 14.25 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,448.69, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.15 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,670.29 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 17.53 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,128.60.
Of the 11 major S&P sectors, six ended the session in positive territory, with the biggest percentage gain coming from the Telecom index (SPLRCL). 
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) closed down 1.3 percent, posting its fourth straight session of declines on concerns of slowing smartphone demand.
Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) helped lift the healthcare sector, 2.4 percent following a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgrade to ""buy."" {nL3N1S051J] 
Aluminum company stocks dropped as the United States opened the door to sanctions relief for Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc (HK:0486).  Alcoa  (N:AA) tumbled 13.5 percent and Arconic fell (N:ARNC) 5.2 percent, making it the biggest percentage loser on the S&P.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.39-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Investors build up exposure to beaten-down UK infrastructure,"By Alasdair Pal and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Leading shareholders in British listed infrastructure funds are doubling down on their investments, betting the political worries that sent valuations to decade-lows are overdone.
The funds, which mainly invest in building and maintaining UK assets like schools and hospitals, have boomed in recent years as successive governments supported private finance initiatives (PFI) aimed at executing projects more efficiently.
They have been a popular choice for investors since the financial crisis, because of their stable dividend income during a period of low yields elsewhere in financial markets.
The four largest listed funds, or investment trusts –  HICL Infrastructure  (L:HICL), International Public Partnerships (L:INPP),  John Laing Infrastructure  (L:JLIF) and BBGI (L:BBGIB) – issued a record 1.1 billion pounds ($1.54 billion) of new shares in 2017 to keep up with the demand.
But an increase in political risk in the UK has soured sentiment in recent months. Share prices slid in September after the opposition Labour party suggested nationalizing PFI contracts, in what would be a radical departure from existing government policy.
They fell further in January after building contractor  Carillion  (L:CLLN) – which had partnerships with a number of the trusts – collapsed, adding to fears the projects might be brought back into the public sector.
As a result, the sector is now trading below the value of its net assets for the first time in nearly a decade, according to Reuters data.
""The nature of current sentiment is that it's hard to dispel,"" said Giles Frost, chief executive of Amber Infrastructure Group, the investment manager advising INPP.
""It's our job to restore confidence, it's our job to persuade all our stakeholders of the value we bring as a long-term private investor, and we're knuckling down and doing that.""
(GRAPHIC: Infrastructure trusts have fallen sharply while share issuance has spiked - https://reut.rs/2K0PG7b)
BUYING OPPORTUNITY
A number of the largest investors in the sector have added to their positions, saying valuations more than compensate for the increased risk of nationalization, though they expect a more muted market with little fundraising in the near future.
James de Bunsen, fund manager at Janus Henderson Investors, a top-20 investor in HICL, has doubled his exposure to infrastructure since the beginning of the year despite the increased political uncertainty.
""I think it's hugely overblown,"" he said. ""It's a risk so you can't completely rule it out, but in my mind you've got to have an election first and that's not slated till 2022.""
Labour would first have to win power and then would probably need to win a vote in Parliament to force through nationalization, said Colin Dryburgh, a fund manager at Kames Capital, a top 20 shareholder in BBGI, HICL and International Public Partnerships.
""You don't just need a left-leaning government, you need MPs that are onside,"" he said.
With the trusts now trading at a discount, some investors are calling for disposals of non-core assets to realize value for shareholders.
""In a number of meetings with the companies I invest in, it is the question I am asking,"" said Mike Pingerra, fund manager at Four Sanlam and a top-30 shareholder in HICL. ""Is this an opportunity to tidy the portfolio up?"" He, too, has added to his holdings.
Diversifying the trusts' portfolios could also end up being a necessity because of the tough PFI market, said Solomon Nevins, a fund manager at Architas, which owns stakes in John Laing Infrastructure and International Public Partnerships.
""Already we have seen a massive decrease in traditional PFIs being written,"" he said. ""Some of the funds have been broadening their investment scope and doing more investments overseas. You are going to see in time the proportion of UK schools and hospitals in portfolios shrink.""
The majority of BBVI's assets are now outside the UK, with the firm's investments dominated by Canadian projects, according to broker Canaccord Genuity.
Conditions in the UK PFI market were likely to be difficult for the foreseeable future, according to an executive at one of the trusts.
""There is not much political support for it at the moment,"" he said. ""It is not the flavor of the month today and I can't see that changing in the short term or in the medium term. But I don't think there is an alternative, either.""

427,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Halliburton revenue jumps on higher North American demand,"By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) reported a 34 percent jump in first-quarter revenue on Monday as North American companies boosted oil and gas production amid rising oil prices. 
The jump in revenue came despite a $312 million writedown on Halliburton's remaining assets in Venezuela, and a hit to earnings related to the impact of cold weather earlier in the quarter.
Halliburton expects normalized margins of around 20 percent in North America by the end of this year, supported by ongoing tightness in the hydraulic fracturing market, Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on Monday. 
""We believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied and will remain tight,"" Miller said, pointing to high fracking equipment utilization rates and service intensity that is degrading existing equipment.
Some 3.3 million of additional hydraulic horsepower is expected to be added to the U.S. pressure pumping fleet this year, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. The additions have stoked concerns among investors that companies could overbuild equipment. 
Halliburton's revenue from North America jumped nearly 58 percent to $3.52 billion in the three months ended March 31, while revenue from international operations rose 9 percent. 
Total revenue jumped to $5.74 billion from $4.28 billion.
Its shares were trading at roughly $51.13 on Monday morning, off about 1.6 percent as part of a broader decline in energy stocks. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were trading around $67.40, down about 1.45 percent. 
Adjusting for items, Halliburton posted a profit of 41 cents per share in the latest reported quarter, in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton in February warned it expected a 10 cents per share hit to first-quarter earnings due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking.
Net income attributable to Halliburton shareholders was $46 million, or 5 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31.
The company posted a loss of $32 million, or 4 cents per share to shareholders, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
The company said it continues to see tightness in the U.S. labor market, and in supply chain segments such as rail and trucking. Higher prices will be needed to absorb the impacts of wage inflation, Miller said during the company's earnings call on Monday. 

Halliburton on Monday also said it would remain in Venezuela, which has been plagued with political and economic turmoil, but carefully manage its exposure in the OPEC-member country.

(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) reported worse than expected results for the first quarter on Monday, blaming the bankruptcy of Toys 'R' Us for a slide in revenue but also promising the worst would be over in the first half of 2018.
Shares of the company, initially hammered almost 8 percent lower by the poor profit and revenue numbers, recovered to trade about 2.2 percent higher at $84.6. 
Managers said the impact of the collapse of one of its biggest retail customers would fall off in the second half of the year, promised growth in 2019 and gave projected operating margin figures for this year that impressed analysts.
""We anticipate the revenue impact will be most pronounced in the first half of the year with a lesser impact in the third and fourth quarters, including the important holiday season"", Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said. 
Goldner said the U.S. liquidation of Toys 'R' Us is expected to conclude at the end of the second quarter, while plans for the retailer's international stores remain uncertain.
D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser said she was relieved to learn that the company did not expect further material expenses from the Toys R Us bankruptcy. 
Hasbro, which reported first quarter revenue that was nearly $100 million below forecast, said it is on track to meet its goal of generating $600 million to $700 million in operating cash flow this year. 
The maker of beyblades expects an operating profit margin in line with 2017's level of 15.6 percent this year, excluding the expenses associated with Toys 'R' Us and severance costs from commercial organization transformation. 
The company, which has focused on getting media content to back their toys through their partnerships with Disney and Marvel, said it is supporting six major releases this year, including ""Black Panther"", ""Avengers: Infinity War"", and ""Deadpool 2"". 
Earlier, Hasbro reported profits that were a huge 23 cents a shares short of expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, its first miss in at least two years.
The net loss attributable to the company was $112.5 million, or 90 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 1, compared with a profit of $68.6 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.
The toy industry's traditional players have been undone in recent years by a shift towards thousands of rival, smaller producers selling on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other e-commerce sites as well as kids picking electronic games over physical toys.

Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), which last week apppointed its fourth chief executive in three years ahead of first quarter results this Thursday, also recovered ground after an initial drop in shares on Monday.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 06:35AM ET</span>",GM Korea drops bankruptcy vote plan after last-minute wage deal,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (NYSE:GM) South Korean unit dropped a plan to consider filing for bankruptcy after winning concessions on pay, bonuses and benefits from its labor union in a tentative deal reached on Monday.
The deal will pave the way for nearly $500 million in fresh capital injection by the South Korean government, providing much-needed liquidity to GM Korea to pay employees and its suppliers, but slumping vehicle sales and low factory run-rates raise questions about its longer-term future.
The concessions by GM Korea's powerful auto union are expected to heap pressure on other auto unions for similar moves, at a time when South Korea's auto industry is grappling with higher labor costs and sluggish demand from the United States and other markets.
""Through the latest agreement, GM Korea will be a competitive manufacturing company,"" Kaher Kazem, chief executive of GM Korea, said in a statement in Korean.
GM shocked South Korea in February when it unveiled a major restructuring plan for the money-losing unit, which involved shuttering one of its four plants in the country and voluntary redundancies for 2,600 workers.
The automaker had sought wage concessions from the union as well as government funding and incentives to save its remaining three South Korean factories.
The board of GM Korea delayed a decision on whether to file for court-managed bankruptcy protection until Monday evening after the automaker failed to reach a wage deal with its labor union in time to meet a Friday deadline.
""HUGE CONCESSIONS""
The union accepted the company's request to freeze base wages and skip bonuses for this year as well as trim benefits, according to the agreement seen by Reuters.
Future base wage increases and performance pay ""will be dependent upon the company regaining profitability"", while the base wage rises will not exceed inflation, it said.
Regarding its 680 remaining workers at the Gunsan factory, which is scheduled to be shuttered in May, the company will ""implement options including a voluntary redundancy program and transfers"" to other plants to avoid layoffs.
""The labor union made huge concessions to save the company,"" Hong Young-pyo, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party who mediated the agreement, said at a news conference after the deal.
The union was absent from the press conference where Hong and GM executives were present.
A union spokesman declined to comment, saying union members are expected to vote on the preliminary deal on Wednesday and Thursday.
""Clearly it sets an example that a labor union cannot help but make concessions to overcome its company's crisis,"" Kim Soo-wook, a professor of operations management at Seoul National University, said.
""This will influence further labor conflicts and activities case by case depending on how bad the situations are for companies or how the global economy goes.""
Hyundai Motor, South Korea's biggest automaker, is bracing for its annual talks with its labor union, after it posted a fifth straight drop in annual earnings last year as a lack of sport utility vehicles in the United States and a diplomatic row with China hurt earnings.
Adding further pressure on Hyundai, U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management said on Monday a restructuring plan proposed by the auto group to end circular shareholding structure was not enough, and recommended it create a holding company and increase dividend, among other things.
DOUBTS LINGER
The deal would pave the way for the Korea Development Bank (KDB) [KDB.UL] to provide support and for GM to allocate two new models to South Korea to help turn around GM Korea, the unit said in a statement.
State-run KDB is GM Korea's second-largest shareholder with a 17 percent stake. The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, controls the remaining 6 percent.
The government had stepped up pressure on GM and the union to reach an agreement, saying without a swift deal some 150,000 jobs at the automaker and its suppliers would be at risk.
GM Korea still needs to negotiate with KDB on terms of the latter's financial support to the unit, while trying to secure tax and other incentives from the industry ministry. KDB's chairman told Reuters last week the lender may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27.
Some analysts said the fate of GM Korea is still uncertain.
The unit's strength is small cars but GM is scaling down its presence in that segment, said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. “GM has extended the lifeline of GM Korea, but not sure how long it will last.”
The South Korean unit, once the backbone of GM's Asian strategy, has been hobbled by labor costs and hurt by the automaker's decision to pull its Chevrolet brand from Europe, a key export market. It posted a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2017, its fourth straight year in the red.

The unit still makes more than 1 million assembled or partially assembled vehicles for the United States, European and emerging markets. It is also an engineering and design source for GM's small vehicles and electric vehicles, as well as home to some of GM's top-ranked suppliers globally.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 09:11AM ET</span>",Activist fund Elliott ramps up pressure on South Korean auto giant Hyundai,"By Ju-min Park and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management dismissed  Hyundai Motor  Group's restructuring plan as insufficient on Monday and called on the South Korean conglomerate to adopt a holding company strategy and appoint more independent board members. 
Elliott disclosed this month that it holds more than $1 billion worth of shares in three key affiliates of Hyundai Motor Group and called for a ""more detailed roadmap"" on how the group will improve corporate governance, optimize balance sheets and enhance capital returns.
Stepping up its campaign against the South Korean carmaker on Monday, Elliott said it was unclear how the group's restructuring plan would benefit minority shareholders.
The giant autos-to-steel group last month announced a plan to streamline its ownership structure, responding to calls from the government and investors for greater transparency and better governance at family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols. 
""Elliott is encouraged that the Group has acknowledged the need for an improved ownership structure. However, the unwinding of the current circular shareholding by itself... lacks clear benefits to minority shareholders,"" Elliott said in a statement.
It said it holds more than 1.5 percent of the common shares in each of the three key affiliates of the country's No.2 conglomerate -  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330), Hyundai Motor (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270). 
Hyundai said in a statement that it would continue to communicate with investors including Elliott to explain the goals and needs of its reorganization plan.
It is Elliott's latest challenge to South Korea's family-run conglomerates after it forced  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) to increase shareholder returns in 2017, and comes amid a government campaign to boost investors' power in a country where shareholder activism is rare.
ACCELERATE HYUNDAI
Elliott said the Hyundai group should combine Hyundai Mobis with Hyundai Motor to create a holding company, and set up a clear policy for dividend payouts. 
""We believe this is truly a unique opportunity to unlock significant value in Hyundai Motor Group that the founding family and the leadership of the Group have built over the decades,"" Elliott said in its presentation. 
It laid out its plan for Hyundai in a 43-page presentation on a new website: https://www.acceleratehyundai.com
In its introduction, Elliott boasted of its ""successful"" 2016/17 campaign against Samsung Electronics, in which it also urged a restructuring of the business as a holding company. Samsung turned down Elliott's push for the holding company structure, but instead boosted dividends and canceled treasury shares.
Regardless of whether Hyundai adopts a holding company structure, Elliott demanded the cancellation of treasury shares in Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis.
Elliott said Hyundai Mobis and Hyundai Motor each has as much as 6 trillion won ($5.6 billion) of excess cash, but they ""have used valuable capital to fund many questionable investments"" including the group's $10 billion bid to buy a plot of land in Seoul at a 217 percent premium over the land's appraised value. 
""We believe that Hyundai Motor Group’s current balance sheet is out of balance,"" it said. 
Elliott also proposed that the three affiliates add three independent board members each to improve the group's corporate governance, which it said ""remains below global standards.""
Kim Sang-jo, head of South Korea's anti-trust watchdog, said on Friday that he expected talks between Hyundai and Elliott would not be friendly, although Hyundai may have prepared for the U.S. fund coming to challenge it.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 03:09AM ET</span>",China fund managers slash ZTE valuation after U.S. sanction,"By Samuel Shen and Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese funds have slashed valuations of ZTE Corp after the United States banned American companies from selling components to the telecoms equipment maker for seven years, a move ZTE said threatened its very survival.
The U.S. action last week was sparked by ZTE's violation of an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. American companies are estimated to provide 25-30 percent of the components used in ZTE's equipment.
Chinese mutual fund managers cut the value of the stock in their portfolios by 20-30 percent in a spate of announcements over the weekend, a blow to ZTE that suspended trading in its mainland and Hong Kong shares on April 17.
Around 40 Chinese mutual funds have adjusted the valuation of ZTE in their portfolios since it suspended trading. In the latest batch, five fund managers revalued the stock on Saturday.
Huatai-PineBridege and GTJA Allianz (DE:ALVG) cut their valuation of ZTE's mainland shares to 25.05 yuan, 20 percent lower than its last trading price. JT Asset Management - the most pessimistic - slashed the valuation to around 30 percent below ZTE's last close of 31.31 yuan ($4.98).
Several funds with exposure to ZTE's Hong Kong shares, including HuaAn Fund and Harvest Fund, cut valuations to about 20 percent below the last trading price of HK$25.60 ($3.26).
ZTE, which had a market capitalization of about $20 billion before trading in its shares was suspended, did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.
The valuation adjustment by mutual funds could be just preliminary, as the real impact of the U.S. sanctions needs to be assessed continuously as the incident unfolds, said Reagan Li, investment manager at private fund house Shanghai V-Invest.
On Sunday, ZTE said it was ""making active communications with relevant parties and seeking a solution to the U.S. export denial order"". Earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department said it would allow ZTE to submit more evidence related to the matter.
The threat to ZTE's business has triggered a broad sell-off in technology shares as investors fear the sector could suffer from the fallout, or that other firms could be targeted by the United States amid escalating trade tensions.
Shares in display maker BOE Technology slumped as much as 6 percent on Monday, even after the firm said it had not received any official information regarding U.S. sanctions in response to rumors in the market that it would be targeted.
The CSI Information Technology index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed tech firms fell 2 percent.

""Investors are asking: who will be next on the U.S. sanction list?"" fund manager Li said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British pensions specialist Clive Cowdery has raised $2 billion in commitments from investors for a new fund to buy up life insurance policies from companies struggling to make enough money to cover long-term payouts, sources told Reuters.
The fund is one of a series of new ventures designed to capitalize on the difficulty life insurers and company pension schemes face in generating the returns required in an environment of low interest rates and tougher capital rules.
Besides Cowdery's fund, the newly formed European Insurance Consolidation Group (EICG) is also looking for life insurance deals while pensions veteran Edi Truell and fund Clara Pensions both plan to take on defined benefit schemes from British firms.
Specialist providers say they can run pensions and life policies at a lower cost by using economies of scale, investing more astutely and using actuarial expertise to match assets more closely to liabilities - and thereby reduce risk.
Cowdery, founder of The Resolution Group, one of UK life insurance's biggest names, will be focusing on life insurance policies closed to new customers in continental Europe and the United States, three sources told Reuters.
Cowdery declined to comment. 
EICG director Jurgen Schweigert, who is a former Resolution executive, said there were a number of life insurance policy portfolios up for sale, including two books in southern Europe with about 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in assets.
""There is a lot of capital out there chasing this opportunity,"" Schweigert told Reuters, declining to give more details about any of the assets on offer.
Existing insurance entities backed by private equity firms Apollo and Cinven are also vying for Italian insurer Generali's (MI:GASI) 43 billion euros of German life insurance business, banking sources told Reuters.
Generali declined to comment.
British insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) sold 12 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) of closed annuities books this year to Rothesay Life and market sources estimate there are about 100 billion pounds of such portfolios available in Britain. [nL8N1QW1BN]
PENSION SUPERFUND
Some large insurers have pulled out of offering costly pensions in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to focus on growth areas - such as Asia, in the case of Prudential.
In Britain, companies are starting to transfer pension schemes calculated on workers' final salaries to insurers, to take the pensions risk off their balance sheets. 
Such schemes, which guarantee a fixed payment to pensioners, have been closed by many companies because of their cost but still have a collective deficit of 116 billion pounds.
Truell, co-founder of the firm which became specialist annuity provider Pension Insurance Corporation, is one of the backers of The Pension Superfund, a new venture designed to manage British company pension schemes.
The superfund is capitalizing on British proposals allowing for the consolidation of company pension funds to make them cheaper to manage. [nL8N1R13MP]
The fund also comes under Britain's pensions regulator, rather than the Prudential Regulation Authority for banks and insurers. Capital costs for insurers offering pensions have risen due to Europe's tougher Solvency II rules.
Truell told Reuters the structure of the superfund would give it greater freedom to allocate assets than an insurer because it won't face their regulatory costs and could invest more easily in higher-yielding assets, such as infrastructure.
The Pension Superfund will, however, face competition from at least two other similar funds looking to take on British company pension schemes, including Clara Pensions, sources said.
Clara Pension's co-founder Kim Toker declined to comment.
BULK ANNUITIES
The Pension Superfund model provides a cheaper alternative to the bulk annuity model that has been in vogue in recent years, Truell said.
Insurers, however, argue their high capital requirements make pension payments through a bulk annuity more secure than the pension consolidation fund approach being adopted by the Superfund and other new players.
In a bulk annuity arrangement, an insurer takes over the risk of a defined benefit company pension scheme, also known as a final salary scheme.
The bulk annuity market is relatively small compared with the two trillion pounds of liabilities in company pension plans. Schemes which are heavily in deficit find it hard to pay the insurance premium required for a bulk annuity. 
However, ratings agency Fitch described it as one of the few life insurance sectors with significant growth prospects, even though barriers to entry are high because of the capital costs and specialist skills needed. 
Advisory company Willis Towers Watson (O:WLTW) estimates the market will total 15 billion pounds in premiums in 2018, up from an average 10 billion to 12 billion in recent years. 
The UK bulk annuity market is also attracting new entrants.
Insurers Canada Life, Phoenix Group (L:PHNX) and Scottish Widows have all entered the market in the last couple of years, bringing the number of players in the United Kingdom to eight.

But industry sources expect new entrants in 2018, including one firm backed by venture capital which has plans to insure smaller company schemes. The sources declined to name the firm.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 05:13AM ET</span>",U.S. fund managers brace for trade war with focus on pricing power,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors' fears of an all-out trade war between the United States and China is prompting U.S. stock fund managers to hunt for companies that can easily pass on higher costs to their consumers. 
So far, domestic small-to-mid-cap companies that get most of their revenues at home have weathered prospects of higher trade costs the best, with the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies up 2.8 percent for the year, nearly double the 1.5 percent gain in the larger-cap and more internationally-exposed S&P 500 index over the same time. 
Yet fund managers from firms including Villere & Co, Hodges Capital and BMO Global Asset Management say that a trade war would likely push inflation higher, eating into the margins of even those domestic companies that get no revenues overseas.
Instead of focusing on the geographic source of revenues, these managers say that they are targeting firms that have dominant niches or intellectual property that will allow them to protect or even expand their margins at a time of rising costs. 
""We're focusing on the companies that regardless of the type of inflation - whether it's commodities or trade or something else - can pass on those costs because they have some sort of structural advantage,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio-manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital. 
Marshall has been adding to his position in Texas Instruments Inc (O:TXN), for example, because the firm's chips are used in high-end, high-demand products such as iPhones and self-driving cars. Shares of the company are flat for the year after its most recent earnings report failed to beat Wall Street estimates for the first time in two years, but Marshall said that he expects its revenue to continue to grow at above-market rates. 
""They have the better mousetrap and if there are additional tariffs to bring its products back then they will be well positioned to pass those costs on,"" he said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese imports to the United States to punish China for what government officials regard as Beijing's predatory industrial policies and abuse of U.S. intellectual property. Beijing has vowed to retaliate.
A trade war between the two countries would lop 0.7 percent off of the U.S. GDP and push inflation up 0.1 percent, according to estimates from MSCI. That, in turn, would sink U.S. stocks by
about 5 percent, the firm estimates, a fall it says may already be priced into the market. Should other countries also raise tariffs, then U.S. stocks could drop by another 10 percent.
In the ""Beige Book,"" a survey of current U.S. economic conditions released Wednesday, the Federal Reserve noted that it had received scattered reports of companies successfully passing on prices in the manufacturing, information technology, transportation, and construction industries.
DOMESTIC NICHE 
Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co, said that he has been reducing his exposure of small and mid-cap companies with international revenues and is focusing more on those that dominate their domestic niche in order to offer protection from the effects of tariffs. 
He has been adding to his position in companies such as  Pool Corp  (O:POOL), the country's largest supplier of residential pool supplies, in large part because it has few competitors that will be able to undercut it on prices, he said. Shares of the company are up 12.5 percent for the year to date. 
He also has been adding to online higher education company  2U Inc  (O:TWOU) and Axon Enterprise Inc (O:AAXN), the parent company behind the Taser brand of non-lethal weapons and body cameras used by police departments, because both are dominant players that also have recurring revenue streams from long-term contracts. 
Shares of 2U are up 34.8 percent for the year, while shares of Axon are up 63 percent for the year to date. 
""The companies that are going to be able to withstand this are the ones that have a sort of moat around their businesses,"" he said.
Not all fund managers are as convinced that the Trump administration's threats, which pushed the benchmark S&P 500 down more than 10 percent to enter a correction in February, will become a reality. 
Margie Patel, a senior portfolio manager at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds, said that she expects to see little to no effect from trade tariffs and has been adding to companies such as PNC Finiancial Services Group Inc (N:PNC) that have sold off in the market downturn. 

""I think at the end of the day that virtually all of the 'trade war' effects will be negotiated away and the true economic impact on industries as well as specific companies will be very small, so I haven't factored the impact of any trade war considerations into my portfolio,"" she said.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2018 04:51AM ET</span>","Rails, truckers have gotten cheap but trade wars a risk","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many U.S. stocks cheapened up during the first quarter's choppy trading scene, relieving some concern investors had about lofty valuations.
But the companies that move goods through a humming economy now look among the market's best bargains, as long as the U.S.-China trade dispute doesn't derail their outlook.
Railroad and trucking stocks took a hit starting in late January just like the rest of the market. From its record high on Jan. 26, the S&P 500 (SPX) slumped more than 10 percent in less than two weeks to enter a correction, and the S&P 1500 road and rail index <.SPCOMRAR> fell 9.1 percent.
Demand to move U.S. goods by rail, truck and ship, however, has held firm so far this year. So the shippers emerged from the tumult sporting some of their cheapest valuations in years thanks to an atypical phenomenon: as their share prices were falling, their earnings expectations were moving up sharply - meaning their price-to-earnings ratios fell by an even wider margin.
""The volatility we saw in the first quarter was actually a pretty healthy thing for the entire market, it kind of reset expectations, it kept excess valuations from bubbling up,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and Director of Research, Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas.
That valuation reset may mean more upside for these stocks than the market as a whole if earnings reports in the coming days validate those optimistic profit forecasts. 
""Now that it has occurred, people have gone back in, re-evaluated the fundamentals and you are starting to see those stocks work their way back up off of a base,"" Marshall said.
J B Hunt Transportation (O:JBHT) may provide investors with a template of what to expect. 
The trucker's shares fell more than 13 percent between late January and early April. But its forward P/E ratio slumped by twice that margin, 27 percent, contracting from 27.2 to 19.8, below its five-year average of 21.5. 
By comparison the full S&P 500's P/E ratio contracted by about 12 percent to 16.3, and still sits above its historic average of 15.1.
The stock surged more than 6 percent in the wake of its earnings on Monday, its best day in five years. Nine of the analysts tracking the stock have raised their price targets since then.

On the rail side, CSX Corp (O:CSX) saw its forward PE drop from 22.02 in mid-January to 16.05 on Feb. 8, well below its five-year average of 19.9. Its shares rose nearly 8 percent on Wednesday, its best day in six years, following its quarterly results to send the stock to a record closing high of $61.01.
CSX Corp Forward PE and Price: https://reut.rs/2HgRyXH
A big concern, however, is an escalation of the current trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which was a primary cause of the recent downturn in the group.
""If you are looking at it in a quite linear focus, you think it would affect the rails probably because they move a lot of exported goods and they are susceptible to what goes on in trade,"" said Lindsay Bettiol, analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. 
The United States imposed a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports on March 23 along with a 25 percent duty on steel imports. U.S. President Donald Trump called for the tariffs to protect U.S. metal makers from cheap imports.
A strengthening economy, however, is likely to overpower those concerns and shipping companies are primed to benefit. 
In a recent note to clients,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) noted its TLFI index, which measures the incremental supply and demand for Dry-Van Truckload services, has done better than its typical performance for this time of the year despite a decline over the past two weeks. 
The index is projected above levels last seen in 2014, but below the fourth-quarter of 2017. When a given reading is above a prior year's level, it means there is more freight demand relative to available capacity, according to the firm. 
Trucking Stocks Forward PE: https://reut.rs/2K1Yda3
Earnings are expected at the end of April and early May from rail and trucking names such as  Union Pacific  (N:UNP),  Norfolk Southern  (N:NSC) and Genesee & Wyoming (N:GWR) as well as trucking companies Knight-Swift Transportation (N:KNX) and  Heartland Express  (O:HTLD). Each are currently at or below their two-year average forward PE.
Rail Stocks Forward PE: https://reut.rs/2JeJCH8
While these stocks are poised to benefit from continued economic growth, they could also be susceptible to another bout of trade war concerns, even if they are relatively insulated to the global economy. 
A Reuters poll of over 500 economists worldwide showed the global economy will race further ahead this year, expanding at its fastest pace since 2010, but trade protectionism has the potential to derail that momentum. 
""These stocks will see bigger up days and bigger low days but over the long term the fundamentals will lay out,"" said Jim Corridore, equity analyst at CFRA in New York. 
""Of course if the entire economy blows up because of trade wars, that is a risk that has to be thought about, but I just don’t see it happening at this time.""

Lenovo dropped 5 percent in Hong Kong at 10:41 a.m. local time, poised for its worst loss in more than a year. The MSCI China Technology Index slipped 0.9 percent. ZTE shares have been suspended from trading since the U.S. government imposed a seven-year ban on its purchases of crucial American components last week.

Bears are targeting Lenovo in particular amid doubts that a company once regarded as a potential challenger to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). may not be able to revive itself.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. are still in focus but there were suggestions that some geopolitical tensions related to North Korea may continue to ease. On Friday, North Korea’s ruler Kim Jong Un suggested he might be open to suspending nuclear tests.
Investors in Asia are also looking at a solid earning season in the U.S., where more than four-fifths of companies listed on the S&P500 that had reported earnings by Friday beating expectations.
But any cues from the U.S. were not overly optimistic. On Friday, the Dow closed down 0.82%, the S&P 500 lost 0.85% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.27% as technology stocks continued to feel downward pressure.
Some focus Monday was likely to be on technology stocks. On Friday, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took a hit in U.S. trading, falling 4.1%, and last week Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (TWO:5425), Apple’s main chip supplier, slumped as much as 7% after it trimmed its full year revenue target. TSMC’s miss was the big news for investors in Asia on Friday.
Investors were also keeping an eye on a move up in yields of U.S. Treasuries, a move that helped support the U.S. dollar. Yields on 10-Year Treasures inched up on Friday to 2.96%, the highest level since January 2014.
Hong Kong shares are coming off their fourth weekly loss in five weeks. Investors are worried about the prospects for increased trade tension between China and the U.S. Last week, the Hang Seng Index fell 1.3%. The Hang Seng Index was down 0.11% to 30,385 at 9:35PM ET (01:35 GMT).
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up at the opening but was down 0.18%. Data out on Friday showed the core consumer price index rose 0.9% year-on-year in March, a slight slowdown from a 1.0% gain in February but matching economist’s median estimates.
The South Korea Kospi was down 0.24% to 2470.82. Australia’s ASX was up 0.27% at 5884.6.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for a bevy of earnings from the world's largest corporations, while keeping a wary eye on U.S. bond yields as they approach peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past.
Traders were also anxiously awaiting surveys on global manufacturing for April to see if economic softness in the first quarter was just a passing phase linked to poor weather and the Lunar New Year holidays.
The first reading from Japan was tentatively upbeat with its PMI firming to 53.3 in April as output and domestic demand picked up.
On the geopolitical front, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the North Korean nuclear crisis was a long way from being resolved, striking a cautious note a day after the North pledged to end its nuclear tests.
Oil prices edged down in early trade but were not far from their highest since late 2014. The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC's role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied. 
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were off 3 cents at $74.03 per barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) eased 10 cents to $68.30.
In stock markets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.4 percent, with South Korea (KS11) off 0.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) eased 0.3 percent and China blue chips (CSI300) 0.6 percent as tech stocks continued to struggle with a warning on waning demand for mobile phones.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) went the other way to edge up 0.24 percent. FTSE futures (FFIc1) added 0.2 percent.

THE 3 PCT BARRIER
The spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation  and long-term bond yields.
Yields on 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) are at the highest since early 2014 at 2.977 percent and again threatening the hugely important 3 percent bulwark.
The last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding.
""Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,"" said Deutsche Bank's macro strategist, Alan Ruskin.
Traditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said it canceled about 40 flights on Sunday, or 1 percent of those scheduled, as it inspects engines after last week’s deadly accident in Pennsylvania.
The airline said the cancellations were the result of the company’s announcement on Tuesday that it would over the next 30 days begin inspecting other CFM56-7B engines, manufactured by CFM International, the engine involved in last week's accident.  
At the time, Southwest said those inspections would cause some impact on operations, but it has not said how many engines it planned to inspect.
On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration and European airline regulators ordered emergency inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to the one involved in a fatal Southwest engine blowout earlier this week. 
The engine explosion on Southwest Flight 1380 on Tuesday was caused by a fan blade that broke off, the FAA said. The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.
Southwest has declined to answer questions about its CFM56-7B inspection program, including how many engines were inspected prior to the accident and if the engine that failed had been inspected. 
A Southwest flight in August 2016 with a CFM56-7B engine made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. 

After that incident, the European agency gave airlines nine months to check engines. U.S. regulators were still were considering what to do after proposing some checks.

Fresenius agreed last year to buy the U.S. maker of liquid generic drugs for about $4.75 billion, but said in February it could terminate the deal if its own independent probe found Akorn breached U.S. Food and Drug Administration data integrity requirements related to product development.
The German company said on Sunday its investigation had found ""material breaches"" of FDA data integrity requirements relating to Akorn's operations.
""Fresenius offered to delay its decision in order to allow Akorn additional opportunity to complete its own investigation and present any information it wished Fresenius to consider, but Akorn has declined that offer,"" it said in a statement.
A spokesman for Fresenius said Akorn had violated other requirements of the acquisition agreement, including its obligation to operate the business in the ordinary course after signing of the agreement, and it had not given Fresenius reasonable access to company information.
Akorn said it disagreed with Fresenius' accusations and planned to enforce its rights and Fresenius' obligations under the merger agreement.
""The previously disclosed ongoing investigation, which is not a condition to closing, has not found any facts that would result in a material adverse effect on Akorn's business and therefore there is no basis to terminate the transaction,"" it said in a statement. 
Fresenius had hoped the acquisition of Akorn would help it offer a wider choice of drugs to hospitals and pharmacies.
Fresenius confirmed its guidance for adjusted group sales to rise between five and eight percent in constant currencies in 2018, with adjusted net income expected to increase between six and nine percent.
Earlier on Sunday, subsidiary Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) (DE:FMEG), cut its 2018 sales target.

Fresenius is due to report full first quarter results on May 3.

General Mills' earnings growth has stalled, and its $8 billion price tag for Blue Buffalo in February was viewed by some analysts as too ambitious.
Yet the deal could allow the Lucky Charms and Annie's Macaroni and Cheese maker to expand niche brands into mainstream stores, a payoff investors might not fully appreciate, the paper said. 
Its earnings per share should see 7 percent compounded growth in the next four years, Barron's added. 
General Mills announced the deal for Blue Buffalo on Feb. 23, expanding into a $30 billion pet-food market in a move seen as countering low demand for the sugary, preservative-filled items with which it is most often associated.
Blue Buffalo's shares traded just under $40 on Friday.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded General Mills to Baa2 on the announcement of the deal.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines,  Goodyear Tire  & Rubber and Lincoln National Corp may have more upside than their discounted share prices suggest, Barron's reported.
The newspaper reviewed stocks trading at no more than about half the valuation of the Standard & Poor's 500 index - which recently approached 17 times forward earning estimates - and spotlighted those not facing ""obvious threats of structural decline"" or ""hitting cyclical peaks."" 
Delta (N:DAL), which closed at $55.40 per share on Friday, is at 8.6 times earnings, a valuation  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani called ""just too low,"" according to Barron's. 
Lalwani's price target of $72 implies a 30 percent upside for Delta, which faces less competition in key markets than some of its peers, the paper reported.
Goodyear, (O:GT), trading at $27.01, 7.3 times earnings, is benefiting from car makers' shift toward trucks, for which tires are more profitable, and its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to rise at mid-teen percentages the next two years, the paper noted.
Lincoln, (N:LNC), whose earnings depend heavily on annuities models that have seen decline in recent years, closed Friday at $71.58. 
But its EPS is expected to rise 8 to 11 percent this year and each of the following two years, thanks in part to a strong stock market that has increased management fees, and an increased demand for savings products, Barron's reported.

ZTE ""is making active communications with relevant parties and seeking a solution to the U.S. export denial order,"" it added in the statement.

The action was sparked by ZTE's violation of an agreement that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.
ZTE said on Sunday it had set up a compliance management committee led by its chief executive officer.
It also said it had invested in export control compliance, provided compliance training to staff and cooperated with the work of independent compliance monitors, the company added.The U.S. Commerce Department has granted a request from ZTE to submit more evidence after the agency imposed the ban, a senior Commerce official said on Saturday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has granted ZTE Corp's (SZ:000063) (HK:0763) request to submit more evidence after the agency banned American companies from selling to the Chinese technology firm, a senior Commerce official said on Saturday. 
The U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, this week banned American companies from selling to ZTE for seven years, saying the Chinese company had broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements. The action was sparked by ZTE's violation of an agreement that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. 
According to Commerce regulations, there is no appeals process, but the agency has ""exercised discretion"" to let ZTE present additional evidence through an ""informal procedure,"" the senior official said. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the decision by Commerce to allow more evidence.
ZTE, in a statement on Friday, called the initial decision ""unacceptable"" and said it could cause damage to both the company and its partners.
It is unclear whether the decision to accept more evidence would provide a chance for resolution between U.S. regulators and the company. 
This week's U.S. action, first reported by Reuters, could be devastating to ZTE since American companies are estimated to provide 25 to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes networking gear and smartphones.
The ban is the result of ZTE's failure to comply with an agreement with the U.S. government after it pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Texas to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran. 
The company paid $890 million in fines and penalties, with an additional penalty of $300 million that could be imposed. 
As part of the agreement, Shenzhen-based ZTE promised to dismiss four senior employees and discipline 35 others by either reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them, senior Commerce Department officials told Reuters. But the Chinese company admitted in March that while it had fired the four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to the 35 others.
Under terms of the ban, U.S. companies cannot export prohibited goods, such as chip sets, directly to ZTE or via another country, beginning immediately. 
The U.S. action against ZTE is likely to further exacerbate current tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade. After the United States placed export restrictions on ZTE in 2016 for Iran sanctions violations, China’s Ministry of Commerce and Foreign Ministry criticized the decision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A telecommunications standards organization - GSMA - said on Saturday it is delaying implementation of a new cellphone technology due to a U.S. government probe of alleged coordination between the group, AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers.
GSMA said in a statement that the move to a global standard for eSIM technology is ""on hold pending the completion of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice."" 
At issue is a technology that could make carriers' business more volatile. ESIM allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, an identifying microchip. That makes it easier to compare wireless networks and easily select a new service when desired.
""This standard contains a wide range of features, including the option for the eSIM to be locked. In the United States, consumers would have this option; however, they would need to explicitly consent to this under specific commercial agreements with their mobile operator, for example when purchasing a subsidized device,"" GSMA said.
It added that it was cooperating fully with the Department of Justice.
Verizon on Friday called the probe ""much ado about nothing,"" adding it has been working with the Justice Department for several months ""regarding the inquiry,"" according to spokesman Rich Young. AT&T also indicated it was they are working with the Justice Department. 

Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other equipment makers have complained to the Justice Department about wireless carrier practices related to eSIM technology, two sources familiar with the matter said. Apple declined to comment.

ZURICH/MOSCOW - Assets totaling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion have been frozen as a result of sanctions imposed on Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his Renova Group conglomerate, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Saturday.
The United States imposed sanctions against several Russian entities and individuals, including Swiss-based Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and his Renova Group, on April 6 to punish Moscow for suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other alleged ""malign activity.""
As a result of the sanctions, all U.S. dollar bank accounts of companies controlled by Renova have been blocked, the people told Reuters, confirming an earlier report in Swiss paper Finanz und Wirtschaft on Saturday.
Renova declined to comment on the situation.
Ties to Renova have caused difficulties for a number of European firms since the sanctions were announced, with pumpmaker Sulzer (S:SUN) taking a one-off hit from business disruption and agreeing to buy 5 million shares from Renova to free itself from sanctions.
Meanwhile, Italy's Octo Telematics put its IPO on hold and Steelmaker Schmolz & Bickenbach (S:STLN) has faced snags in clearing a bond placement needed to finance a deal. 
Nonetheless, Renova, which is headquartered in Moscow and has a subsidiary in Zurich, intends to maintain its Swiss holdings, which also include a stake in Oerlikon (S:OERL).
Renova and Vekselberg are seeking the help of Swiss authorities in clearing up business matters, the people said, adding that the Swiss government had been instrumental in helping free Sulzer from sanctions.
Salary accounts of several Swiss-based Renova employees had been blocked for a time, the people said, but were once again open after clearing diligence checks.
""European and Swiss banks in particular are excessively cautious,"" one source said. ""Secondary sanctions turn out to be in fact of (a) supra-national character, finding (their) way into countries which are not going to copy U.S. sanctions or do not even agree with them.""

While Ford's decision does not affect all of its accounts with WPP - and the agency will be able to bid for the rest of the business along with everyone else - it comes at a difficult juncture for the world's biggest advertising firm.
Sorrell, who over 33 years built the firm into one of Britain's biggest companies, quit last week as chief executive officer after an allegation of personal misconduct that he denies.
Saturday's announcement is part of a review of Ford's strategy that has lasted since November, when it told long-time partner WPP that it was considering its future ad model.
""We are going to place some portions of our advertising business up for bid with other agencies, including WPP, beginning in the coming weeks. No decisions have been made,"" Ford Britain said in a statement.
It added that WPP is a trusted partner of Ford and that it had offered the agency more detail about its marketing aspirations.
WPP, which counts Ford as a major client, declined to comment.
WPP staff were sent a memo on Friday outlining Ford's decision.
""WPP will have an opportunity to compete with other firms to retain these portions of the business, and will remain Ford's agency of record in some other key areas,"" a copy of the memo seen by Reuters said.
Ford's review of its ad operations does not include accounts with WPP in China, public affairs, U.S. dealerships or WPP's Hudson Rouge agency that handles Ford's luxury Lincoln brand, the memo said.
WPP and its major rivals Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) face challenges on every front, from the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - whom Sorrell famously dubbed ""frenemies"" - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte.

With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups are grappling to become more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up.

However, Deutsche Bank said on Saturday that CEO Christian Sewing's appointment was ""unanimous"", without giving more detail of the proceedings or how votes were cast. 
On April 8, board chairman Paul Achleitner called the bank's 20-member board to a hastily arranged telephone conference to make three major decisions: To vote out former chief executive John Cryan, to vote in Christian Sewing to replace him, and to name two co-deputy CEOs.
In each decision, there were several ""no"" votes cast, the sources said on Friday. Both employee representatives on the board as well as investor representatives on the board cast dissenting votes, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. There were also some abstentions.
In the end, Sewing was chosen as the bank's new CEO, amid frustration over continuing losses at the German lender and a sagging share price.
""Christian Sewing was unanimously appointed chief executive officer,"" the spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank said on Saturday. On Friday, a spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Some shareholders have criticized Achleitner for the rushed nature of the CEO change, the second under his watch.

Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper cited a letter the ECB sent to banks under its supervision and the main auditing firms spelling out its concerns connected to the coming into force of the IFRS9 accounting rule.
The new rule, in place from the start of 2018, forces lenders to book expected, and no longer just incurred, losses. Under a temporary regime, banks can spread over five years the impact of rule's initial application. Also, the impact is only on banks' capital and not their earnings.
The ECB said banks may have postponed booking loan losses to the start of this year in order to benefit from the 'first time adoption' regime, Il Sole reported.
The ECB has also asked auditors to pay special attention to this issue when reviewing banks' 2017 financial statements, the paper added.
The ECB declined to comment.
Il Sole said that Italy's larger lenders ruled out having to revise their 2017 accounts because they believed they had applied the new rule correctly.

In publishing last year's accounts, all main Italian banks have said they would book significant writedowns at the start of 2018 in connection with the coming into force of the IFRS9 rule.

""The unsafe condition,"" the FAA said in the order, ""is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.""
The inspections ordered are a sharp step-up from actions by both the European and U.S. regulators after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. The European agency had given airlines nine months to check engines, while U.S. regulators still were considering what to do.
Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required in the next 20 days, the agencies said on Friday. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.
That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday's Southwest flight would have been affected, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.
The coordinated 20-day measure partially resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world's two largest and most influential aviation regulators, a person familiar with the discussions said and published documents show.
The FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalized the measure by the time of Tuesday's fatal second accident.
The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, matching the FAA's roll-out, saying data did not justify that.
The divergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two agencies, especially on one of the world's most-used aviation products. CFM, which is jointly owned by  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both in the United States and in Europe.
""It happens that there are disagreements about the right way to go in some cases, and this was one of them,"" the person familiar with the discussions said.
On Tuesday, however, when news broke that a second failure had taken place involving the same model engine, aircraft and airline - this time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat - the two agencies agreed to act quickly, the person said.
An FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue. An EASA spokesman declined to comment.
On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of U.S. aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.
The FAA and NTSB have different roles. Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and recommend possible changes to safety rules, while regulators have to assess whether safety risks could appear.
Several major airline officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest.
Southwest, which had opposed efforts by the engine maker last year to shorten the FAA’s earlier proposed deadline, on Friday said its maintenance program meets or exceeds the new requirements.
United Continental Holdings (N:UAL) said that it had begun inspections earlier after a recommendation from CFM. American Airlines (O:AAL) said it does not have any CFM56-7B engines with 30,000 cycles and would not be impacted by the 20-day order. Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said it had begun complying and did not expect any operational impact to customers
Approximately 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are in operation. 
CFM had initially recommended the inspections.
The European order requires that after the first inspection, airlines should keep repeating the process every 3,000 cycles, which typically represents about two years in service.
More than 150 have already been inspected.

Inspections recommended by the end of August will affect an additional 2,500 engines.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>","Canada, Mexico laud NAFTA progress, ministers to reconvene Tuesday","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada and Mexico on Friday said good progress had been made in talks with the United States to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and that ministers would meet again on Tuesday as they push to wrap up a deal.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo struck a positive note after a second day of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to revamp the 24-year-old accord, which underpins some $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.
""We are certainly in a more intense period of the negotiations and we are making good progress,"" Freeland told reporters, saying that officials would stay in Washington over the weekend as the eight-month-old talks continue.
Guajardo, who has often sought to temper optimism for a quick deal, said the ministers would meet again on Tuesday.
""There was a lot of progress made today,"" he said.
The three ministers are pressing for a quick deal to avoid clashing with a July 1 presidential election in Mexico, which would mean overcoming major differences on several U.S. demands.
Canada and Mexico have battled for months with a U.S. push for tougher NAFTA rules on how much North American content vehicles must contain to avoid tariffs, known as rules of origin.
""We continue to work very hard on rules of origin, really the heart of this agreement,"" Freeland said.
U.S. negotiators had initially demanded that North American-built vehicles contain content that is 85 percent made in the NAFTA countries, based on value, up from 62.5 percent at present.
However, auto industry executives said last week that Washington had softened that demand in an effort to move faster toward a deal.
A source familiar with the talks said Canada and Mexico found the U.S. concessions ""really helpful,"" especially a move to back away from proposals that would have made tracking the origin of parts overly complex.
""We have makings of a deal right now. We could accept where they (the Americans) are at,"" said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. 
The source said the three nations were looking at a figure of roughly 75 percent for the NAFTA content of vehicles.
Earlier on Friday, Moises Kalach, a senior representative of the Mexican private sector at the talks, said he believed the sides were perhaps ""a couple of weeks away"" from a deal.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to walk away from NAFTA unless major changes are made, says the pact has created jobs in Mexico at the expense of U.S. workers.

Lighthizer instilled fresh momentum in early March by floating the prospect of a quick deal ""in principle."" Mexican and Canadian officials say only an agreement covering the essential details will be viable.

479,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this quarter
1. Familiar Foes Return to Spook US Equities
As the new quarter of earnings season gathered pace, old foes returned to haunt U.S. equities.
Surging bond yields spooked equity investors as the 10-year treasury yield rose to a nearly four-year high to move within a whisker of 3%. While a slump in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on concerns over a weak iPhone sales also weighed on the broader market.
Canaccord lowered its March and June quarter estimates for iPhone sales to between 48.0 million and 39.4 million from between 53.1 million and 43.7 million, citing the high price of the iPhone X was stifling demand. 
""For the mature North America market, we believe the price point above $1,000 has been a greater deterrent for broad market appeal than anticipated,"" Canaccord said.
In corporate earnings, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) producer a blowout quarter propelling its share price to an all-time high. But the pick of the bunch was  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE) as it topped earnings estimates and surprised investors by maintaining its outlook for the rest of 2018.
The S&P 500 closed roughly unchanged for the week after shedding 0.85% on Friday.
2. Crude Oil Prices Notch Second-Straight Weekly Gain
Crude oil prices ended the week at nearly three-and-a-half year highs on expectations that oil markets are nearing rebalancing after OPEC and its allies compliance rose to the highest ever.
Major oil producers’ commitment to continue slashing oil production reined in excess crude supplies, which stood at just 12 million barrels above the five-year average in March, Reuters reported Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.
Oil prices also had to contend with a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump, blaming OPEC for ""artificially very high"" oil prices, insisting that it would not be accepted. 
On Friday U.S. crude futures posted a second-straight weekly win, settling 9 cents higher at $68.38 a barrel.
3. Dollar Rides Steeper Yield Curve to Weekly Win
The dollar swung to a weekly win from a loss last week against its rivals supported by surging bond yields and a slump in sterling.
The U.S. 10-year treasury yield jumped above a key 2.9% level as traders bet that both inflation would continue to make modest strides, and U.S. economic growth would remain solid.
Investors’ outlook on inflation was also bolstered by the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report released Wednesday, suggesting that consumer inflation was set to gather pace as rising input costs could be passed onto consumers in some U.S. districts.
Momentum in the greenback was also helped by slump in sterling this week as dovish comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney scaled back investor expectations that a May rate hike was a foregone conclusion.
The dollar rose 0.47% to 90.06 against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold’s Glitter Diminishes as Geopolitical Tensions Fade
Gold prices snapped a two-week winning streak Friday as safe-haven demand faded amid easing geopolitical concerns, while continued dollar strength weighed on sentiment.
Falling safe-haven demand comes as U.S. military intervention in Syria was less extensive than some had feared, while improving U.S.-North Korea relations also weighed.
U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he hoped a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would be successful.
Despite the bearish week for gold prices, traders appeared to resumed their bets for an upward move in the precious metal.
CFTC COT data showed money managers increased their net long positions in gold futures to 157,925, up 3,881 lots for the week ended April 17.
5. Crypto Comeback: Bitcoin, XRP, Bitcoin Cash Rally
It could be a bit premature to declare that the rally in bitcoin this week marked the start of a turnaround in cryptocurrencies. But the positive shift in sentiment suggested there was some truth to claims that the end of the U.S. tax season would trigger a crypto rally.
Analysts made bullish calls earlier this week, predicting that the wave of selling in cryptos to fund taxes – following huge crypto profits in 2017 – would grind to a halt, supporting a rebound in cryptocurrencies.
Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital told CNBC on Monday that he expected the downward pressure on crypto prices to abate after tax day, while Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the end of tax-selling pressure would support a rally in bitcoin to $25,000 by the end of 2018.
One of the main positives from this week’s rally appeared to be a willingness from traders to buy the dips in cryptos – something that was absent in recent weeks – pointing to firmer crypto demand.
Crypto investors backed bitcoin after it dipped below $8,000 on Tuesday amid reports the New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into 13 major cryptocurrency exchanges trading cryptocurrencies including bitcoin.
Others, however, said the move lower was isolated to a single large investor, or “whale,” dumping holdings of bitcoin.
That said, however, the uptick in total cryptomarket cap pointed to renewed demand.
The total market cap of cryptocurrencies rose to about $380 billion – at the time of writing – from about $250 billion last week, according to coinmarketcap.com
Bitcoin rose 3.09% to $8,501.6, on the Bitfinex exchange, Ethereum rose to $593.00, up 5.89% and Bitcoin Cash rose 18.16% to $1,119.50. Ripple XRP jumped to $0.92622, up 25.00%, on the Poloniex exchange."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co confirmed Friday it has sent $5,000 checks to passengers aboard a flight that made an emergency landing this week after an engine failed, killing a passenger. 
The airline confirmed news reports from passengers it had sent the checks along with $1,000 travel vouchers. ""We can confirm the communication and gesture are authentic and heartfelt,"" the company said in a brief statement on Friday.
The CFM56 jet engine on Southwest flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York’s LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board. The engine debris shattered a window on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 plane, killing a passenger - the first death in a U.S. airline accident since 2009. The plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.
The Federal Aviation Administration said late on Wednesday it was working to quickly finalize an airworthiness directive within the next two weeks that had been proposed in August 2017 after a similar engine failure in a Southwest plane in 2016, which it said would apply to 220 engines.
National Transportation Safety Board investigators on the scene were expected to wrap up their work in Philadelphia on Saturday, the agency said on Friday.
Southwest said after the incident that it was accelerating its existing engine inspection program ""out of an abundance of caution"" and expected to complete it over the next 30 days.
The company has declined to answer questions about the status of those inspections and whether the engine that failed had previously been inspected or whether the inspections have turned up any evidence of defects or metal fatigue.
The FAA order will require ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of takeoffs. Others more recently serviced will require inspections within 18 months, the FAA draft order said. 

Airlines told the FAA last year that because fan blades may have been repaired and moved to other engines, the order would affect far more than 220 CFM56-7Bs, which are made by a partnership of France’s  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 09:33PM ET</span>","U.S. said to investigate AT&T, Verizon over wireless collusion claim: source","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.
Verizon and AT&T acknowledged the government probe and said they were working with regulators.
At issue is a technology that could make carriers' business more volatile. Called eSIM, it allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, an identifying microchip. That makes it easier to compare wireless networks and easily select a new service when desired.
Verizon called the probe ""much ado about nothing,"" adding that it has been working with the Justice Department for several months ""regarding the inquiry,"" according to spokesman Rich Young.
The New York Times reported on Friday that the Justice Department had opened an investigation about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department.
The Justice Department sent demands to AT&T, Verizon and the GSMA, an industry standards-setting group, on efforts to thwart eSIM. 
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other equipment makers have complained to the Justice Department about wireless carrier practices related to eSIM technology, two sources familiar with the matter said. Apple declined to comment.
""The reality is that we have a difference of opinion with a couple of phone equipment manufacturers regarding the development of e-SIM standards. Nothing more,"" Verizon's Young said.
An AT&T spokesman said in an email: ""Along with other GSMA members, we have provided information to the government in response to their requests and will continue to work proactively within GSMA, including with those who might disagree with the proposed standards.""
News of the probe comes at a critical time for AT&T which is being sued by the Justice Department to stop its deal to buy media company  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX).
The U.S. government has argued in a trial that is nearing completion that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content.
However, Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if AT&T will be allowed to buy Time Warner, is unlikely to consider a report of potential wrongdoing by the wireless giant because it is irrelevant to the merger trial under way in Washington, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. 
The Department of Justice and the GSMA, the telecommunications standard setting group, declined to comment on news of the investigation.
Shares of AT&T and Verizon dipped after the initial Times report, with AT&T closing down 0.4 percent at $34.67, and Verizon ending off 1.1 percent, at $47.90.
The person briefed on the matter told Reuters that other wireless operators potentially received inquiries from the government. 
It is common practice for the Justice Department to send CIDs, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, to all major players in the industry because the agency wants evidence from companies that allegedly participate in any conspiracy as well as those outside of it, according to Ethan Glass, a former trial attorney with the Justice Department now at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP. 
The source said the Obama administration had investigated similar claims in 2016 but did not take any action.
Consumer advocates learned in February that Verizon was apparently planning to lock phones as an anti-theft measure, and later were told by industry participants that Verizon was working with AT&T in hopes of convincing the GSMA to create a standard for locking the phones, according to Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge.
Consumer advocates support the idea of an electronic SIM card, which is in the process of being rolled out, since it allows phone owners to bargain hunt and contract with any network or to shift networks easily while traveling, said Feld.

""I am very happy that the DOJ is taking its job as a cop on the beat very seriously,"" said Feld.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumers may be about to directly feel the effects of the trade fight started by U.S. President Trump with China and other countries this year when a new list of Chinese imports to be taxed is announced in coming days. 
After imposing import tariffs on solar panels and washing machines in January, Trump moved to levy steel and aluminum in March along with about $50 billion in other goods.
After China responded with a list of U.S. goods that would be subject to tariffs, Trump raised the stakes on April 4 by directing the U.S. Trade Representative to consider $100 billion in additional levies.
But a Reuters analysis of Chinese imports shows that to quickly reach $100 billion worth of goods to tax, Trump may have to target cellphones, computers, toys, clothing, footwear, furniture and other consumer goods, prompting price rises at U.S. retailers.
""There is no way to avoid consumer products when you're thinking about how to hit $100 billion worth of imports coming from China,"" said Hun Quach, vice president of international trade for the Retail Industry Leaders Association which represents U.S. retailers.
How much the news tariffs would hit wallets depends on variables that make calculating the impact of the tariffs on individual products hard to measure. Companies can absorb some of the costs, and some companies can shift production in China to other countries, cutting the final bill for America's shoppers.
After washing machines imported by LG Electronics' (KS:066570) were hit with a 20 percent tariff in January, the company raised U.S. prices by about $50 per machine, or 4 percent to 8 percent.
LG opted to absorb part of the tariff cost, which was imposed at a time when construction was already well underway on its new U.S. factory that will begin producing washers in late 2018, avoiding U.S. tariffs.
Companies with complex supply chains, mainly those in high technology industries, can also change how their internal costs are charged among subsidiaries to lower their tariff bill.
Trump's first round of import tariffs deliberately left most consumer electronics untouched, but out of the $506 billion in U.S. imports from China last year, finding another $100 billion to tax without hurting U.S. shoppers will not be easy.
The USTR could quickly find $100 billion but at the cost of targeting three broad categories of consumer electronics - cellphones at $44 billion, computer equipment at $37 billion, and voice, image and data recorders at $22 billion. 
U.S. supply chains would also be hurt as many consumer electronics products depend on the export of American semiconductors, software and other inputs to China for assembly before being imported back to the United States. 
U.S. allies South Korea, Japan and Taiwan also supply cellphone parts for companies like Apple Inc (O:AAPL), including displays, cameras and fingerprint scanners, and would feel the impact.
""You end up shooting yourself in the foot, shooting your allies in the foot, and maybe you wound China’s big toe,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
ORDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PLACED
Trump could get a quarter of the way to $100 billion in goods taxed by levying toys, games and sporting goods, categories with little U.S. content that totaled about $25.5 billion from China in 2017. 
But China made up 81.5 percent of all U.S. imports in this group, meaning that there would be few alternative sources for importers that could blunt the tariff impact on consumers.
Adding in apparel, footwear and furniture to the list would get the rest of the way to $100 billion, but price rises for those categories of goods would be seen clearly by consumers.
According to Census data, there are about 7,600 consumer and industrial goods still available for tariffs with a combined value of $101 billion where China accounts for 40 percent or less of U.S. imports and so could possibly be sourced elsewhere. 
Most of these involve small-scale production and a wide range of goods sold in U.S. chain stores such as Wal-Mart (N:WMT), including clothing, pet food and lighting fixtures.
While the availability of these items in other countries could help limit price rises, there would still be disruptions for retailers with long-established supply chains.
""Sourcing from another country is not an easy solution. It can't happen overnight,"" said RILA's Quach, who added that retailers' Christmas orders for 2018 are already locked in.
And there are few alternatives for the $402 million in Christmas tree lights that China supplies. 
Economists earlier surveyed by Reuters warned that, while imposing tariffs may benefit U.S. steel and aluminum producers, costs would rise for many other U.S. producers and consumers as a result.
U.S. exporters will also feel the impact of the trade war after China responded in March by announcing tariffs on 128 products such as fruit and wine which the U.S exports to China and which will taxed at 15 percent. Another $50 billion worth of U.S. exports such as automobiles, airplanes, pork and soybean face a 25 percent tariff.
During the 2016 election campaign Trump argued that tariffs were needed to punish China for misappropriating U.S. technology and to bring jobs and industry back to the U.S., but studies of the 2002 steel tariffs enacted by the Bush administration show that they caused more job losses than job gains.

The terminal is part of COSCO's planned $6.3 billion deal to buy shipping firm Orient Overseas International Ltd (OOIL) (HK:0316), the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
COSCO executives met with officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) this week and proposed to divest or carve out the Long Beach terminal to ease U.S. concerns about the deal, the report said.
A spokesperson for the Treasury Department, which oversees CFIUS reviews, did not immediately reply to Reuters' request for comment.

The planned acquisition of Orient Overseas Container Line, OOIL's main subsidiary, is on track to be completed by the end of June, COSCO Vice Chairman Huang Xiaowen said earlier this month.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. technology stocks tumbled on Friday ahead of a crucial week of quarterly reports from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other heavyweights as investors worried that the high-performance sector may be running out of fuel.
Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) both lost more than 1 percent, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled 4 percent because of worries about slower-than-expected iPhone demand. 
When Alphabet and Facebook report next week, investors will be anxious for new details about how they may be affected by calls for increased government regulation following reports on March 17 that Facebook improperly shared personal information about its users with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. 
A European law taking effect in May will allow European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent, affecting Alphabet, Facebook and other major technology firms. 
Shares of Facebook, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet - which in recent years propelled Wall Street's gains - in recent months have splintered in different directions. 
Amazon.com has rallied 31 percent in 2018, while Netflix has soared 73 percent. Portfolio mainstays Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, are both down year to date, while Alphabet's 2.4 percent return is only a little higher than the S&P 500's flat performance.

""Investor sentiment with tech stocks is in a long, slow retreat,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Hurting Apple,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Katy Huberty in a note to clients cut her estimates for iPhone shipments in the March and June quarters due to weakness in China. Huberty trimmed her Apple price target to $200 from $203, compared with Friday's $166 level.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 information technology companies to grow their earnings per share by nearly 24 percent, which is better than the 20 percent growth estimated across the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
But the high bar suggests that failure to deliver on those expectations may exacerbate recent market worries about high valuations, damage from a trade war with China and expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates. 
The S&P 500 information technology index is trading at about 18 times expected earnings, down from nearly 20 in late January but still above its 15-year average of 17, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.
After the bell on Monday, Alphabet is expected by analysts on average to report a 22 percent increase in revenue to $30.3 billion, with net income rising 21 percent, equivalent to $9.28 per share on a non-GAAP basis, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Analysts expect Facebook to post a 42 percent surge in quarterly revenue, to $11.4 billion, when it reports late on Wednesday. Its stock has lost 10 percent since the revelations about Cambridge, underscoring investors' concerns about regulation that could crimp the leading social network's profitability.
Amazon late on Thursday is expected to report a 40 percent jump in revenue to $50 billion as the online retailer continues its expansion into cloud computing and brick-and-mortar groceries. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos may face questions from analysts about how Amazon might react to U.S. President Donald Trump's allegations that the company enjoys unfair business advantages, including its use of United States Postal Service.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Whistleblowers may be given greater protection from reprisals when exposing fraud, tax evasion, data breaches and other misdeeds, under new rules proposed by the European Commission.
Whistleblowing has become an increasingly hot topic since two former accounting firm employees were prosecuted in 2016 for leaking data about Luxembourg's tax deals with large corporations in the so-called ""LuxLeaks"" affair. The conviction of one was overturned by Luxembourg's highest court this year.
Under the Commission's proposed rules, both private and public companies would be required to set up internal reporting channels and do follow-up reports, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
Such channels will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the whistleblower's identity. 
The proposal would also oblige employers or authorities to prove that any lawsuits they bring are not a retaliation against the informers.
The draft says exposing wrongdoing, whether corruption, tax avoidance or public procurement, could save the bloc billions of euros.
The level of protection currently given to whistleblowers varies among the 28 EU countries, with Ireland for example considered to have good laws in place while Cyprus does not have any, according to Transparency International EU.
The proposal, which the Commission will unveil on Monday, will need approval from EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financially beleaguered Illinois will come back to the U.S. municipal bond market with an offering rated one or two notches above ""junk"" grade in the most notable of more than $8 billion in debt offerings scheduled for next week.
The two-part competitive general obligation debt sale slated for Wednesday consists of $450 million of bonds with serial maturities in 2019 through 2043 and $50 million of bonds due in 2019 through 2028.
As the lowest-rated state, Illinois has had to pay a hefty penalty to sell debt to investors worried about its ongoing financial and political problems.
The state's so-called credit spread over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield scale for 10-year bonds has widened from 177 basis points in January to 210 basis points on Thursday. 
(GRAPHIC: Illinois 10-year GO yield spread over MMD benchmark - http://reut.rs/2JXIf0B) 
""Judging by the way the bonds are trading recently, the market is once again concerned about the state's ability to pass a budget,"" said Triet Nguyen, head of municipal credit at Triangle Park Capital Markets Data.
An impasse between Illinois' Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left the state without complete budgets for an unprecedented two fiscal years. Lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Governor Bruce Rauner's vetoes in July.
Legislators have since begun work on a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
The state was the fourth-biggest issuer of debt in the muni market last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. It sold $6 billion of GO bonds in October to pay overdue bills and $750 million of GO bonds in November to fund capital projects. 
Including Illinois, there is a total of $7.78 billion of bonds and $262.3 million of notes scheduled to hit the market next week.
In the week's largest deal, the New York Transportation Development Corporation is set to issue $1.4 billion in negotiated special facility revenue bonds to help finance renovations at LaGuardia Airport. The redesign project is being led by Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
New York's bonds were given a Baa3 rating by Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB rating by Fitch Ratings. 
Citi Group is scheduled to price the deal on Tuesday.
U.S. municipal bond funds reported $515.2 million of net outflows in the week ended April 18, marking a third-straight week of negative flows, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper division. 
April outflows are typically attributed to investors cashing in muni investments to pay their taxes.

MONTREAL/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canada's biggest rail union said no progress had been made in negotiations on Friday with  Canadian Pacific Railway  Ltd (TO:CP) to reach a deal before a Saturday deadline as worries about a potential strike weighed on the country's crude oil prices.
If the two sides fail to reach a deal, a strike that would begin on April 21 would be the union's third in six years. Management and union workers are grappling over issues such as schedules to reduce fatigue management, the union said. This would add hurdles for shipments of potash, crude oil and grains as demand soars for already congested rail service at CP and its larger rival Canadian National Railway (TO:CNR).
Chris Monette, spokesman for the union, Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, said ""negotiations have not progressed at all."" The union represents about 3,000 CP locomotive engineers and conductors. A second union representing about 360 railroad rail signals staff at Canada's second-largest railroad also plans to walk off the job.
A CP spokesman was not immediately available for comment but the company said on April 18 it would continue to bargain in good faith and remained committed to achieving a win-win solution.
Some analysts said Canada's federal government would likely legislate strikers back to work.
""I believe that if a strike were to happen, it will probably be short lived because so many commercial interests will be affected,"" wrote Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman by email. 
Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, settled at $21 below the West Texas Intermediate on Thursday in thin trade, well above Monday's settle of $14.40. 
Canadian oil prices trade at a discount to the U.S. benchmark and the heavy discount is expected to persist for the foreseeable future, as rising production in Alberta's oil sands outstrips shipping capacity, with the rail uncertainty adding pressure to an industry already hurt by pipeline constraints.
""It is another factor that illustrates the fragility of our export capacity at a time we are still working through supply overhang,"" said Tim Pickering, president of Auspice Capital.
On Thursday, Canadian Labour Minister Patty Hajdu said she expected all parties to stay at the table until a deal was reached.
Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, said the grain sector already has a backlog of 6,058 railcar orders for CP to fill. 

""Even a stoppage of two or three days will create a loss in capacity that cannot be afforded,"" he said by email.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia's foreign minister said on Friday that Dubai state-owned port operator DP World (DI:DPW) should reconsider its contract with the breakaway region of Somaliland and work with federal authorities so Somalia's sovereignty is not violated.
""We are asking DP World to reconsider these agreements,particularly the one in Berbera port since Somaliland is claiming to be a state independent from Somalia,"" Ahmed Isse Awad, Somalia's foreign minister, told Reuters in an interview.
He said DP World's agreement to develop an economic zone and port in Somaliland's Berbera ""bypassed the legitimate authority"" of Somalia, triggering ""misunderstanding and disagreement"" that remained unresolved. 
Somaliland's Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the deal was not up for discussion.
""The government of Somalila has nothing to do with this agreement,"" Ambassador Bashe Awil Omar told Reuters by phone.
Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 and has acted as a de-facto state since then but is not internationally recognized. The UAE's Dubai government owns DP World.
A DP World spokesman told Reuters that construction in Somaliland and Puntland, another semi-autonomous region of Somalia where a Dubai state-owned company has a separate deal to manage a port, was on schedule and that work would start soon.
""Both Puntland and Somaliland have urged DP World to expedite construction,"" the spokesman said. Puntland officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
The comments come amid a diplomatic row between the volatile Horn of Africa nation and the UAE. 
Somalia and the UAE have separately said a UAE military training program in Somalia has ended following the seizure of millions of dollars from a UAE plane at Mogadishu airport earlier this month.
The spat is related to the port issue but has escalated amid an increasingly troubled relationship between Gulf states - divided by their own disputes - and fractured Somalia, whose coastline sits close to key shipping routes and across the water from Yemen.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have strong trading links with and influence in Somalia, but that is offset by the sway of Qatar and its ally Turkey, one of Somalia's biggest foreign investors.
Analysts have said the dispute in the Gulf that erupted last year between Qatar and Turkey on the one hand and Saudi Arabia and the UAE on the other risks exacerbating an already explosive security situation on both sides of the Gulf of Aden.
Against this backdrop, Somalia's parliament unanimously passed a resolution last month saying DP World's contract with Somaliland was null and void because it was agreed with authorities in the breakaway region, not with the federal government. 
Somaliland President Muse Bihi Abdi has said the vote will have no impact on the DP World deal which includes the government of Ethiopia.
Its small port of Berbera exports camels to the Middle East and imports food and other items. But DP World's deal to expand the port is one of many investments the UAE government has made in Somaliland, from agreeing to train police and military to establishing a military base.
Awad said the federal government wanted DP World to engage with Mogadishu, instead of Somaliland authorities.
""After that, Somalia welcomes any investment in any  part of Somalia including Berbera,"" he said. 
He added this policy applied to any deals by foreign countries or government's with Somalia's federal member states, which include Puntland. 
The minister denied claims by UAE authorities that they had signed the Berbera port deal with a previous Somali government, saying no evidence had been produced.
He said he thought relations with the Gulf state would normalize, without giving details, and said Mogadishu wanted to enter ""serious, open and friendly"" discussion to resolve misunderstandings.

509,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>","U.S. biotech companies Alnylam, Dicerna settle trade secrets case","By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Friday that Dicerna Pharmaceuticals Inc will pay it $25 million in cash and stock to resolve a lawsuit claiming it stole trade secrets about gene-silencing technology used to develop drug treatments.
The settlement between the two biotech companies resolves a lawsuit that Alnylam filed against Dicerna in 2015. The accord came ahead of a jury trial that was set to begin on Monday in state court in Woburn, Massachusetts.
Under the agreement, Dicerna said it will pay Alnylam $2 million up-front plus 983,208 shares of its common stock.
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Dicerna said it will also pay Alnylam another $13 million over the next four years, the timing of which is dependent on revenue Dicerna receives pursuant to future RNAi technology-based partnerships under its GalXC brand.
Alnylam, also Cambridge-based, in a statement said the deal would also place certain restrictions on Dicerna. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.
Dicerna's stock was trading at $13.20 midday on Friday, up 29.12 percent. Shares in Alnylam were trading at $97.59, up 1.46 percent.
Alnylam's lawsuit accused Dicerna of misappropriating confidential information related to RNAi technology Alnylam acquired when in 2014 when it bought a Merck (NYSE:MRK) & Co Inc subsidiary in a deal it valued in court papers at $325 million.
RNAi, or RNA interference, prevents a defective gene from making disease-causing proteins.
The lawsuit said Dicerna, which unsuccessfully tried to acquire RNAi assets from Merck, used confidential information it reviewed while considering the potential transaction in violation of a confidentiality agreement.
Alnylam contended Dicerna also hired several Merck scientists who had been involved in developing the technologies its rival acquired as part of an intentional scheme to gain access to trade secrets and confidential information.
Alnylam in court papers filed in Middlesex County Superior Court said the scheme allowed Dicerna to develop ""strikingly similar"" technologies within a year and unjustly enriched the company by up to $325 million.
Dicerna denied the allegations. It filed a counterclaim alleging Alnylam was pursuing a frivolous lawsuit that improperly interfered with its funding sources and partnership opportunities in order to crush its smaller competitor.
Dicerna sought $42.2 million in damages. It also filed a related federal antitrust case against Alnylam, which is also being settled.

Jes Staley (L:BARC) escaped with a fine on Friday after a year-long investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority into his conduct.
Staley had twice tried to find out who wrote a letter raising ""concerns of a personal nature"" about an unnamed senior employee at Barclays.
""I probably wouldn't bother now,"" said Paul Moore, who blew the whistle on Lloyds Banking Group's (L:LLOY) ill-fated takeover of troubled rival HBOS in 2008. ""It gives a very clear signal to whistleblowers not to bother.""
The investigation of Staley was considered the first big test of the ""senior managers regime"", set up to hold top bankers accountable after few were punished for their roles in bank collapses during the financial crisis, and initiatives to encourage and protect whistleblowers. 
""Whistleblowers around the financial services sector, I'm sure, would have been watching this and making a decision as to whether or not they feel safe and protected, and able therefore to make their disclosures,"" said Georgina Halford-Hall, chief executive of Whistleblowers UK. 
She added that she feared the outcome would deter them from speaking out. 
A spokesman for the FCA, which opened 900 whistleblowing cases in 2016-17, down from 1,340 in 2014, said: ""The FCA has in recent years taken a number of steps to encourage whistle-blowers to come forward to the organization, including increasing the resources dedicated to the area.""
Julianna Tolan, a barrister at law firm Fox Williams, said the high-profile enforcement action against Staley represented a ""rare moment"". It was the first time a sitting chief executive of a major bank has been fined by regulators. 
But, she said, ""If the regulators are looking to use this as a warning shot about the gravity of whistleblower protection, this proposed action doesn't really achieve that.""
""The message it sends is a disappointing one,"" said Mary Inman, whistleblower partner at law firm Constantine Cannon who has spent years representing whistleblowers. 
""To whistleblowers, I think it is showing that the FCA isn't as serious about protecting their anonymity as they should be.""

512,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 01:19PM ET</span>",EU suspects tax fraud at China's new gateway to Europe,"By Angus Berwick and Renee Maltezou
MADRID/ATHENS (Reuters) - European Union and Italian authorities are investigating suspected wide-scale tax fraud by Chinese criminal gangs importing goods via Greece's largest port of Piraeus, a trade gateway between China and Europe, officials said.
""The VAT is completely evaded, with enormous damage to the national tax authorities and to the community,"" Fabio Botto, of the Italian Central Anti-fraud Office's special investigative unit, said in an interview.
He said the suspected scam at Piraeus, part of China's vast Belt and Road infrastructure project, had cost Italy tens of millions of euros in unpaid value-added taxes (VAT), though the total could be far higher as the investigation was not over.
The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirmed it was working with Italy on the investigation but declined to give details, citing confidentiality.
Botto said his agency had evidence that Chinese-owned firms run by the criminal groups were fraudulently avoiding import duties and VAT on large shipments of goods through Piraeus.
The groups import goods, often counterfeit clothing and footwear, and massively understate their value to EU customs to avoid import duties, he said. They also lie about the firms that receive the goods, enabling them to avoid VAT.
Greece's Financial Crime Unit is conducting a separate investigation into a suspected tax fraud case involving Chinese goods imported via Pireaus. The Greek unit has had little contact with Italian and EU authorities and has not been informed about the wider investigation, an official there said.
China's state-owned COSCO Shipping (SS:601919) (HK:1919) has majority-owned Piraeus since 2016.
China wants to transform the port into its ""gateway to Europe"" under the $126 billion Belt and Road initiative, which envisions a new ""Silk Road"" of land and sea routes with trading partners.
Botto and the Greek official said neither investigation had evidence of any wrongdoing by Piraeus port authorities. COSCO owns a majority stake in the  Piraeus Port  Authority (PPA) (AT:OLPr), which manages one container terminal, and a wholly-owned COSCO subsidiary owns and manages two other terminals.
COSCO said: ""The company has in its global operations consistently and strictly followed local and international laws, and persevered to operate legally and compliantly"".
PPA said it had not received any information about criminal groups using the port and it would alert authorities if it did. It said it took all necessary measures to ensure that goods had customs supervision. 
""(PPA) is under no circumstances responsible for conducting checks for illegal activities,"" PPA said in a statement.
OLAF and national authorities in recent years have clamped down on customs loopholes used by Chinese smugglers, whose tax scams they estimate cost the EU billions of euros a year.
Italy began investigating the Piraeus case in late 2017 after seizing falsified invoices at customs offices, Botto said. Reuters has not seen this evidence and Botto declined to name the suspect firms as the investigation is ongoing.
Piraeus has become a major new entry point, Botto said, as northern ports have tightened controls and Piraeus's import capacity has leapt six-fold under COSCO.
""We are investigating the new routes developing with the Belt and Road project. Currently the predominantly beaten path appears to be through Piraeus,"" he said.

The company, which had faced intense criticism and political scrutiny over price hikes for its life-saving EpiPen emergency allergy treatment, said the Morgantown plant ""needed to be rightsized to be less complex"" for continued operations.
The layoffs involved more than 400 employees represented by a United Steel Workers local union, reported WAJR, a Morgantown radio station.
Mylan said the affected employees were primarily in operations. It said it continues to employ about 3,000 people in West Virginia.
""We remain committed to a U.S. manufacturing base and plan to continue making the majority of the medicines we supply to the U.S in the U.S.,"" Mylan said in a statement. 
Generic drugmakers have seen profits shrink due to intensifying pricing pressure on the low-cost pharmaceuticals.
Mylan's bottom line has also been hit by its decision to sell a generic EpiPen for about half the price of the branded product in response to public outrage in 2016. Consumers saw the price for a pack of two auto-injectors rise sixfold to $600 in less than a decade, making them unaffordable for a growing number of families.
The Morgantown plant is not involved in EpiPen production. EpiPens are manufactured for Mylan by  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) at a plant in St. Louis, which has experienced production problems that have led to shortages in some international markets, including Canada and Britain.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) could seal a deal to buy a more than 51 percent stake in Indian online marketplace Flipkart as early as next week, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The U.S. retail giant has been in talks with Flipkart for months to acquire a controlling stake in the firm as it looks to take on rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) head-on in India, a market where e-commerce is tipped to grow to $200 billion in a decade.
SoftBank Group, which owns about a fifth of Flipkart through its Vision Fund, was unwilling to sell a part of its stake as Walmart was offering to buy existing shares at a valuation of $12 billion, a price the Japanese tech investor considered low, Reuters had previously reported.
But that stalemate between SoftBank and Walmart has ended, one of the sources told Reuters on Friday. It was not immediately clear though, whether SoftBank had agreed to sell some of its shares in Flipkart.
Walmart's purchase of new equity is likely to value Flipkart at at least $18 billion.
Reuters reported this month that Walmart completed its due diligence on Flipkart and had made a proposal to buy 51 percent or more of the Indian company for between $10 billion to $12 billion.
A third source said a deal was close, but things could still drag into the first week of May.
Some of Flipkart's main investors - U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, South African tech investor Naspers and venture capital firm Accel - are likely to take a full exit as Walmart purchases their shares, sources have previously told Reuters.
Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, former Amazon employees who founded Flipkart in 2007 in India's tech hub of Bengaluru, are also likely to part sell their stake as part of the deal, one of the sources said.
All sources declined to be named as the talks are not public.
Flipkart, SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while a representative for Walmart in India declined comment.

SoftBank and Tiger Global own little more than 20 percent each of Flipkart, Naspers holds nearly 13 percent stake, Accel 6.4 percent, while the Bansals own just over 5 percent each of the company, according to data from business intelligence platform paper.vc.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 03:05PM ET</span>",Low profile hedge funds post high returns in year after New York Sohn conference,"By David Randall and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One of the year's most popular events for fund managers, the Sohn Investment Conference, will be held in New York on Monday, but if history is any guide, some of the industry's lower-profile managers will probably provide the most profitable ideas.  
The best ideas of some press-shy hedge fund managers who spoke at the 2017 New York Sohn Investment Conference outperformed those of celebrity managers such as Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, according to a Reuters analysis. 
Josh Resnick, founder of New York-based Jericho Capital Asset Management, had the best overall investment idea of the 11 featured investors who spoke last year. His, short, or bet against,  Frontier Communications Corp  (NASDAQ:FTR) gained 61 percent since it was announced on May 8 of last year. 
Larry Robbins, the billionaire manager of Glenview Capital Management, had the next-best performance, with approximately 33 percent gains in his bullish position in DXC Technology Co.
The 2018 Sohn conference, which will take place at the David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center, will include presentations by Glen Kacher of Light Street, Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital and Li Ran of Half Sky Capital. 
Returns from picks of higher-profile investors at Sohn last year were mixed and Einhorn’s Greenlight is among those nursing heavy losses. 
Einhorn, who came to fame after his call to short Lehman Brothers before the 2008 financial crisis, last year recommended shorting Core Laboratories NV, a losing position as the stock gained 7.3 percent between May 8 and Thursday. 
In the first quarter alone, Greenlight was down 14 percent, Einhorn wrote in a letter to clients dated April 3. Through a spokesman, Greenlight declined to comment for this story. 
Hedge fund managers, unlike many mutual fund managers, can bet a stock will fall and thus promise to make money in tumbling markets, but that strategy has not worked well for a variety of managers this year even though the U.S stock market has suffered from fears of central bank interest rate rises and the fallout of the imposition of import tariffs by President Trump.
Last year, Bill Ackman, a long-time supporter of the conference, pitched real estate company Howard Hughes Corporation, which he’s owned for some time. In 2017, the pick was a winner for his $8 billion Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management but Ackman's firm still lost money. The stock climbed 11 percent in the last 52 weeks. Ackman will not be presenting this year.
John Khoury, who runs $2.7 billion Long Pond Capital, will be back at the Sohn conference this year after having pitched Hyatt Hotels Corp in 2016. In the last 52 weeks the stock price has climbed 42 percent. 
As hedge fund returns have stalled in the past year, investors have protested by pulling cash out. At the same time, some are giving smaller fund managers a chance, given academic research that smaller firms often outperform their bigger rivals.
""It's hard to attract money and run a long-short fund when the broad market is going up 20 percent a year,"" said Ken Heinz, president of hedge fund tracker Hedge Fund Research. 
DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach, known as the ""Bond King,"" recommended going long emerging market stocks and shorting the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index and enhancing the return through leverage. Including borrowing costs, the trade returned over 13 percent through Thursday. ""This is a good result and a great risk-adjusted result given the low risk nature of pair trades,"" Gundlach told Reuters. The broad S&P 500 index gained approximately 12.2 percent before dividends over the same time. 
Resnick, who presented last year's best performing idea, will not be among those presenting. The firm released a March 12 public letter calling on VMWare Inc to end talks with Dell Technologies over a potential reverse merger, arguing that it would ""likely lead to a significant destruction of shareholder value.""

Shares of VMWare are up 11.4 percent for the week after reports that Dell may be close to walking away from talks amid concerns that the merger plan would prompt in-demand employees to defect to rivals that were not saddled with Dell's legacy hardware business.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 07:46PM ET</span>",Trade tensions set for brighter U.S. corporate spotlight,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The potential for an intensifying trade dispute to undercut the U.S. stock market could become clearer next week when a host of multinational companies reports quarterly results that may provide a glimpse into the impact of those global tensions.
A broad trade war scaled up a list of worries for Corporate America and equity investors after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs last month on imports of steel and aluminum. His comments and posts on Twitter about unfair behavior by U.S. trade partners have rattled the market, which has pulled back from record highs early this year.
China has responded with tariffs of its own, leading to fears about a full-blown trade war and injecting fresh volatility into a stock market that has been more jittery over the past two months.
Of 25 U.S. companies seen by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) as most exposed to a trade war, more than half will report their results in the coming week. They include Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co on Monday, 3M Co and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc on Tuesday, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Wednesday,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) on Thursday and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) on Friday.
Overall, more than 180 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index are due to report results next week. Some companies have already weighed in on trade tensions in the early stages of earnings season.
""Management has to walk a fine line between flapping their arms and lobbying against tariffs, and presenting themselves as vulnerable to tariffs,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago.
Of particular concern will be executives' views about their exposure to China, the world's No. 2 economy and an important market for many U.S. companies. 
“I’d like to know if things do deteriorate with China, how much it would affect them,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise in Boston.
Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of equities at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management in San Francisco, said he expects companies to start discussing how they may alter their budget for capital expenditure ""depending on the outlook of policies related to trade.""
Company comments about tariffs and trade could blemish what is expected otherwise to be a stellar earnings season, which includes the first full quarter with the recently passed U.S. corporate tax cuts. With 87 companies having reported so far, S&P 500 profits in the first quarter are expected to have increased a whopping 20 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
With investors focused on earnings, the S&P 500 was set to rise by almost 1 percent for the week, but the benchmark index is little changed from where it ended 2017.
Trade tensions cast a shadow on an otherwise rosy report about U.S. economic growth from the U.S. Federal Reserve this week.
In the latest ""Beige Book,"" the Fed's periodic summary of contacts with businesses, the words ""tariff"" or ""tariffs"" were mentioned 36 times, compared to zero mentions in the March 7 Beige Book.
""Contacts in various sectors including manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation expressed concern about the newly imposed and/or proposed tariffs,"" according to the report, which covered the period from March to early April.
Martin Anstice, the chief executive of Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), said this week that the chip equipment maker had yet to see an impact on its business from tariffs, but was watching for any dampening of consumer confidence or changes to domestic equipment company agendas.
""If things got a little bit tit-for-tat, then there are obviously risks at a minimum that we need to be attentive to,"" Anstice told analysts on a conference call.
Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek called the China tariffs ""a fluid situation"", and that the diversified industrial manufacturer was assessing its exposure ""while also actively developing mitigation plans."" 
Any trade war would erode economic growth and affect its business, said Hamid Moghadam, CEO of Prologis Inc, a real estate company specializing in warehouses, but he added that ""I don't think we're quite there yet.""

""All of our customers that I'm aware of have basically had their head down doing their business and not paying too much attention to what comes out in the tweets in the morning until there's something specific they can react to,"" Moghadam said on his company's call.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",HSBC bosses grilled on bank's gender pay gap and diversity,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Staff and investors in HSBC (L:HSBA) questioned its new bosses on Friday over how they will improve gender balance and ethnic diversity in senior management at a bank that only weeks ago reported the biggest gender pay gap among big British companies.
Mark Tucker, the bank's new chairman, and new chief executive John Flint faced questions from their own employees at the bank's annual general meeting (AGM) in London over why so few women and people of color are in its senior ranks.
""I want to know specifically what HSBC is going to do to get people like myself sitting there [on the bank's board], I want to come to this AGM and see a reflection of myself sitting there,"" said Ololade Durodola, a black woman who works in HSBC's retail banking division.
Flint replied that the bank has committed to a target of increasing the ratio of women in senior management roles to 30 percent by 2020, from 26.5 percent today, but that it needs to do more on both diversity and gender balance.
""Until our senior leadership is representative of the people we are serving, we are running a business risk,"" Flint said.
At board level, five of the HSBC's 14 directors are women after the bank reduced the board from 17 members on Friday as part of efforts by Tucker to reduce bureaucracy and speed up decision-making.
Europe's biggest bank also faced questions on its funding of coal power plants in Asia after it unveiled a new energy policy on Friday that involves phasing out funding for fossil fuels.
Shareolders queried HSBC on an exception it has made for coal-fired power plants in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, which the bank said is a sensible short-term exception given the lack of alternative power sources in some parts of those countries.
HSBC last month revealed it has a gender pay gap of 59 percent, the largest among British companies with more than 250 employees and caused by the lack of women in senior, better-paid roles.
CEO Flint told reporters on the sidelines of the AGM that the bank has taken measures including a requirement for hiring shortlists to be gender-balanced but said the bank would stop short of choosing women for senior jobs because of their gender.
""We have to create an environment where women can fulfil their potential, but if we start trying to put women into roles because they are women, we undermine this agenda,"" Flint said.
Durodola told Reuters after the meeting that she had confidence that Flint would try to tackle the problems of gender and ethnic balance in HSBC's senior ranks but said she did not expect the problem to be fixed quickly.
""There's no Indian person, no African-American, no Afro-Caribbean on that board,"" she said.
""We need to look at diversity together. Flint's been through the system, he's been groomed with HSBC values so hopefully he's a man of his word,"" she said.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",German prosecutors may widen Bosch emissions probe,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors may widen an investigation into auto supplier Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] over its suspected involvement in emissions test cheating to include dealings with  Fiat  (MI:FCHA), Ford (N:F), General Motors (N:GM) and Hyundai (KS:005380), according to the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office.
German weekly der Spiegel reported on Friday that the prosecutors suspect Bosch supplied those carmakers with illicit emissions control software.
The prosecutor's office confirmed it had launched preliminary inquiries in connection with Bosch and the four carmakers, but did not provide details.
It has not launched any formal investigations on the matter, a spokesman for the office said.
The prosecutor's office launched an investigation over Bosch's emissions dealings with Volkswagen (VW) (DE:VOWG_p) in 2015, when VW's diesel test-cheating scandal in the United States broke. 
It later started separate probes in relation to its suspected involvement in alleged emissions irregularities at  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), VW's premium unit Audi and Chyrsler.
Bosch said it could not comment on the details of the investigations. 

""We are taking accusations that diesel software was manipulated very seriously,"" the company said in a statement, adding it was cooperating fully with the relevant authorities.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's Transport Commissioner Mike Brown met Uber [UBER.UL]boss Dara Khosrowshahi in January, a freedom of information request revealed, as the Silicon Valley app fights to keep its cars on the streets of its most important European market. 
Uber is battling a decision by the city's transport regulator last September to strip it of its license after it was deemed unfit to run a taxi service, a ruling Uber is appealing.
Since then Uber has made a series of changes to its business model, responding to requests from regulators, including the introduction of 24/7 telephone support and the proactive reporting of serious incidents to London's police.
Khosrowshahi flew to London in October for discussions with Brown after which Uber promised to make things right in the British capital city. 
The pair had a second meeting in London in January, according to a response to a freedom of information request from Reuters.
""The Commissioner met with Dara Khosrowshahi on 3 October 2017 and 15 January 2018, both meetings took place in London,"" Transport for London (TfL) said. 
A TfL spokesman declined to provide an immediate comment on what was discussed at the meeting. Uber declined to comment. 
Reuters had asked for a list of every meeting which had taken place between Uber and TfL's private hire team and/or Brown since Sept. 22 but TfL declined to release such details.
""We are not obliged to supply the remainder of the information requested in relation to meetings as it ... relates to information where disclosure would be likely to prejudice the exercise by any public authority of its functions ..,"" it said.

A court hearing over Uber's appeal is due this month before the substance of the appeal is heard in June.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Global Economy: Is it just a cold, or something more serious?","By Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Is it just a cold or something more serious?
That's the question investors hope will be answered in the coming week by a policy update from the European Central Bank, fresh euro zone and U.S. economic data, and earnings reports from some of the world's largest technology firms.
Cold weather in the first quarter is among temporary factors blamed for a spell of poor economic readings from Europe and the United States, with some analysts already betting on a rebound in the summer.
But some fear this minor ailment will develop into something more serious if any of a number of looming risks, ranging from a trade war between the United States and China to a widening of the Syrian conflict, comes to pass.
ECB President Mario Draghi is expected to underscore these concerns when he speaks on Thursday after a policy meeting which is forecast to leave unchanged the ECB's plans for a gradual exit from its aggressive monetary stimulus.
""The soft patch should only strengthen the case for gradualism which ECB officials have been building since the start of the year,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management.
The ECB is expected to wind down its 2.55 trillion euro bond-buying program by the end of the year but some economists have been pushing out their expectations for a rate hike to the second half of 2019 after the recent soft data.
The odds on a rate hike by the Bank of England in May have also lengthened after a sharper-than-expected slowdown in inflation in the first three months of 2018.
Ironically, one of the few prices that Draghi and his peers at major central banks might like to stay low -- that of oil -- has risen to a 3-1/2 year high this week as producer nations continue to drain inventories.
This makes fuel prices more expensive for importing countries, eating into consumers' and companies' spending power.
U.S. President Donald Trump was quick to react to the surge in the price of crude, saying on Friday the oil output reductions would not be tolerated.
TRADE WAR
It was the latest in a series of threats and protectionist moves by the U.S. administration -- primarily aimed at China -- that have kept entrepreneurs, investors and consumers on edge for the past year.
Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and most recently banned U.S. companies from selling parts to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE (SZ:000063) for seven years.
China announced hefty anti-dumping tariffs on imports of U.S. sorghum and measures on synthetic rubber imports from the United States, European Union and Singapore.
""When investors do not know under what terms they will be trading, when they don't know how to organize their supply chain, they are reluctant to invest,"" Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said on Thursday.
Consumer spending is also showing early signs of faltering, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TW:2330) citing softer demand for smartphones when cutting its revenue forecasts.
Investors will be looking for further evidence that the economic cycle is turning down when Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google's Alphabet (O:GOOGL) report their earnings in the week.
Trump will play host to French president Emmanuel Macron during a three-day state visit that starts on Monday before meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday.

The leaders are expected to discuss the situation in Syria -- where the United States, Britain and France launched missile strikes against Syrian targets on April 14 -- and a European Union request for a permanent exemption from U.S. tariffs.

Chief Executive Officer Margaret Georgiadis' announcement of her departure on Thursday came after just 14 months at the helm that has seen the company's share price cut in half. She was formerly at Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Analysts said her replacement, digital media executive Ynon Kreiz, has little room to maneuver as he seeks to deal with a changing toy market that has hurt traditional producers and bankrupted the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer Toys 'R' Us.
A 7.2 percent drop in early trade on Friday took Mattel shares to a more than nine-year low of $12.21.
""This (departure) may imply that the business is struggling to the degree she feels it impossible to turn around and the options are running thin,"" said Stephanie Wissink, an analyst with broker Jefferies. 
""Fundamentals continue to be weak, recovery prospects are strained by capital constraints and brand fatigue, and TRU (Toys 'R' Us) events are disruptive.""
Wissink and others raised the prospect of Mattel selling off parts of its business in response. 
Some, however, argued Kreiz, who comes from digital media and content company Market Studios and has also served with TV company Endemol, has the right background to modernize the toymaker.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>","Two months after Parkland shooting, gun makers' stocks are rallying","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two months after the death of 17 people at a school shooting in Florida sparked the strongest push for gun control in years, gun makers' stocks and firearm sales have surged.
Uproar over the murders continued to stoke debate about regulation ahead of November's elections, with students across the United States planning a walk-out on Friday, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.
Expectations of new regulations have sent gun owners worried about potential restrictions to stores to stock up - benefiting gun makers. 
The upcoming midterm elections could boost them further, as candidates at federal and state government levels call for restrictions on the sale of AR-15s and other assault-style rifles used in recent massacres. 
""If we're getting close to the mid-terms and people perceive that there's a realistic chance that the Democrats may take the House and the Senate, that certainly could swing the industry toward higher sales because of fears of potential gun control legislation,"" said Rommel Dionisio, an analyst at Aegis Capital. 
Since the Feb 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida, prompted a movement of student activists calling for restrictions on gun sales and boycotts of companies doing business with gun makers, Sturm Ruger & Company's (N:RGR) stock has rallied 12 percent, while rival American Outdoor Brands (O:AOBC), the maker of Smith & Wesson, has jumped 4 percent.
Gun maker Remington filed for bankruptcy in March. It ran into trouble after borrowing to ramp up production in 2016 in anticipation of greater industry demand, according to court filings.
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation background checks in March hit over 1.5 million, according to data supplied by the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Background checks are a strong proxy for monthly gun sales, whose figures manufacturers do not release publicly. 
Last month's background checks were the highest for any March since at least 2000, although they barely exceeded background checks in March 2013, when Democrats in Washington tried - and ultimately failed - to pass legislation banning assault-style weapons in the wake of a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
Checks for purchases of rifles, which are more profitable for manufacturers than handguns, accounted for much of the March increase. 
Still, the stock rally has not made up for a 15-month post-election slump for gun makers. American Outdoor Brands is down 60 percent from before the November 2016 election, when gun sales had been surging due to expectations that Democratic candidate Hilary Clinton would win and then impose restrictions on gun sales. 
Sales of guns slumped after the election of Donald Trump, a Republican who campaigned against gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Trump called for age restrictions on gun purchases and stricter background checks, but later backed away from those proposals.
Still, protests following the Parkland shooting have led to increased gun-control momentum in several state legislatures, and have also pushed some companies to act. 
BlackRock, the largest shareholder of both American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, has pressed gun makers and retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearms sales and use.  Citigroup  (N:C) added restrictions on firearms sales for new retail-sector clients.
Dick's Sporting Goods (N:DKS) has fallen 4 percent since it said on March 13 that a new policy against selling guns to people under age 21 and against selling assault style rifles and high-capacity magazines could weigh on its 2018 results. Kroger Co's (N:KR) superstore chain Fred Meyer said in March it would exit the firearms business.
In a sign that retailers have worked through excess inventory left after the 2016 election, many shops now offer product discounts of around 20 percent, down from as much as 40 percent a year ago, said Brian Rafn, lead portfolio manager at Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee. His firm owns shares of Sturm Ruger.

""The elections will keep (regulation) in focus and keep demand simmering,"" Rafn said.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",U.S. Senator Warren presses bank regulators over competition fears,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday pressed regulators on how they plan to preserve competition in the banking sector if Congress passes a bill that is expected to lead to consolidation among mid-sized lenders.
In a letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Warren raised fears a bill easing rules introduced after the 2008 global financial will free up large regional banks to merge, potentially reducing competition. 
""Large regional banks compete with community banks for customers hoping to open checking accounts and small businesses looking for a loan to expand,"" the Massachusetts lawmaker wrote. 
""I’m concerned about the negative impact of increased consolidation ... on community banks and on customers who benefit from more competition for their business."" 
The Fed and the DOJ share responsibility for reviewing the competitive effects of bank mergers and acquisitions. Spokespeople for both agencies declined to comment. 
On March 14, 2018, the Senate passed a bill which would reduce federal oversight of banks with between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, making it much more attractive for many banks to merge or acquire new assets.
Reuters reported in February that deal bankers and bank executives expected to see deal-making in the mid-size bank sector pick-up as a result of the new legislation. 
Citing the Reuters and other reports, Warren asked Powell and Sessions for a range of information on how they have historically reviewed bank mergers and asked if this approach has proved sufficient.
Republicans and 13 Senate Democrats who originally backed the bill say it will help promote economic growth by reducing the regulatory burden for community lenders.
However, Warren, along with other Democrats and some former bank regulators, has vigorously opposed the bill, saying it will increase systemic risk by weakening capital standards for big banks and undermines consumer and civil rights protections. 

Analysts expect the bill, which has yet to be passed by the House of Representatives, to become law in coming months.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo agrees to pay $1 billion to settle customer abuses,"By Patrick Rucker
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co will pay $1 billion to settle with U.S. regulators who say the bank wrongly layered insurance on hundreds of thousands of drivers and routinely hit homebuyers with excessive fees, officials said on Friday.
The penalty was a record from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and comes more than eighteen months after Wells Fargo admitted it opened sham accounts for customers - a practice that likely ensnared millions.
Wells Fargo said the settlement lowers its first-quarter 2018 net income by 16 cents per share to 96 cents per share. It had flagged a possible settlement when it reported earnings last week and said then it may need to restate results. 
The penalty is the first by Mick Mulvaney, whom U.S. President Donald Trump tapped in November as interim head of the CFPB, and fulfills Trump's vow to come down hard on the country's third-largest lender.
Mulvaney has worked to dial back the reach of the independent agency, and Reuters has reported the CFPB has dropped cases against at least two payday lenders. 
""We will enforce the law,"" Mulvaney said in a statement about the Wells Fargo deal. ""That is what we did here.""
While the fine will sting Wells Fargo, regulators did offer the bank some relief in the settlement.
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a sister regulator to the CFPB dropped Wells Fargo's designation as ""troubled"" which will make it easier for departing employees to collect payouts.
Wells Fargo workers have not been able to collect all their severance without a blessing from regulators ever since a 2016 consent order regarding the phony accounts.
That check was meant to block bonuses for executives who played a part in scandal. But running those checks has taxed OCC staff and delayed payouts for some workers.
Under the agreement, the OCC will still not be able to hire new executives without a sign-off from regulators.
Wells Fargo agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing. 
""While we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them,"" Wells Fargo president and chief executive Timothy J. Sloan said in a statement.
Taken together, the mortgage and auto programs ensnared more than 600,000 customers and will require nearly $300 million in refunds, the bank has said.
The programs allowed Wells Fargo to earn fees from unneeded car insurance and penalties on mortgage paperwork that the bank had botched.
For homebuyers, Wells Fargo promised to ""rate lock"" or freeze the interest rate for borrowers who got their mortgage paperwork finished within a few weeks.
When that deadline slipped and it was the bank's fault, Wells Fargo could blame the customer. The penalty for late mortgage paperwork often topped $1000, according to a borrower lawsuit.
Drivers stung by insurance fees were wrongly pushed into policies that they did not need.
Drivers must carry auto insurance but the bank has a right to ""force place"" a policy on borrowers who let coverage lapse. Insurers working for Wells Fargo pushed policies onto more than 500,000 customers who already had coverage, the bank has said. 

In July, Wells Fargo blamed a third-party vendor for wrongly layering insurance policies on its auto borrowers. Wells Fargo did not explain that it received payouts when those policies were written.

The arrest of Joerg Kerner was related to ongoing inquiries into emissions manipulation at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), more than two years after the German carmaker admitted cheating on U.S. exhaust tests, the person said.
A spokesman for Porsche declined to comment. 
Kerner was one of three current or former employees of Porsche that prosecutors were targeting when they searched offices at Porsche and its sister brand Audi (DE:NSUG) earlier this week, a spokesman for the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office said.
Those three, as well as Porsche itself, were suspected of having known that engines developed by Audi had been manipulated, Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume told staff in a memo, excerpts of which were seen by Reuters on Friday. 
""We reject these allegations and will do our utmost to clear up the matter,"" Blume said in the memo, which was first reported by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag earlier on Friday.
The arrest occurred on Thursday, he said.

The website for the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes shows a pending request for the proceedings but offers no further details or the amounts of money involved. 
Kimberly-Clark (N:KMB) did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2016, Venezuelan authorities took over a plant belonging to the American personal care products manufacturer and renamed it the Cacique Maracay Productive Plant after a local Indian leader who fought against Spanish colonial rule in the 16th century.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissues, two years ago halted its two-decade Venezuela operations as it was unable to obtain raw materials or hard currency and was struggling with high inflation.
The country is undergoing a major economic crisis, with millions suffering food shortages and price-doubling every two to three months.
A handful of multinationals, including Clorox (CLX.N),  General Mills  (N:GIS), General Motors (N:GM) and Harvest Natural Resources (N:HNR), have abandoned Venezuelan assets or sold them at fire sale prices - although some are keeping a foot in the door, hoping for improvements.
Critics blame a wave of nationalizations and takeovers during nearly two decades of socialist rule in Venezuela for destroying local production and cowing private business.

Nissan builds its Qashqai and Juke models at the northeastern English site and the company's sales in Britain, Europe's second-largest car market, have fallen 35 percent so far this year, worse than overall demand in the sector, which is down 12 percent.
Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) is cutting around 1,000 jobs and output at two of its factories after a fall in sales which the industry has partly blamed on confusion over government diesel policy, with a tax hike having come into force this month.
Nissan said it is discussing the operational changes with its employees. 
""We will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes,"" the firm said in a statement.
Demand for diesel fell by a third in the first three months of this year in Britain hit by continued consumer concern over planned tax rises and proposed bans and restrictions in several cities around the world.
Nissan, which in 2016 announced that it would build new models in Britain, providing a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May, said on Friday its production changes were not linked to Britain's departure from the European Union.

(Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc (N:STI) said on Friday a former employee may have attempted to download some information on nearly 1.5 million clients and share it with a criminal third-party.
The company said it believes the information included names and account balances, but not personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers, account numbers, pins, user IDs, passwords or driver's license numbers.
The Atlanta, Georgia-based regional bank's shares fell 3.4 percent to $100.61 in early trading.
Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said the attempt to download client information was made six to eight weeks ago.
""We began our own internal investigation and through that process, approximately 6 to 8 weeks ago, we discovered that the former employee attempted to download client information,"" Rogers said in a post-earnings conference call.
No significant fraudulent activity has been identified, Rogers said.
A SunTrust spokeswoman, Sue Mallino, refused to disclose the location of the branch where the employee attempted to steal data. She also declined to disclose the identity of the criminal third-party and said the matter was under investigation.
SunTrust also said that as of last week, it believed the stolen information had not left the bank.
Rogers said this was not a data breach, adding the employee was not authorized to get that level of information, and that the company was reviewing its systems and capabilities.
""While management appears to be proactively addressing the data issue, we expect a degree of uncertainty to persist as the duration, breadth, and financial impact of any related investigations (both internal and external) are not yet known,"" Evercore analysts wrote in a client note.
The incident will not result in any material impact to earnings, the bank said.
In a press release shortly after the call, SunTrust said it will offer identity protection services to all of its clients free of charge, not just those potentially impacted.
SunTrust reported a 36 percent rise in quarterly profit helped by a rise in net interest income and lower expenses.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Global security and cash management firm G4S (L:GFS) expects notes and coins to drive its business, even as their usage falls in favor of electronic transactions around the world.
Although data compiled by the British company best known for transporting banknotes in armored vans shows people are increasingly paying for anything from their daily coffee to online bargains with cards and mobiles, Chief Executive Ashley Almanza said G4S is defying its own expectations.
""Our fastest growing service line anywhere in the world in the last three years has been cash solutions in the United States,"" Almanza told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The death of cash has long been predicted and in Sweden the number of cash payments in shops has dropped by almost half to 20 percent from 39 percent between 2010 and 2015.
However, in Europe as a whole, G4S says 80 percent of point-of-sale transactions are still conducted in physical currency.
G4S designs and implements software which cuts corporate costs by reducing the time, effort and manpower needed to count and manage payments of all types over tills, Almanza said.
And its cash management services in the United States, where the use of notes and coins for shopping only makes up 31 percent of sales over the counter and it does not have its own fleet of vans, is more profitable than any other of its businesses.
""It is a better margin"" than for our overall business, Almanza said, without giving further detail.
UBS estimates that profit margins in G4S's cash solutions business are around the mid-teens versus around 10 percent for cash-in-transit activities and around 5 percent for manned guarding operations.
Almanza, a 55-year-old South African, took over the top job at G4S, which operates in 90 countries and has 570,000 staff, in 2013 and has helped it to recover from unprofitable contracts, although shares are up just 5 percent since he took over.
Cash solutions now make up 16 percent of G4S's 7.4 billion pounds ($10.4 billion) annual sales, while secure solutions --its guarding and alarm business-- deliver three quarters of its revenue. Care and justice, where it operates secure centers and prisons, make up just 7 percent.
G4S, which posted 2017 core profit before tax of 496 million pounds, is finding that its service is also winning business with U.S. banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
Meanwhile in Europe, a new cash management product which helps retailers offer all payment options in the Netherlands, ""G4SPay"", is delivering a margin above the group's average, Almanza said.
SAFE AS HOUSES
Almanza expects G4S's cash business to continue growing faster in advanced economies for another one to two years, while emerging markets will provide other opportunities. 
G4S's World Cash Report, which chimes with central bank data, found three quarters of online purchases in the Middle East and Asia are paid for in cash on delivery.
""People are very attached to cash because you know where you stand with it, it's anonymous, you don't have to give your data to people and with things like data privacy and cyber-security this has really come to the fore in the last couple of months."" 
A G4S smart safe product, which manages cash for retailers akin to an in-store teller machine, is growing at ""double digit rates from a relatively small base"" in South Africa and Kenya.
And the G4S report cites taxi service Uber [UBER.UL] as an example of a business, famed for its electronic payment system, which saw exponential growth when it introduced a cash option in Asia, Africa and South America.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France (PA:AIRF) launched on Friday a new consultation period with staff members to try to end a strike dispute over pay that has so far cost it 220 million euros ($271 million), with the company's head saying his job was on the line.
Jean-Marc Janaillac, who is chief executive of the Air France KLM parent group and chairman of Air France, said it would be hard for him to stay in his post if the talks failed.
""I cannot see how I could stay at the head of the company,"" he said at a news conference on Friday.
Shares in Air France KLM were down 4 percent in late session trading on Friday.
Air France said its latest pay offer of a 7 percent wage increase over 4 years had not received the majority of signatures required by 1200 local Paris time on April 20.
Air France added that Janaillac would now launch a new consultation period.
This consultation by electronic vote, which will begin on April 26 and end early in May, will invite all company staff to give their opinion on the agreement proposed on 16 April 2018, added the airline.
""I cannot accept the disaster unfolding whereas a large majority of staff are not taking part in the strike action,"" Janaillac said in a separate statement.
""Therefore, to put an end to this disaster and re-affirm the entire company's commitment to the growth dynamic, I am calling on everyone to make their voices heard. I will be personally accountable for the consequences of this vote,"" he added.
The Air France strikes - which have on general impacted about 30 percent of flights - have coincided with railway strikes in France over the last month, resulting in widespread travel disruption across the country.
Workers at the SNCF state-owned rail firm have launched a series of protests against plans by President Emmanuel Macron's government to reform the SNCF, which the government says will improve the SNCF's finances and cut France's state debt.

More than half of U.S. companies in the country want to hire extra employees and invest more, the poll published by the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany (AmCham Germany) showed.
President Donald Trump announced the tariffs last month, causing a global outcry. Germany, along with the rest of the European Union, has been exempted from the higher duties but so far only until May. 1, 2018. 
The EU and other U.S. allies worry that the tariffs will limit the amount of their goods getting into the United States and they also fear steel barred from the United States will flood back into their markets, causing a glut.
The AmCham Germany survey found that 61 percent of the U.S. companies with operations in Germany want to boost their activity there in the coming three to four years.
German companies operating in the United States are also optimistic, with about 80 percent expecting rising revenues and 70 percent wanting to increase their activities there.
But they complained about a lack of planning security in the United States, with just over half criticizing a lack of reliability in U.S. politics.
""The results show that both Germany and the USA are still highly valued locations for investment despite the current political discord,"" said Bernhard Mattes, president of AmCham Germany.
""Germany attracts U.S. companies with its stable economy and strong domestic consumption. On the other side of the Atlantic measures like the U.S. tax reform have made the USA more attractive for German investors,"" he added.
Earlier this year the United States slashed taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed, temporary tax relief to middle-class Americans under a $1.5 trillion reform.

On Thursday Germany's leading economic institutes said that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would not dampen German exports if the exemption granted to the EU expires on May 1 without a permanent solution.

The Boeing and Embraer partnership would create a new company in which the U.S. planemaker would have an 80.01 percent stake and the Brazilian firm 19.99 percent, the paper said, adding this was a model supported by the Brazilian government.
Boeing, Embraer and Brazil's Defense Ministry did not have an immediate comment on the report. 
The two jet manufacturers said in December they were discussing ""a potential combination,"" but the Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer, needs to approve the deal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are still keen on risk assets despite bearish signals such as a flattening U.S. yield curve and a surprise move by China to cut bank reserve requirements, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday. 
As a strong earnings season rekindled risk appetite, investors pushed money into U.S. and emerging market equities, while they pulled out of European and Japanese stocks, BAML strategists said, citing EPFR flows data. 
Overall, a modest $2.8 billion flowed into bonds while equities drew small inflows of $3.3 billion.
High-yield bonds drew $2.3 billion inflows this week while $1.5 billion flowed into government bonds, in flows strategists said were starting to reflect more dovish central banks and investors' expectation yields have peaked. 
The bank's ""bull and bear"" indicator of market sentiment was at 5.9, a neutral level, but strategists struck a pessimistic tone, focusing on the flattening U.S. yield curve and China's surprise move to cut reserve requirement ratios. 
The U.S. yield curve has hit its flattest since the global synchronized recovery, they said, despite record earnings, U.S. tax cuts, unemployment at record lows and surging commodity prices. 
An inversion of the yield curve would be a bad omen, indicating a recession around the corner. By 1023 GMT the curve was at 48.32, up slightly from the previous session. 
Strategists saw Chinese easing as another sign of a slowdown, saying the surprise move to cut reserve rates was triggered by a strong yuan and slowing export growth.
""As macro data reflect global slowdown and central banks blink ... rotation to defensives to accelerate,"" they said, adding they expect defensives to outperform cyclical assets. 
Flows since the start of the year indicate risk aversion in bonds and risk appetite in equities, a pattern BAML's strategists labeled ""schizophrenic"". 
TECH RETAINS CROWN
Government bonds have seen strong inflows while high yield bonds have been dropped, while in equities the most popular areas year-to-date are Japan, emerging markets, and financials. Utilities and telecoms stocks, seen as defensive, have seen sharp outflows. 
Commodities were easily the best-performing asset class of the year so far, returning 23 percent, while the U.S. dollar nursed losses of 9 percent since January, in price action the bank said was typical of this late stage in the economy.
""Last time asset performance ranked this way was in 2007,"" strategists noted, striking an ominous tone. 
Investors reversed sharply out of Japanese equities this week, driving record $5 billion outflows from the region after 19 straight weeks of inflows. 
European stocks also suffered outflows of $2 billion, taking year-to-date flows into negative territory - reflecting the region's fall from grace this year as macroeconomic data shows signs the ""Euroboom"" is slowing. 
U.S. equities saw $5.1 billion of inflows while emerging markets drew in $3.7 billion. 
Tech remained the most popular sector, drawing in $0.6 billion, while healthcare, energy, materials and financials all saw outflows. 
BAML's fund manager survey this week showed investors have been cutting down on their tech exposure, considering the sector the ""most crowded"" trade for the third month running.
In commodities, precious metals, whose prices have soared as Russian sanctions sparked fears of a supply squeeze, drew in strong inflows of $0.8 billion. 

Italian and Greek equities topped the chart of ""overbought"" areas of the stock market, indicating investors' newfound appetite for European periphery markets.

(Reuters) - Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) Inc struck a $1 billion neurology drug development deal with Ionis Pharmaceuticals on Friday, expanding a partnership that developed the company's potential blockbuster drug for spinal muscular atrophy.
Biogen's shares, however, fell about 2 percent as investors were looking for a larger deal, especially after rival Novartis AG last week said it would buy AveXis Inc for $8.7 billion to gain access to its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.
""Given the fact that just happened and ...here they are a week later not buying that company and doing a $1 billion pre-clinical deal, I think the Street remains very nervous and uncertain,"" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters.
Biogen, which has a $37 billion war chest, licensed the spinal muscular atrophy treatment Spinraza from Ionis as part of an earlier agreement. 
The company is now banking on Spinraza, with a list price of $750,000 for the first year, to offset slowing growth of its top-selling drug Tecfidera, a treatment for multiple sclerosis.
Biogen's new 10-year agreement with Ionis gives the company the option to license and commercialize a range of neurological therapies for conditions including Alzheimer's and dementia.
""We anticipate advancing up to seven new high potential drug candidates from these collaborations into the clinic in the next two years,"" Biogen executives said on a conference call.
The executives also highlighted strong safety data for treatments Ionis is working on, including a class of medicines called antisense oligonucleotides over gene therapies.
""Opportunities for antisense technology are by far broader and larger (than gene therapy), and technology is far more validated,"" Ionis executives said on a conference call.
California-based Ionis is also eligible to receive milestone-based payments, license fees and royalties on net sales of the drugs as per the deal.
The agreement, which comes ahead of Biogen's first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, includes a $625 million equity investment in Ionis and a $375 million upfront payment.
Ionis' shares rose 4.7 percent in early trading on Friday.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday, as Apple led a decline in technology stocks on concerns about weak iPhone demand and investors worried about the impact of a rise in U.S. bond yields.
Apple (O:AAPL) fell 3.8 percent and was the biggest drag on the major indexes after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimated weak demand for its latest iPhones, adding to fears raised by Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) of softer smartphone sales.
Microsoft (O:MSFT), Intel (O:INTC) and Cisco (O:CSCO) were the other big decliners, leading to a 1.6 percent drop on the S&P technology index (SPLRCT), its third straight day of decline.

 General Electric  (N:GE) jumped 3.4 percent after it posted quarterly results that topped estimates and affirmed its 2018 forecasts.
Schlumberger (N:SLB) dropped 1.9 percent after the oilfield services provider's profit just scraped past estimates.
Oil prices were down after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized OPEC and said oil prices were artificially high. The S&P energy index (SPNY) fell 0.6 percent.

Investors were also jittery as the 10-year Treasury yield (US10YT=RR) reached its highest level since March 21 as a bond selloff continued for a second day, driving the yield curve steeper after two weeks of flattening. 
""It's slowly creeping closer to 3 percent, so the 10-year from a technical standpoint will show up on people's radar,"" Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.
When yields are high, investors favor bonds over defensive sectors such as consumer staples and real estate, which promise high dividends and slow, predictable growth. But banks benefit because high interest rates can boost their profits.

565,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",South Korea's antitrust chief says expects change in Samsung governance 'in near future',"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust chief on Friday said he expects Samsung Group to unravel its governance structure in the near future, as the government and investors call for reform of the country's powerful family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols.
Chaebol families have come under increased scrutiny since the arrest last year of Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee, who denies wrongdoing, on charges of bribery and embezzlement.
Rekindling public discontent toward chaebol families this month was the investigation of a daughter of the chairman of  Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) for allegedly throwing water at an attendee of a business meeting. The investigation comes about three years after another daughter was jailed for berating an employee over incorrectly served nuts.
""Samsung Group has been busy announcing various measures,"" changing the way it does business, Kim Sang-jo, head of the Korea Fair Trade Commission, told foreign media.
Kim is popularly known as the ""chaebol sniper"" for his shareholder activist campaigns before joining the Commission. He has often criticized chaebols for complicated cross-shareholding structures that he has said are aimed at cementing family control.
Speaking of recent changes at the country's biggest conglomerate, Kim referred to  Samsung SDI  Co Ltd's (KS:006400) sale of a stake in affiliate Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260) to ease cross-shareholding ties, and a  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) unit hiring temporary repair workers as regular staff and recognizing their union.
Kim called the moves ""enormous changes"".
""I think Samsung's most crucial task is to resolve ties between  Samsung Life  and Samsung Electronics,"" said Kim. ""In the not too distant future there will be signs of change.""
Samsung Life Insurance Co Ltd (KS:032830) is at heart of a cross-shareholding structure in which it owns about 8 percent of Samsung Electronics.
A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman responsible for Samsung Group-wide issues declined to comment.
Kim's comments come almost a month after South Korea's second-biggest chaebol, Hyundai Motor Group, announced a plan to streamline its ownership structure in response to calls for chaebol reform.
""I think Hyundai made the right decision at the right time,"" Kim said.
Kim, in an interview with local media this month, said he expects change in Samsung's corporate governance to begin when Lee's trials end.
Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, was found guilty but freed in February after an appeals court suspended his prison sentence. The case is currently assigned to the Supreme Court after further appeal.

AMARILLO, Texas (Reuters) - In a sprawling plant near Amarillo, Texas, rows of workers perform by hand one of the most dangerous jobs in American industry. Contract workers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pantex facility gingerly remove the plutonium cores from retired nuclear warheads.
Although many safety rules are in place, a slip of the hand could mean disaster.
In Energy Department facilities around the country, there are 54 metric tons of surplus plutonium. Pantex, the plant near Amarillo, holds so much plutonium that it has exceeded the 20,000 cores, called “pits,” regulations allow it to hold in its temporary storage facility. There are enough cores there to cause thousands of megatons of nuclear explosions. More are added each day.
The delicate, potentially deadly dismantling of nuclear warheads at Pantex, while little noticed, has grown increasingly urgent to keep the United States from exceeding a limit of 1,550 warheads permitted under a 2010 treaty with Russia. The United States wants to dismantle older warheads so that it can substitute some of them with newer, more lethal weapons. Russia, too, is building new, dangerous weapons. 
The United States has a vast amount of deadly plutonium, which terrorists would love to get their hands on. Under another agreement, Washington and Moscow each are required to render unusable for weapons 34 metric tons of plutonium. The purpose is twofold: keep the material out of the hands of bad guys, and eliminate the possibility of the two countries themselves using it again for weapons. An Energy Department website says the two countries combined have 68 metric tons designated for destruction - enough to make 17,000 nuclear weapons. But the United States has no permanent plan for what to do with its share.
Plutonium must be made permanently inaccessible because it has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years.
""A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION""
Edwin Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in Washington, says solving the problem of plutonium storage is urgent. In an increasingly unstable world, with terrorism, heightened international tensions and non-nuclear countries coveting the bomb, he says, the risk is that this metal of mass annihilation will be used again. William Potter, director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told Reuters: “We are in a much more dangerous situation today than we were in the Cold War.” 
Washington has not even begun to take the steps needed to acquire additional space for burying plutonium more than 2,000 feet below ground - the depth considered safe. Much of America’s plutonium currently is stored in a building at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina - like Pantex, an Energy Department site. Savannah River used to house a reactor. Local opponents of the storage, such as Tom Clements, director of SRS Watch, contend the facility was never built for holding plutonium and say there is a risk of leakage and accidents in which large amounts of radioactivity are released.
The Energy Department has a small experimental storage site underground in New Mexico. The department controls the radioactive materials - plutonium, uranium and tritium - used in America’s nuclear weapons and in the reactors of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines. In a Senate hearing in June 2017, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the Energy Department has been in talks with New Mexico officials to enlarge the site. Environmental groups there have strongly opposed expansion.
Under an agreement with Russia, the United States was to convert 34 metric tons of plutonium into fuel for civilian reactors that generate electricity. The fuel is known as MOX, for “mixed oxide fuel.” Plutonium and uranium are converted into chemical compounds called oxides, and mixed together in fuel rods for civilian nuclear power plants. The two metals are converted into oxides because these can’t cause nuclear explosions. But the U.S. effort has run into severe delays and cost overruns.
The alternative method is known as dilute-and-dispose. It involves blending plutonium with an inert material and storing it in casks. The casks, however, are projected to last only 50 years before beginning to leak, and so would need to be buried permanently deep underground. 
THE MOX MESS
President Donald Trump has sided with the Energy Department in wanting to kill the MOX project because of the extreme cost overruns and delays. The Energy Department, beginning in the Obama administration, favored closing down the MOX project for the same reason, but Congress overruled it. The federal budget adopted in February, however, specifies a means for ending the project, if a study shows that dilute-and-dispose would be at least 50 percent cheaper than making MOX. 
The National Nuclear Security Administration, the part of the Energy Department that oversees the nuclear sites and materials, favors switching to the dilute-and-dispose method. In recent testimony before a House of Representatives subcommittee, Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the new NNSA administrator, said that method would “cost billions less” than completing the MOX plant.
Plutonium is a versatile nuclear bomb material. Terrorists would need only 11 kilograms or less to make a bomb, Lyman says. 
Its ordinarily limited radioactivity makes plutonium safe for terrorists or other thieves to transport with little risk of radiation injury. It goes undetected by most sensors. It radiates alpha particles, relatively large on an atomic scale, which means the thin glass of a test tube, the leather of a briefcase, or even air or skin stop them. The danger from handling small amounts is inhaling plutonium dust. In that case, the dust spreads from the lungs throughout the body, causing multiple kinds of cancer. 
The federal government now has no solution in sight to dispose of the plutonium permanently. Its one effort to make it unusable for bombs has turned into what the White House and Energy Department say is a costly failure. The MOX project, at the Energy Department’s Savannah River Site in South Carolina, has been kept on life support by Congress thanks to the influence of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and other lawmakers. The MOX plant employs about 2,000 people in Graham’s state.
Graham and other Congressional backers say MOX is the best way to keep plutonium out of the hands of terrorists. They note too that the pact with Russia requires the United States to use MOX as the method for disposal.
A spokeswoman for Graham declined to comment on his behalf but sent a link to a YouTube video of a Senate hearing in March. In the hearing, Graham, referring to steps already taken to limit work on the MOX plant, said: “What I think we’ve done is ended the biggest non-proliferation program in the world, and I’m going to try and fix that.”
Today’s plutonium glut mainly is a legacy of the Cold War. The quantities now seem surreal. By 1967 the U.S. nuclear arsenal reached its apex, with 37,000 warheads. The Soviet Union’s peak came in the 1970s, with approximately 45,000. These were enough to destroy life on Earth thousands of times over.
A RADIOACTIVE PEACE DIVIDEND
Amid the terror and aggressiveness then of government and military leaders on both sides, little or no thought was given what to do with the warheads should the risk of mass annihilation ebb. 
Daniel Ellsberg, best known for leaking in 1971 the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam war, in the early 1960s was an adviser to the Air Force and White House on nuclear policy. He recently published a book detailing and criticizing the nuclear policy debates and decisions of that era. In a phone interview, he said disposal of weapons was never considered at the time.
“I don’t think one person gave one moment of thought to that,” Ellsberg said. “No one thought that the Cold War would end.”
Treaties that dramatically reduced U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals were signed soon after the Soviet Union fell. It was then that the magnitude of the problem – disposing of the surplus plutonium – dawned on the two countries.
Scientists proffered ideas, nearly all involving making the plutonium forbiddingly dangerous for malefactors to transport and burying it deep underground.
Instead, under a 2000 treaty, the United States agreed to transform the 34 metric tons of plutonium into MOX, unusable for bombs. Russia agreed to destroy the same quantity using a special type of reactor. But the United States had never before built a MOX plant. No U.S. civilian reactor had ever used MOX as fuel.
This misplaced optimism led to one of the costliest snafus ever in U.S. government construction. Work began in 2007 to build a MOX plant that was to be operational by November 2016. The Energy Department now estimates that, if allowed to proceed, it will not be finished until 2048. In 2007 the Energy Department said the total cost would be $4.8 billion. Now it estimates the cost at more than $17 billion.
Building of the plant began when detailed designs were between 20 percent and 40 percent complete. But once initial construction finished, the contractor, under instructions from the Energy Department, breezed ahead without architectural plans.
Reports from the Union of Concerned Scientists said rooms were built for laboratories and offices where none were needed. Ventilation ducts and electrical wiring were in the wrong places. Plumbing was a maze of misplaced pipes. The contractor later had to rip out much of its work and start over. 
The contractor is a consortium of companies, CB&I Areva MOX Services. It includes CB&I (formerly Chicago Bridge and Iron), based in the Netherlands, and Areva, which specializes in nuclear-related and alternative power projects, majority owned by the French government.
GIVING IT AWAY
In an e-mailed statement to Reuters, the consortium said it expects to finish the facility. It said “the project is over 70 percent physically complete.”
But Gordon-Hagerty, the National Nuclear Security Administration’s new chief, testified in March before a House Appropriations Subcommittee that it is “nowhere near” 50% complete. Government Accountability Office reports (https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688369.pdf and https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-17-651T ) criticized the Energy Department for awarding a “cost plus” contract, which guarantees a profit regardless of how much work is done.
In an emailed response to questions for this article, Lindsey Geisler, a spokesperson for the NNSA, said that in 2011, after the contract had been awarded, “NNSA recognized the need to institute project management reforms.” She said the NNSA established a new office to better oversee contracting and acquisition, and that practices have improved significantly.
Echoing other critics, Frank von Hippel, a Princeton University professor who researches nuclear arms control and policymaking, said weak oversight continues. “The problem at DOE is that the quality of managers, with some exceptions, is quite low,” he said. “Contractors just milk them for money.”

An Energy Department panel reported in 2016 that there is no US market for MOX. To use MOX fuel rods, civilian power plants would have to modify their reactors, requiring lengthy relicensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The report said the best the Energy Department could hope for was to give the stuff away.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>",Steinhoff faces angry shareholders as it renegotiates debt,"By Toby Sterling and Wendell Roelf
AMSTERDAM/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African retailer Steinhoff is in talks with creditors about restructuring its debt, it said on Friday as it faced shareholders for the first time since an accounting scandal surfaced in December. 
Steinhoff, which runs chains such as Poundland and Mattress Fir, is fighting for survival after discovering holes in its books. The accounting scandal wiped billions off its stock market value and triggered a cash crunch. 
""The group has been engaging with its creditors across the debt clusters to create a window of stability and to develop a restructuring plan,"" the company said in a presentation. 
Investors, who backed the company's reinvention from a small furniture outfit in Johannesburg to multinational that once vied with IKEA, are facing directors for the first time since more than 90 percent of their stock value was wiped out. 
The meeting is being held in Amsterdam and streamed live to an exhibition and trade show centre in Cape Town, where dozens of protesters, led by civil servants union Public Service Union (PSA), held up placards that read: ""arrogance is not the solution"" and ""hands off our provident funds"".
""Our main concern is that the current board that is sitting in Steinhoff are the ones that are responsible for the loss of pension money, which directly affects our members and pensioners. So they must do the honourable thing and just resign,"" Reuben Maleka, a member of trade union PSA.
Shareholder rights group VEB, which is suing the company, along with banks that prepared its stock market flotation in Frankfurt in 2015, plans to put questions to the board about the scandal. 
""We still know next to nothing about what actually happened. It's been five months already,"" said Armand Kersten of VEB. ""Every single decision that shareholders make, they have to make in the absence of information, and the company’s directors are responsible for that."" 
A South African shareholder Bobby Snodgrass, who owns about 100,000 shares, blamed the board for its lack of scrutiny over Steinhoff's accounts but was hopeful the company would survive.
Steinhoff, which parted ways with its chief executive and chairman in December, said initial findings from auditors PwC found that a pattern of transactions were undertaken over ""a number of years"" that led to the ""material overstatement of income and asset values."" 
PwC has gathered more than millions of records and conducted a series of internal and external interviews as part of its unrestricted scope of the investigation, Steinhoff said. 
The company has said accounting problems stretch back to at least the 2015 financial year.

(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) scraped past first-quarter profit estimates on Friday as higher costs weighed on a strong performance in its North America business.
The oil industry has benefited from a 7.5 percent rise in U.S crude oil prices (CLc1) in the first quarter as a strengthening global economy and OPEC-led supply cut reduced excess global supplies.
Shares of Schlumberger, considered a bellwether for the oilfield services and drilling industries, were down 1.3 percent at $69.40 in premarket trading as part of a broader decline in oil stocks and prices.
Brent and U.S. crude turned negative after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized OPEC for rising prices that he said were being artificially increased and would not be accepted.
Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services provider, said revenue from North America jumped nearly 52 percent to $2.84 billion.
However, the company's total cost of manufacturing products and delivering services rose nearly 12 percent to $6.80 billion.
Revenue from international operations, the company's biggest segment, fell 0.8 percent to $4.88 billion.
Total revenue rose to $7.83 billion from $6.89 billion.
Net profit attributable to Schlumberger rose to $525 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $279 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts' estimate of 37 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Planned job cuts at carmaker Opel will save enough cash to meet owner PSA Group's turnaround targets, the works council chief said on Friday, as Opel workers' rejection of further concessions began to draw criticism from other PSA unions.
PSA (PA:PEUP) aims to eliminate 3,700 jobs under a program of voluntary departures, with 2,000 candidates already identified, Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug said.
""I'm not worried about meeting the cost targets,"" the labor boss said at a press conference. ""The scale of the uptake of buyout offers means it's now a question of whether we have enough staff to manage the current workload."" 
The group declined to comment on the job cuts target.
PSA, which last year paid General Motors (N:GM) $2.6 billion for loss-making Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall, is also demanding pay curbs and other sacrifices from workers in an attempt to restore profitability by 2020.
Tensions have mounted since Opel workers rejected demands that they waive a 4.3 percent pay increase negotiated nationwide in return for PSA's commitment to assign a new model to the Eisenach plant in central Germany, securing the plant's future.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced concern this week over PSA's plans. Chief Executive Carlos Tavares had an ""open and constructive"" telephone conversation on Friday with the German economy and labor ministers, Peter Altmaier and Hubertus Heil, the company said.
Force Ouvriere (FO), PSA's biggest French labor grouping, also weighed in on Friday, urging Germany's IG Metall union to ""take more responsibility"" for necessary cost cuts.
""They seem prepared to make the rest of the group carry the burden,"" FO official Christian Lafaye said in an interview. ""The French unions will not allow their workers to take the weight of a third competitiveness plan.""
Under Tavares, staff at PSA sites in France, Spain, Britain and several other countries have granted concessions on working hours, wage restraint and bonus cuts.
A return to profit requires productivity measures far beyond the agreed buyouts, PSA executives maintain.
""If only returning to competitive production was as simple as announcing voluntary job cuts - that would be too easy,"" a management source said.
At Vauxhall, Opel's British arm, assembly workers in Luton have just signed off on a 1.5 percent pay increase and hours that can be modified at short notice to meet demand spikes.
Gary Reay, an official with the Unite union, said Luton workers would also be dismayed if German colleagues avoided making a similar contribution to the recovery of the business.
""Our members wouldn't be at all happy,"" Reay said.
""We were unfortunate enough to not get the increase we initially wanted, which would have been above inflation. We had to do what we thought was right for our situation.""
Following the breakdown on Opel pay, PSA suspended a plan to invest in production of a new SUV at Eisenach, which IG Metall said would have safeguarded only half of the plant's 1,800 jobs.
Union negotiators furthermore accused PSA of ""blackmail"" by demanding wage restraint for its entire 19,000 German workforce as a precondition for investment at just one of its sites.
""It's not just about the wage deal, it's about whether we can trust PSA with future agreements,"" Schaefer-Klug said on Friday. ""They are not offering to negotiate, they're dictating.""

575,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>",GE profit tops estimates as cost-cutting kicks in,"By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) posted quarterly results that topped expectations on Friday, as earnings from aviation, healthcare and transportation offset weak power and oil-and-gas profits, sending shares sharply higher.
GE affirmed its forecast for 2018 earnings and cash flow, and said it expects to book as much as $10 billion in proceeds from divesting industrial assets this year. Those comments eased concern that GE would post poor results. 
GE's profit reflected 7-percent revenue growth and vigorous cost cutting. Revenue rose in aviation, oil-and-gas and healthcare, offsetting declines in power, transportation, lighting and renewable energy. GE sliced $1 billion in costs, including $800 million in industrial structural costs.
GE's shares were up 3.8 percent to $14.52 on Thursday. The stock has lost more than half its value in the past last year.
But GE also took a $1.5-billion reserve charge for potential costs associated with its discontinued WMC mortgage business, formerly part GE Capital. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating the activities of GE's former mortgage unit during the subprime mortgage crisis, since 2015. GE said settlement discussions with the DOJ in March and analysis of other banks' reserves prompted it to take the charge, but it sees limited impact to results. 
""We do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity,"" GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference call with analysts. 
Excluding adjustments, GE earned $369 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenue of $28.7 billion. That compared with 1 cent a share a year ago. 
While several analysts thought GE handily beat forecasts, others cited the unadjusted earnings as being more telling.
""I'm looking at it as coming in as expected,"" analyst Jeff Windau at Edward Jones, said of the results and the adjustments. ""And expectations were low.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Steve Tusa was among those who said GE may cut its full-year earnings forecast in coming months. While results were ""not that bad"" compared with other quarters, Tusa said, negative free cash flow of $1.68 billion was weaker than he expected. GE typically reports negative cash flow early in the year as it spends on inventory shipped later in the year.
GE earned an adjusted 16 cents per share, up from a restated 14 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE recently restated 2017 results to reflect changes in accounting standards.
Analysts had forecast GE's profit to decline in the first quarter and some thought Friday's results might fail to meet even those diminished expectations.
But the company's aviation, transportation and healthcare businesses produced double-digit profit growth in the quarter, boosting overall results.
Profit at GE's power business fell 38 percent on a 9 percent decline in sales; orders dropped 29 percent. 
""The industry continues to be challenging and is trending softer than our forecast,"" GE said of the power business.

Profit in GE's oil and gas unit fell 30 percent, excluding restructuring and other charges, GE said.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",China trade body urges tighter corporate compliance after ZTE woes: document,"By Shu Zhang and Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - A state-backed Chinese trade body said compliance is now a core risk for Chinese firms and that the government must speed up the implementation of guidelines on corporate oversight following a U.S. ban on sales to ZTE Corp.
U.S. authorities this week forbade American companies from sales to ZTE for seven years, saying the Chinese telecom company had broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements - a move that threatens to cut off ZTE's supply chain.
The ZTE case represents a ""milestone"" and government leaders should urge the company to boost compliance oversight to ease ""disastrous"" consequences, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) said in a policy proposal seen by Reuters.
""We can see compliance risk has become a core risk for Chinese firms that join international competition,"" the trade body said in the proposal dated April 18.
The authorities should introduce compliance training measures for government officials and business leaders, the body said.
China is set to implement a set of new national standards on compliance management systems on July 1, as the government steps up efforts to monitor companies' overseas operations and strengthen their compliance management to curb risk.
The trade body said the action against ZTE came ""at a sensitive moment"" in Sino-U.S. trade relations and so it cannot be ruled out that the United States is seeking to exert pressure on China through sanctions against ZTE.
The United States and China have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, fanning worries of an intensifying trade war.
""The most urgent priority is to ease the disastrous impact on ZTE caused by U.S. sanctions through efforts from multiple sides,"" the CCPIT said, noting that it would be ""unrealistic"" to ask the Unites States to remove the order.
It called on the government to go through informal channels to lobby key U.S. firms who sell components to ZTE, including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp, to seek leniency with U.S. Congress members on the matter, the proposal showed.
The trade body said top compliance experts, including those working at ZTE's American suppliers and other multinational companies, had held a discussion this week on the U.S. sanctions to form the CCPIT's policy proposal.
Calls to the CCPIT's news department went unanswered on Friday. ZTE did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

ZTE said on Friday that the U.S. ban on the sale of parts and software to the company was unfair and threatened its survival. It said it would safeguard its interests through all legal means.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares dipped on Friday at the end of a strong week as a rally in commodities softened, sparking profit-taking among mining stocks, although strong earning updates boosted shares in Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Telia (ST:TELIA).
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.1 percent by 0809 GMT but remained up 0.6 percent on the week and set for its fourth straight week of gains, as global markets recovered from a turbulent first quarter.
Jitters over possible trade wars, faster rate hikes in the United States and a regulatory crackdown on big tech groups sent the STOXX to 14-months lows in March. 
But since April the index has been on a recovery path as those worries receded and investors were lured back into equities by cheaper company valuations.
On Friday, Ericsson rallied 15 percent and was set for its biggest one-day gain since October 2008 after the Swedish mobile equipment maker reported first-quarter earnings and its gross margin above market expectations as cost savings from job cuts started to kick in. Its gains drove shares in rival Nokia (HE:NOKIA) up 2.7 percent.
""The big jump in profitability provides evidence that Ericsson's efforts at cost reduction, addressing loss making contracts and investing in R&D is paying off,"" Liberum analysts led by Janardan Menon said in a note.
However, they confirmed their hold rating on the stock, saying overall operating margins continued to be low in an unpredictable industry environment. 
Cost cutting has been a key driver for earnings growth in Europe and could also help first quarter results. Companies on the MSCI EMU index <.dMIEM00000PEU> are expected to see earnings rising 1.9 percent in local currency terms last quarter as sales are seen down 1.3 percent. 
Elsewhere, dovish remarks overnight from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney weakened the pound, helping the internationally exposed FTSE (FTSE) index outperform with a gain of 0.4 percent and weather a 6.4 percent fall in  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) following another poor update that further stresses gloomy prospects for consumer goods makers.
Still in earnings, Telia was an outstanding gainer, up 8.3 percent, after the Nordics telecoms group announced a welcome share buyback plan as first-quarter core earnings slightly topped market expectations.
But ASM International (AS:ASMI) slumped 10 percent after the supplier of wafer processing equipment for semiconductor manufacturing industry reported a bigger than expected fall in gross margins.

The basic resources index (SXPP), which tracks big mining stocks, fell 0.1 percent, but remained on track to end the week up more than 4 percent. Metal prices remained below this week's peaks as a rally driven by fears of supply disruptions caused by U.S. sanctions on Russia appeared to lose momentum.

592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>",Barclays CEO to Stay in Job After Whistle-Blowing Probe,"(Bloomberg) --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley will keep his job after U.K. regulators said they had concluded their investigation into his attempts to unmask a whistle-blower.
While the Financial Conduct Authority and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority proposed that the CEO pay a financial penalty, they “are not alleging that he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer,” the bank said in a statement on Friday.
Barclays’s board has “unanimous confidence” in Staley and continues to recommend that he be re-elected at the annual general meeting on May 1, the company said. On top of the regulatory fine, the bank has already said it may claw back his entire 1.3 million-pound ($1.6 million) bonus for 2016.
The lender reprimanded its CEO in April last year after discovering he had twice tried to identify a whistle-blower. Staley has also come under increasing pressure in his third year in charge of the British lender. In March, activist investor Edward Bramson bought a stake in Barclays with the aim of pushing for strategic change to lift the shares, adding to growing discontent among investors about the lack of progress in turning around the investment bank.
Staley, a former JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. executive, bet his reputation on boosting returns at the securities unit, which has long been Barclays’s worst-performing division.
The whistle-blowing controversy dates back to June 2016, when Barclays’s board received an anonymous letter raising concerns about the recruitment of one of Staley’s former JPMorgan colleagues, Tim Main. The letters flagged issues of a personal nature about him and Staley’s role in dealing with those concerns at JPMorgan.
After learning about the letters, Staley made two attempts to discover who wrote them, despite being informed that it was inappropriate for him to do so after his first try. Barclays’s own investigation had found Staley ""honestly, but mistakenly, believed"" his actions were permitted, which was why they didn’t fire him.
When Staley started in December 2015, he promised he’d lead a “cultural transformation” of the lender and reset strained relations with regulators after a series of misconduct fines and settlements wiped out more than 20 billion pounds of earnings over six years.
Regulators have placed whistle-blowing, and the protection of those raising the alarm, at the heart of efforts to avoid financial misconduct and scandals since the financial crisis. The Barclays issue is also seen by commentators as a critical test of the FCA’s Senior Managers and Certification Regime, which requires officials to be directly accountable for misconduct on their watch.
As part of the investigation, the FCA interviewed officials including Mike Ashley, the board member who supervises whistle-blowing complaints, Chief Operating Officer Paul Compton, former company secretary Lawrence Dickinson and Staley’s chief of staff, Timothy Karpoff. Former head of compliance Mike Roemer and Troels Oerting, ex-head of the group information security team Staley tasked with identifying the author of the complaints, were also questioned, Bloomberg News reported last year.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lockheed Martin to propose stealthy hybrid of F-22 and F-35 for Japan - sources,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) plans to offer Japan a stealth fighter design based on its export-banned F-22 Raptor and advanced F-35 Lightning II aircraft, two sources said.
Lockheed has discussed the idea with Japanese defense ministry officials and will make a formal proposal in response to a Japanese request for information (RFI) after it receives permission from the U.S. government to offer the sensitive military technology, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the proposal. 
The decision on whether to release parts of the highly classified aircraft designs and software to help Japan stay ahead of Chinese advances will test President Donald Trump's promise to overhaul his country's arms export policy.
The proposed aircraft ""would combine the F-22 and F-35 and could be superior to both of them,"" said one of the sources. 
Japan, which is already buying the radar-evading F-35 to modernize its inventory, also wants to introduce a separate air superiority fighter in the decade starting 2030 to deter intrusions into its airspace by Chinese and Russian jets.
The country's air force currently flies the F-15J, based on the Boeing (NYSE:BA) F-15; and the F-2, based on the Lockheed Martin F-16. Both designs are decades old. 
Japan's ambition to build its own stealth fighter was in part spurred by Washington's refusal a decade ago to sell it the twin-engined F-22, which is still considered the world's best air superiority fighter. 
Although the Japanese stealth aircraft program, dubbed the F-3, was conceived as a domestic effort estimated to cost around $40 billion, Tokyo has recently sought international collaboration in a bid to share the expense and gain access to technology it would otherwise have to develop from scratch.
Any aircraft built with international partners must have Japanese-designed engines and radar, however, and feature other components made locally, the other source said. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries tested a prototype stealth jet in 2016 that cost the Japanese government $350 million to develop.
""We are considering domestic development, joint development and the possibility of improving existing aircraft performance, but we have not yet come to any decision,"" a Ministry of Defense spokesman said on Friday.
The Japanese government in March issued a third RFI for the F-3 to foreign defense companies and sent a separate document outlining its requirements in more detail to the British and United States governments.
In addition to a proposal from Lockheed, Japan is hoping for responses from  Boeing Co , which makes the F/A-18 Super Hornet multirole fighter, and BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc, which is part of the consortium that built the Eurofighter Typhoon high-altitude interceptor. 
""We look forward to exploring options for Japan's F-2 replacement fighter in cooperation with both the Japanese and U.S. governments. Our leadership and experience in 5th generation aircraft can be leveraged to cost-effectively provide capabilities to meet Japan’s future security needs,"" a Lockheed Martin spokeswoman said. 
Boeing and BAE did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 

Japan's last jet fighter, the F-2, which entered service in 2000, was built jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy and Lockheed Martin. As Japan's leading fighter maker, MHI, which built the World War Two-era A6M Zero, would anchor the Japanese portion of any new project.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 07:24AM ET</span>","In Vietnam, a mega casino rises with the help of a Macau junket company","By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Along a three-kilometer (2-mile) stretch of coastline in central Vietnam, construction cranes are digging up mounds of sand and rubble where the country's biggest casino is set to open next year.
When completed, the $4 billion Hoiana project will extend across almost 1,000 hectares, and also include shops, restaurants, golf courses and water parks.
Driving the project is Suncity Group Holdings Ltd (HK:1383), which has made billions luring high-rollers – mainly from China - to the baccarat tables in the Chinese territory of Macau.
Vietnam is betting big on developing a gambling industry, targeting the Chinese tourists who have been flocking to the country in recent years.
In addition to Hoiana, two other casinos, one in Van Don in the northern province of Quang Ninh, and one on Phu Quoc island in the south, are also under construction. The two projects will be part of a pilot program that would allow Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos for the first time.
Hoiana will be the first casino owned by SunCity, which will have a one-third stake in the project. VinaCapital, a Vietnamese investment management and real estate firm, and the Hong Kong-based VMS Investment Group will also have similar-sized stakes.
""The government really wishes to bring tourism here,"" said Henry Tam, project director of Hoi An South Development, the local company which is building Hoiana. He added that development of the area would also include a school and sports stadium for local residents.
""This is a 15-20 year project,"" he said. ""The area is four times the size of Macau's Cotai strip.""
The Hoiana project comes with challenges. Local Vietnamese will not be allowed to gamble at the casino and operations are subject to Vietnam's uncertain regulatory environment. 
Competition around Asia is also heating up, with Macau, the world's largest gambling center, building more resorts, and South Korea and the Philippines expanding their casino footprints. Other countries like Singapore also compete in the sector.
Ho Tram, a multi-billion dollar casino project located a two-hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City, had construction delays and financing problems before it opened in 2013. The casino - which is owned by Asian Coast Development, headed by the hedge fund manager Philip Falcone - has struggled to attract foreign gamblers to its remote location.
There are fewer than 10 casinos in Vietnam, mostly smaller ones outside major cities. At present, only foreign passport holders can enter and gamble in them.
Suncity executives are optimistic for Hoiana, citing strong government backing, local support through VinaCapital and large-scale infrastructure works like the four-lane highway that will connect it to Danang's international airport 40 kilometers away.
And they are pinning their hopes on Chinese tourists. In 2017, Vietnam welcomed 4 million Chinese visitors, up 49 percent from the previous year.
The first phase of the project, which includes a 140-table casino and a golf course, is due to open in 2019. The second phase, which will add a lagoon, water park, second golf course, entertainment village and four more beach resorts, is slated to open by 2023.
Anthony Chiu, Suncity's chief financial officer, said the cost of the first phase was $650 million, of which VinaCapital, Suncity and VMS have put in around $70 million each, with the rest coming from bank financing.
Companies associated with Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, headed by the Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng, are building 100 villas and a 1,176-room hotel as part of the first phase.
In addition to Hoiana, Suncity has also signed a management service agreement for the Van Don project in the north.
Van Don is scheduled to open in 2019 according to Suncity but details are scarce on the nature of the development. Foreign investors are required to invest over $2 billion in order to qualify for casino licenses.
Las Vegas operators including  Las Vegas Sands  (N:LVS) have been interested in setting up in Vietnam for several years. But Sands has said it would only invest in a casino if locals were allowed to gamble there.
CASINO EXPANSION
For Suncity, the stakes are high in Hoiana.
Booming gambling revenues in Macau have created enormous wealth for junket operators like Suncity, who bring in players from mainland China and collect their debts.
But as tighter regulatory controls and a lack of space crimps further development in Macau, junkets have been trying to expand overseas.
Their role remains critical for Asian casinos eager to attract Chinese players, as gambling debts are not legally enforceable in China. 
Suncity is responsible for all the casino operations in Hoiana, including bringing in VIP players.
Macau's government will also soon be deciding on whether to allow new contenders to set up casinos in the glittering enclave once the six existing licenses start to expire from 2020.
Suncity's 34 percent stake in Hoiana will help position it as a contender for a casino license in Macau, said Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming in Macau.
Suncity's executive director, Andrew Lo, said Hoiana also gave the company an opportunity to be in control of an operation rather than just a service provider.

""I think it's a very good investment,"" he said. ""Our marketing strategy is that we will become the entertainment hub of the Danang and Hoi An area.""

597,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",End of Sorrell's reign heralds change for big ad empires,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell's departure from the world's biggest advertising company heralds change for his sprawling WPP (LON:WPP) empire and may accelerate a shake up of the big ad groups that followed his lead.
WPP and its major rivals Omnicom, Publicis and IPG face challenges on every front, from the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) - whom Sorrell famously dubbed ""frenemies"" - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte.
With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups must learn to be more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up.
""I don't think this is the event that brings down the holding companies,"" industry adviser and MediaLink Chief Executive Michael Kassan told Reuters. ""I do believe this is going to force everybody to rethink.""
Ad groups embark on their latest transformation without Sorrell, the godfather of the modern industry who quit after 33 years over an investigation into misconduct. WPP does not plan to release results of the probe. He denies the allegations.
The clear industry leader WPP employs 200,000 staff who offer advertising, branding, media buying, lobbying and data analytics via more than 400 separate companies.
Sorrell built up the group since the 1980s. When he set out, elaborate television campaigns ruled. Complexity was added as the ad market moved online and become more fragmented. The structure he began with, now looks dated.
Several years of strong organic growth at WPP evaporated in 2017. In March, it said it did not expect to grow in 2018. WPP's stock has fallen by a third in a year. FIS Astec Analytics, a data provider, says 51 million of WPP's shares are on loan to short sellers, up from just 1 million a year ago. 
WPP valuation has slid to 9.9 times future earnings, compared with a FTSE average of 13.6 times, while its big three rivals still boast multiples of 12 to 14 times.
Sorrell's resignation further dented WPP's share price but the firm's executives still say they are upbeat. ""I think some people might feel a bit liberated,"" Stephen Allan, who runs WPP's media-buying agency MediaCom, told BBC radio. 
CLIENT PRESSURE
WPP, the owner of agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, has been hit hard by a reduction in spending from the world's biggest consumer goods groups,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and Procter & Gamble, which complain about having to deal with WPP's multiple agencies.
They also want more transparency in how ads are viewed, after an Association of National Advertisers report showed some ads were only seen by bots and many were not watched at all.
P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the media supply chain was ""murky at best and fraudulent at worst"", adding it was time to end the era of ""Mad Men"", referring to ad leaders in the 1960s credited with laying the foundations for the industry that Sorrell built on.
Digital consultant Ian Maude said advertising agencies needed to provide creative services and strategies for planning and buying media space, all reinforced by data insight, public relations and input on how a user shops and acts online.
""The question is whether the holding companies are the right structure any more and whether they can be turned into something that is nimble and agile in a reasonable timetable that is going to satisfy investors,"" he said. 
Sorrell said in March WPP would accelerate plans to break down barriers between agencies to create a cohesive global team. 
That is not easy when many of them are run as individual entities competing with rivals inside and outside WPP.
""WPP probably still has the best portfolio of assets,"" said Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. ""It's direction wasn't wrong. The problem was one of execution and articulation."" 
One group that is earning plaudits, however, is Publicis. Tech groups, independent agencies and consultants have told Reuters the French group has a more joined up offering.
Run for decades by Sorrell's rival Maurice Levy, Publicis set out plans in March under its new boss Arthur Sadoun to foster more collaboration between its agencies and to become a consulting and technology partner to global advertisers.
Publicis on Thursday reported better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter of this year.
Omnicom, the biggest holding company in the United States, is also drawing together single teams from across its agencies to support individual clients. IPG, the fourth of the big four, has said it expects a stronger 2018 after a slow 2017. 
""TIPPING POINT""
Michael Farmer, author of the book Madison Avenue Manslaughter, says the holding companies need to stop accepting demands to produce more work for lower fees. He also said they need to compete more effectively for talent against firms such as Accenture.
""The tipping point has been reached,"" said Farmer, who works with advertising agencies and major brands such as Ford and Kraft on strategy. ""WPP is not growing.""
Mark Read, WPP's co-Chief Operating Officer since Sorrell's departure last weekend, told staff WPP needed to hold together.
""There's been speculation about breaking up the group. We don’t believe this makes sense,"" he wrote in an email that was the first in the group's history to go directly to all WPP staff worldwide. ""We need to get closer together, not further apart.""
To improve their offering, the ad groups could start by being more transparent. Michael Moszynski, previously of Saatchi who now runs the agency London Advertising, said clients wanted to see more clearly how their money was spent.
And some clients remain loyal. A marketing chief at one major packaged goods company, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that WPP provided a powerful service, wrapping data analytics and insight with its creative work that helped clients navigate changing markets.
WPP must now make that kind of joined up offering the norm if it is to avoid unraveling. But it will have to do this without Sorrell at the helm, which may prove tough.

""It's the fall of an emperor,"" David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas, told Reuters. ""One that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.""

601,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",P&G's vitamin boost could signal more to come,"By Martinne Geller and Richa Naidu
LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble's $4.2 billion deal for Merck's vitamin and supplements business is the latest example of a major consumer company stocking up on health-related products.
The U.S.-based maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors announced the deal on Thursday, giving it brands such as Seven Seas vitamins and expanding its portfolio of healthcare products.
Just last month, cleaning product maker Clorox Co agreed to buy multivitamin company Nutranext for $700 million. And in December, Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) paid $2 billion for vitamin maker Atrium Innovations.
The moves show how global consumer goods companies are looking to new, interesting areas to offset flagging growth in their core businesses.
The vitamins and supplements sector is attractive due to the emergence of new brands marketing themselves digitally and selling directly online to young consumers, said investment banker William Hood of William Hood & Co.
""It's what the millennials are buying and how they're buying it,"" Hood said. ""Large companies are realizing they need to figure it out.""
A spokeswoman for P&G declined to comment on the company's strategy to expand its vitamins, minerals and supplements business. P&G already owns consumer health brands including Vick's, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol.
Globally, the vitamin and supplements category has grown between 5 and 7 percent annually for the past five years, according to Euromonitor.
The category is very fragmented, with market leader Amway Corp having only 3.6 percent share, Euromonitor data showed. That implies a consolidator could easily boost margins by building scale.
Consumer goods firm Reckitt Benckiser has owned Schiff, maker of MegaRed tablets for heart health and Airborne for immunity, for five years. It was a very different business to other health or home goods, said CEO Rakesh Kapoor on a post-earnings call in February, adding that sales and margins were improving after some stumbles.
""This is a category which is here to stay. It is one of the single largest categories in health,"" he said.
A PRELUDE TO MORE?
P&G was in talks with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) about buying the U.S. drugmaker's consumer health business, CNBC reported earlier this month. Pfizer hoped to bring in $20 billion through an auction for the business, which includes Centrum vitamins and Advil painkillers. 
The auction hit a roadblock after GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser dropped out of the running.
When asked about its interest in Pfizer on Thursday, P&G chief executive David Taylor declined to comment.
Referring to the P&G-Merck deal, Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said: ""The question is - is it a prelude to more? ... Is P&G still theoretically on the hunt for Pfizer?""

Bernstein analysts noted that the Pfizer business ""may still be an acquisition candidate (for P&G) since it doesn't seem to raise anti-trust concerns on the surface.""

602,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 08:32AM ET</span>","GM Korea fails to reach wage deal, edging closer to bankruptcy filing","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit and its labor union failed to reach a wage deal by Friday, breaching a deadline set by the U.S. automaker to seek bankruptcy protection for the loss-making unit.
A source familiar with the matter said GM Korea will hold a board meeting at around 8 p.m. local time on Friday to discuss filing for a court-led rehabilitation.
But a union official told Reuters in a text message that the two sides will continue talking until Monday afternoon. 
The U.S. automaker shocked South Korea when it unveiled in February a major restructuring plan for its unit that involved closure of one of its four plants in the country and voluntary redundancies of 2,600 workers.
It has sought wage concessions from the union as well as government funding and incentives to save the remaining three factories.
GM has said the unit, which employs some 16,000 people, is likely to file for bankruptcy if there was no restructuring agreement by Friday.
""Without concessions from the labor union and clear resolution from stakeholders, the company has no choice but to go ahead with rehabilitation proceedings,"" GM Korea CEO Kaher Kazem said after the talks failed in a letter to employees that was seen by Reuters.
GM Korea, however, is not expected to immediately file for court receivership, as any plan needs to be put to a vote at a shareholder's meeting. It will also need approval from 85 percent of its shareholders.
That includes the state-funded Korea Development Bank (KDB). The bank told Reuters this week that it may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27 to financially support the business should an interim due-diligence report due on Friday turn out to be satisfactory.
The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea while KDB owns a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104), controls the remaining 6.0 percent.
A KDB spokesman declined to comment. 
A union official previously said the thorniest issue is job security for 680 workers at the Gunsan factory that is due to be closed by May. 
""We don't want a disaster. We still have to keep in mind the worst situation,"" he said prior to the talks, declining to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the talks. 
JOBS, EXPORTS
GM Korea's future is important for South Korea as GM and its suppliers have hired a total of 156,000 workers. GM Korea also accounts for some 13 percent of the nation's automaker jobs and 16 percent of the sector's exports in Asia's fourth-biggest economy. 
Its restructuring also poses a challenge to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has attached the utmost priority to jobs, especially with local elections scheduled for June. 
Over the past three years GM has sought to focus on profitable markets, mainly the United States and China, and new technologies such as electric and automated vehicles. 
Although the South Korean unit has been hobbled by labor costs and hurt by GM's decision to pull its Chevrolet brand from Europe, a key export market, any decision on whether to pull the plug on the unit will not come easy for GM Chief Executive Mary Barra.
The unit was once the backbone of its Asian strategy and still makes more than 1 million assembled or partially assembled vehicles catering to the U.S., Europe and emerging markets. 

It is also an engineering and design source for GM's small vehicles and electric vehicles as well as home to some of GM's top-ranked suppliers globally.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 02:21AM ET</span>",Asia's second-hand jet market soars as super-rich eye bargains,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Asia's super-wealthy are increasingly opting for second-hand private jets rather than buying new ones, as private buyers look for deep discounts and shorter waiting times, aircraft brokers said.
Buyers from the region bought 61 pre-owned aircraft and 54 new jets in 2017, marking the first time second-hand purchases outstripped new orders, according to a report by aviation consultancy Asian Sky Media. 
It underscores how a trend that began last year has hardened amid slowing economic growth in the region, while cost-conscious Chinese buyers have shunned flashy symbols of wealth.
Brokers said customers included Chinese companies, which were buying such jets to support overseas expansion and opting for used planes to keep costs down. Pre-owned jet prices have also seen a steep drop in the past two years, they said. 
""Customers have changed, their knowledge of the industry has changed and they now understand the value of a pre-owned aircraft,"" Jeffrey Lowe, managing director of consultancy Asian Sky Media, said on the sidelines of the Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition in Shanghai this week.
""The market has had an abundance of supply of late, so they were able to find good airplanes at good prices too which were not necessarily all that old and still under warranty. So that has certainly spurred the market.""
Planemakers such as General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) Gulfstream and  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) have reduced production in recent years as market demand contracted and they worked on releasing new models, resulting in longer waiting times for buyers. 
""The market base has grown,"" said David Dixon, president of business jet brokerage Jetcraft Asia. 
""Some people who don't want to spend $60-65 million on one of these, can spend $40 million instead. There's a lot you can do with $20 million.""
Industry executives said however, that this shift was not negative for planemakers such as Gulfstream and Bombardier, as it was helping to firm prices by reducing an oversupply of used business jets on the global market. 
Customers were also attracted by new models being pushed out by planemakers, brokers said. 
At the show, Gulfstream showed off its newest G500 and G600 jets, while Bombardier displayed a mock-up of its upcoming Global 7000 long-range plane. 
Gulfstream, which rivals Bombardier for the largest share of the Asia-Pacific private jet fleet, said it was confident in the market and that growing maturity of the region's buyers was a plus for the U.S. planemaker. 

""There's a realization now that these airplanes are really being used for business, they're business tools,"" said Gulfstream's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Scott Neal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has tested a new blockchain platform for issuing financial instruments with the National Bank of Canada and other large firms, they said on Friday, seeking to streamline origination, settlement, interest rate payments and other processes.
The test on Wednesday mirrored the Canadian bank's $150 million offering on the same day of a one-year floating-rate Yankee certificate of deposit, they said in a statement. The platform was built over more than a year using Quorum, a type of open-source blockchain that JPMorgan has developed inhouse and is in discussions to spin off. 
Participants in the experiment included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the fund management arm of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) and  Legg Mason  Inc's (N:LM) Western Asset and other investors in the certificate of deposit.
Banks have poured millions of dollars to develop blockchain, the software first created to run cryptocurrency bitcoin, to streamline processes ranging from cross-border payments to securities settlement.
""Blockchain-related technologies have the potential to bring about major change in the financial services industry,"" David Furlong, senior vice president of artificial intelligence, venture capital and blockchain at National Bank of Canada, said in a statement.
JPMorgan is considering spinning off Quorum because the technology has attracted significant outside interest, Umar Farooq, head of blockchain initiatives for JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank said in an interview. 
He said it was taking too much time to field requests for help from users at other companies.
Charging for assistance is not an option because software support is not the bank's business, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The source was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
The spin-off discussions are in the early stages and the bank has received interest from financial institutions and large enterprise technology companies, Farooq added. He declined to name the companies. 
JPMorgan plans to beef up the Quorum team with dozens of engineers from the bank's other divisions who have become familiar with the technology, he said. 
Blockchain is in the early stages of development in the financial industry, but JPMorgan is optimistic about its potential, Farooq said.
""We haven't really seen a lot of really large scale things go into production yet. There are few cases where blockchain can really shine.""

607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 09:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. sorghum armada U-turns at sea after China tariffs,"By Karl Plume and P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Several ships carrying cargoes of sorghum from the United States to China have changed course since Beijing slapped hefty anti-dumping deposits on U.S. imports of the grain, trade sources and a Reuters analysis of export and shipping data showed.
Sorghum is a niche animal feed and a tiny slice of the billions of dollars in exports at stake in the trade dispute between the world's two largest economies, which threatens to disrupt the flow of everything from steel to electronics.
The supply-chain pain felt by sorghum suppliers on the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans underscores how quickly the mounting trade tensions between the U.S. and China can impact the global agricultural sector, which has been reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut.
Twenty ships carrying over 1.2 million tonnes of U.S. sorghum are on the water, according to export inspections data from the USDA's Federal Grain Inspection Service. Of the armada, valued at more than $216 million, at least five changed course within hours of China's announcing tariffs on U.S. sorghum imports on Tuesday, Reuters shipping data showed. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JZz9An)
The five shipments, all headed for China when they were loaded at Texas Gulf Coast export terminals owned by grain merchants Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) or Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) would be liable for a hefty deposit to be paid on their value, which could make the loads unprofitable to deliver. 
Beijing, which is probing U.S. imports for damage to its domestic industry, announced Tuesday that grains handlers would have to put up a deposit of 178.6 percent of the value of the shipments.
Traders said Cargill and ADM likely sold most of the grain in the cargoes that are on the water, traders said.
In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, Cargill confirmed it is the exporter. The company declined to confirm what is in the ships, the final destinations or the tonnage, nor name the customers. The company also declined to confirm why the ships stopped, or if they are being re-directed – but said that it does not have any responsibility for costs that may result.
ADM representatives declined to comment.
The Panamanian-flagged ship called the N Bonanza, was churning its way northeast across the Indian Ocean earlier this week, carrying more than 67,000 tonnes of sorghum from ADM's elevator in Corpus Christi, Texas, according to Reuters shipping data.
Eleven hours after the anti-dumping deposits were announced, the ship stopped and then slowly tracked northwest.
The RB Eden, a vessel carrying 70,223 tonnes of sorghum loaded at the same ADM terminal, was headed east-northeast through the Indian Ocean off the coast of South Africa. It turned around.
Hours later, the Stamford Eagle - hauling sorghum from Cargill's elevator in Houston - turned around off the western coast of Mexico.
At least two other vessels have also suddenly changed course: the Ocean Belt and Xing Xi Hai, both loaded at Cargill's terminal.
It is unclear where the vessels are now heading. 
For now, at least, two of the world's largest grain merchants are among those feeling the impact of the latest trade tussle with China, even if it is just a short-term issue, said Bill Densmore, senior director of corporate ratings at Fitch Ratings.
""For their overall trade businesses, this is not that substantial. But it's a warning,"" Densmore said. ""If China really does start slapping tariffs on everything, like soybeans and corn, things could get really ugly, really fast.""
SEARCHING FOR NEW BUYERS
Beijing's move has heaped more strain on an already tense trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.
Traders said the deposit was high enough to bring U.S. imports to a halt. Sorghum is used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu.
Indeed, the news had an immediate impact on the global grains market: Bids for cargoes of Australian sorghum, which are not subject to the higher tariffs, spiked following the announcement, traders said.
Industry sources in China said some of the cargoes might be redirected to Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, to feed hog and poultry plants owned by Chinese feed producers.
However, those countries and others in the region are small importers of sorghum. Vietnam has never imported U.S. sorghum and the Philippines imported just 19,000 tonnes in the 2016/17 season, according to USDA data.
China, by contrast, imported more than 5.2 million tonnes last season, nearly 10 times more than No. 2 importer Japan, the data showed. 
Shippers may have to discount the cargoes to sell them, analysts said.
""They're not in a strong bargaining position considering they've got shipments from across the ocean that they have to sell and get the boats cleared out,"" said economist Daniel O'Brien of Kansas State University in the top U.S. sorghum-producing state.
Sorghum prices at the Texas Gulf have slipped since China's announcement. At midweek, immediate shipments from Corpus Christi  were priced around $181.29 per ton, not including shipping costs, a one-month low.
The U.S. sorghum industry called for an end to the trade dispute and expressed concern about the impact on established trade relationships that have taken years to build.
""This tit for tat has to stop, and talks to find reasonable and lasting solutions must begin, for the good of U.S. agriculture and the customers we have spent decades working to win as loyal buyers,"" said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd shares lost almost 5 percent of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the size of any deal the Japanese firm would have to make to seal its record-breaking purchase of London-listed Shire PLC.
Shire late on Thursday said it had rejected Takeda's $63 billion cash-and-stock conditional offer, saying the offer - and two previous offers - significantly undervalued its growth prospects and drugs in development. The rare disease drugmaker said talks continued over ""whether a further, more attractive, proposal may be forthcoming.""
Several analysts said Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker by sales, will need to substantially raise the cash component of its offer make it attractive to Shire shareholders.
Takeda's shares closed down 4.67 percent in afternoon trade. The stock is down more than 12 percent since news of its initial bid emerged.
A successful bid would be the most radical step yet by Chief Executive Christophe Weber, propelling Takeda into the top ranks of global drugmakers with what would be Japan's largest-ever outbound deal.
Other cross-border deals chased down by the Frenchman include the $5.20 billion acquisition of U.S. cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc last year, as well as the purchase of Belgian biotech group TiGenix NV announced in January.
For Shire, Takeda's most recent rejected offer of 46.50 pounds per share - made on April 12 - comprised 17.75 pounds in cash, paid in U.S. dollars, and 28.75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares. The cash portion, at 38 percent, compared with the 36 percent originally offered.
Takeda has room to raise its cash offer but ""we do not see a lot of margin,"" Daiwa Securities analyst Kazuaki Hashiguchi wrote in a client note. 
The deal would also be a financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of over 36.6 billion pounds ($51.5 billion), is worth more than Takeda, which has a market capitalization of 3.9 trillion yen ($36.24 billion). 
Regarding new Takeda shares, analysts said any issuance could lead to a further drop in demand for Takeda stock. They also said there were concerns over whether Takeda may end up overpaying - an accusation frequently leveled at Japanese firms investing overseas.
CLSA analyst Stephen Barker, however, wrote in a client note earlier in the week that a successful bid would likely see Takeda's share price rise as the deal would greatly increase the Japanese drugmaker's earnings per share. 
Under British takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away.
British Botox maker Allergan (NYSE:AGN) PLC also said it was considering an offer for Shire before deciding otherwise.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  China Huarong Asset Management  Co (HK:2799) confirmed its chairman Lai Xiaomin, who is under investigation for alleged corruption, had stepped down, sparking an 11 percent tumble in shares of the nation's biggest bad debt manager on Friday. 
Reuters reported earlier this week, citing sources, that a senior banking regulator official would take the helm at state-owned Huarong after China's anti-corruption watchdog launched a probe into Lai for ""serious discipline violations"", a euphemism for graft.
Huarong said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange late on Thursday that Lai's departure ""will not cause any adverse impact to the business.""
Wang Zhanfeng, head of the Guangdong branch of China's banking regulator, had been lined up as its new chairman and Li Xin, chief supervisor of China Orient Asset Management Co Ltd, would be named president of Huarong, it said.
Investors sold down the stock sharply when trading resumed on Friday after being halted earlier this week. The Hong Kong-listed shares fell 11 percent, their biggest one-day drop, to hit their lowest level since January last year in a slightly softer wider market (HSI). 
""People are holding back on companies haunted by similar issues involving management, worried that they might face some other hurdles even after a management reshuffle,"" said Steven Leung, a sales director at UOB Kay Hian. He added that the new chairman's regulatory background was viewed as a long-term positive.
Huarong hit the headlines this year after building up a 36 percent stake in a key unit of embattled private energy company CEFC China Energy which is acquiring a $9.1 billion stake in Russia's oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN).
The investigation into Lai makes him the latest in a long line of top Chinese executives coming under fire as China looks to rein in risks in the financial sector, targeting riskier lending practices and high levels of corporate debt.

Huarong Investment Stock Corp Ltd (HK:2277) and Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd (HK:0993) - which also earlier suspended trading of their shares - both dropped over 10 percent in late trade on Friday.

(Reuters) - Consumer activists and technology experts are advising consumers to hold off on buying Android handsets from China's ZTE until the company clarifies whether U.S. sanctions against the company prevent it from providing operating system updates for its devices.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday banned U.S. companies from providing components, software and other technology to ZTE, saying it was punishing the company for violating the terms of a settlement agreement.
ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) responded by suspending trading of its shares on Chinese stock markets and delaying an earnings release. But it has provided no guidance to consumers on how the ban will affect its ability to provide updates to the Android operating system from Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google unit. 
Sources with two mobile carriers told Reuters on Wednesday that ZTE had yet to advise them as to whether it will be able to keep delivering such updates, which patch security vulnerabilities, add new functionality and improve battery life. 
ZTE did not respond to requests for comment and Google declined comment when asked if the order means it can no longer provide Android updates.
Jamie Court, president of Los Angeles-based advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, called on ZTE, Google and carriers to tell consumers how the ban will impact their ability to service the Chinese company's phones. 
""They certainly shouldn’t be selling new phones if they aren’t sure they can update them,"" Court said. 
ZTE phones were available for sale on Thursday through websites of major U.S. carriers and retailers including AT&T Inc (N:T), Sprint Corp (N:S),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT). 
Verizon and Sprint declined to comment. AT&T, Best Buy and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.Some technology analysts advised consumers not to buy the phones until it is clear whether they can be updated. 
""Sufficient uncertainty exists that it would not be prudent to buy a ZTE phone,"" said John Jackson, a consumer technology analyst with market research firm IDC. 
Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, said he expects U.S. carriers and retailers will sell out current ZTE inventories, then stop selling the Chinese company's handsets.
ZTE smartphones should still function if they do not get future Android updates, but users will not be able add new features or install patches to protect the devices against newly discovered security threats, according to Entner.
""People are stuck,"" Entner said.
Some frustrated customers turned to support forums on Reddit and ZTE's website with questions on warranties, repairs and future security patches that went unanswered.
""I wonder how long we will have to wait to get an actual statement from ZTE,"" one user wrote Monday on ZTE's website.
""I doubt at this stage they are going to find anyway through this ban."" 
Canadian privacy advocate Michael Geist said that ZTE and the U.S. government should figure out a way to tweak the order so that it does not undermine the security of millions of people using the company's phones by preventing them from accessing security updates.

""It’s consumers who will ultimately pay the price if their phones are vulnerable,"" Geist said.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 08:19PM ET</span>",Wall Street regulator sanctions Tezos cryptocurrency project co-founder,"By Anna Irrera, Steve Stecklow and John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Wall Street regulator has suspended the co-founder of the controversial Tezos cryptocurrency project from associating with broker-dealers for two years, part of a settlement to resolve allegations that he made false statements about his side venture while working at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fined Arthur Breitman $20,000 for the alleged violations, which he neither admitted nor denied, in an agreement dated April 18.
The action follows a Reuters investigation https://reut.rs/2gPOMNH published in October that found Breitman, a French citizen registered with FINRA, had not reported any outside business activities while working at Morgan Stanley in 2014 and 2015 when he was developing and pitching Tezos.
FINRA requires registered securities professionals to provide prior written notice to their employer to conduct outside business activities if there is ""reasonable expectation of compensation.""
""Breitman did not notify Morgan Stanley at any time that he was engaging in these outside business activities,"" FINRA said in the settlement agreement.
Breitman also falsely attested on two Morgan Stanley compliance questionnaires that he had disclosed all outside business activities to the Wall Street bank, according to the agreement.
Tezos raised $232 million in July through an initial coin offering, an online fundraiser where new virtual currencies are issued to buyers. It has since been embroiled in controversy and has yet to issue any tokens to its contributors.
""The settlement with FINRA is unrelated to and has no impact on the launch of the Tezos network,"" Sarah Lightdale, an attorney for Breitman, said in a statement. ""Arthur cooperated fully with FINRA at all times and Arthur is pleased to put this personal matter behind him.""
A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment. Breitman left the bank in 2016 and is not currently associated with a broker-dealer, according to his FINRA record.
In an interview last June, Breitman's wife, Kathleen, who is Tezos's other co-founder, told Reuters, ""We made all the proper disclosures. It was a hobby, you know. And like there was never any intention to really commercialize any of the software.""
But Reuters reported that a copy of a ""Tezos Business Plan"" from early 2015 listed Arthur Breitman as chief executive and projected that if the company survived 15 years, it would be worth between $2 billion and $20 billion.
In its findings the regulator cited the ""Business Plan,"" and alleged that Breitman broke a FINRA rule that such communications may not make any exaggerated or unwarranted claims, opinions or forecasts.
""The Business Plan failed to provide a balanced presentation and sound basis for evaluating an investment in Tezos,"" the settlement agreement said.
Reuters also reported that in an email Arthur Breitman sent to an acquaintance in early 2015, he said he was seeking to create a business based on Tezos but was trying not to be associated publicly with the project. He had published two papers about Tezos under a pseudonym, L. M. Goodman.
He also expressed concern that his activities might conflict with his employment at Morgan Stanley, according to messages reviewed by Reuters.

In its findings, FINRA said ""Breitman's use of the L.M. Goodman pseudonym to promote Tezos … effectively concealed Breitman's involvement with Tezos from"" Morgan Stanley.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>","Odebrecht struggles to get loans, as bond deadline looms: sources","By Carolina Mandl and Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian engineering conglomerate Odebrecht SA has not yet secured new bank loans that it has requested to honor bond payments due next week, four sources with knowledge of the matter said, raising the possibility of a default triggering some $3 billion in early repayments.
Talks with Brazil's biggest lenders, including Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4),  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB11) and state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) are still ongoing, but it has been difficult to accommodate the different interests among lenders, the sources said this week. 
If Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] fails to line up fresh loans, it is not clear the group will have enough cash to honor a 500 million reais ($150 million) 2018 bond repayment due on April 25, three of the sources said. Other bond-related payments over the next 10 days from Thursday amount to $11 million.
In a statement to Reuters on Thursday, Odebrecht said it was engaged in talks with its creditors. It did not respond to questions about its plans for bond payments due next week. The banks declined to comment.
Odebrecht was forced to deleverage rapidly after it was ensnared in Brazil's largest-ever corruption probe. It has admitted to paying bribes from Peru to Panama and has paid $3.5 billion in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland.
The last financial statement available to creditors showed a $700 million cash position in September, one of the sources said, but its current cash position is unclear.
A final decision among Odebrecht's creditors is expected early next week, the sources added.
Cross default clauses on the bonds mean that a default on next week's payments would trigger early repayment of almost $3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Brazilian company, said Sarah Leshner Carvalho, director for Latin America corporate credit research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
In recent weeks, Odebrecht has urged banks to extend new loans amounting to 3.2 billion reais ($945 million), arguing that its stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA (SA:BRKM5), has grown in value as the shares climbed 56 percent in the last 12 months.
Odebrecht's 38 percent stake in Braskem is already pledged as collateral to the banks and its dividends are also directed to creditors to serve part of Odebrecht's total 70 billion reais ($21 billion) in debt. 
In previous debt refinancing, Odebrecht had agreed to accelerate the sale of assets to repay debt.
So far, it has committed to selling 12 billion reais in assets, but has only received around 7 billion reais, one of the sources said. The main problem is in Peru, where the conglomerate has not received proceeds of the sale of its Chaglla hydropower plant and Olmos irrigation unit.
That has left Odebrecht pressing banks for a lifeline, with limited success so far.
Some private-sector banks have agreed to provide new loans to Odebrecht if they get preferential rights as creditors, a condition which displeased other lenders, two sources said. 
Other banks have refused to provide more cash, but at least one waived debt limits previously imposed, according to another source.
In the talks with creditors, Odebrecht has agreed to sell its Braskem stake within two years to repay the debt, according to one of the sources.
Odebrecht has discussed hiring the Brazilian unit of investment bank Moelis & Co as advisor, two of the sources said, but the bank would only have a mandate in the event of a debt restructuring.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is close to settling a record fine of $1 billion imposed by two U.S. regulators for its risk management business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
Last week, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed Wells Fargo to pay the penalty to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses at the third largest U.S. bank.
Wells Fargo declined to comment. 
The CFPB had been readying sanctions alongside the OCC, Wells Fargo's day-to-day regulator. https://reut.rs/2IGwTwi
The bank, still smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, found inconsistencies at its auto lending and mortgage in the summer of 2017, leading to further probes by regulators.
To appease investors and regulators, the bank overhauled its operational structure, shook up its board and hired a new compliance officer.

616,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2018 06:23AM ET</span>",Australia vows crackdown on corporate misconduct as bank inquiry claims AMP scalp,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian inquiry into financial sector misconduct claimed its first scalp on Friday as the CEO of the country's largest wealth manager stepped down over revelations of board-level deception and misappropriation of funds.
The departure of AMP Ltd's (AX:AMP) Craig Meller came as the government vowed to double prison terms for financial crimes, dramatically increase penalties and ramp up the investigative powers of the corporate regulator following shocking admissions of misconduct to the Royal Commission inquiry.
Not only has the start of the year-long inquiry been a publicity disaster for Australia's major lenders, it has also put the conservative government - which had initially opposed a commission despite years of scandals including rate-rigging and alleged money-laundering - in a tight spot.
Faced with daily revelations of wrongdoing at the highest levels of corporate Australia, the government is now under mounting pressure to extend the inquiry beyond its February 2019 deadline, meaning it would run concurrently with the next federal election.
Treasurer Scott Morrison, who once dismissed opposition calls for a Royal Commission as ""crass populism"", on Friday said the government would raise criminal penalties for corporate crimes to a maximum of 10 years in jail, from 5 years currently. 
Offending companies would face fines up to A$210 million ($162 million), versus A$10 million now. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) would get the power to intercept internal communications of companies if necessary, Morrison said.
""They are not victimless crimes,"" Morrison told a press conference. ""We need to set the tone ... so people understand that misleading regulators about serious issues such as this is no victimless offence, and it won't carry a victimless penalty.""
The changes were the result of years of planning and were not a knee-jerk reaction to the inquiry, he said. 
""PERSONALLY DEVASTATED""
AMP executives admitted in testimony this week that the company had lied to the corporate watchdog for almost a decade to cover a practice of charging customers for services it did not provide.
Chairman Catherine Brenner issued an unreserved apology for ""misconduct and failures in regulatory disclosures in our advice business"", as she announced Meller's exit along with a review of the company's governance. 
Government data prepared for the Royal Commission, which has the power to subpoena documents and compel top executives to testify in public, shows more than 80,000 consumers have been given bad advice by financial institutions over the past decade, costing them a total A$5 billion ($3.9 billion).
This week's hearings have been particularly brutal. 
A nurse gave tearful testimony on Thursday about losing her home after taking advice from Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), while lawyers presented evidence that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the country's biggest bank, knowingly charged dead clients for counsel for years.
But the revelations about AMP for the first time showed direct board-level involvement in hiding misconduct from ASIC, leading to calls for the watchdog to play a far more aggressive role than it has in the past.
MELLER'S EXIT NOT ENOUGH
The Australian Shareholders' Association said Meller's resignation was ""not sufficient"" and called for Brenner to explain the board's involvement in the case or step down.
The ASA ""wants to ask Catherine Brenner about the reported interference with the production of the independent report"", it said in a statement.
""If this is not able to be provided, her position as chair is untenable and she should resign,"" said the ASA.
""The ASA is having further discussions with the company to assess how rigorous these directors are in dealing with the ongoing issues,"" it added.
The association represented about 700 shareholders at the last AMP annual general meeting, the ASA website shows.
AMP shares have lost over A$1.2 billion in market value since the revelations came to light on Tuesday. The stock ended down 0.5 percent on Friday, in a weak overall market (AXJO).
Meller said he was ""personally devastated by the issues which have been raised publicly this week"", and while he did not condone making misleading statements to the regulator they had occurred under his watch so his resignation was appropriate.
""This is not the AMP I know and these are not the actions our customers should expect from the company."" 
AMP Director Mike Wilkins, a former CEO of Australia's biggest general insurer,  Insurance Australia Group Ltd  (AX:IAG), will step in as AMP's acting chief until a permanent replacement for Meller is found, the company added.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Firearms companies widely held in ETFs and funds: research firm,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - An estimated 24 percent of the world's exchange-traded funds and 15 percent of mutual funds have holdings in firearms companies, researcher Sustainalytics said in a report on Thursday, levels it said might be ""more pervasive than some investors realize."" 
The report shows the potential influence of fund firms like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group Inc with firearms companies. Both fund companies face consumer pressure over those investments and one activist's talk of boycotting the firms.
Both asset managers in turn questioned firearms makers after a shooting at a Florida high school left 17 people dead in February, the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history.
Sustainalytics found that holdings of the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF included investments in 21 companies in a range of firearms-related businesses including retailers. Together they represent less than one percent of the ETF's total assets, however.
Filings show fund holdings include two large gunmakers, Sturm Ruger & Co and Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands Corp. 
The report also showed both firearms makers and others underperformed the index on which the fund is based. 
""In some cases, holding stakes in these companies can take a toll on the total returns of an investment portfolio,"" report co-author Martin Vezer said via e-mail.
Just how fund companies should treat investments in gunmakers has become an issue among activists. David Hogg, a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre, on April 17 tweeted a call to boycott BlackRock and Vanguard over their gunmaker holdings. 
But other gun control activists have not called for boycotts or divestment, saying that investors instead can seek changes from the weapons industry like requiring completed background checks or reducing straw purchases.
""We generally don't recommend divestment, because once you do, you lose the right to make shareholder resolutions and otherwise demand answers from a company's board of directors,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Washington, D.C.
Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann said most of its funds do not directly invest in top gunmakers, and that it has been meeting with those firms and distributors to discuss their risk-mitigation plans.
BlackRock has said it is also questioning gun companies over their safety practices, and earlier this month said it would offer new investment strategies and ETFs that exclude gunmakers and retailers.

620,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 04:32PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, April 20.
1. Fed Speak, Bond Yields in Focus
In what will be a light day for economic data, Federal Reserve officials’ Charles Evans and John Williams will wrap up a week of Fed speeches, which have mostly echoed the Fed’s narrative of gradual rate hikes and improving inflationary pressures.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will deliver a speech at 09:40 ET, and New York Fed President John Williams at 11:15 am ET.
Williams said on Tuesday that while an inverted yield curve “is a powerful signal of recessions” the current flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is “totally normal” as the Fed continues to hikes rates. “ I don’t see the signs yet of an inverted yield curve,” he added.
The yield curve, however, steepened on Thursday as the U.S. 10Y bond yields rose above 2.9%, supporting an uptick in the U.S. dollar index amid optimism on the U.S. economy and inflationary pressures.
USD/CAD will be closely watched as Canada released its consumer price inflation data for March at 08:30 am ET.
2. Earnings: All Eyes on General Electric
Focus on earnings will continue to drive sentiment in stock markets as a slew of names report corporate earnings Friday.
Some of the more notable names due to report earnings before U.S. markets open include  General Electric  Company (NYSE:GE), Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) and Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB).
An earnings report from General Electric, or GE, is expected to be the pick of the bunch. The firm’s guidance will be closely watched as firm has previously downplayed investor expectations that guidance will be cut.
GE’s share price slumped earlier this week after Goldman analyst Joe Ritchie said in a note to clients that a cut to the outlook is ""almost a certainty.""
3. OPEC Meeting, Baker Hughes Rig Count Data on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday at 1:00 pm ET, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rose for the second straight week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Investors will also monitor the outcome from the joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting slated for Friday expected to confirm OPEC and its allies continued compliance with the pact to curb production.
The production cut-agreement has nearly eliminated the glut in global crude supplies, which stood at just 12 million barrels above the five-year average in March, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.
Crude futures retreated from a nearly three-and-a-half year high as traders appeared to take profit on the recent rally in oil prices."

NEW YORK (LPC) - Regulated banks are underwriting more highly leveraged buyout loans for US companies as the Republican administration relaxes guidelines aimed at reducing risk, which is leveling the playing field with unregulated lenders again.
Banks overseen by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) are pitching debt packages with leverage of 7.5 times and 7.75 times, respectively, on the auctions for roofing distributor SRS Distribution and education software company Renaissance Learning, several leveraged finance bankers said. 
These levels are far higher than the six times leverage limit adopted by regulators in 2013 to curb risky lending. To comply with the guidelines, credits also had to be able to repay all senior debt or half of total debt within five to seven years from free cash flow.
Leverage levels on buyout financing led by regulated banks have averaged 5.5 times since 3Q17, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. 
“For good assets, regulated banks are doing whatever they want,” a senior leveraged finance banker said. 
Constraints imposed by the leveraged lending guidance paved the way for nonregulated banks and lenders such as Jefferies, Nomura, Macquarie and KKR Capital Markets to pick up the slack and grab market share as regulated peers stepped back. 
Buyout financing led by non-regulated lenders has carried leverage of 6.98 times on average since the third quarter of 2017, the data shows. 
Regulated banks are currently capitalizing on the opportunity to win back lost ground as the political environment continues to undermine enforcement, sources said.
Investors appear to be willing to lend to more highly leveraged buyouts, particularly credits that they know and like, such as SRS, which has been through two buyouts already.
“ (SRS) has been LBO’d twice before. Both were homeruns for private equity guys and debt investors. The deal has been a race to the bottom in terms of leverage, pricing and terms,” a senior leveraged finance banker said. 
“Renaissance is a good business, the pay down works, and we like the space,” another senior leveraged finance banker said.
LAISSEZ FAIRE 
The OCC, alongside the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), in 2013 updated guidance on leveraged lending to improve underwriting standards and banks’ risk management framework.
Exceeding the six times leverage limit previously allowed regulators to censure banks and even impose penalty fees if the ratios could not be reasonably justified.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) was famously singled out in 2014. 
“Back in the day, creditworthiness didn’t matter,” a senior coverage banker said. “You’d pick when to go above 6.5 times, but no way would you go above 7.0 times.”
The Trump administration is taking a more lenient approach. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of the US Congress, said in October that leveraged lending guidance is subject to Congressional review, which means that it could be overturned. 
In February, Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting said that he supports banks transgressing guidelines as long as they have enough capital and it does not impair their safety and soundness. President Donald Trump is continuing to nominate new business-friendly policy makers to fill vacancies on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. 
The rise in leverage offered by regulated banks could drive leverage provided by non-regulated banks and lenders even higher in response, bankers said. 
“It seems difficult at these kinds of levels but if the demand for new paper continues to be there, it could happen,” a syndicate head said.
PUSHING HIGHER
Financing for the buyouts of food contract manufacturer Hearthside Food Solutions and packaging machinery company ProMach, and the merger of education technology firms PowerSchool and PeopleAdmin also highlight the trend. 
The buyout of Hearthside Food Solutions by private equity firms Charlesbank Capital Partners and Partners Group has leverage of 7.0 times, sources said. The financing will be led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which ran the sale process and provided staple financing. 
Staple leverage was increased from around 6.5 times during the process so the banks would remain competitive, the sources noted. Regulated banks offered leverage above 7.0 times, but the new owners opted for a more conservative debt profile. 
Private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners’ buyout of ProMach was backed by a 7.3 times-levered debt package, underwritten by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Goldman Sachs, sources said. The transaction closed in March. 
Financing for the tie-up of Vista Equity Partners-backed education technology companies PowerSchool and PeopleAdmin has a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of around 7.5 times, sources said. It will be led by Barclays and Credit Suisse, they said. Private equity firm Onex Corporation is investing and will be an equal equity owner in the combined company.  
The apparent willingness to extend credit beyond recent norms is also a function of investor demand. Regulated banks are not offering higher leverage indiscriminately, sources said. 
“It’s situation specific, and depends on valuation and margins,” a leveraged finance head said.
Barclays and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, SRS sponsor Berkshire Partners and Renaissance Learning sponsor Hellman & Friedman did not respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The bronze statue of a little girl that became a tourism phenomenon by staring down Wall Street's massive ""Charging Bull"" sculpture is to be moved to a nearby spot where its stern gaze will be on the male-dominated New York Stock Exchange, city officials said on Thursday.
""Fearless Girl,"" whose message is for a bigger role for women in corporate America and whose appearance in lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women's Day last year sparked a social media sensation, will be moved by the end of 2018, officials said.
""She is a powerful symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America — and she will become a durable part of our city's civic life,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.
Although the diminutive 50-inch (127-cm) statue was originally intended to be planted in front of the ""Charging Bull"" for only a week in March 2017, the city extended its stay by another 11 months after an outpouring of support.
The planned move, which officials said was prompted in part by traffic safety concerns, will place ""Fearless Girl"" in a pedestrian-only area at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, the site of George Washington's inauguration in 1789 as the country's first president, where it will face the NYSE.
""We eagerly await the arrival of Fearless Girl to her fitting new home, standing her ground and training her unblinking eyes on our engine of progress and free enterprise,” NYSE President Thomas Farley said in a statement.
The statue was originally part of a gender diversity campaign by  State Street  Global Advisors, a subsidiary of State Street Corp (N:STT), which said last year that 25 percent of the largest 3,000 U.S. companies have no female directors. 
Since the appearance of ""Fearless Girl,"" more than 150 companies have added a woman to their boards, State Street Global Advisors President Cyrus Taraporevala said.
The firm has had its own gender-related issues, agreeing to pay $5 million last October to settle U.S. Labor Department allegations that it underpaid female and black executives. It also opted not to use its equity clout last year in seven of eight shareholder resolutions to enhance boardroom diversity. 
""Fearless Girl"" is not without detractors, including Arturo Di Modica, who objected to the placement in front of his “Charging Bull.""

Although city officials said they are looking into moving ""Charging Bull"" as well, Di Modica's lawyer, Norman Siegel, said the sculptor would need to give his permission, and has yet to be contacted about it.

(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) said on Thursday that board member and digital media executive Ynon Kreiz will replace Chief Executive Margaret Georgiadis, who is stepping down after only 14 months at the helm of the maker of Hot Wheels and Barbie dolls.
Mattel, whose shares have lost nearly half their value in the past year under Georgiadis' tenure, is facing weak demand for its well-known toys at a time when children increasingly prefer videogames.
The bankruptcy and liquidation of Mattel's top customer and toy retailer Toys 'R' Us has heaped more pressure on the company and highlighted the troubled retail environment.
Kreiz is a former head of digital media company Maker Studios, which assembled a stable of YouTube stars and was acquired by Walt  Disney  (N:DIS).
Kreiz's appointment as CEO, effective April 26, will likely help Mattel shift its focus toward using entertainment to increase Mattel's brand equity and revenue, Global Toy Experts CEO Richard Gottlieb said. 
""It appears that the Mattel board is betting that Kreiz, with his history in entertainment, can turn things around,"" he added.
The departure of Georgiadis, a technology executive hired from Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) to modernize Mattel, caught some experts by surprise.
""I think the high tech experience that Margo had maybe wasn't just working out,"" said Jackie Breyer, editor-in-chief of The Toy Book, a trade magazine covering the toy industry. ""The idea is to try and get a fresh start especially in the wake of the Toys R Us liquidation."" 
Under Georgiadis's leadership, Mattel ramped up efforts to cut costs, replaced veteran finance chief Kevin Farr in September and suspended its dividend.
Georgiadis will serve in an advisory role at Mattel until May 10, after which she will take over the role of chief executive in genealogy website Ancestry.com.
Kreiz, who also served previously as chairman and CEO of television production company Endemol Group, said that as the new head of Mattel he would make more use of its IP that includes iconic consumer brands such as American Girl and Fisher-Price.
Kreiz will become chairman of the board after his election at an annual shareholders' meeting slated for May 17, Mattel said. 
Mattel is scheduled to release its first-quarter results on April 26 and its conference call will be hosted by executives including Georgiadis.

The company's shares closed down 3.2 percent at $13.45 and were up 1 percent in extended trading.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federal oversight board on Thursday approved a fiscal turnaround plan that includes pension cuts and labor reforms that Governor Ricardo Rossello has vowed to defy, portending the latest potential court battle over the bankrupt U.S. territory's future.
At a hearing in San Juan, broadcast via the internet, the seven-member board voted 6-1 to certify a plan that forecasts $6.7 billion in debt payment ability for Puerto Rico through 2023. Board member Ana Matosantos was the lone dissenter.
Tasked with helping Puerto Rico recover from the dual scourges of fiscal insolvency and natural disaster, the board green-lighted its plan after unsuccessful negotiations with Rossello on a consensual framework.
The governor has opposed labor and pension reforms, insisting the board lacks the authority to impose steps that would require legislation.
If Puerto Rican leaders refuse to implement such measures, the board could sue to enforce them, sparking more litigation over the details of Puerto Rico's path to solvency.
The island's bankruptcy has already seen months of costly litigation among stakeholders competing for the island's limited resources. 
Puerto Rico filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history last year, owing $71.5 billion of bonds and $50 billion in pension obligations. It then suffered catastrophic damage from September's Hurricane Maria. 
""We will not propose any bill that reduces vacation and/or sick leave,"" Rossello said in a written statement on Thursday, adding that it was ""wrong and immoral to reduce the benefits"" of public worker pensions.
The board's plan would slash pensions 10 percent on average, though specific cuts would vary according to income. 
With pensions virtually insolvent, current benefits could cost more than $1 billion a year from the island's general fund.
""The reality is that the employment retirement system is less than 1 percent funded, which means the pensions that people expect ... could not be paid without these reforms,"" Natalie Jaresko, the board's executive director, said at the hearing.
The board's plan would loosen private-sector job security that is stronger than almost any U.S. state's, eliminate mandatory Christmas bonuses, and halve paid leave.
It also calls for headcount reductions, putting layoffs on the table if targets cannot be achieved through attrition. 
Puerto Rico's benchmark general obligation bond traded at 42.6 cents on the dollar on Thursday, while senior sales tax-backed debt traded at about 60 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The board also approved turnaround plans on Thursday for Puerto Rico's beleaguered power authority, PREPA, and water authority PRASA.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T (N:T) CEO Randall Stephenson said on Thursday his company's bid to buy movie and TV show maker  Time Warner  (N:TWX) would allow the two firms to serve customers better by lowering pay TV rates, rejecting government arguments the deal would raise consumer prices.
Speaking in U.S. District Court in Washington, Stephenson addressed himself to Judge Richard Leon who will decide if the $85 billion deal may go forward. He said that he wanted to combine what AT&T knew about its customers with Time Warner's ability to create compelling content.
Stephenson disagreed with the government's assessment that the transaction would mean higher prices for consumers. ""On its face, the premise is absurd,"" he said. ""It literally defies logic to me.""
Instead, the deal would help AT&T, which owns the biggest pay TV company DirecTV, build a cheaper online product that could be partially sustained through advertising, he said.
The government has argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows. It has also said that the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services in order to slow their development. 
Stephenson's testimony mirrored what Time Warner (N:TWX) Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said on Wednesday. He also argued the deal would help the companies better compete for advertising dollars with internet giants like Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google and Facebook (O:FB).
The Justice Department introduced an email exchange between Stephenson and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in which the pair discussed ways they could work together on advertising, but Stephenson said nothing came of the exchange.
Like Bewkes, Stephenson dismissed the idea that AT&T would seek to use Time Warner content exclusively, saying the best financial strategy was to ensure it was as widely seen as possible.
Stephenson said that AT&T had initially thought to buy several small content companies - a “string of pearls” – but when that failed it decided to pursue one large company in Time Warner, a ""head-snapper moment.""
He telephoned Bewkes to invite him to lunch, Stephenson said. ""A quick lunch turned into a very long afternoon,"" he said, as they began to discuss a deal. ""We both got very excited about it.""
But Stephenson also acknowledged sending an email that expressed concern that Time Warner was taking a stake in the online service Hulu, apparently concerned that it would hurt AT&T's online product.
Judge Leon asked Stephenson about AT&T's offer to go to arbitration with rival pay TV companies if they feel that they are being charged too much for Time Warner content. The arrangement is similar to one struck between the Justice Department and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) when it won approval to buy NBCU. Both are good for seven years.
""You modeled that on Comcast?"" Leon asked.
""Yes,"" Stephenson said.
Following Stephenson, the government called Ron Quintero, an accounting expert who had evaluated AT&T's estimated cost savings and revenue increases used to defend the proposed merger. Quintero said that in many of its calculations, AT&T simply estimated a percentage reduction in expenditures with no data to support it. 

The trial, which began in mid-March, is expected to wrap up this month.

NEW YORK (LPC) - The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) is developing a standard industry framework for Green loans to allow more activity in the U.S., which is lagging the European loan market due to a previous lack of corporate and regulatory support.
The LSTA kicked off its first meeting on Tuesday to develop a set of Green loan principles. It is likely to mirror the framework that the European Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA) set out in March. 
“The key takeaway was that alignment with the Green Bond Principles and alignment with the LMA and APLMA Green Loan Principles is paramount,” said Tess Virmani, senior vice president and associate general counsel of the LSTA.
Under the LMA and the APLMA’s principles, a Green loan’s proceeds have to fund green projects that provide clear environmental benefits. This would be a special purpose loan issued by a pure-play company in the sustainability space. 
“It’s a narrower product,” Virmani said. “Corporate loans are often for general corporate purposes which is broader than funding one or more green projects as a use of proceeds Green loan might be. Ultimately, we would want to have a framework broad enough to be applicable to all market segments and types of facilities.”
ESG-TIED
To appeal to the general corporate loan market, a new type of Green loan has emerged in Europe. These are general purpose loans whose interest margins are linked to a company’s overall sustainability achievements, such as gas emission reduction and nutrition education programs development. 
For example, France’s Danone in February refinanced its €2bn revolving credit facility that includes a payable margin adjustment mechanism based on scores of companies’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance provided by third-party researchers, LPC previously reported.
These sustainability-improvement revolving credit facilities are growing more than traditional Green loans in Europe, said Jorge Gonzalez, global head of corporate loans at BBVA (MC:BBVA).
“There’s no use of proceeds and it’s just for general corporate purposes,” Gonzalez said. “The pricing is based on the ESG score of the company.”
However, those ESG-linked loans use a different model that doesn’t connect with the LMA’s Green Loan Principles, said Heather Lang, executive director of sustainable finance solutions at Sustainalytics, which is one of the ESG rating providers on Danone’s deal. 
The LSTA aims to ultimately incorporate both types of green credits in its principles to allow more of the corporate loan appetite, according to Virmani.
LAGGING EUROPE
The Green loan market in the U.S. is almost non-existent compared to Europe where companies are refinancing to include green principles, such as Spanish utility  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE) SA, which raised a record €5.3bn Green loan in January. Green loan volume was €19bn in March.  
“Most of the Green or sustainability-linked loans have involved European issuers and lending institutions,” Lang said. “I’m not aware of any Green loans involving U.S. issuers to date.”
Having a standard framework in place will help to encourage more Green loan activity in the U.S., but the problem is rooted in corporate engagement in green initiatives and the lack of regulatory support.
“European shareholders and stakeholders seem to be more vocal in their support for a move towards green and sustainability and there is regulatory support as well,” LSTA’s Virmani said. “So it may be easier for European companies to justify any additional cost from monitoring, reporting and third party verification because there’s so much goodwill achieved in doing a Green loan or bond.” 
“I don’t know if most companies here have been able to make that tradeoff yet, but it is early days,” she added. 
But the popularity of green lending among European banks is expected to trickle down to the U.S. sooner or later.
“Europe is way ahead of the U.S. in terms of Green loans, but more and more U.S. companies are starting to get interested,” BBVA’s Genzalez said. “It’s going to happen no matter what. Utility companies are normally the first ones to come to the market.”
BBVA is the facility agent and sustainability agent on the Iberdrola SA’s €5.3bn loan. The bank was involved in 11 Green loan transactions in Europe and Latin America in 2017.

636,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Fed Will Accept a Recession Before It Allows High Inflation,"(Bloomberg Prophets) -- Don’t worry about faster inflation. The Federal Reserve has a history over the past two decades of snuffing out consumer-price increases before they take hold. Instead, worry that even modest inflation could compel the Fed to undertake a late-cycle acceleration in the pace of tightening.
Inflation is rebounding in line with the Fed’s expectations, as weak numbers from last March drop out of the year-over-year comparisons. The weakness of last year was indeed transitory, and, on the back of a low unemployment rate, central bankers expect inflation to firm up a bit more and modestly overshoot the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2019. Policy makers expect inflation to peak near 2.1 percent this cycle, according to the latest projections.
Even as inflation picks up, any fears of high inflation seem unwarranted. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, for example, has made the case that the economy is set for a case of stagflation unlike any since the 1970s. Indeed, it is fairly easy to draw such parallels. The Fed anticipates that unemployment will fall to 3.6 percent, a level it hasn’t reached since the late 1960s. Add on fiscal stimulus when the economy already operates near or beyond full employment, and the parallels grow even more eerie.
This Fed, however, is likely to act well before inflation rises enough to destabilize expectations. This is the takeaway of the central bank’s policy actions since the low and stable era of inflation began in the mid-1990s. The Fed hasn’t faced a period of high consumer-price inflation since then. Instead, the Fed’s main challenge has been fighting high unemployment.
This indicates that worrying about high inflation is unwarranted. The Fed has proved time and time again that it will act long before such concerns become relevant. New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley, who will soon step down, made this clear this week:
The Fed is prepared to accelerate the pace of hikes if inflation makes an appearance. Still, what’s an “appreciable margin”? It’s hard to know exactly as the Fed has a specific inflation target of 2 percent rather than a range around that target. But based on their past behavior, central bankers are likely to be comfortable with core inflation within a 25 basis-point range of their 2 percent target as long as their forecast anticipated a return to target within a medium-term time horizon.
Let’s say, however, that a 25 basis-point overshoot is too hawkish and assume central bankers would tolerate a more dovish 50 basis-point overshoot. That would mean the worst-case scenario is that the Fed allows inflation to drift up to 2.5 percent and expect it to remain there or higher before central bankers accelerate the pace of rate hikes. That’s not exactly high inflation. It is certainly nothing like the stagflation of the 1970s.
In short, if there is any hint of sustained inflation at this stage of the business cycle -- with low unemployment threatening to go lower with fiscal stimulus -- past behavior indicates the Fed will risk and accept a recession before it allows a truly high inflationary environment to develop. That means your medium-term risk is more recessionary than inflationary. The caveat, however, is that it assumes the Fed remains independent. That independence will be tested as soon as it tightens policy sufficiently to slow the economy, and the testing will rise in tandem with the risk of recession.

LONDON (Reuters) - It's long been a financial market truism that if everyone already owns a particular stock, bond or security, there's no one left to buy and the only way for the price to go is down.
That's easy to assert, less easy to measure. 
But a long-running and widely followed monthly survey of global investors by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) has recently gained a reputation for accurately spotting where the herd is nearing a cliff edge.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch's fund manager survey polls several asset managers every month on various investment trends. Among the questions participants answer is what they consider to be the 'most crowded trade' in world markets. 
Since the end of last year, the ""most-crowded"" trades featured in the survey have all unravelled in a short space of time following the poll's publication.
(For a graphic on 'Evolution of BAML Global Fund Manager Survey ""most crowded trade"" click https://reut.rs/2JUjCC0)
Take December for instance. The most-crowded trade according to the survey, published on December 19, was to go long, or buy and hold Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) had soared to a record high of $19,666 by mid-December, before worries of a regulatory clampdown on cryptocurrency exchanges in January quickly deflated what many in the investment world were calling one of the biggest asset price bubbles in history.

The virtual currency now trades at less than half its peak value -- near the $8,000 mark.
In January, the most-crowded trade highlighted in the survey published on Jan. 16 was shorting, or selling volatility, which had sunk to historically low levels.
Soon after, higher than expected wage growth numbers in the United States prompted a big selloff in stocks and the VIX index (VIX), also known as Wall Street's ""fear-gauge"", posted its biggest one-day spike ever recorded. The VIX is a common proxy for expected stock market volatility.
The spike in the VIX caused major losses at exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which bet on volatility remaining low. Some were forced to shut down.

For February, March and April, the most-crowded trade has been ""Long FAANG + BAT"", a reference to buying and holding the FAANG (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Google's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) and BAT (LON:BATS) (Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent) groups of technology heavyweight stocks in the United States and China.

So when could that trade pop?
Manish Kabra, head of European equity and quant strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said it is not unusual for a particular asset class to spend months as a ""crowded trade"" on the survey.
""Sometimes it takes a bit of patience ... for what people say are crowded trades to become a contrarian trade. Historically we have seen, for instance, for almost six months people could say the same trades were crowded.""
Kabra noted three instances in the past where there was a strong view to short emerging markets - those calls were followed by the start of a bull market in emerging markets in 2016.
There hasn't been a heavy shakeout in tech stocks yet but they have been rattled in recent weeks over a range of issues, especially increased regulatory scrutiny and the prospect of being caught up in a trade tussle between Washington and Beijing.
The survey shows funds have been overweight technology stocks for over a decade, raising questions about whether the sector is set to suffer the same fate as Bitcoin and short-vol products. 
In the latest poll, 64 percent of investors said they would move to underweight on the sector if anti-trust, tax and privacy regulations ratcheted up. 
So if soaring tech stocks are not next in line for a reversal, what could be? The most recent survey indicates the second most-crowded trade has been growing in conviction: shorting the U.S. dollar. Shorting the dollar has been the second most-crowded trade in the survey since February this year.

643,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Peugeot boss faces toughest adversary yet in IG Metall,"By Laurence Frost and Ilona Wissenbach
PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Group (PA:PEUP) boss Carlos Tavares, whose career has seen him thrash out margin-boosting labor deals for two carmakers in several countries, is now taking on Germany's IG Metall union, which has been the undoing of many a cost cutter.
Under Tavares, a former  Renault  (PA:RENA) executive, the  Peugeot  maker is demanding pay curbs and other concessions from workers at Opel, the loss-making German carmaker it bought from General Motors (N:GM) last year, in return for new investment.
The standoff could quickly take a political turn, amid reports PSA is also looking to shed thousands of jobs. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened publicly on Wednesday, saying PSA must honor commitments made prior to the acquisition - when Tavares told German leaders there were no plans for plant closures or compulsory layoffs.
""We expect above all that the company sticks to everything it promised in connection with the takeover,"" Merkel said at a summit of German state premiers, adding her government was seeking talks with PSA management.
Western carmakers typically use plants in low-cost countries as benchmarks, warning higher-wage workers that failure to narrow the productivity gap could endanger their jobs.
Pressure on manufacturing costs has increased with investment demands for connected, autonomous and electrified car development. GM is now employing similar tactics to seek concessions from its South Korean workforce.
The U.S. carmaker failed to end Opel losses over two decades, hemmed in by German ""codetermination"" laws granting workers board seats and by IG Metall - which has thwarted or altered the plans of companies ranging from Volkswagen to Tesla.
BLUFF CALLED
Tensions have mounted at Opel since German workers called Tavares' bluff last week, by rejecting demands they waive the 4.3 percent pay increase negotiated by IG Metall nationwide.
In response, PSA put investment plans on hold for the Eisenach plant in central Germany, tabling no new proposals. Unions fear the group may now begin planning to wind the plant down, triggering an all-out confrontation.
Eisenach, which will lose Opel Corsa subcompact production after the model is updated next year, would have built the new Grandland SUV under the paused investment, sources have said.
That plan would sustain only about half of the plant's workforce of 1,800, union representative Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug said after a works council meeting on Thursday.
Opel could also cut 2,700-3,700 of the 7,700 jobs at its Ruesselsheim research center under scenarios discussed at the meeting, business magazine Wirtschaftswoche reported.
PSA human resources chief Xavier Chereau had warned of ""consequences"" if IG Metall rebuffed management proposals, after other unions in Spain and Britain agreed concessions, according to a union source with knowledge of the talks.
""We told him IG Metall is not like other unions,"" he said.
FRENCH SQUEEZE
In Europe, French carmakers have led the squeeze on labor, extracting pay freezes and working time flexibility as investment recovered from the last major financial crisis.
Renault, with Tavares as second-in-command, struck a deal with Spanish workers in November 2012. That in turn helped cajole French unions into signing a similar pact three months later. PSA, under then CEO Philippe Varin, followed suit.
Such deals are part of the reason why PSA and Renault now regularly post automotive operating profit margins above 6 percent, compared with their 2-3 percent pre-crisis norms. By contrast, Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) namesake volume brand raised its margin to 4.1 percent last year from 1.8 percent.
Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall lost 179 million euros ($221 million) for a negative 2.5 percent margin in the last five months of 2017, after PSA took control.
The French carmaker has said it discovered the full extent of Opel's problems only once it had closed the acquisition - and months after giving assurances that no closures were necessary.
""IG Metall wants to apply the same methods it always has, which cost Opel 20 years of losses and 50,000 jobs,"" said a source close to the French carmaker.
The French group referred Reuters questions to Opel, which said it remained hopeful that ""codetermination-based dialogue"" would achieve a deal.
""We want to pave the way for a sustainable future by unleashing investments based on the right level of competitiveness,"" a company spokesman said, adding it aimed to avoid ""forced redundancies"".
IG Metall has a history of humbling foreign managers.
Tesla (O:TSLA) became enmeshed in a German labor dispute soon after its 2016 acquisition of robotics specialist Grohmann, before eventually granting a 30 percent wage hike.
In one of its earlier failed attempts to halt Opel losses, GM negotiated the closure of its Bochum plant, north of Cologne - but only at the price of job guarantees for remaining workers of the kind Tavares is now seeking to unpick.
NO GUARANTEES
Staying competitive offers the ""only guarantee"" of future sustainability for PSA workers and sites, the PSA boss is fond of saying.
The group is so far refusing to renew the multi-year job and plant guarantees that typically accompany new production investments, according to sources on both sides of the talks, who asked not to be named. Current guarantees on jobs begin expiring this year, while Opel's plants are covered until 2020.
""New guarantees are not on the table,"" said one. Management is now insisting the unions come back with proposed cuts to Christmas and holiday bonuses and other supplementary pay, to offset the basic wage increase they refused to suspend.
Any PSA concessions on Eisenach would have likely repercussions for Opel's Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern plants and the rest of its 19,000 German workforce. It could also undermine labor agreement across the broader group.
""We too have been through tough times and made considerable sacrifices for a competitiveness deal,"" said Franck Don, a French official with PSA's centrist CFTC union.
""French workers wouldn't understand it if their Opel peers were not asked to make the same concessions they had to make. It would definitely create tensions in France.""
During investor pitches, however, Tavares has placed heavy emphasis on Opel's German identity as a source of export growth potential - a stance that could be undermined by major cuts. 
IG Metall is confident he will give ground, rather than face prolonged German strikes that could further damage Opel's standing and performance, one union official said.
""The brand can't afford to take any more scratches.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) on Thursday called on securities regulators to set international standards for shareholder voting rights, suggesting they resolve one of the thorniest debates in corporate governance.
The world's largest asset manager made the call in a letter to index provider MSCI, which had sought comments about a proposal it is considering to adjust the index weighting of stocks like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) to account for their unequal voting structures.
BlackRock, which manages $6.3 trillion, said while it appreciates the index provider's attention to the issues, MSCI's proposed changes could distort markets. Instead, ""we believe that policymakers, not index providers, should set corporate governance standards,"" it stated in the letter, signed by BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick and posted on the firm's website. 
Since last year a number of high-profile technology firms, including  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT), Dropbox Inc (O:DBX) and  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP), have listed shares with a voting structure that gives lopsided decision-making power to insiders. According to the Council of Institutional Investors, among 124 IPOs in 2017, 23 had unequal voting rights, although some would give outside investors more voting power over time.
Corporate executives say the structures help their firms focus on long-term growth. 
BlackRock and rivals like  State Street  Corp (N:STT) and Vanguard Group have criticized the trend but have bought the shares to fill index funds they say must try to replicate mandated market segments.
MSCI and other providers last year made changes that excluded some stocks with unequal rights, like Snap, from widely followed indexes, including the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000. MSCI said in January it might make further changes after more consultation with clients.
BlackRock's Novick wrote that a global body like the International Organization of Securities Commissions would be well-positioned to suggest listing standards that national regulators could use. A Madrid-based spokeswoman for the organization said it has not undertaken work on the matter.
U.S. regulations are still under development. A committee that advises the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March recommended reforms like clear disclosures of different voting rights and of the risks that could result.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said at the time he would like analysis of related areas like concerns about short-term investing and the attractiveness of U.S. capital markets. In February, Commissioner Robert Jackson said stock exchanges should develop some kind of limit on dual-class structures.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 02:59PM ET</span>",Trump launches effort to boost U.S. weapons sales abroad,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy on Thursday aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it will bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home. 
The White House aims to speed up arms deal approvals and increase the role of senior U.S. officials, including President Donald Trump, in closing foreign sales, while giving greater weight to business interests in sales decisions that have long prioritized human rights.
The initiative, as first reported by Reuters, adds the full weight of government to Trump's direct personal role in pushing arms sales during interactions with foreign heads of state. 
Companies that stand to benefit from the new policy most include  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and the other top U.S. defense contractors,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT),  Raytheon Co  (N:RTN), General Dynamics Corp (N:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC). 
The plans have been in the works for a year, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro playing a major role in driving the project forward. Navarro is best known for pushing the administration to take tough trade actions against China.
Human rights will now carry equal weight alongside other considerations in planned arms sales including the needs of allied nations and the economic loss if the U.S. contractor does not win the sale when decisions are made on whether to approve an arms deal.
""This is a balanced policy,"" said Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, an official with the State Department who oversees arms export agreements. ""We absolutely look at human rights as one of a set of considerations that we look at.""
'SHORT CIRCUIT'
In a joint new conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida, Trump said late on Wednesday his administration was working to ""short circuit"" the cumbersome bureaucratic process at the State Department and the Pentagon to expedite arms sales to Japan and other allies. 
But giving economic and commercial concerns equal weight to human rights in the arms sales decision-making process raises concerns.
""The new policy retains the legally binding language that prohibits weapons transfers when there is actual knowledge that they will be used to commit war crimes,"" Brittany Benowitz a former U.S. Senate staffer and lawyer who worked on human rights issues and arms transfers. 
""However, the policy did away with the more comprehensive assessment of risks when contemplating a weapons deal. A transaction can still occur to a human rights abuser so long as the U.S. has no specific knowledge that system will be used to commit atrocity crimes,"" Benowitz said.
The new policy will go well beyond a relaxation of rules for foreign military sales under President Barack Obama in 2014 that enabled U.S. arms contractors to sell more overseas than ever before. 
The export policy explicitly states it aims to ""strengthen the manufacturing and defense industrial base"" and as a part of this ""when a proposed transfer is in the national security interest, which includes our economic security, and in our foreign policy interest, the executive branch will advocate strongly on behalf of United States companies."" 
Trump has pressed foreign governments to buy more U.S.-made weapons in nearly every call he has had with a head of state of major allies, a State Department official said this week.
The planned revision of U.S. weapons export policy also includes a new drone export policy that allows lethal drones that can fire missiles and surveillance drones of all sizes to soon become more widely available to U.S. allies.
Two potential beneficiaries of the rule changes,  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions Inc (O:KTOS), currently market smaller armed drones internationally.
The new approach represents a “fundamental shift” in the way the United States sells large armed drones, Rachel Stohl, director of the conventional arms program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, said.
The full text of the drone policy will remain classified along a list of potential buyers being given fast-track treatment is expanding to include more countries, a State Department official told Reuters this week. 
Previously, U.S. government sources had said that more NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea would be given the favorable treatment regarding drone sales.

The Aerospace Industries Association trade group said the policy was an important ""first step"" and more needed to be done because ""increasing demand for American defense products has strained the system, resulting in an overburdened and fragmented process beset by avoidable delays.""

Unions are calling for a 6 percent pay increase for this year for Air France staff. 
Management has proposed a draft agreement that runs for several years, including a pay increase of 2 percent for 2018. That draft agreement, which also contains a general wage increase of 5 percent over the 2019-2021 period, is open for signatures until Friday.
So far, the walkouts have cost parent group Air France-KLM 220 million euros ($272 million).

664,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Jane Rosenthal lives life on the Hollywood high wire,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie producers do not turn into household names as often as actors and directors, but Jane Rosenthal leapt to that level, and not just for her feature film projects. 
Perhaps her best-known project is New York City's Tribeca Film Festival, which she co-founded in 2002 with the aim of bringing people back to lower Manhattan and healing the many wounds of 9/11.
The famed producer is also known for her longtime partnership with actor Robert De Niro, a union which has produced franchises like “Meet the Parents” and “Analyze This,” as well as the recent HBO film “The Wizard of Lies,” about Wall Street ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff.
With this year’s Tribeca Film Festival kicking off April 18, Rosenthal spoke with Reuters Money for the latest in our “Life Lessons” series, to talk about life on the Hollywood high wire.
Q: Did movies influence you early on in life?
A: Ever since I was seven years old and I saw the magic of “Mary Poppins.” She was the first superhero: She could fly, she spoke multiple languages, she traveled the world, she could negotiate. That movie had a big impact on how I looked at the world, in so many different ways.
Julie Andrews actually interviewed me for a job at one point, and it was the worst interview I ever had. I just sat there gushing, it was really embarrassing. I didn’t get the job.
Q: What life lessons did your parents pass along?
A: The importance of dinner table conversation. My mother always made these wonderful dinners, and even if it was just for 10 minutes, forced everyone to sit down and talk for a little bit. There is something wonderful about that: Sitting down, eating together, and just being a family.
Q: At what point did you realize you could make a successful career in film?
A: I never think that. I still don’t. The thing about the movie business is that you are always looking to your next project. You are always pushing a rock up a hill, and that is what keeps me going. You are never at rest.
Q: What do you invest in, apart from film projects?
A: Primarily real estate. Take the Tribeca Film Center, for instance. When Bob (De Niro) purchased that building, the vision was to have an open workspace, whether others could have offices too, and we could all share services. It was kind of like WeWork, but back then, people weren’t really talking about the shared economy.
Q: How do you cope with the financial ups and downs of the movie business?
A: You are exhilarated one minute, and the next minute you want to fling something across the room. It is a roller coaster, and it is certainly not dull. But you learn far more from your failures than from your successes. It is very much a crapshoot, and you never really know what is going to hit a chord with the public.
Q: What were the lessons of starting a film festival from scratch?
A: I was inspired by hearing Nelson Mandela talk about the movies: He said films were the one thing he and his jailers had in common. They would laugh at the same things, and cry at the same things. Movies have that kind of unifying power, and that is what New York City needed after 9/11. 
Q: Do your philanthropic dollars go toward 9/11-related charities?
A: I have been involved with that museum and memorial since literally months after 9/11. But I am also very involved in childhood mental health, such as with the Child Mind Institute. Look at what is going on in the world today, and it is obvious that we have to treat mental health as just as important as physical health. Children are our best resource, so we have to make sure they grow up healthy and supported and inspired.
Q: What life lessons do you pass along to your own kids?

A: Kindness and curiosity. In this world, kindness is overlooked.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>","GM Korea, union fail to reach agreement before Friday deadline","SEOUL (Reuters) - Wage talks between General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit and its labor union ended without an agreement on Thursday, a day before the deadline the company had set for filing for bankruptcy.
The Detroit carmaker had said that its loss-making South Korea unit was likely to file for bankruptcy protection if it failed to reach a restructuring agreement by Friday.
GM said in February it would shut down one of its plants in Korea, and it has been seeking wage concessions and government help to save its remaining three factories. 
""The two sides have not been able to narrow differences over the relocation of Gunsan workers and cost-cutting,"" GM Korea said in a statement, referring to its workers at the Gunsan plant, which will face a closure by May.
No schedule has been set for Friday's talks, the statement said. 
GM Korea is scheduled to hold a board meeting at around 8 pm on Friday to discuss filing for bankruptcy protection should it fail to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the matter said.
Even if the board approved a plan for bankruptcy protection, the company and the union could continue talks to cut labor costs before actually filing for it, the source said.
The head of Korea Development Bank, which holds a 17 percent stake in GM Korea, told Reuters this week that the state-run bank may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27 to extend financial support for GM Korea. 

He said the bank may inject about 500 billion won ($471.31 million), or 17 percent of GM's pledged $2.8 billion of investments into the unit, should an interim due-diligence report on the operation turn out to be satisfactory on Friday.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>",Your money: Women who retire early can miss out,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Women have a math problem when it comes to retirement: On average, they retire two years earlier than men but they live five years longer. 
The obvious solution is to make sure women save enough money to cover the longer spread and to work as long as possible, but that is not what is happening out there in the real world. 
When it comes to early retirement, which most define as before 65, a study from Fidelity released Thursday found that the top reason women leave the workforce early is because of a health concern. This health matter typically relates to a spouse, but also sometimes to elderly parents or even grandchildren. 
One of Abe Ringer's financial planning clients presents a common scenario. This woman stopped working when she was 63 to care for her husband until he died of lung cancer. Rather than return to the workforce, she shifted to caring for her grandchildren so her daughter could work. 
She will probably have enough funds for her later years, but Ringer, who is based in Boston, has other clients he worries about. 
""With any type of financial planning, we're operating with a certain degree of uncertainty,"" he said. 
Healthcare costs are one of the most unpredictable factors of retirement. The Fidelity study estimated than women over 65 will need $147,000 for healthcare in retirement, while men will need just $133,000. That number does not include long-term care. 
Those who retire before Medicare kicks in at 65 have additional costs because they have to pay for coverage - either cost-sharing with an ex-employer or on the open market, said Katie Taylor, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity. 
To avoid running out of money, there are several areas where women can make strategic decisions: 
KEEP WORKING
One of the major reasons women save less than men is that they spend 44 percent of their adult lives out of the workforce, compared to just 28 percent for men, according to a study from Merrill Lynch on Women and Financial Wellness released Thursday. 
The result: A potential cumulative wage gap of over $1 million. 
To combat this, working women need think about the long-term impact of stopping work. 
""Retirement is no longer a switch that you turn on and off,"" said Maddy Dychtwald, co-founder of Age Wave, which conducted the study with Merrill Lynch
At the very least, try to keep one toe in the workforce. 
""Part-time work is so impactful,"" said Ringer. 
He has one client who stopped working in her early 60s, because her husband was older and was retiring. Now he is ill, and Ringer is worried her funds will run out after he dies, so he is counseling her to pick up consulting projects. 
""I am awestruck at the women who have started over,"" said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. ""They go out and look for part-time work, and then demonstrate how good they are. It’s really inspiring.""
DO A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The Merrill Lynch study noted that two-thirds of care provided to older adults is done by women. 
Before one person in a family stops working to become a caretaker, Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, suggested polling everyone involved (siblings, adult children, etc.) to see if the care can be divided without anyone having to stop work. The group can pool resources to pay for a caregiver instead, too. 
Ritter said family members can also all chip in for a long-term care policy for the ailing relative, and get the care covered by insurance. 
DOWNSIZE
When it comes to making hard decisions when the money is gone, Ringer suggests anything else but starting pensions and Social Security early. 
""Hold off, even if it means drawing down other accounts first,"" he said. 
With Social Security, claiming at any age prior to 70 chips away at benefits. Many private pensions also have age triggers. 

Homeowners who are running short of money can sell. Or they can take a reverse mortgage, which allows a homeowner to cash out of the house while still living there. These contracts are more expensive than they used to be, but Ringer said they can be useful if you turn the payments into an annuity so you have steady income.

By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS will centralize its European cross-border wealth management business and run it out of Switzerland from June, the latest step within a series of reshuffles since merging its flagship business under one global unit this year. 
The world's largest wealth manager will handle cross-border business for western Europe out of two regional units to help adapt the offshore business to differing regulations, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
""The separation between Europe International North and South allows us to take strategic decisions based on market access regulations, which are tighter in southern Europe than in the north,"" the bank's new head of wealth management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Christine Novakovic, said in the memo sent on Thursday.
Many wealthy European clients seek to book money not only in their home country but also through additional accounts booked in Switzerland, the world's largest center for offshore wealth. 
In some countries, foreign bankers may travel to court new clients or make visits to existing customers on their home turf. 
But countries such as Italy, Spain and France impose tighter restrictions than several important northern European markets against cross-border visits and marketing, meaning banks focus more on attracting offshore clients from these countries who already have a Swiss bank account. 
Novakovic will directly oversee the southern unit --including Italy, Iberia, France and the Benelux -- on an interim basis, while Sonia Goessi will lead the northern unit, consisting of cross-border business from Germany, Austria, Britain, the Nordics and Netherlands.
The bank will reintegrate its business for so-called affluent clients -- private banking customers with under 2 million Swiss francs ($2.1 million) managed by the bank -- into the same organizational structure as its high net worth clients, in order to help boost business as their assets grow.

The Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, was working to restore power to the less than 30 percent of customers in the U.S. territory still without power after Wednesday morning's blackout.
The power line failure in southern Puerto Rico was the latest in a string of operational and political headaches for the bankrupt, storm-ravaged power utility.
The utility has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico on Sept. 20.
Maria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico's electrical grid, and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday's blackout. 
PREPA said on Twitter that several power plants were back in service, including units at Central Aguirre, EcoElectrica, Central Costa Sur, Yabucoa and Palo Seco.
The blackout was caused by the failure of a 230-kilovolt transmission line between the oil-fired Aguirre generating complex in Salinas and AES Corp's (N:AES) coal-fired power plant in Guayama, PREPA said in a statement on Wednesday.
PREPA estimated on Wednesday that it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore service to all customers that had power before Wednesday's blackout.
Before the outage, PREPA said 1.43 million homes and businesses had electric service. That is 97.2 percent of the utility's 1.47 million total customers. (For a graphic, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s)
Many of the remaining 40,000 customers have been without power since Hurricane Maria.

PREPA has suffered several blackouts since the storm, including an outage last week affecting about 870,000 customers, and has been in bankruptcy since July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",ZTE woes may boost network rivals Ericsson and Nokia,"By Olof Swahnberg and Eric Auchard
STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are warming to beleaguered mobile network makers Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) as they begin to recover ahead of a once-a-decade uplift from a new business cycle and an unexpected boost from a U.S. ban on exports to low-cost Chinese rival ZTE.
ZTE has snatched market share in Europe and the Americas, growing four times faster in those markets last year than it did its home market and acting as a drag on contract pricing and revenue growth for Ericsson and Nokia.
But now, ZTE has been slapped with a potentially devastating seven-year export ban. It has yet to say how it may respond to U.S. threats to cut off its supply chain.
Ericsson is due to report results on Friday and Nokia next Thursday and the focus is likely to be on next-generation 5G network upgrades expected to start later in 2018 or during 2019, ending a three-to-four year dry spell in network spending.
ZTE, meanwhile, has postponed its own quarterly results announcement, which was due on Thursday.
Ericsson shares are up 3 percent in April while Nokia has gained 6 percent.
Bengt Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), head of telecoms consultancy Northstream, said it could take several months for ZTE to find alternative suppliers and redesign its products, including optical and mobile gear. ""This is a very serious setback for ZTE,"" he said.
Whether or not a Commerce Department ban on U.S. firms supplying components to ZTE holds up, Ericsson and Nokia still face a tough year ahead amid weak overall market demand as telecom operators keep a tight lid on network capital spending.
Three big players dominate the global market for mobile network gear: Huawei, of China, is the biggest, followed closely by Ericsson and Nokia. Complicating the picture is that Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia have more revenue from serving other telecom segments.
The three face competition from ZTE and Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), a relative newcomer to the network gear market, and a growing number of more focused software and services challengers. 
MODEST REBOUND 
Quarterly financial reports for the European names are likely to deliver only muted signs of recovery, even if prospects seem to be brightening further out. 
""No one on this planet is ready to break the bank for 5G, even less so with a total lack of 5G business cases,"" IHS Markit mobile equipment analyst Stephane Teral told Reuters. Even when 5G hits its stride sometime next decade, he warns that capital spending may never return to 4G peak levels of 2015. 
Revenue for Europe's two big network gear suppliers remains under pressure in 2018, even if they are making progress towards seeing growth stabilize in 2019, analysts at UBS said, adding this is ""more so for Nokia than Ericsson, where there remains much work to be done to rationalize contracts"".
Sweden's Ericsson has made sweeping cost cuts, changed most of its management and is focusing on profitability over growth.
Ericsson has spied signs of recovery in a few key markets but cautions that it has more work to do in order to hit profit improvement targets it has pledged to deliver by 2020. A Reuters poll shows that analysts, on average, expect sales to fall 9 percent in the first quarter, with its main networks business declining 11 percent.
Nokia has said it expects its results to bottom this year, and has forecast a recovery in profits by 2020, encouraging investors spooked last year by the general decline in global network spending and acquisition integration missteps.
Most analysts see Nokia recovering faster than Ericsson, which, in a nutshell, is why Nokia shares are up 22 percent so far this year, while Ericsson is up just 1 percent, after the latest in a string of downbeat quarterly reports in January.
 Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) analyst Gary Paulin considers Nokia an especially safe bet in a volatile tech market, classifying it as a ""fallen angel"" - a cheap stock that has suffered a round of setbacks but is on the mend, ready to demonstrate its underlying earnings power once its short-term issues resolve.
By contrast,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) says stock market expectations are still too high for Ericsson, which it says will underperform the market due to execution risks from its ongoing restructuring and slower than expected benefits from 5G adoption.
Activist investor Cevian Capital said it is betting on Ericsson to improve profits by increasing efficiency and simplifying how it operates, rather than counting on any 5G boost later this decade.

""When 5G comes it could lift growth and profitability further,"" said Christer Gardell, managing partner at Cevian Capital which owned 8.5 percent of Ericsson outstanding shares as of February.

LONDON (LPC) - Lenders to Rusal are exploring how to get rid of their exposure to Russian aluminum company before a May deadline set by the US, as the fallout from fresh sanctions pulls Russian loan pricing lower in Europe’s secondary market.  
In addition to a ban on lending to sanctioned entities, the US Treasury has given banks until May 7 to divest or transfer debt, equity, or other holdings in Rusal, energy firm EN+, and vehicle maker GAZ.
The sanctions are more severe than those imposed in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of the Crimea, as the first forced disposal of now illiquid Russian debt will bring losses for lenders. 
""How much worse can it be? If you're a forced seller you've lost already and will take a big hit. If people know that your risk is looking for a new home, that has a significant and severe price tag,"" a loan syndicate head said. 
Banks' main exposure is to Rusal, as EN+ and GAZ do not have any international syndicated loans. Rusal raised a US$1.7bn five-year pre-export finance term loan which was signed last May and pays 300bp over three-month Libor.
Rusal warned that new sanctions could result in technical defaults in a stock exchange filing on April 9. It is one of the world's biggest aluminum producers and the price of aluminum and alumina has soared after its inclusion. 
The company's loan was last quoted at 98% of face value on April 11, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, and has not been quoted since.
""All lenders to Rusal have been calling external cousel for advice - no-one is actually trying to sell the paper yet,"" a banker said.
Banks including lead arrangers Bank of China, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) Corporate & Investment Bank, ING Bank, Natixis, Nordea Bank,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), UniCredit and VTB Bank have transferred Rusal's loan into their bad loans or restructuring units, bankers said.
Banks face write downs or writing off Rusal debt if buyers cannot be found. Lenders are also exploring options including freezing Rusal's loans and putting them in an escrow account if they are unable to sell.
Even if buyers are found, funds from a sale could still be placed into escrow as it is unlikely that institutions will be willing or able to settle US dollar trades linked to Rusal, bankers said. 
“If we sell in US dollars no one will clear the settlement. One way around might be to settle in a different currency if possible,” a second banker said.
Chinese banks have been named as possible buyers of Russian loans, but most Chinese banks will be unwilling to jeopardize their US operations, which could leave them unable to buy the debt. 
The Russian government and the country's state-owned banks are the most obvious buyers of Rusal paper, but most of these banks, including VTB and Sberbank, are also sanctioned.
Unsanctioned Promsvayzbank could take on Rusal's debt with a guarantee from the Russian government, bankers said. A temporary nationalization of Rusal is another option, a Kremlin spokesman said on Thursday. 
PULLED LOWER 
The secondary pricing of some of Russia's top unsanctioned companies has also been pulled lower to around 98% of face value in Europe's secondary loan market since sanctions were announced on April 6. 
The loans are effectively illiquid, however, as banks monitor their exposure and whether or not they will be forced to divest more Russian assets. 
A US$2bn tranche of metal and mining company Norilsk Nickel’s US$2.5bn, five-year term loan was 1.25% lower at 98% on April 18, the data shows. 
Norilsk, which is also known as Nornickel, is the world's second biggest nickel producer and is part-owned by Rusal and sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska is the owner of EN+, which is the co-owner of Rusal and Norilsk Nickel.
The price of nickel surged to its highest level since late 2014 on Thursday, on fears that US sanctions on Rusal could be broadened and hit the company. 
Several loans for the potash group Uralkali have fallen including a US$850m 2017 revolving credit facility which was 1% lower at 98%. 
Uralkali’s US$1.2bn term loan maturing in April 2021 has fallen 0.5% to 99% and a US$530m term loan which matures in April 2019 has fallen 0.12% to 99.625%.
Fertilizer producer Eurochem’s US$800m, five-year term loan was 0.5% lower at 98.5%. Oil producer Gazpromneft’s US$2.15bn five year loan which matures in November is 0.5% lower at 99%.
Metals miner Polymetal’s US$350m four year pre-export finance facility maturing in September 2019 has fallen 0.7% to 99% of face value and a US$125m loan due in August 2023 for shipping company Sovcomflot has fallen 1% to 96% of face value.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Rare disease drug maker  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) said on Thursday it had rejected a $63 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer by Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (T:4502), while Allergan Plc (N:AGN) reversed course on pursuing a rival bid. 
The high-stakes drama underscores the surge in dealmaking this year in the pharmaceutical sector, as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines. An acquisition of Shire by Takeda would be by far the biggest acquisition of a drug company year-to-date.
Botox-maker Allergan confirmed on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire after Reuters reported on its interest, sending its shares down 7 percent.
Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire.
Dublin-based Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $52 billion, had $30 billion in debt as of the end of December, the legacy of a string of acquisitions. This has weighed on Allergan's ability to carry out big acquisitions. 
Allergan's exploration of a bid for Shire was part of its wider strategic review, Allergan said in a statement. This review is currently unlikely to lead either to a major acquisition or a breakup of the company, one of the sources said.
Reuters also first reported on Thursday that Takeda had made a cash-and-stock offer of 46.50 pounds ($66.20) a share for Shire. This prompted both companies to confirm the move and announce that Shire had rejected it, although their negotiations are continuing.
Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.
It would be Weber's boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda's position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in drugs to treat hyperactivity.
But it would be a big financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds ($48.3 billion), is worth a lot more than Japan's biggest drugmaker, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion).
An acquisition of Shire would have given Allergan heft in the rare diseases space at a time when Saunders is seeking to cement its status as a purveyor of innovative drugs. Saunders' plans to sell Allergan to  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) for $160 billion were scuppered two years ago after the U.S. Treasury changed the rules on corporate tax inversions. 
Saunders ""was a huge deal guy and everyone was kind of waiting for the next big deal,"" said Kevin Kedra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of both Allergan and Shire.
If there was to be a big share component to a deal it would have to come before a vote of shareholders, he noted. ""Shareholders seem to be voting this morning,"" Kedra said.
Takeda said it would remain disciplined in its approach and intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating, adding that: ""Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing."" 
MORE CASH WANTED
Shire confirmed it had received three conditional proposals from Takeda, but said they significantly undervalued the company's growth prospects and drugs in development.
Takeda's latest 46.50 pounds offer was made on April 12 and comprised 17.75 pounds in cash, which would be paid in U.S. dollars, and 28.75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares. Shire said that valued it at approximately 44 billion pounds ($62.6 billion), based on total issued and to be issued share capital.
The two earlier cash-and-share offers were worth 44 and 45.50 pounds per share, respectively.
Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away, after it said last month it was considering a bid.
Based on Takeda's market capitalization, Shire shareholders would end up owning approximately 51 percent of the enlarged group, Shire noted.
Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia said Shire was likely to be pushing for a larger cash component in current talks but Takeda was already stretched, suggesting the chances of a deal being consummated were still ""reasonably risky.""
Shire has been under pressure in the past 12 months, with its shares down by a third before Takeda's interest was made public, due to greater competition from generic drugs and debts from its $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.
Shire said in January it would run its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) business, which consists mainly of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse, separately and possibly seek a separate listing.
Earlier this week it struck a deal to sell its cancer drugs for $2.4 billion to unlisted French group Servier.

686,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",Currency trading volumes hit record highs in first quarter,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign exchange trading volumes rose to a record high in the first three months of the year, data showed on Thursday, as a rise in volatility from multi-year lows encouraged more buying and selling of currencies. 
The numbers released by CLS, a major settler of trades in the foreign exchange market, follows a huge surge in trading on Thomson Reuters' trading platforms, with its March volumes up 28 percent on last year and narrowly below February's, its best ever month.
The rise in FX volumes will be welcomed by trading platforms and banks that have struggled with calm financial markets squeezing their profits in recent years.
Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) this week reported a jump in first-quarter profits thanks to a surge in trading activity, although Morgan Stanley executives warned results through the rest of the year may not be quite as strong. 
After volatility spiked during a sudden sell-off across financial markets in January and February, price swings have returned to lower levels, with price moves in the biggest currencies notably small.
Market participants say April has been a quiet month so far, with currencies mostly shrugging off rising geopolitical tensions, concerns about a possible U.S.-China trade war and the prospect a global economic growth boom is nearing its peak. Key currency pairs remain stuck in narrow price ranges.
""FX markets are in a wait-and-see mode,"" Thu Lan, an FX analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt said. ""Everyone is waiting to see the first (monetary policy) normalization steps from central banks.""
Trading of emerging market FX, particularly the Russian rouble after the announcement of new U.S. sanctions targeting Russian companies and oligarchs, may have held up better in April but these currencies are traded in far lower volumes than the 'G10' currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro and Japanese yen.
(For a graphic on 'Currency volatility index' click https://reut.rs/2JX6Q5G)
CLS said in a statement that the average daily traded FX volumes submitted to it reached $1.87 trillion between January and March, surpassing a previous high of $1.67 trillion in the first quarter of 2013.
Daily volumes in March reached $1.855 trillion, down 4.8 percent on February but up on a year earlier. 
As well as volatility, CLS attributed the rise in volumes to a trend of more buy-side firms like asset managers using its services.
Average daily volumes of spot and derivatives currency trading touched $461 billion in March, slightly lower than the record month of February when volumes hit $463 billion, Thomson Reuters said.

NEX Group, which owns another big FX trading platform, saw average daily foreign exchange spot trading volumes rise 7 percent to $92.7 billion in March from the previous year. Trading of fixed income products rose even more.

The yield curve, or the yield difference between shorter- and longer-dated Treasuries, is at its flattest in more than a decade on expectations of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve and inflation staying tame.
A curve inversion occurs when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated yields as traders worry that short-term borrowing costs become too high, resulting in an economic slowdown.
""While we would consider a significant inversion of the Treasury curve a bearish signal, we think such concerns are currently misplaced,"" Goldman analysts Charles Himmelberg and Matthieu Droumaguet wrote in a research note.

While Goldman and some Federal officials have downplayed the risk of a curve inversion, others including analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have sounded the alarm.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>","P&G, Nestle, Unilever forgo price increases to move product","By Silke Koltrowitz, Martinne Geller and Richa Naidu
ZURICH/LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Quarterly sales growth at Nestle, Procter & Gamble and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) was driven almost entirely by shifting more goods, in a stark illustration of how hard it is for consumer products makers to raise prices in a competitive retail environment.
Multinational makers of everything from soup to soap are under pressure to boost revenues as consumers flock to fresher products and newer brands. The large retailers they sell through face their own pressure to keep prices down, as they battle new competition from drugstores and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The result has been mounting tension, which recently erupted in a clash between Nestle and European retailers that saw some of the Swiss company's goods briefly taken off store shelves. That row was itself an echo of a 2016 standoff between Unilever and British supermarket giant  Tesco  (LON:TSCO).
On Thursday, results from both European manufacturers suggested those tensions remain high. Nestle's 2.8-percent underlying sales growth only got a 0.2 percent boost from higher prices, and Unilever's 3.4 percent growth just a 0.1 percent lift. 
""We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities (prices),"" Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.
The pricing pressure was even tougher for Procter & Gamble, the world's largest consumer goods maker, which on Thursday reported a disappointing 1-percent rise in third-quarter organic sales as lower prices offset a 2-percent rise in the volume of goods moved.
""What is clear is what it takes to win has gotten more difficult,"" P&G Chief Executive David Taylor said on a post-earnings call. 
The maker of Gillette razors, which said sales would continue to hurt from pricing in the fourth quarter, flagged higher transportation costs in addition to pressure from struggling retailers and rising commodities prices.
Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy.
""I think everybody is feeling this a little bit,"" Unilever Finance Chief Graeme Pitkethly said, predicting that industrywide freight costs in the U.S. could rise by a high single-digit to double digit rate. 
P&G and Unilever shares fell more than 2 percent, while Nestle's were up 0.2 percent. Nestle investors looked past the pricing issue at the Swiss food giant to the fact its overall sales exceeded expectations after several disappointing quarters.
That beat, and a pick-up in volume, is welcome news for Nestle's new CEO Mark Schneider, who took the top job at the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups in 2017 with the mission to return it to solid growth after six years of decline.
Schneider said underlying growth would improve during 2018.
""The mood of European consumers is proving to be rather less optimistic in the first quarter of 2018 than at the end of last year,"" the group said on Thursday. ""In France and Austria, in particular, the euphoria appears to have diminished temporarily in the wake of the elections.""
WANING PRICING POWER?
Consumer goods makers and retailers are always in complex negotiations around pricing and promotions to suit their ambitions. If a manufacturer wants to take market share, it might discount; alternately, it may seek price increases to boost margins.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said trends suggested Unilever and some of its peers had ""blinked a little"" on pricing due to growing competition, even though they represent powerful, established brands. 
""Brands are still a vital part of any company's pricing power armoury but ... some companies are stronger in the food chain than others, depending on size, route to market and the availability of alternatives,"" Mould said. 
This is Unilever's second quarter of volume-led sales growth, after several quarters fueled by pricing. CFO Pitkethly said the earlier price rises, and corresponding weak volume, were partly due to currency-related inflationary pressures in certain markets that have since abated, giving consumers more confidence to spend on everyday items. 
As a result, sales volume in emerging markets, where Unilever does the majority of its sales, was ahead of expectations, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts. 
""The good news is when you have more muted pricing, more consumers buy more of your brands,"" Pitkethly said, adding that minimal commodity price inflation had also inhibited the ability to raise prices. 
He said the main pricing trouble spots were Brazil and Indonesia, which both saw prices fall due to weak consumer sentiment; India, due to a tax change put through last year; and Britain, where retail competition is fierce. 
These four countries make up 25 percent of Unilever's sales, Pitkethly said. Other countries, such as Turkey and Mexico, saw a good balance, he said. 
The overall balance of price and volume would improve in the second half of the year, Pitkethly said. P&G CFO Jon Moeller also said he expects pricing pressures to ease later this year.
All three companies confirmed their sales guidance for the year, with Nestle aiming for 2 percent to 4 percent underlying sales growth, Unilever looking for 3 to 5 percent growth and P&G saying organic sales would be at the lower end of its 2 to 3 percent range. 
Unilever said growth in the second quarter would be near the lower end of the range. Nestle also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit underlying sales growth by 2020.

689,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China looks to speed up chip plans as U.S. trade tensions boil - sources,"By Elias Glenn and Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is looking to accelerate plans to develop its domestic semiconductor market amid a fierce trade stand-off with the United States and a U.S. ban on sales to Chinese phone maker ZTE that has underscored the country's reliance on imported chips.
Senior Chinese officials have held meetings this week with industry bodies, regulators and the country's powerful chip fund about speeding up already aggressive plans for the sector, two people with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
The talks underscore China's concern about its reliance on imported chips from global names such as  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), aggravated by a worsening dispute with the United States centered on cutting-edged tech.
""In the last few days senior Chinese officials have met to discuss plans to speed up the development of the chip industry,"" one person with knowledge of the talks said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
China has already made the semiconductor market a key priority under its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy to cut reliance on foreign technologies and create its own domestic champions.
That goal has been given fresh urgency after a U.S. ban on sales of products – including chips – to Chinese phone maker ZTE Corp (SZ:000063) roiled the firm, which uses mainly U.S. chips in its smartphones.
A second person with knowledge of the talks said senior officials had met with key ministries, as well as the National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund, ""this week"" to discuss speeding up plans due to recent trade tensions.
China's Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment late on Thursday. The IC Fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The seven-year ban on U.S. firms selling parts to ZTE comes at a time when the two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full blown trade war.
Washington said ZTE had violated an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. 
ZTE, which has chips from U.S. firm Qualcomm in an estimated 50-65 percent of its phones, is now facing a struggle to save its smartphone business as it looks to find new supplies.
That over-reliance has spooked China - though most industry insiders said shifting production back home would not be easy.
""China won't allow the U.S. to use chips as a stick against it. China can take steps to replace foreign-made chips with domestic,"" the country's hawkish Global Times newspaper said in a commentary this week.
""The Trump administration is helping us Chinese make such a decision.""
The move could boost domestic firms including Tsinghua Group, Huawei [HWT.UL],  Unisplendour Corp Ltd  (SZ:000938), Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), and smaller rival Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co (SS:600584).
China already wants locally-made chips inside 40 percent all smartphones in the domestic market by 2025 and is betting billions of dollars on domestic ""champions"" to get there. It also has targets in robotics, electric cars and drugs.
Analysts say money is now ""raining down"" from Beijing and state-backed funds to support the chip market, while the country's state chip fund, known as the ""Big Fund"", raised an estimated $32 billion in a new round of financing last month.

China's chip push is at the heart of the trade stand-off with the United States. Beijing wants to boost its tech prowess and escape from its reliance on U.S. products. Washington sees the move as a direct challenge to its own technology leaders and a potential security threat as China's power grows.

LONDON (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) has made a bid for  Shire  (L:SHP) that values the London-listed drugmaker at around $61 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The Japanese company's indicative cash-and-stock takeover proposal is worth about 46.50 pounds per share, the sources said. 
The moves comes ahead of an April 25 deadline for Takeda to make a firm offer or walk away from the FTSE 100 company. Shares in Shire were up 6.3 percent at 39.90 pounds at 1113 GMT in London. 
Takeda confirmed last month it was considering an offer for Shire, which sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder. 
A takeover would be transformational for Takeda, which has a market value of about $37.8 billion, making it smaller than its bid target. 
Its bid values Shire at approximately 43 billion pounds, or $61 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed. 
A spokesman for Takeda declined to comment and Shire did not reply to a request for comment.
The bid comes amid a surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the UK as companies take advantage of cheap debt to pursue dealmaking opportunities. 
The value of M&A involving British firms rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion in the first three months of the year, the most since 2007, Thomson Reuters data shows.

695,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>",Tobacco and tech drag on Wall Street; yields boost banks,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed lower on Thursday, with tobacco stocks leading a tumble in consumer staples while concerns about smartphone demand hurt the technology sector and rising bond yields and earnings helped financials rebound. 
The market pared some losses late in the session after Bloomberg reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told President Donald Trump last week he is not a target of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The report cited two unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Cigarette giant Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) was the second biggest weight on the S&P after weaker-than-expected results, also pulling down U.S. tobacco company Altria (N:MO).
A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (TW:2330), the world's largest contract chipmaker and an Apple Inc (O:AAPL) supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the industry's growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks and made Apple the S&P's second biggest weight.
Along with weak results from Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), defensive sectors such as consumer staples (SPLRCS) were also hurt by a rise in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which helped bank stocks. 
""It's pretty much dictated by the move in the bond market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
When yields are high, investors favor bonds over defensive sectors such as consumer staples and real estate, which promise high dividends and slow, predictable growth. But banks benefit because high interest rates can boost their profits.
""The sectors really tell the story. Financials are up because they do better in a higher rate environment,"" said Richard Sichel, senior investment strategist at The Philadelphia Trust Company. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 83.18 points, or 0.34 percent, to 24,664.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 15.51 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,693.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 57.18 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,238.06.
The S&P consumer staples sector was the benchmark's biggest drag, closing down 3.2 percent, led by Philip Morris' 15.6 percent slide. Altria, the parent of Philip Morris USA, fell 6 percent. 
Procter & Gamble shares were down 3.3 percent after it said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs had squeezed its margins. 
Apple shares fell 2.8 percent, making it the biggest drag on the S&P 500 on the day, as a raft of analysts said TSMC's prediction of softer smartphone sales was driven chiefly by concern about demand for the company's iPhones. 
TSMC's U.S.-listed shares (N:TSM) closed down 5.7 percent, while the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index (SOX) tumbled 4.3 percent.
A 1.5 percent rise in the S&P's financial sector (SPSY), was supported by a 7.6 percent jump in  American Express  Co (N:AXP) shares due to strong earnings as well as climbing yields.
But rising bond yields hurt homebuilders and the PHLX housing index (HGX) fell 2.7 percent.
Of the 52 companies among the S&P 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 52 new lows. 

On U.S. exchanges 6.52 billion shares changed hands, compared with the 6.98 billion-share average for the last 20 sessions.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 08:46AM ET</span>",Venture capital firm Fort Ross aims to bring more U.S. startups to Russia,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A venture capital firm aiming to bring more U.S. startups to Russia has raised a $200 million fund, hoping to use the fresh pool of money to help Silicon Valley companies deliver their services to Russia's biggest corporations and its millions of internet-connected consumers.
Fort Ross Ventures announced its new venture fund on Thursday. It will provide checks of $5 million to $10 million to fast-growing startups working on financial services technology, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and on-demand services, the firm said.
Fort Ross has offices in Silicon Valley, Israel and Moscow, and is led by Victor Orlovski, a former technology executive at Russian state-owned bank Sberbank, which is also an investor in the fund.
Orlovski is part of a community of Russian nationals who have set up shop in Silicon Valley to get better access to promising startups, as tech investment opportunities are quite limited in Russia.
Fort Ross closed the new fund, double its previous $100 million fund, as fraught relations between the United States and Russia grow increasingly toxic, and as foreign investments of all types into U.S. technology companies receive more scrutiny from the Trump administration.
Political tensions have not yet derailed startup deals, according to Orlovski. He said the new fund had closed two investment deals so far and had two more in the works, although he declined to name the companies because the deals have not yet been made public.
""So far, so good,"" Orlovski said. ""We haven't had any struggles with portfolio companies or with new companies. Perception is not working against us.""
Investments from Fort Ross's previous fund include ride service Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and computing service GridGain Systems Inc, deals that were joined by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and Sberbank, among other investors.
Orlovski's fund shows how geographically complex Silicon Valley's financing engine has become. About 60 percent of Fort Ross's fund comes from Russian investors, and the other 40 percent was raised primarily from investors in China and the Middle East, Orlovski said. 
Orlovski said Russia offers startups a market of more than 100 million internet users, little competition from local tech companies and a skilled workforce that costs a fraction of what Silicon Valley employees command. GridGain and trading marketplace eToro, which Fort Ross backed in 2014, do business in Russia.

It is not always easy going when U.S. companies do get to operate in Russia. In 2017, a year after Fort Ross's investment, Uber agreed to sell its operations to the local competitor,  Yandex  (O:YNDX).

698,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Barclays board may be a step too far for activist Bramson,"By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Major  Barclays  (L:BARC) shareholders will baulk at any bid by activist Edward Bramson to gain a seat on the bank's board, despite giving their cautious backing to the biggest bet of his career.
Bramson's 5 percent shareholding, revealed last month, was broadly cheered by investors as pressure mounts on Barclays to fix low returns at its investment bank, the lender's biggest profit engine before the financial crisis.
But there is speculation that Bramson, a turnaround expert - famed for leading corporate shake-ups from within - might push for a boardroom makeover at Barclays' annual shareholder meeting on May 1 as part of a plan to boost its depressed stock.
Bramson, together with Stephen Welker, co-managing director of investment vehicle Sherborne Investors, has pursued 10 activist campaigns since 2003, six of which involved direct engagement with the companies' boards, according to filings. All six of the campaigns eventually saw principals of Sherborne Investors join those boards. But several shareholders in the British bank said any agitation for a Barclays board seat would be inappropriate given that so little is known about Bramson's aims, forcing him to tackle Barclays as an outsider.
""I can't think of any particular reason to want him on the board with a 5 percent stake,"" James Mahon, chief executive and chief investment officer at Church House Investments, said. ""I know it's forever getting bad press, but actually I think [Barclays management] are doing the right things now and I'm not quite sure what Bramson is going to bring to it,"" he added. Sherborne Investors C, the investment vehicle which owns the 5 percent stake, has until April 24 to make any statement to shareholders that might affect the tone of the AGM or prompt a management response. 
Bramson has until 48 hours before the May 1 meeting to call for an amendment to any resolution already proposed and could requisition a special shareholder meeting (EGM) at any time.
A spokesman for Sherborne declined to comment. Barclays declined to comment.
LONDON VISIT
Industry sources said New York-based Bramson had visited London in recent weeks to reconnect with Sherborne shareholders but details on his Barclays plans remain sparse.
Some shareholders say Bramson is most likely to target perceived structural and operational weaknesses in Barclays International, where capital is shared between the successful corporate lending, credit cards and payments businesses and the investment bank. ""You'd think it was something to do with the investment bank as it's the nettle to be grasped. The trouble is, a lot of the value that's created goes to the staff,"" one investor told Reuters, highlighting the issue of staff costs that Bramson might have in his sights.
""I don't believe a shareholding of 5 percent merits a position on the board in a company as large and as complex as this,"" the investor, who did not want to be named, added.
Some question whether Bramson's strategy would be materially different from the bank's own drive to boost performance.
""I think management are doing quite a good job,"" Steve Magill, Head of European Value at UBS Asset Management (S:UBSG) told Reuters.
""[Barclays Chief Executive] Jes Staley and his predecessors have done a lot of work and the company is in much better shape than it was,"" Magill said, adding that he would need more information on Bramson's agenda before backing any move to join the board.
Neverthless, Bramson's track record in forcing companies to deliver greater shareholder value has given investors grounds for optimism.
According to filings, Sherborne made an average 166 percent total return for unaffiliated shareholders in four of its UK targets - 4imprint (L:FOUR), Elementis (L:ELM),  Spirent  Communications (L:SPT) and F&C, now BMO Global Asset Management.
LOW PROFILE
Bramson's low profile approach has unsettled some longer term investors, who say greater transparency is important for minimizing the potential for market rumors, which could distract management and destabilize the shares.
One top-50 investor said any Bramson move to trim capital employed in the investment bank would hit revenues and raise costs at arguably the wrong point in the cycle. It could even need a new CEO and chairman to push the plans through.
""For this reason we wouldn't, I suspect, support Bramson going on the board,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. To date, Sherborne has had one meeting with Barclays' Company Secretary and the head of investor relations after the bank's results in February, but is yet to meet Staley or Chairman John McFarlane, two sources familiar with the matter said.
""We are all sitting a little bit in the dark until he's a bit more vocal,"" said a top-20 investor, who would also resist a push for a board seat with such a small shareholding. ""For me it's more a point of principle.""
Barclays is approaching the end of a multi-year revamp, including the sale of billions of pounds of assets and the settlement of almost all its historic misconduct charges.
The arrival of rainmakers like Tim Throsby at Barclays and a focus on key businesses like bond, stock and currency trading and M&A advisory has put the investment bank on track to deliver higher returns by the next financial year.
The bank has also restored its dividend and pledged to consider share buybacks after settling a U.S. probe into the bank's alleged misselling of mortgage-backed bonds.
Barclays shares are up 5.3 percent in the year to date, but are down 0.5 percent since Sherborne's stake became public on March 19.
Some industry sources say this reflects scepticism that Bramson can achieve anything more than holding management to account for their restructuring efforts.
With the bank's makeover mostly complete, and a profit-boosting change in global interest rates imminent, Mahon said Bramson was just ""pushing on an open door"".
""Because we've all hated the banks for so long, one has rather lost sight of the fact that if rates go up, banks will benefit,"" Mahon said.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 08:32AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Unsold aluminum piling up at sanctions-hit Rusal factory,"By Polina Ivanova
SAYANOGORSK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486) is stockpiling large quantities of aluminum at one of its plants in Siberia because U.S. sanctions imposed this month have prevented it from selling the metal to customers, five sources close to the company said.
With the firm's own storage space filling up with unsold aluminum, Rusal executives in Sayanogorsk, in southern Siberia, have had to rent out additional space to accommodate the surplus stock, one of the sources told Reuters.
""Aluminum sales have broken down. And now the surplus aluminum is being warehoused in production areas of the factory itself,"" said someone who works on the grounds of one of Rusal's two plants in Sayanogorsk.
Several people connected to Rusal said that Oleg Deripaska, the company's main shareholder who along with the company was included on a U.S. sanctions blacklist, visited Sayanogorsk this week for a closed-door meeting with staff.
Asked if the firm was stockpiling aluminum in Sayanogorsk, a Rusal spokeswoman declined to comment.
Rusal and Deripaska were included on a U.S. sanctions blacklist this month, scaring off many of its customers, suppliers and creditors who fear they too could be hit by sanctions through association with the company.
A number of traders and customers of Rusal's aluminum have stopped buying the firm's products, citing the sanctions risk, and Rusal has stopped shipping some of its products for export, according to a logistics firm and a railway operator that used to carry much of its aluminum.
While shipments have stalled, Rusal cannot readily reduce its production of aluminum because the electrolysis pots that are at the heart of the manufacturing process can be irreparably damaged if they are shut down.
At Rusal's two plants in Sayanogorsk - which together accounted last year for about a quarter of the firm's production - aluminum is now stacking up in ad hoc stockpiles dotted around the factory grounds, the sources said.
An employee with a Rusal subsidiary described how the unsold aluminum ingots were being stored in garages in the plant. He said his company had just agreed to rent out space to Rusal so it could store more of the ingots.
A contractor at the Sayanogorsk plants said the stockpiled ingots, stacked on pallets, were building up fast. He said two days' worth of production would fill up a five-car train, but already a week had gone by with aluminum piling up.
""Can you imagine a week?"" he said. ""There's a hell of a lot there, a hell of a lot. It's being stockpiled, it's not being shipped.""
An electrician working for Rusal said the ingots were being squeezed into all available space. 
""The storage is not quite full,"" said the electrician, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal company affairs. ""Something is still being loaded all the same, some stuff is being shipped.""
Deripaska, who started his metals industry career in Sayanogorsk in the 1990s, visited the town this week and held a closed-door meeting with staff, according to several people with links to Rusal.
Deripaska himself was included on the U.S. sanctions blacklist, along with Rusal and other businesses where he has a controlling stake.
Washington said it took the measure against Deripaska and others because, it said, they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world.
Since the sanctions were imposed on April 6, Rusal's share price has slumped, the value of its bonds has plummeted and partners around the world have distanced themselves from Deripaska and his business empire.
U.S. customers cannot do business with Rusal any more under the sanctions, while major Japanese trading houses asked Rusal to stop shipping refined aluminum and other products and are scrambling to secure metal elsewhere, industry sources said. 
Rusal is encountering problems at the other end of its production cycle too, with the sanctions affecting the overseas operations that supply it with the raw materials it uses to produce metal.
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), which supplies bauxite to some of Rusal's refineries and buys refined alumina, said it will declare force majeure on some contracts.

Further besieging Rusal, creditors and bond-holders are trying to offload the firm's liabilities because many financial market players believe that to handle Rusal debt could leave them too susceptible to U.S. sanctions.

The responsibility for information technology, which was Hammond's main task, may be transferred to another board member, the person said, adding the bank would need clearance from supervisory authorities for a such move. 
Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the matter, which was first reported by daily Handelsblatt.
The lender announced Hammonds' departure on Wednesday, amid a continuing reshuffle of its executive management.
Hammonds had been tasked with streamlining the bank's IT systems, which former Chief Executive John Cryan called 'lousy' when he took the helm. But she came under pressure after disparaging comments she made about the bank became public.
Hammonds is the latest to go in a major shake-up of top managers. Cryan was ousted last week, replaced by his deputy Christian Sewing, and a top investment banker, Marcus Schenck, also left the bank.

Hammonds told colleagues earlier this year that Deutsche was ""the most dysfunctional company"" she had ever worked for, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","P&G earnings beat as struggling retailers, costs eat into margins","By Richa Naidu and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - The world's largest consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) narrowly beat quarterly earnings expectations on Thursday, saying shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed margins.
Shares in P&G were down 2.4 percent in premarket trading, with lackluster third-quarter earnings and forecast dampening gains from P&G's earlier announcement that it was buying Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) consumer health business for about 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion). The deal will give P&G vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets.
The maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said it expects full-year organic sales growth at the low end of its 2 to 3 percent range. Overall, P&G said it expects sales to rise about 3 percent, including acquisitions and divestitures.
U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs. Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy.
Sales are under pressure from lower prices, tightening inventories and growing private label brands at retailers including Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call with journalists. 
P&G operates in several politically volatile markets where consumption is down, including Egypt, Brazil and Nigeria, Moeller added.
Reported gross margin decreased by 100 basis points in the third quarter ended March 31. Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.51 billion, or 95 cents per share, compared with $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. 
""Expectations were coming down entering the quarter, but organic sales growth was likely still below what investors were looking for,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Bonnie Herzog said.
Pricing is becoming an even bigger concern and fourth-quarter organic sales will need to accelerate to hit lowered full-year guidance, Herzog added. 
Excluding items, the company earned $1 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net sales rose 4.3 percent to $16.28 billion, helped by demand for skincare products Olay and SK-II, as well as fabric and home care products such as Febreze. Analysts had expected sales of $16.21 billion.

P&G also said on Thursday that it was ending its PGT Healthcare joint venture with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (N:TEVA), saying its priorities and strategies were no longer aligned with Teva's.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Sky reports strong quarter before bid battle steps up,"By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (L:SKYB), the pay-TV group at the center of a takeover battle between Fox,  Disney  and Comcast, reported a strong third quarter on Thursday, underlining its appeal to rival U.S. entertainment groups who want to expand in Europe.
Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said the British company was ""well placed for the future"" regardless of which company emerged as its ultimate owner. 
Sky added 38,000 customers, taking its customer base to nearly 23 million homes. 
Core earnings for the nine months to end-March were up 10 percent to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) on like-for-like revenue up 5 percent to 10.1 billion pounds.
The latest battle to buy Sky started in December 2016, when Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), the owner of 39 percent of the company, agreed to buy the rest.
Since then, the deal has been stuck in regulatory purgatory, a tortuous process due to end in June.
But if Fox receives clearance it is unlikely to end up as the long-term owner of Sky.
Murdoch agreed to sell most of Fox to Disney (N:DIS) for $52.4 billion in December, including its stake in Sky. 
Fox spurned a higher offer from U.S. cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA) over concerns about regulatory risk and its stock value, a filing showed on Wednesday.
After losing that battle, Comcast said it was considering making a 12.50 pounds a share offer for Sky, valuing the group at $31 billion, and trumping the 10.75 pounds offer agreed by Fox. 
Darroch said on Thursday there had been some interaction between Sky and Comcast in terms of the regulatory process. 
""They haven't yet come forward with a full offer, as and when they do that, if they do, then we will obviously come back and talk a bit more in detail then,"" he told reporters.
Fox/Disney and Comcast want to buy Sky to scale up against online groups Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Darroch said Sky was continuing to improve its own products and services to ensure it provided the content entertainment its customers wanted.
It will launch streaming service Spotify (N:SPOT) on its flagship Sky Q platform next week, and will offer Netflix (O:NFLX) in a Sky package in Britain before the end of the year, he said.
""Customers can look forward to an even broader choice of entertainment through our pioneering new partnerships with Netflix and Spotify, together with our new Premier League deal which secures the UK rights until 2022,"" he said.
Sky shares were trading at 13.05 pounds at 1036 GMT, down 0.3 percent.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",FAA to order inspections of jet engines after Southwest blast,"By Alwyn Scott and Alana Wise
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it will order inspection of about 220 aircraft engines as investigators have found that a broken fan blade touched off an engine explosion this week on a Southwest flight, killing a passenger.
The regulator said late on Wednesday it plans to finalize the air-worthiness directive within the next two weeks. The order, which it initially proposed in August following an incident in 2016, will require ultrasonic inspection within the next six months of the fan blades on all CFM56-7B engines that have accrued a certain number of takeoffs.
Airlines said that because fan blades may have been repaired and moved to other engines, the order would affect far more than 220 of the CFM56-7Bs, which are made by a partnership of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (N:GE).
The CFM56 engine on Southwest (N:LUV) flight 1380 blew apart over Pennsylvania on Tuesday, about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound flight left New York's LaGuardia Airport with 149 people on board. The explosion sent shrapnel ripping into the fuselage of the Boeing 737-700 plane and shattered a window. 
Bank executive Jennifer Riordan, 43, was killed when she was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat as the cabin suffered rapid decompression. Fellow passengers were able to pull her back inside but she died of her injuries. 
On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said the incident began when one of the engine's 24 fan blades snapped off from its hub. Investigators found that the blade had suffered metal fatigue at the point of the break.
Sumwalt said he could not yet say if the incident, the first deadly airline accident in the United States since 2009, pointed to a fleet-wide problem in the Boeing 737-700. 
Southwest crews were inspecting similar engines the airline had in service, focusing on the 400 to 600 oldest of the CFM56 engines, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It was the second time this kind of engine had failed on a Southwest jet in the past two years, prompting airlines around the world to step up inspections.
A NTSB inspection crew was also combing over the Boeing (N:BA) 737-700 for signs of what caused the engine to explode.
Sumwalt said the fan blade, after suffering metal fatigue where it attached to the engine hub, has a second fracture about halfway along its length. Pieces of the plane were found in rural Pennsylvania by investigators who tracked them on radar. The metal fatigue would not have been observable by looking at the engine from the outside, Sumwalt said.
Passengers described scenes of panic as a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a plane window, almost sucking Riordan out. 
Riordan was a  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, the company said.
Videos posted on social media showed passengers grabbing for oxygen masks and screaming as the plane, piloted by Tammie Jo Shults, a former U.S. Navy fighter pilot, prepared for the descent into Philadelphia.
The airline expected to wrap up its inspection of the engines it was targeting in about 30 days.
The GE-Safran partnership that built the engine said it was sending about 40 technicians to help with Southwest's inspections.
Pieces of the engine including its cowling - which covers its inner workings - were found about 60 miles (100 km) from Philadelphia airport, Sumwalt said. The investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. 

In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the FAA to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed.

708,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>","Markets Should Brace for More Volatility, IMF Finance Chief Says","(Bloomberg) -- Investors should be prepared for more volatility as overstretched markets adapt to the end of easy central-bank money, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund’s capital-markets department.
The sharp selloff earlier this year in the stock market was a “fairly isolated” event that involved the unwinding of bets that low volatility would continue, the IMF’s Tobias Adrian said in an interview Wednesday at the fund’s headquarters in Washington. Still, markets will probably face more choppy waters ahead, he said.
“We’re probably not going to see this very low volatility that we saw last year going forward,” he said. “There might be sharp spikes in volatility going forward.”
The S&P 500 Index plunged more than 10 percent from a late January peak to early February, which was followed by a rebound. Adrian refers to the drop as the “VIX tantrum,” in reference to an index that reflects market estimates of future volatility. The index spiked in February to a three-year high.
The IMF said this week that risks to global financial stability have increased over past six months, a shift that could make the “road ahead bumpy” for markets and put growth at risk. Valuations of risky assets are “stretched, with some late-stage credit cycle dynamics emerging, reminiscent of the pre-crisis period,” the fund said in its semi-annual Global Financial Stability Report.
Growth Momentum
“This current environment of strong growth momentum and very easy financial conditions is not going to last forever,” said Adrian, who previously worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
“At some point there will be adjustments, inflation might come back, monetary policy might tighten more than anticipated, economic momentum might slow. So there are lots of headwinds that will eventually realize,” he said.
The IMF noted in its report that investors aren’t currently pricing in the risk of sharply higher inflation over the next few years, leaving markets vulnerable to an “inflation surprise.”
Adrian said markets continue to price in the assumption that low inflation will continue, meaning investors could be caught off guard if consumer prices accelerate more than expected.
‘Faster Path’
“There could be a faster path of monetary policy tightening at some point,” Adrian said. “We do think inflation will come back at some point.”
The IMF is warning that prices are frothy across a variety of assets, from stocks to government and corporate bonds. It’s unusual to see inflated valuations across so many asset classes, Adrian said.
“The last time we saw that was in the runup to the financial crisis,” he said. “We see stretched valuations across asset classes and across regions of the world, from advanced countries to low-income countries, from Asia to Africa to the Americas.”
The bright side is that economies are better prepared for the next downturn than a decade ago, Adrian said. “What is different today is the banking system is much more resilient, there’s a lot more capital and a lot more liquidity,” he said. “So we’re not quite as worried as we would have been.""

In the latest twist of a decade-long legal battle between the Swiss food giant and its U.S. rival Mondelez (O:MDLZ), Advocate General Melchior Wathelet advised the European Court of Justice to uphold a lower court ruling which found that public recognition across Europe of the shape of the four-fingered bar was not enough to merit the KitKat trademark granted in 2006.
Wathelet also called an appeal by Mondelez against a part of the lower General Court's findings to be ""manifestly inadmissible"" because the U.S. firm's overall complaint against the Nestle trademark had been successful.
ECJ justices generally follow such advice when giving their rulings several months later, although not always. A decision by the Court of Justice will be final.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Opel CEO says German costs twice those of other plants: source,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Some of Opel's German plants cost twice as much to run as new French owner PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) other factories, Opel's chief executive told employees as the company tries to hammer out an effiency deal with labor leaders in return for investments.
Michael Lohscheller was speaking at a town hall meeting on Wednesday as the issue took on a national dimension with Chancellor Angela Merkel intervening to say she expected PSA to honor its commitments during the 2017 takeover.
At stake is the future of Opel's Eisenach plant, which employs 1,800 workers. Shop stewards earlier this week rejected wage concessions demanded by PSA in exchange for a commitment to invest in a production line for a new model there.
Lohscheller told a town hall meeting at Opel's headquarters in Ruesselsheim, western Germany, that profitability was improving but added: ""In part, our factories were twice as expensive as PSA factories.""
His comments were first reported by German weekly Wirtschafts Woche and were confirmed on Thursday by a source familiar with what he said.
European carmaker Opel, which PSA bought from General Motors (N:GM) for $2.6 billion, has made losses for almost 20 years, and CEO Carlos Tavares has been frustrated in his bid to cut high production costs.
Opel's German sites have so far been excluded from PSA's sweeping investment plans, and management has demanded that workers in Germany forego a Christmas bonus and other benefits to help increase efficiency.
Powerful German labor union IG Metall union has said however that PSA's cost targets per vehicle cannot not be met without management's making concessions on pay, and have demanded that Opel's management fulfil its pledge of allocating more production to the Eisenach plant.
Spiegel magazine, citing IG Metall sources, reported that Opel would need to cut the workforce at Eisenach to 1,000 from 1,800 if existing production plans were implemented and no new models were added to the production line.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 06:17AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley seeks new court in Italian derivatives case,"ROME (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) on Thursday asked to have a lawsuit against it for 2.7 billion euros ($3.34 billion) in damages thrown out of an Italian administrative court, an Italian judge said. 
At the opening of the trial in Rome, the U.S. investment bank the other defendants asked a three-judge panel at the Court of Accounts, which rules on abuses of public funds, to reject the case in an acknowledgement that the judges do not have jurisdiction, Marco Fratini, one of the judges, said. 
The defendants, who deny any wrongdoing, maintain the issue should be reviewed by a civil court.
The U.S. investment bank maintains that derivatives contracts signed with Italy's Treasury that led to losses belong in a civil court, not the Court of Accounts, which rules on abuses of public funds, sources close to the case said before the hearing began.
If the Court of Accounts accepts the claim, the state would then have three months to bring the case before a new tribunal. The hearing is ongoing and it is not clear whether the judges will rule on the issue on Thursday. The Morgan Stanley derivative transactions were made between 1995 and 2005 and were terminated in December 2011 and January 2012, Morgan Stanley said in a securities filing.
The interest-rate derivatives were meant as a form of insurance for the Italian government, one of the most heavily indebted in Europe, in the event that market rates rose.
Instead, after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, interest rates plunged, and the state incurred large losses on its derivative positions as it was able to borrow more cheaply in the bond markets. 
The Court of Accounts prosecutors argue that some contracts negotiated with Morgan Stanley were speculative in nature and contained termination clauses that were overly advantageous to the bank.
Morgan Stanley says the claim is groundless, and in August, 2016, the bank rejected a settlement proposal from an Italian prosecutor for a one-off payment, a securities filing showed.
The case includes claims worth 1.18 billion euros against two senior officials - former public debt chief Maria Cannata and Treasury chief administrator Vincenzo La Via - and former finance ministers Domenico Siniscalco and Vittorio Grilli.
These defendants also challenged the jurisdiction of the trial on Thursday, Fratini said.A Treasury spokesman said in July that it had full faith in the work undertaken by its managers and trusted that the court could clear up these matters.
Siniscalco and Grilli declined to comment.

Compensation orders by the Court of Accounts can be appealed. Once confirmed, they are legally enforceable through asset seizures, if necessary.

719,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 05:23AM ET</span>",Publicis and industrials lead the pack as earnings dominate European stocks trading,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - Advertising group Publicis and industrial stocks made gains on Thursday as strong results spurred them higher, while the main European indices stalled, showing signs of fatigue after a two-day rally took them to six-week highs. 
Earnings dominated trading, with Swiss industrial equipment maker ABB (S:ABBN) and French electric components firm Schneider (PA:SCHN) the biggest boosts to the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. 
ABB rose 3.9 percent after reporting its best start to the year since 2015, while Schneider's profit beat sent its shares up 2 percent. Shares in ABB rival  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) also rose 1.5 percent.
Advertising group Publicis (PA:PUBP) shone at the top of the STOXX after delivering a first-quarter sales beat helped by a rebound in North American activities.
Its shares jumped 6.1 percent, boosting the media sector (SXMP) up 0.8 percent. 
""The fact we have now had a second agency group [after U.S. firm Omnicom on Tuesday] report top-line positive organic revenue growth should reassure on the secular concerns,"" said Liberum analysts.
Publicis' British rival WPP (L:WPP) also gained 3.4 percent as the results helped improve sentiment on agencies, which has been very negative.
A surge in metals prices, after Russian sanctions sparked concerns over global supply, lifted the basic resources index (SXPP) up 0.4 percent, having soared 4.3 percent on Wednesday.
Finnish steel firm Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) gained 2.8 percent, reflecting a rise in Japanese steelmakers overnight after a summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump produced no bad news on tariffs.
Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) also rose 2.3 percent.
Overall the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) hovered near six-week highs as a weaker healthcare sector outweighed gains in resources stocks.
 Novartis  (S:NOVN) shares fell 1.8 percent despite the Swiss drugmaker confirming 2018 targets. Baader Helvea analysts pointed to weaker first-quarter performance for its Sandoz drug in the U.S., and lower than expected profitability in the Innovative Medicine segment.
Results from Nestle and  Unilever  reignited concerns about large consumer goods firms' pricing power. 
Unilever (L:ULVR) declined 2 percent after investors focused on weaker pricing which the Chief Financial Officer said was expected, due to difficulties in Brazil, North America and the UK.
""We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market's fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities,"" said Jefferies analysts in a note.
Nestle (S:NESN) shares barely budged despite the maker of Kit Kat chocolate confirming its outlook and saying volumes had picked up.
Tech stocks also held the STOXX back with chipmakers arms (S:AMS), Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), STMicro (MI:STM), and ASML (AS:ASML) all falling after Taiwan Semiconductor (TW:2330) reported weaker than expected results.
Merger and acquisition news also drove some big share price moves.  Weir Group  (L:WEIR) shares jumped 5.6 percent to the top of the STOXX after the firm agreed to acquire U.S. mining tools maker ESCO for $1.05 billion.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 05:53AM ET</span>",New Novartis CEO feels heat on U.S. generics business,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis' (S:NOVN) first quarterly results under new CEO Vas Narasimhan have been marred by a prized psoriasis treatment that disappointed and a sharp slump in sales by its U.S. generics unit.
The stock declined 1.9 percent at 0910 GMT, more than double the fall of the broader European Healthcare index (SXDP) after the company released first-quarter earnings.
While Narasimhan confirmed 2018 growth targets, his Cosentyx drug for psoriasis and arthritis missed analyst expectations by more than $50 million. 
And though price pressure on Novartis's Sandoz U.S. generics business is no secret, the 18 percent sales decline in the world's biggest market underscores the company's uphill struggle in the U.S. to market cheap, copycat pills amid intense competition and buyers seeking to cut costs.
Sandoz's U.S. business is under review for a possible disposal, but the relentless price battle could make finding a buyer more difficult, especially one willing to pay a reasonable price.
""At Sandoz, times are tough,"" said Berenberg analyst Laura Sutcliffe, who has a ""hold"" rating on the shares. ""The biggest surprise is that psoriasis drug Cosentyx delivered sales that are a 9 percent miss versus consensus.""
""It is possible we are starting to see the effects of a more-competitive landscape in psoriasis.""
Cosentyx, a pillar for replacing plunging revenue from Novartis's patent-expired Gleevec blood cancer drug, boosted revenue by 35 percent to $580 million. Still, that trailed the average analyst forecast of $636 million.
 Novartis  blamed the impacts on Cosentyx sales on destocking at the specialty pharmacy level, and price concessions it made to help the drug win business in earlier treatment.
MIXED BAG
Overall, core net income rose 4 percent to $2.98 billion, the Basel-based company said, equaling analyst forecasts in a Reuters poll. Sales rose 4 percent in constant currencies to $12.7 billion, beating forecasts for $12.3 billion.
Narasimhan, who took over Feb. 1, has other reasons for encouragement. His cancer drugs portfolio enjoyed 6 percent growth in the first three months of 2018, while a resurgent Alcon eye care unit profited from demand for products like implantable lenses.
Alcon's $1.8 billion sales, up 7 percent, beat analysts' $1.6 billion forecast and could increase Novartis's options as it considers spinning off the unit to shareholders to focus on prescription drugs. 
A spin-off could come as early as first-half 2019, Novartis said.
""Operationally, we drove solid growth across all financial metrics, strong performance across our key growth brands, and continued Alcon’s strong recovery,” Narasimhan said in a statement.
He also announced that he had poached Amgen's (O:AMGN) John Tsai as his new chief drug developer.
Novartis is on track for 2018 core operating profit to rise by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage, it said.
Even so, Narasimhan, a U.S. citizen and Harvard-trained doctor, is not there yet: First-quarter core operating profit rose only 4 percent to $3.34 billion, so improvements are needed by year's end. 
To start 2018, Narasimhan has been aggressively managing his portfolio, unloading a consumer health venture to GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) and adding gene therapy hopeful AveXis (O:AVXS) for $8.7 billion.

The deal for AveXis, whose top spinal muscular atrophy prospect is expected to have multiple-billion-dollar annual sales potential, shows Narasimhan is hunting for targets that could run to $10 billion.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Nestle confirms outlook as volume growth picks up,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Food group Nestle confirmed its full-year guidance after organic sales growth accelerated to 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, helped by improving volumes.
Nestle is among packaged food companies taking action after seeing sales slow as many consumers prefer fresh foods, reacting by cutting costs, divesting underperforming businesses and increasing efforts to innovate with new products.
The maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups confirmed on Thursday its target to grow organic sales by 2-4 percent this year and improve its trading operating margin. It also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit organic sales growth by 2020. 
It also confirmed it expected restructuring costs of around 700 million Swiss francs ($723 million) this year. 
Quarterly organic growth of 2.8 percent, which strips out currency swings and portfolio changes, was ahead of the average estimate of 2.5 percent in a Reuters poll and up from 1.9 percent in the final quarter of 2017.
Volume growth picked up to 2.6 percent, from 1.2 percent in the final quarter of 2017, but prices rose by only 0.2 percent, Nestle said in a statement. Price pressures were illustrated by a price row with European retailers.
There were also broadly positive reports from other consumer goods companies.
French yogurt maker Danone on Wednesday reported a 4.9 percent rise in first-quarter underlying sales, helped by strong demand for baby formula products in China
Anglo-Dutch  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) reported first-quarter sales that met expectations, helped by volume gains, and maintained its full-year outlook.
SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT
For Nestle, growth in the Americas accelerated to 1.2 percent and Asia (AOA), at 4.7 percent, was also better than the previous quarter, while Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EMENA) slowed to 2.2 percent, hit by declining prices, Nestle said.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said sales figures were better than feared, highlighting the improvement in the U.S.
""However, we are now in the execution phase of efforts to accelerate sales,"" he said. ""While there is an improvement, it is clearly going to take time to accelerate sales for a group the size of Nestle."" 
Vontobel's Jean-Philippe Bertschy said deflationary pressures in Brazil and Europe had led to the weak pricing, but the slightly better-than-expected figures should help market sentiment.
Shares in the group, which have lost around 10 percent of their value this year, were indicated to open 1.1 percent higher, according to pre-market indications by bank Julius Baer. 
They are trading at around 20 times forward earnings, at a premium to Danone at just under 18 times and in line with Unilever.

722,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 04:01AM ET</span>","Sell in May, Just Not in the U.S. of A., Stock Performance Shows","(Bloomberg) -- With the end of April looming, investors are bound to hear -- and disregard -- the old stock market adage “sell in May and go away, don’t come back ’till St. Leger’s Day.” But there may be some truth in the saying, outside the U.S. at least.
A look at 30 years of data across a variety of assets and geographies shows that while American stocks tend to show positive returns over the May-to-mid-September period, those in Asia and Europe don’t.
The 30-year average return of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index from May 1 to Sept. 15 -- this year’s date for Britain’s St. Leger Day horse race, which traditionally signaled the end of summer -- was negative 1.2 percent, according to Bloomberg calculations. The same for Europe’s Stoxx 600 was a negative 1 percent and that for the FTSE 100 was minus 0.4 percent.
Conversely, the S&P 500 returned 1.2 percent over the same period, not stellar but not necessarily a reason to sell at the start of the summer either.
For investors in other asset classes, the data show there’s some evidence of risk aversion in the summer months. The average gain for U.S. Treasuries was 2.8 percent over the five-and-a-half month period, beating that of stocks as well as the 2 percent rise in U.S. high-yield bonds. Gold also showed a positive return, up 0.6 percent on average.
Of course the study only measures average returns. An Asian investor who sold in May 2003 would have missed out on a whopping 30 percent gain, and a European fund manager “going away” in 2009 didn’t participate in a 20 percent rally.
However, they would have avoided a lot of red, too. While just 10 of the last 30 years showed negative returns for American investors, selling in May would have saved Asian investors from losses 19 times and European traders 16 times.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","As GM mulls options for unit, how does bankruptcy work in South Korea?","SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) has said its loss-making South Korean operation would file for bankruptcy if its union failed to agree to cut labor costs by Friday, heaping pressure on workers and the South Korean government to approve a rescue plan.
The Detroit carmaker said in February it would shut one of its four factories in South Korea, and asked for government support and union concessions to stay in the country.
GM has warned that it would file for bankruptcy if there isn't a restructuring deal by Friday, as the Korean operation is running out of cash to pay employees and suppliers amid slumping sales.
But it could still avoid filing for bankruptcy protection. The head of Korea Development Bank (KDB) told Reuters this week that the state-run bank may sign a preliminary deal next week to extend financial support for GM Korea.
Here is a look at how South Korea's court-managed bankruptcy protection procedures work.
LENGTHY PROCESS
The court-managed rehabilitation procedure, equivalent to a U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, can be requested by creditors holding claims equal to or greater than 10 percent of the paid-in capital, or shareholders owning 10 percent of the company.
GM holds a 77 percent stake in GM Korea, while KDB has a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), controls the remaining 6 percent. 
Upon receiving such a petition, the court would decide, usually within a month, whether to start a restructuring process after hearing opinions from the interested parties, said Park Seung-du, a law professor at Cheongju University. 
By contrast, Chapter 11 in the United States is effective immediately upon filing to create an automatic stay of all collection activity against the debtor company, according to legal experts.
In South Korea, once a court decides to start a restructuring process it will appoint an administrator who is required to submit a plan with details on asset disposal and debt restructuring. The plan needs approval from creditors.
In the event that a reorganization plan is implemented successfully and the debtor manages to pay creditors over time and reschedule obligations, the court has the discretion to end the structuring process or can do so at the request of the debtor's administrator.
But if the debtor is likely to fail in carrying out the restructuring plan, and the liquidation value of the company is deemed to exceed the going concern value, the court will terminate the process and will put the company into bankruptcy.
""Compared to the U.S. process, South Korea's court rehabilitation process is much more complex and takes longer,"" said Park, the professor at Cheongju University. ""Depending on the size of a debtor company, it can take years to see the end of it."" 
Legal experts also say negative public perceptions of bankruptcy often hamper efforts to keep troubled companies alive.
""GM restored itself after transferring healthy assets to a new GM,"" said Rim Chi-yong, a lawyer from Kim & Chang in Seoul, referring to the U.S. firm's successful restructuring after it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 after years of losses and market share declines.

""In South Korea, when a company files for rehabilitation to the court, it's largely considered as dead. It is difficult for them to take part in a bidding and banks are reluctant to provide loans for that company,"" he said.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 04:52AM ET</span>",Sky CEO Darroch: 'I have no interest in running WPP',"LONDON (Reuters) - Sky (L:SKYB) Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said he had no interest in running WPP (L:WPP), the world's biggest ad group which is searching for a new chief executive after the abrupt departure of Martin Sorrell on Saturday.
Whoever is named as Sorrell's successor will inherit a difficult task, with WPP publishing its weakest results since the financial crisis in March and analysts speculating that the group could be broken up without Sorrell at its helm.
A WPP insider suggested that Sorrell's departure could represent a new beginning for the company, saying he was sad that Sorrell was leaving but there was ""a mood of change"". 
""I think some people might feel a bit liberated,"" Stephen Allan, CEO of MediaCom, which is part of WPP, told the BBC.
Deciding WPP's future is not a job Sky's Darroch wants. He had been suggested as a possible candidate by industry insiders. 
""I have no interest in running WPP, thank you very much,"" he said on Thursday after the pay-TV group reported its third-quarter results.
""Good luck to them in their change. I wish them well, but I am very happy just focusing on Sky.""

Sky, one of Britain's biggest advertisers, reappointed WPP's MediaCom as its media buying and planning agency earlier this month.

LONDON/BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Talks between  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and Iraq on a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure contract have reached an impasse, Iraqi officials and two industry sources said, in a potential setback to the oil major's ambitions to expand in the country.
More than two years of negotiations on awarding the U.S. firm a project to build a water treatment facility and related pipelines needed to boost Iraq's oil production capacity have hit difficulties because the two sides differ on contract terms and costs, the officials and sources told Reuters.
Unless the differences can be resolved, the project could be awarded to another company in a tender, the officials said, without elaborating on the points of dispute.
Losing the contract could deal a blow to Exxon's broader Iraqi plans, as it would be handed rights to develop at least two southern oilfields - Nahr Bin Umar and Artawi - as part of the deal.
Exxon declined to comment. 
Further delays to the project could also hold back the oil industry in Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer; the country needs to inject water into its wells or risk losing pressure and face severe decline rates, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives. 
The Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), which would supply water to more than six southern oilfields, including Exxon's existing West Qurna 1 field and BP's (L:BP) Rumaila, was initially planned to be completed in 2013 but has now been delayed until 2022. 
""The CSSP would be expensive and challenging but there's opportunity here (for Exxon) ... to get access to resources on a very large scale and to achieve something and really make a difference to its own business,"" said Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Many of the world's biggest oil companies, like  BP ,  Total  (PA:TOTF), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Eni (MI:ENI), have operations in Iraq, where a low-return environment and strict contract terms have squeezed returns in recent years. 
With total oil production at West Qurna 1 at around 430,000 bpd, Exxon's presence in Iraq is small compared with dominant player BP whose Rumaila oilfield accounts for around a third of the country's total production of around 4.4 million bpd.
While the Texas-based firm is looking to grow in Iraq, its geographical focus remains on the Americas, including U.S. shale fields and Brazil, in contrast to rivals like France's Total and Italy's Eni who have been significantly expanding their activities in the Middle East in recent years. 
'ANOTHER APPROACH'
The talks between Iraqi authorities and Exxon are still ongoing, according to the industry sources and officials from the Iraqi oil ministry.
However the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC), which is overseeing the project, said it could now tender the project this month in a parallel process with the aim of completing a first phase by 2022.
""We have this one approach but we can have another approach as well,"" Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry's licensing and contracts office, told Reuters.
Iraq chose Exxon to coordinate the initial studies of the CSSP in 2010 [story here https://www.reuters.com/article/iraq-oil-water/iraqs-oil-output-revival-at-stake-for-want-of-water-idUSL6N0RI28H20140917]. At the time, Baghdad aimed to raise its oil production capacity to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia. That target has been missed and now been cut to 6.5 million bpd by 2022 from around 5 million bpd now.
""Iraq can probably get to 5.5 million bpd production without a major seawater supply project, but I think they will struggle to get to 7 million bpd,"" said Thom.
Negotiations with Exxon fell through in 2012 due to red tape and cost disputes. In 2015, the company reentered talks with the oil ministry, this time in partnership with China's CNPC and with the CSSP folded into a much bigger development project known as the Integrated South Project. [story here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opec-oil-exclusive/exclusive-opecs-new-price-hawk-saudi-arabia-seeks-oil-as-high-as-100-sources-idUSKBN1HP1LB]
CNPC did not reply to a request for comment.
For Iraq, going down the non-Exxon route raises two major concerns: how to integrate the project between the water treatment facility and the oilfields and how to finance the project, Thom said. 
Two Iraqi oil sources told Reuters that taking the non-Exxon path would raise financing concerns for Iraq. 
""If you decouple it, it's not the same project,"" one of the industry sources said of a non-integrated project.    
Projected costs of the scheme have not been disclosed.
ILF Consulting Engineers, which did the front end engineering and design (FEED) for the project in 2014 based on treating 12.5 million bpd of seawater transported to six oilfields, put the cost at $12 billion.

The capacity has been revised downwards, with the first phase set to have a 5 million bpd of water, and in the second phase an additional 2.5 million bpd of water will be added for additional fields.

However, the sanctions will be credit negative for some Russian debt issuers, especially Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc (HK:0486), Moody's said in a report.
The Russian banking system has enough earnings capacity for absorbing credit losses arising from exposures to sanctioned companies, the rating agency said.
Moody's assessment is in contrast to that of Fitch Ratings, which said last week the U.S. sanctions would limit Russia's potential economic growth and severely impact targeted companies. 
The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions earlier this month on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, as well as 17 senior Russian government officials. Moscow calls these sanctions unlawful and has warned retaliation.
""Russia's sovereign credit profile -- its rating is Ba1 with a positive outlook -- is well positioned to withstand the impact of new sanctions,"" said Kristin Lindow, a Moody's Senior Vice President and co-author of the report. 
""Higher oil prices will help the government to make further progress in rebuilding its fiscal savings.""
The risk to Russia's credit profile comes from the possibility of Russian entities being cut off from the international capital market for some time, Moody's noted. 
Moody's expects the Russian government to increase support to regions facing a fall in revenues due to the sanctions. 
Washington cites Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election for the sanctions.

The alleged misconduct, if proved true, could deal another blow to the automaker which admitted an inspection scandal last year.
Subaru, Japan's sixth-largest automaker, provided readings for its popular Forester compact SUV and other models produced at one of its domestic plants to the country's transport ministry which were inconsistent with in-house figures, NHK said, without citing sources.
Subaru said the report was not based on information provided by the company.
The automaker had said it was investigating the matter, and would file a final report to the transport ministry by the end of March. But a transport ministry official said on Thursday that it was yet to receive the report.
The latest revelation follows Subaru's admission in October that uncertified staff had been for decades carrying out final checks on new cars sold in the domestic market.
Mileage readings, an indicator of fuel efficiency, do not fall under safety requirements. However, any proof of what would be a second instance of misconduct in the past year would taint the image of not only Subaru but also Japan's manufacturing industry that has been rocked by a slew of scandals recently.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) has agreed to acquire Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's consumer health unit for 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion), giving it vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets.
The maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors said the deal would help it expand its portfolio of consumer healthcare products which includes Vicks cold relief. 
The Merck unit includes vitamin brands Femibion and Neurobion.
The deal follows GlaxoSmithKline agreeing to buy Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion after dropping its pursuit of Pfizer's consumer unit.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) has struggled to divest the business for as much as $20 billion, after Reckitt Benckiser dropped out last month and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stepped away in January.
Prescription-free remedies offer stable sales due to customers' brand loyalty, albeit at lower margins than pharmaceuticals. 
But intense price competition online, mainly from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as cheaper store-brand products have weighed on profits in the U.S. and other Western markets.
U.S.-based P&G derived 12 percent of group sales, or $7.5 billion, from health care products last year, including Oral-B toothbrushes and toothpastes. 
The purchase price for Merck's business suggests that the German company climbed down from price demands of as much as 4 billion euros, which sources told Reuters had deterred initial suitors such as Nestle, Perrigo and Stada owners Bain and Cinven.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Vincent Meunier said the price still implied a valuation of 4.7 times sales and around 19 times operating profit (EBITDA) for the business, at the high end of recent deals in the sector.
""This will help (Merck) focus on its pharma unit and refurbish its pipeline,"" he said.
Merck shares were up 0.5 percent higher at 0833 GMT, among top gainers in the German blue-chip DAX index, having risen 1.2 percent earlier.
Merck said that it fetched a multiple of about 19.5, above recent industry transactions and based on an adjusted ""economically transferred"" EBITDA of 173 million euros in 2017.
The proceeds would allow it to reduce debt faster, giving its businesses, which include chemicals, pharmaceuticals and lab equipment, more flexibility, although it ruled out acquisitions worth more than 500 million euros this year.P&G also announced it will split up its consumer care joint venture with Teva, PGT Healthcare, on July 1, saying strategies were no longer aligned. 
PGT accounts for nearly all of P&G's personal health care sales outside of the United States.
Teva said the terms of the agreement to terminate the JV with P&G would not be disclosed and that the dissolution was amicable.
Merck said the divestment of its consumer health business did not change its goal of keeping net sales of its established prescription drugs, such as Erbitux against cancer and multiple sclerosis treatment Rebif, organically stable until 2022.
It will issue guidance for 2018 to reflect the sale of the consumer healthcare business with it publishes first-quarter financial results on May 15, it said.
INDIA BUSINESS
About 3,300 Merck employees could move to P&G upon completion of the transaction, which is expected by the fourth quarter. 
As part of the deal, P&G will buy a majority stake in the German company's Indian consumer health business, Merck Ltd, and subsequently make a mandatory tender offer to minority shareholders. 
A final agreement with P&G on Merck's French consumer health business has yet to be worked out with labor representatives but that will not change the overall price agreed with P&G.
JP Morgan acted as financial adviser to Merck on the transaction, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer was legal adviser.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's premium brand Infiniti plans to at least triple sales in China within the next five years by making four additional car models locally and shifting to more of an electrified offering - a fast-emerging market in China.
That means Infiniti will aim to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market to roughly 150,000 vehicles a year, up from 48,000 last year, the brand's global chief Roland Krueger said in an interview in Beijing.
China's premium car market, which Krueger said generated about 2.5 million vehicle sales last year, is growing fast but accounts for less than 10 percent of the country’s overall auto market.
Premium cars account for about 12 percent of the U.S. overall market, and 30 percent in Germany, Krueger said.
Combine that with a ""dynamic and fast"" development of the so-called new-energy vehicle, or green-car market, in China and “there is a huge growth potential in China for us,” he said.
Krueger said that from 2021 every Infiniti model launched will be either an all-electric car or so-called ""e-Power"" hybrids, underlining Nissan's previously announced plan to make Infiniti primarily an electrified offering.
More than half of Infiniti's global sales will be electric vehicles by 2025, he said.
Sales of new-energy passenger vehicles, excluding electric commercial vehicles in China, totaled 460,000 to 470,000 vehicles last year, according to Infiniti.
""Growth is phenomenal, and we might see a million electric cars sold this year. Almost doubling sales,” Krueger said.
Within the next five years, Infiniti will be producing six models locally in China. 
In addition to the QX50 sport-utility vehicle, Infiniti has been producing the Q50-L, a long-wheelbase version of the Q50, in China since 2014. At the Beijing auto show starting next week, Infiniti is expected to display a concept car called the Q Inspiration. Krueger said the brand plans to produce a car based on this concept car, an e-Power hybrid, over the next five years.
Combining localization and electrification, “we want to triple our volume within the next five years at a minimum,” Krueger said.
The shift to more electric vehicles is necessary in part to help Nissan and Infiniti meet China’s stringent fuel-economy requirements and production quotas for heavily electrified cars.
But more importantly, it also marks an effort to elevate the brand's image in the way Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has done, producing a highly-desired premium brand with a lineup of sleek electric cars.
In China, Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have dominated the country’s premium auto market for much of the last two decades. But as Chinese consumers’ appetite for upscale cars grows, the market has seen a sizable uptick in competition with automakers - from Cadillac to Lexus to Acura to Lincoln and Tesla - investing in their brands to grab a bigger piece of the action.
""Customer preferences are changing fast. We have data showing that from 2011 to 2016, interest in the EV among Chinese customers has tripled,” Krueger said. 

“This is a huge opportunity for us as a challenger brand.”

739,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 09:42PM ET</span>",Judge dismisses Catalyst’s C$1.3 billion Wind Mobile-related lawsuit,"By John Tilak and Lawrence Delevingne
TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Ontario judge on Wednesday dismissed a C$1.3 billion ($1.03 billion) lawsuit by Catalyst Capital Group Inc in a case involving Canadian wireless carrier Wind Mobile, citing an “abuse of process” by the Canadian private equity firm. 
Catalyst sued VimpelCom (NASDAQ:VEON) Ltd, Canadian investment firm West Face Capital Inc, UBS Securities Canada and others in 2016. VimpelCom, a Russian cellphone operator that changed its name to Veon Ltd, owned a large stake in Wind through a subsidiary. 
Saying it had an exclusive agreement with VimpelCom to buy Wind Mobile, Catalyst alleged misuse of confidential information by West Face and others, as well as a breach of contract against some of the defendants. The core issue was whether West Face and others used confidential information from a former Catalyst employee in the acquisition of Wind.
“Catalyst is disappointed by the decision and this result,” Catalyst said in a statement following the ruling. “Catalyst continues to strongly believe that its rights, and the interests of its limited partners, were violated in the Wind transaction. Catalyst also strongly believes that substantial evidence exists to substantiate this conclusion.”
Catalyst will explore ""all appropriate legal avenues,"" it added.
West Face Chief Executive Greg Boland said in a statement: “This decision is yet another independent confirmation of lack of merit to the serial litigation being pursued by Catalyst against West Face for almost four years.”
The lawsuit was one of two filed by Catalyst against West Face Capital and others after it lost a bidding process to buy Wind Mobile from VimpelCom in 2014.
Judge Frank Newbould, originally hearing both cases in Ontario's Superior Court, dismissed one of them in August 2016, concluding that West Face and others had not used confidential information from a former Catalyst employee to make its winning bid. Catalyst appealed Newbould’s dismissal, and that appeal was dismissed in February.
In his decision on Wednesday, Judge Glenn Hainey wrote that Catalyst's current action ""is dismissed ... as an abuse of process.""
Catalyst told its private equity fund investors last year that its VimpelCom Wind claim could be highly lucrative. In an annual meeting presentation in April 2017, Catalyst estimated the claim was worth $446.9 million at the end of 2016 and that the firm had “a reasonable likelihood of success at trial.” [Read the Reuters Special Report on Catalyst here: https://reut.rs/2Jh1Wjq]
In a letter to investors sent in March, Catalyst said: “We remain convinced that Catalyst’s confidential work product, information, and strategies regarding the WIND transaction were improperly conveyed” and that “such breaches caused significant damages to Catalyst Fund investors.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Resource stocks were on a roll in Asia on Thursday as oil prices hit heights not seen since late 2014 and ignited a rally across commodities, though the potential boost to inflation globally also put some pressure on fixed-income assets.
Brent crude futures climbed another 37 cents to stand at $73.85 a barrel, adding to a 2.7 percent jump overnight. U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $68.73.
The surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC's new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement's original target is within sight.
""The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold – and costly – reform program,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader.
""So, they might continue to squeeze the lemon while they have the chance and the hand.""
The leap in oil combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities to light a fire under the entire sector. Aluminum prices reached their highest since 2011, alumina touched an all-time peak and nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years. 
Such increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds.
Yields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent.
EXTRA ENERGY
Resource stocks were the big winners, driving Chinese blue chips up 1.1 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.9 percent, with energy up over 2.6 percent.
Japan's Nikkei faded late in the day to end up 0.15 percent, but basic materials and utilities both climbed more than 2 percent.
The bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. 
Investors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent, as did futures for the FTSE.
Wall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials. 
IBM's 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company's quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets.
The Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent.
In currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained range bound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.669. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.46 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78.
The euro hovered at $1.2374, within striking distance of the week's top of $1.2413.
The strength in commodity prices helped the Australian dollar easily weather unexpectedly soft jobs data, with employment rising by a meager 4,900 in March. 

Figures out from New Zealand also showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 10:32PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Facebook to put 1.5 billion users out of reach of new EU privacy law,"By David Ingram
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If a new European law restricting what companies can do with people's online data went into effect tomorrow, almost 1.9 billion  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) users around the world would be protected by it. The online social network is making changes that ensure the number will be much smaller.
Facebook members outside the United States and Canada, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Ireland.
Next month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for only European users, meaning 1.5 billion members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25.
The previously unreported move, which Facebook confirmed to Reuters on Tuesday, shows the world's largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.
That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could mean billions of dollars.
The change comes as Facebook is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.
The change affects more than 70 percent of Facebook's 2 billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.
Facebook, like many other U.S. technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union.
Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.
'IN SPIRIT'
In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.
""We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,"" the company said.
Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally ""in spirit,"" but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.
In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient U.S. privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.
Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.
The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, ""because EU law requires specific language."" For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.
NO WARNING
Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.
Facebook released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.
Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn Corp (NYSE:LNKD).

LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. ""We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,"" the company said.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico board's turnaround plan promises more austerity,"By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's federally-appointed oversight board on Wednesday unveiled a framework for the bankrupt island's fiscal turnaround that breaks with Governor Ricardo Rossello's vision, pushing pension cuts and labor reforms while hinting at layoffs.
The plan, expected to be approved by the board at a public hearing beginning Thursday in San Juan, forecasts $6.7 billion in debt payment ability through 2023.
Tasked with helping the U.S. territory regain access to debt markets, the board has been negotiating with Rossello for months on a fiscal blueprint for Puerto Rico's recovery from the dual scourges of fiscal insolvency and natural disaster. 
But the board can impose a plan unilaterally if it cannot reach terms with the governor, and was expected to do so after Rossello earlier this month opposed the board's calls for labor and pension reforms.
The island filed the biggest government bankruptcy in U.S. history last year, with $71.5 billion of bond debt and $50 billion in pension obligations. It then suffered catastrophic damage from September's Hurricane Maria. 
The board's $6.7 billion projected surplus is slightly higher than an earlier forecast by Rossello, though still about $8.8 billion short of what Puerto Rico owes in that period, according to the board's projections. 
Puerto Rico's benchmark general obligation bond has long traded below par in expectation of repayment cuts in bankruptcy. It traded around 42.25 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, while senior sales tax-backed debt traded at 60.75 cents, according to Thomson Reuters data.
With pensions virtually insolvent, current benefits could cost more than $1 billion a year from the island's general fund.
The board is proposing slashing those benefits by 10 percent on average, though individual cuts would vary based on income. 
The board's plan would loosen private-sector job security that is stronger than in almost any U.S. state, eliminate mandatory Christmas bonuses, halve paid leave, and condition minimum wage hikes on benchmarks like boosting dismal labor force participation.
While stopping short of demanding layoffs, the board calls for cuts to government spending and suggests that ""attrition and headcount reductions"" at the island's Department of Public Safety could help boost savings. It also notes its proposed public education model would ""decrease headcount requirements.""
Rossello has vociferously opposed layoffs and pension cuts, while insisting the board lacks the authority to impose them without legislation. 

If Puerto Rican leaders refused to implement such measures, the board could sue to enforce them, setting up a potential court battle over the details of Puerto Rico's path out of bankruptcy.

743,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>","Lost home, fees for the dead - Australia banking inquiry hears testimony","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian inquiry into the financial services sector heard tearful testimony on Thursday from a nurse who lost her home after taking advice from a major lender, and that the country's biggest bank knowingly charged dead clients for counsel.
The testimony was among the most personal yet at the Royal Commission that has already resulted in startling admissions of bad behavior by firms. Government data prepared for the inquiry shows over 80,000 consumers have been given bad advice over the past decade, costing them a total A$5 billion ($3.89 billion).
Coverage of the inquiry, initially resisted by Australia's center-right government, has dominated newspaper front pages, TV chat shows and talk-back radio across the country. 
Treasurer Scott Morrison on Wednesday raised the prospect of jail terms for the worst executive offenders, while regulators have flagged tougher oversight and penalties for the biggest sector of the Australian economy.
On Thursday, Jacqueline McDowall, a nurse, told the inquiry she lost her home after she and her truck-driver husband acted on advice from Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC). 
McDowall said she was advised by Australia's second-largest bank that she could achieve her dream of retiring to run a bed-and-breakfast (B&B) by selling her home and using part of her and her husband's pension pot as a deposit for a loan on a B&B property where they could live. 
McDowall followed the advice, but Westpac denied her the loan, according to details presented by Rowenna Orr, the barrister assisting the commission, and confirmed by McDowall and Westpac. 
""It's a bit like you go to a doctor and he's been trained to deal with your problem, you go to a lawyer, and the same thing,"" McDowall told the inquiry, fighting back tears. ""I felt that ... we had been to a big bank that we had banked in for 16 years and then never thought that I would be lied to.""
Documents presented by Orr showed the lender had offered to return about A$50,000 to cover only the fees it had charged McDowall for the advice and some of the losses of their savings.
A Westpac spokesman said it would not be appropriate to further comment on the issue ""as Westpac's witness is currently being cross-examined"" by Orr.
The inquiry also heard that Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (AX:CBA), the country's largest bank, withdrew advice fees from dead people's accounts. 
Under questioning, CBA executives admitted that in one case, a subsidiary of the lender charged advisory fees for more than a decade to a person who had passed away in 2004.
A media representative from CBA was unable to immediately respond to requests for comment.
WIDESPREAD MISCONDUCT NOT ACCEPTABLE
CBA executives also told the inquiry earlier this week that the lender was the worst offender among the big banks in misappropriating fees. Meanwhile, the country's largest wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), has admitted it lied to the regulator to cover up charging thousands of customers for services they did provide.
Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer has said that such widespread misconduct in the sector was ""not acceptable"" and the onus was on the financial companies to restore the trust of their customers.
The Royal Commission is just a couple of months into what is expected to be a year-long investigation. The inquiry will be able to make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and on criminal or civil prosecutions.

In the 2000s, at least two executives were jailed for fraud and bribery offences after an inquiry into Australia's biggest corporate collapse, HIH Insurance. A 2006 inquiry into the Australian Wheat Board over hundreds of millions of dollars funneled to the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq also recommended criminal penalties, however only civil charges were laid.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) turned to long-time leader Howard Schultz on Wednesday to make the case that the U.S. coffee chain accused of racial profiling is committed to offering a ""safe space"" to customers despite the arrest of two black men in one of its Philadelphia cafes.
Closing 8,000 company-owned cafes on the afternoon of May 29 ""to do significant training with our people is just the beginning of what we will do to transform the way we do business and educate our people on unconscious bias,"" Schultz, Starbucks' co-founder and executive chairman, told CBS This Morning. 
He joined CEO Kevin Johnson and other executives for a meeting with Philadelphia clergy and community leaders later in the day.
Schultz's appearance on Wednesday marked his return to the limelight after stepping down as CEO last year. Daily management has been left to Johnson, who lacks his predecessor's experience with social issues and damage control. 
""Howard always comes back when they're in trouble,"" said Robert Passikoff, president of consultancy Brand Keys, referring to Schultz's 2008 return as CEO during the financial crisis.
Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, is at the center of a social media storm prompted by a Philadelphia cafe manager's decision to call police on the two men, who had not made a purchase and were waiting on a friend. They were released without charges. 
Video of the Philadelphia arrests spawned protests and calls for boycotts at the chain whose U.S. traffic has flattened in recent years because of intense competition. 
""Race is a very difficult subject to discuss. We learned that three years ago,"" said Schultz. He was referring to the backlash from Starbucks' 2015 ""Race Together"" campaign, which aimed to start a conversation on race relations in the wake of high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men. 
Hugh Taft-Morales, president of the national leaders council of the non-profit American Ethical Union, called on the company to help create a ""new wave of justice"" during the meeting with Schultz and other executives. 
Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said closing 8,000 stores for training on May 29 could result in $5 million to $7 million in lost sales.

Starbucks has directed cafe employees to welcome customers, protesters and people who are ""visiting for any reason,"" according to a Monday memo viewed by Reuters, which in particular directed employees to let anyone use restrooms.

(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, which agreed in December to sell most of its assets to Walt Disney Co for $52.4 billion, had previously rejected a bid from Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) over concerns about the regulatory risks and its stock value, a regulatory filing on Wednesday showed.
The joint filing by Disney and Fox, which outlines the timeline of their negotiations, offers the most detailed insight yet into Fox's thinking, as it goes head-to-head against Comcast, a U.S. cable operator, in its bid to acquire European pay-TV company Sky Plc (LON:SKYB), in which Fox holds a 39 percent stake.
Comcast announced in February it was working on a $31 billion bid that would top Fox's deal for Sky. It has not made a new attempt to bid for the Fox assets after the Disney deal, so investors are keen for information on the hurdles that prevented an agreement between Fox and Comcast.
The filing does not mention Comcast by name, but refers to it as Party B. Another bidder for the Fox assets, U.S. wireless carrier  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), is referred to as Party A.
Verizon and Comcast representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Comcast on Nov. 14 offered to acquire most of Fox's assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, the filings said. Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share.
Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox's entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the documents show. 
In the filing, Disney and Fox said the ongoing antitrust scrutiny of U.S. telecommunications provider AT&T (NYSE:T) Inc's planned merger with media conglomerate  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX) heightened concerns about potential regulatory hurdles to Comcast's bid. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued AT&T and Time Warner to thwart their deal, and the case is in court.
The companies added that, unlike Disney, Comcast declined to offer a reverse deal termination fee, which would compensate Fox in the event that regulators stymied a deal. Disney offered a reverse termination fee of $2.5 billion. 
The companies also said that Fox saw Disney's stock as more valuable than Comcast's, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.
Comcast's proposal, on the other hand, would reduce the compensation offered to Fox shareholders in the event that asset sales were required to reassure antitrust regulators, increasing the potential risk to Fox shareholders, the filing said. 

Verizon's bid was rejected because it offered to acquire Fox at market value, without a meaningful premium, according to the filing.

""Paris has become attractive again, even from a tax point of view,"" Les Echos cited an anonymous source as saying.
JPMorgan's Daniel Pinto, who holds the shared positions of president and chief operating officer, discussed the issue with Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau during a meeting in New York on Wednesday, the paper said, adding that the bank had yet to make a final decision.
Macron, a former investment banker, and his government are pushing through social and economic reforms to re-shape the French economy and restore France's image among investors.
He has already made hiring and firing easier by easing labor regulations, slashed a wealth tax, introduced a flat 30 percent tax rate on capital income and scrapped the highest bracket of payroll tax for banks.

(Reuters) - Credit card issuer  American Express  Co (N:AXP) easily topped Wall Street targets for quarterly profit as record investments in card rewards and a strengthening U.S. economy contributed to higher customer spending.
Shares of AmEx, which ended 1.4 percent higher on Wednesday, added another 3.5 percent in after-hours trading.
New York-based AmEx spent a record $2.35 billion in customer rewards during the first three months of the year, seeking to woo more high-spending customers and counter competition from major U.S. banks.
JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and Bank of America (N:BAC), which have all begun offering premium cards, each saw their card businesses grow in the first quarter.
""Today's results are showing good returns on the investments we've been making to drive growth in the premium sector,"" AmEx Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in a statement.
Higher marketing expenses are the ""table stakes"" in the premium card category, analysts at Jefferies Group said last week, forecasting that industry-wide investments will continue to grow because of high competition.
AmEx on Wednesday also said it expects 2018 earnings at the high end of its estimated range of its $6.90 to $7.30 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $7.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company said first-quarter card customer spending increased 3 percent in the United States and 7 percent worldwide.
Consumer spending in the United States rose in January and February.
AmEx's net income rose to $1.63 billion or $1.86 per share in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion or $1.35 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.71 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A plan by U.S. regulators to test banning the rebates stock exchanges pay to brokers that provide liquidity, in an effort to reduce potential conflicts of interest, will ultimately harm investors, the president of exchange operator Cboe Global Markets said on Wednesday. 
""I have a problem with banning rebates. I think that's draconian,"" Cboe's Chris Concannon said at a Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) conference in New York. ""Impacting the rebate is literally taking money out of investors' pockets.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) in March said it planned to test the effects of lowering stock exchange fees and rebates following widespread criticism of the current pricing system.
Critics, including several large asset managers, say the pricing regime creates conflicts of interest by giving incentives for brokers to send customers' orders to the exchanges that pay the highest rebates rather than to exchanges that would obtain the best result for the end clients.
The SEC's pilot program would force exchanges to lower the fees they charge for matching buy and sell orders and the size of rebates they pay out, allowing the regulator to analyze whether the current system distorts traders' decisions about where they send orders. In some cases, rebates would be banned altogether under the proposal, which is not yet final.
But there are brokers that trade only on their own behalf, ""making markets"" by providing both buy and sell quotes for others to trade against in an unconflicted manner, and exchanges use rebates as a way to compensate them. 
""I find it unacceptable that the SEC is going to say we can't enter into that relationship to support stocks,"" said Concannon.
Some of the exchange-traded funds listed by Cboe, which is the No. 2 U.S. stock exchange operator, behind Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE unit, need market maker support in order to maintain a tight spread, he said. 
Without rebates to compensate the market makers, the spreads will widen out and investors will have to pay more to buy stocks, he added.
""So I have a fundamental problem with that, that we are going to, in the interest of potential conflicts of interest, take money out of investors' pockets.""

Currently, the fees exchanges can charge for trades they execute are capped at 30 cents per 100 shares. Rebates, which not all exchanges pay, are generally in line with the fee cap.

753,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 04:33PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Data, Fed Jawboning Looms 
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended April 13, expected to show jobless claims fell to 230,000 from 233,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are forecast to fall to 1.848 million from 1.871 million the prior week.
The report on the labor market is due Thursday at 08.30 a.m. ET, a day after the Federal Reserve’s beige book showed that tightness in the labor market has yet to boost wage growth pressure.
Economists forecast the Philly Fed manufacturing index slated for 8.30 a.m. ET for April to show a reading of 20.8, slightly below the 22.3 reading seen in March.
Speeches by FOMC Member Lael Brainard at 8.00 a.m. ET,  FOMC Member Randal Quarles at 09.30 a.m. and FOMC Member Loretta Mester  at 6.45 p.m ET.
The Fed speeches are likely to be closely monitored after St. Federal Reserve James Bullard counterpart warned that the yield curve could invert– a key predictor of a recession - within six months.
The dollar remained subdued against a basket of major currencies, despite weakness in both sterling and the loonie.
2. Natural Gas Inventories, Crude Oil Rally in Focus
Natural gas prices rose slightly on Wednesday, as weather guidance remained mostly unchanged overnight ahead of a shift to bearish weather in May expected to curb heating demand.
The Energy Information Agency’s weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage fell by 23 billion cubic feet last week.
Traders are also expected to monitor developments in oil markets as crude oil prices settled above $68 for the first time since December 2014 after U.S. crude supplies unexpectely fell.
Crude futures settled at $68.47 a barrel, up 2.95%.
The sharp uptick in crude prices comes as investor attention shifts to the outcome of the joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial monitoring committee meeting slated for later this week.
3. Crypto Post-Tax Day Rally to Continue?
With the April 17 U.S. tax filing deadline in the rear-view mirror, market participants remained keen to observe whether cryptocurrencies would fulfil recent predictions of a post-tax day rally.
Analysts said earlier this week that the wave of selling in cryptos to fund taxes – following huge crypto profits in 2017 – would grind to a halt, supporting a rebound in cryptocurrencies.
""Tax-selling has been a significant factor in downward crypto prices over the past few weeks. I would expect this downward pressure to abate after tax day,"" Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital told CNBC on Monday.
Tom Lee, managing partner and the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, echoed Bogart's comments, predicting that the end of tax-selling pressure would support a rally in bitcoin to $25,000 by the end of 2018.
Trading action across large-cap cryptocurrencies appeared to validate the post-tax day claims as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple XRP and Ethereum rallied."

Mexico has prohibited the entities from ""participating in federal public contracts or any contract with Construtora Norberto Odebrecht S.A."", the government's official gazette said late on Tuesday. Existing contracts were not affected, it added.
Two units of the Brazilian company had each been fined 543.5 million pesos ($30.05 million), a government document showed. Two legal representatives of the company were also fined 1.26 million pesos ($69,654) each, it added.
The decisions relate to probes into suspected corruption involving Odebrecht's business with state oil firm Pemex, officials say. The government did not provide details.
Odebrecht has spent the past few years at the center of one of the largest corruption scandals in Latin America, and has admitted paying bribes from Peru to Panama.
In December, Mexico banned the Brazilian construction firm from bidding for federal public contracts for four years after the Public Administration Ministry (SFP) said it had sanctioned the company for an ""incorrect charge"" with Pemex.
Ecuador jailed its vice president over the Odebrecht scandal, and the company has paid billions of dollars in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland.
Last month, Peru's president resigned after a probe targeted his connections to Odebrecht.
Odebrecht has admitted to U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors that it paid $10.5 million in bribes in Mexico.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 06:29PM ET</span>",EPA's Pruitt under spending probe; senators urge his ouster,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House budget office said on Wednesday it was probing whether a $43,000 soundproof phone booth installed for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt violated the law, while dozens of Democratic senators called for him to resign over allegations of ethics lapses. 
Pruitt has been under fire for potential ethics lapses, including flying first class, excessive spending on security, and the rental of a room in a Washington condominium owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist. 
The Office of Management and Budget is reviewing whether spending on the booth installed in Pruitt's office broke a law prohibiting federal agencies from incurring expenses in excess of available funds, known as the Anti-Deficiency Act. 
""We take the anti-deficiency statue very, very seriously and if (it's) been broken, we'll follow the rules,"" Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, told lawmakers in a House hearing. ""We will enforce the law, and we'll do so in a transparent fashion."" 
An OMB spokeswoman said the probe had already begun and her agency was working with the EPA on it. 
The EPA's approval of the phone booth violated both the anti-deficiency law and another requiring agencies to notify Congress when they obligate more than $5,000 in federal funds to make improvements in an office of a presidential appointee, the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, said on Monday. 
Pruitt has said the phone booth is necessary for him to conduct official business. When asked about the OMB's probe, Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman, said his agency disagreed that spending on the booth required notification to Congress and said the agency is addressing the GAO's concern.
President Donald Trump said this month that Pruitt, who has carried out his policy of slashing regulations on the fossil fuel industry, ""has done a fantastic job."" Trump added that he will look into the allegations of ethical lapses.
Mulvaney said the anti-deficiency law is technically a criminal statute, but he did not know if anybody had ever been charged criminally with violating it. 
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized Pruitt over the allegations. On Wednesday, 38 Democratic U.S. senators and an independent who votes with them in the 100- member chamber introduced a resolution calling for Pruitt to resign. 
Pruitt has ""completely violated the trust of the American people and the standards of his office, with a list of ethical transgressions that grows longer by the day,"" Senator Tom Udall said.
The Senate is controlled by Pruitt's fellow Republicans. Although Republicans can defeat the resolution, it is symbolically important because it represents the most senators ever to call for a cabinet member's ouster in such a petition, its sponsors said.

More than 130 U.S. representatives signed a companion resolution in the 435-seat House of Representatives.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 03:52PM ET</span>",SunPower buys U.S. rival SolarWorld to head off Trump tariffs,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (O:SPWR) on Wednesday said it would buy U.S. solar panel maker SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing as it seeks to stem the impact of Trump administration tariffs on panel imports.
The White House cheered the deal, saying it was proof that Trump's trade policies were stimulating U.S. investment. 
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
The news sent SunPower's shares up 12 percent on the Nasdaq to their highest level since before President Donald Trump imposed 30 percent tariffs on imported solar panels in January.
""The time is right for SunPower to invest in U.S. manufacturing,"" Chief Executive Tom Werner said in a statement.
SunPower is based in San Jose, California but most of its manufacturing is in the Philippines and Mexico. The company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by U.S. manufacturers, including SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports.
The deal is a win for the Trump administration's efforts to revive U.S. solar manufacturing through the tariffs. SunPower will manufacture its cheaper ""P-series"" panels, which more directly compete with Chinese products, at the SolarWorld factory in Hillsboro, Oregon, it said. It will also make SolarWorld's legacy products.
""This is great news for the hundreds of Americans working at SolarWorld's factory in Oregon and is further proof that the president's trade policies are bringing investment back to the United States,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in an emailed statement.
The announcement comes as SunPower is seeking an exemption from tariffs on its higher-priced, more efficient panels manufactured overseas. It has argued to the U.S. Trade Representative, which will make a decision on exemptions in the coming weeks, that those products should be excluded because there is no U.S. competitor that makes a similar product.
In a note to clients, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said the SolarWorld deal would enable the company to compete against Chinese imports should SunPower's products not receive an exemption. But he added that skeptics ""may question the company's ability to generate profits with U.S. manufacturing.""
CAPITAL INJECTION
The deal will inject much-needed capital into SolarWorld's long-suffering manufacturing plant and give it the support of a major market player. SunPower is one of the largest solar companies in the world and is majority owned by France's deep-pocketed oil giant  Total  SA (PA:TOTF). 
The U.S. arm of Germany's SolarWorld AG (F:SWVKk) opened the Hillsboro factory in 2008 as it sought to capitalize on surging solar demand in the United States. But its start coincided with a dramatic increase in the production of cheaper solar products in Asia, and SolarWorld struggled to compete. 
Twice, in 2012 and 2014, trade cases brought by SolarWorld prompted the U.S. Commerce Department to slap import duties on solar products from China and Taiwan. Yet prices on solar panels continued their free fall, and just three years later, in 2017, the company joined rival Suniva in asking for new tariffs.
SolarWorld called the outcome ""ideal"" for its hundreds of employees in Hillsboro.
During the trade case and after the tariffs were announced, the solar industry's trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, argued that the tariffs would not be enough to keep SolarWorld and Suniva afloat.
Indeed, Suniva's future remains uncertain after a U.S. bankruptcy court judge this week granted a request by its biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company's solar manufacturing equipment through a public auction. 

SunPower shares were up 87 cents, or 10.4 percent, at $9.22 in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq. The stock hit a high of $9.75 earlier in the session, its highest since late 2017.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday blocked an Ohio law that would cut federal taxpayer funding to 28 Planned Parenthood clinics, holding that conditions it imposed that denied funds to abortion providers were unconstitutional.
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld a lower-court judge's ruling enjoining a law Republican Governor John Kasich signed in 2016 that would strip funding that Planned Parenthood received for non-abortion services.
The law would have affected funding for Planned Parenthood programs for mothers' and infants' health, HIV counseling and testing, and sex education. Planned Parenthood offers abortions in some of its Ohio clinics, but not all of them.
According to court papers, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Southwest Ohio said they stood to lose nearly $1.5 million in funding annually if the law took effect.
""We are thrilled that today's decision will safeguard our patients' access to care,"" Jerry Lawson, the chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, said in a statement.
Dan Tierney, a spokesman for Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who defended the law in court, said his office was reviewing the ruling to determine whether to seek further appellate review.
The lawsuit was one of several pursued by Planned Parenthood over access to healthcare at its centers since 2015, when anti-abortion activists began releasing videos purporting to show group officials negotiating prices for aborted fetal tissue.
Planned Parenthood has called the videos heavily edited and misleading and says at least 13 states that investigated those claims have cleared it of wrongdoing.
The law at issue in Wednesday's ruling required the Ohio Department of Health to ensure that funding it received through six non-abortion-related federal programs was not used to fund any entity that performs or promotes non-therapeutic abortions.
Ohio argued that Planned Parenthood was seeking a constitutional guarantee to public funding that does not exist. But U.S. Circuit Judge Helene White said the two Planned Parenthood affiliates in the case claimed no such thing.
""What they do claim is a right not to be penalized in the administration of government programs based on protected activity outside the programs,"" she wrote for the three-judge panel.

White said the law had violated Planned Parenthood's due process rights by requiring a health care provider surrender its right to provide legal abortions as a condition of participating in programs that have nothing to do with abortion.

NEW YORK (IFR) - The US Senate on Wednesday invalidated Obama-era guidance aimed at preventing auto lenders from charging borrowers higher rates based on factors such as race or national origin.
The Senate voted 51 to 47 to disapprove the guidance, which was issued in 2013 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and regarded by critics as an overstep of the agency's powers.
""An ill-advised Obama-era auto-lending rule issued by the CFPB missed the mark on both process and substance,"" Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who sponsored Wednesday's disapproval resolution, said this week.
The guidance was meant to hold lenders that offer auto loans through dealerships responsible for any discriminatory pricing based on factors such as race, religion, sex or national origin.
It targeted dealer mark-ups, or additional interest auto dealers can charge for loans they originate for third-party lenders.
Dealers can receive compensation from the lenders if they manage to charge the borrowers a higher rate, but the CFPB has warned the practice could result in illegal discrimination.
Critics of the guidance have argued that the compliance cost has been a burden for financial institutions, that metrics used by the CFPB to determine discrimination were flawed and that the agency does not have authority to regulate loans issued by dealerships.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",GM abruptly replaces head of Cadillac brand,"By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Wednesday that it was replacing Johan de Nysschen as head of its Cadillac brand, ahead of the launch of a new sport utility vehicle central to GM's hopes for luxury market growth.
GM said De Nysschen will be replaced immediately by Steve Carlisle, who had most recently served as managing director of GM's Canadian operations.
“Looking forward, the world is changing rapidly, and, beginning with the launch of the new XT4, it is paramount that we capitalize immediately on the opportunities that arise from this rate of change,"" GM President Dan Ammann said in a statement. ""This move will further accelerate our efforts in that regard.”
De Nysschen, an outspoken executive who previously led Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG's Audi brand in the United States and then Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) Infiniti brand took over at the helm of Cadillac in July 2014. 
De Nysschen outlined bold plans to reshape Cadillac's lineup with a $12 billion product program. He moved Cadillac's headquarters to New York in 2015, saying the brand's executives should be closer to the urban customers who had for years shunned it.
De Nysschen also upset Cadillac dealers by trying to cull their numbers as part of an effort called Project Pinnacle.
Under de Nysschen, Cadillac sales worldwide grew, mainly because of increasing demand in China. The brand said global sales for the first three months of 2018 were up 22.5 percent.
In the United States, Cadillac's second largest market to China, growth was slower. De Nysschen had bet heavily on Cadillac sedans, but as early as January 2015 GM slashed prices to move them off dealer lots. Cadillac's U.S. sales fell 8 percent in 2017, but sedan sales plummeted 27.4 percent.
Once the top-selling luxury vehicle brand in the United States, Cadillac last year trailed 
Last December, the brand's former marketing chief resigned.
In a bid to catch up with market shifts, last summer De Nysschen said Cadillac would shrink its lineup of sedans and add sport utility vehicles and hybrid and electric vehicles.
At last month's New York auto show, Cadillac launched a crossover called the XT4, as part of those efforts. A larger SUV with three rows of seats is due by 2019.
De Nysschen told Reuters the XT4 had been developed partly to meet growing Chinese demand for the same type of vehicle.

GM named Travis Hester, vice president for global product programs, as Steve Carlisle's replacement in charge of GM Canada.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 03:06PM ET</span>",Zuckerberg under pressure to face EU lawmakers over data scandal,"By Foo Yun Chee
STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg came under pressure from EU lawmakers on Wednesday to come to Europe and shed light on the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica that affected nearly three million Europeans.
The world's largest social network is under fire worldwide after information about nearly 87 million users wrongly ended up in the hands of the British political consultancy, a firm hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani last week repeated his request to Zuckerberg to appear before the assembly, saying that sending a junior executive would not suffice.
In his letter to the Facebook CEO, Tajani said the company should bear in mind that lawmakers play a key role in crafting tough rules governing online tech giants.
""Let me also stress that one of the Parliament's future priorities will be to reinforce the regulatory framework to ensure a well-functioning digital market with high level protection for our citizens,"" he wrote.
EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova, who recently spoke to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, said Zuckerberg should heed the lawmakers' call.
""This case is too important to treat as business as usual,"" Jourova told an assembly of lawmakers.
""I advised Sheryl Sandberg that Zuckerberg should accept the invitation from the European Parliament. (EU digital chief Andrius) Ansip refers to the invitation as a measure of rebuilding trust,"" she said.
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Zuckerberg fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from nearly 100 U.S. lawmakers last week and emerged largely unscathed. He will meet Ansip in San Francisco on Tuesday. 
Another European lawmaker Sophia in't Veld echoed the call from her colleagues, saying that the Facebook CEO should do them the same courtesy. 
""I think Zuckerberg would be well advised to appear at the Parliament out of respect for Europeans,"" she said.

Lawmaker Viviane Reding, the architect of the EU's landmark privacy law which will come into effect on May 25, giving Europeans more control over their online data, said the right laws would bring back trust among users.

M&S said Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, executive director of customer, marketing and M&S.com, appointed by Rowe's predecessor Marc Bolland six years ago, has stepped down from the board and would leave the company at the end of next month.
Rowe is reorganising M&S into businesses with clearer lines of accountability. As a result, the corporate marketing teams will be devolved into the clothing & home and food businesses.
M&S re-set its strategy in November, two months after retail veteran Norman joined as chairman.
The firm said it would speed up store closures, accelerate the relocation and downsizing of other stores, and reposition its food offering.
Bousquet was the only executive director on M&S' board apart from Rowe after the departure of finance chief Helen Weir at the end of March. She is being replaced by Dixons Carphone's (L:DC) finance chief Humphrey Singer in July.
Other changes Rowe has made include new heads for the clothing & home and food divisions.
Shares in M&S, down 21 percent over the last year, closed unchanged at 281 pence, valuing the business at 4.6 billion pounds.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 05:47PM ET</span>",St. Louis Fed study questions college as the great race equalizer,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Shavondra Britton had a pretty typical high school experience. 
“They focused all the time on going to college,"" said the 21-year-old African American, currently a junior psychology major at the University of Illinois-Springfield. 
But she had no help with the process: ""I had to figure out the rest. How to pay was overwhelming,"" she added. 
Britton is the first person in her family to go to college. Her mother, raising three younger children on a clerical salary, cannot afford to contribute. 
Despite receiving grants for low-income students, Britton will have about $35,000 in student loans when she graduates. “I might not pay it off until I die,” she said, “but I’m so passionate about what I’m going to do that I know I will do everything imaginable to succeed.”
Going to college has long been seen as the route into the middle class and touted as the great equalizer among the races.
The reality is more complicated for black college students like Britton. A new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis describes a tremendous chasm in the wealth black and white college graduates have accumulated. It projects that the average black student today is likely to remain far behind white classmates as they build their adult lives.
A major problem: African-American students take on 68 percent more debt than white students, largely because they tend to come from families with far less in savings, home equity and investments, according to the report by Fenaba Addo, a University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor and scholar at the St. Louis Federal Reserve. 
Then, laden with debt, young black adults cannot in turn buy homes, save for retirement or children’s education.
“One of the unintended consequences of rising college costs may be that the long unstable and fragile position of the black middle class will persist,” said Addo in her report.
The average net worth of black parents is $48,494, with half having no more than $9,498 in wealth from home equity, to cars, furniture and savings after subtracting debt, according to Addo. Yet, white parents’ average wealth is $174,871.
That difference has a huge impact on black students because they often must fend for themselves as they pay for college. According to the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, recent black college students said their parents helped them with $4,200 for college, even though four years at a public university can easily run more than $100,000. White students received about $12,000 from parents.
The advantages carry over to life after college as well, with white parents more able to help their children with money if they run into financial trouble, said Addo. As a result, the white college graduates have built about $17,000 more in wealth than black graduates by the time they are 25, and the gulf between them continues to expand into their 30s.
MANAGING RISKS
There are ways to mitigate some of the impact of student debt, starting with the choice of the college in the first place: 
* Do your homework
Families should think about costs and whether the course of education will lead to jobs that pay well enough, said Addo. That does not mean skipping college, but just working the system. 
For instance, colleges with strong reputations and high sticker prices may not be out of reach, and may instead turn out cheaper because they offer more assistance for low income students. 
A report by the New York Federal Reserve noted that the highest default rates – or students unable to pay back loans – happen among students who have attended for-profit colleges and community colleges. Results are better from four-year public or private non-profit colleges.
* Check graduation rates
Default rates on student loans are high among people who start college and do not get a degree. Families should check graduation rates and time in school - a fifth year in college means more loans and more time away from a solid job. 
* Work cautiously
Students often work full-time or nearly full-time because they fear college loans, and as a result research shows they are exhausted and more likely to drop out of school. On the other hand, working 15 hours a week may be useful and manageable. 
Experts say not to fear student loans as long as the total does not exceed the pay you are likely to get on your first job.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Venezuela bondholders inch toward $50 billion debt default showdown,"By Maiya Keidan, Corina Pons and Paul Kilby
LONDON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Investors holding billions of dollars in defaulted Venezuelan bonds have formed at least one bondholder committee that is seeking a financial adviser, according to several sources familiar with the matter, in a sign they may be gearing up for a legal dispute. 
President Nicolas Maduro's government began quietly halting interest payments on some $50 billion in publicly traded debt last year in an effort to save hard currency for the collapsing socialist economy, which is suffering from hyperinflation.
Investors have been slow to move against Venezuela and its state oil company, PDVSA, in part because Maduro has shown no signs of advancing the kind of reforms - including an overhaul of the oil industry - needed to restore economic stability. 
The committee that is close to naming an adviser recently met in London and will meet again this week in Washington, possibly as early as Wednesday, the sources said.
""Clearly the situation is unsustainable,"" said an investor source familiar with the situation. ""Venezuela is in a situation where it will break one way or another."" 
The creditors ""want to be ready to be part of getting that sorted out,"" the source said.
Another source said investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc  (N:HLI) is the front-runner for the financial adviser job but a decision is not yet final. 
Houlihan Lokey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Another source, meanwhile, said other creditors had formed at least one other committee. 
The formation of the committees and appointment of advisers could signal investors are marshaling forces for an eventual legal dispute with Venezuela - a move known as an acceleration that requires backing from holders of 25 percent of a given bond. 
That could unleash international court battles similar to a 15-year dispute between creditors and Argentina after it defaulted on its sovereign debt in early 2002.
IN FLUX
Sources said any legal offensive is unlikely to happen until after Venezuela's May 20 presidential election, which its main opposition coalition is boycotting on the grounds that the vote is stacked in favor of Maduro.
“I think the idea is to be ready for whatever comes down the pike after the elections,"" said one of the sources, speaking about the meeting in Washington. ""It’s better to share information.”
He and other sources said the committee membership was still in flux and that hedge funds with a more aggressive stance toward Venezuela than the institutional shareholders who now dominate could eventually join.
The group close to naming an adviser includes 12 of the 15 largest creditors, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
The biggest holders of Venezuelan debt include UK asset manager  Ashmore  Group (L:ASHM), as well as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) and  Northern Trust  Corp (O:NTRS).
Venezuela and PDVSA are in default on a combined total of $52 billion in bonds as a result of failure to make some $2.3 billion in interest payments, according to Thomson Reuters data and local financial consultants.
Venezuela this month angered investors by making an interest payment on the PDVSA 2022 bond - most of which were acquired by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) - despite being in default on most of its debt.
The move to service debt on those securities, dubbed ""hunger bonds"" in a reference to the country's worsening humanitarian crisis, has spurred complaints of discrimination from other investors holding bonds in default, according to two fund managers who focus on Venezuela.
'HUNGER BOND' OUTRAGE
""The government is starting to have the capacity to pay what it wants and to not pay what it doesn't want,"" said Alejandro Grisanti of Venezuelan consultancy Ecoanalitica. ""That's the perfect incentive for a lawsuit.""
Maduro's government had in the past said U.S. sanctions, which do not directly block routine operations such as bond payments, had prevented it from getting some $2 billion in outstanding interest payments to investors.
Creditor committees would help push an acceleration, or demand that the issuer pay down the principal, because with the exception of Goldman and the ""hunger bonds,"" no single creditor holds such a large percentage of any single bond. That means that in most cases, creditors would have to join forces to accelerate. 

In addition, U.S. sanctions block U.S. citizens from buying newly issued Venezuelan bonds. That effectively shuts down the possibility of exchanging defaulted debt for new paper that matures down the road, which is the most common form of resolving sovereign debt disputes.

(Reuters) - Avenue Capital Group LLC, a New York-based investment firm with $9.4 billion in assets under management, plans to launch a fund this year that will focus on so-called impact credit investments, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Avenue fund will primarily make debt investments, along with some equity, in North American companies, the source said. That could include businesses that aspire to have a social or environmental impact in sectors like agriculture, water, renewable energy, energy efficiency and storage, affordable housing and infrastructure resiliency, the source added.
Avenue, led by billionaire Marc Lasry and best known for its bets on distressed debt, is seeking to raise about $500 million for the new fund, said the source, who requested anonymity because the information is confidential. 
A spokesman for Avenue declined to comment.
The new fund, Avenue's first foray into the sector, will be run by John Larkin, a senior managing director who is now head of impact investments, the source said. Two recently hired deputies, Rhys Marsh from CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and Thomas ""Jamie"" Devine from J.H. Whitney Investment Management LLC, will assist him, according to the source. 
Such impact funds are few and far between in the world of alternative investments, especially hedge funds, though investor demand for them is rising. Recent entrants include activist hedge fund JANA Partners LLC and ValueAct Capital Management LP.
The Avenue fund's credit focus would be a rarity as most investment vehicles driven by environmental, social and governance criteria focus on equity bets, often through publicly traded stocks. 

Like other Avenue funds, the new ""impact"" fund will require investors to commit capital for multiple years, a so-called lockup structure that is something between a hedge fund and a private equity fund, according to the source.

The lawsuit by Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear was his fifth to date seeking to hold a drug manufacturer or distributor responsible for its role in the national opioid epidemic.
The lawsuit, filed in McCracken Circuit Court, accused J&J and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit of misrepresenting that its opioid medications were safer than alternatives and were ""rarely addictive"" when used for chronic pain.
Those opioids included Duragesic, which before 2009 accounted for at least $1 billion in annual sales, and Nucynta and Nucynta ER, the lawsuit said. Janssen sold the rights to Nucynta to another drugmaker in 2015.
The lawsuit seeks penalties and compensatory and punitive damages.
""Janssen has profited from their illegal conduct, and my office is taking action to make sure they pay for ravaging our communities and destroying our families just to make a profit,"" Beshear said in a statement.
J&J in a statement said that it marketed and promoted opioids appropriately and that its products' labels provided information about their risks and benefits.
Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive pain-killers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders.

Eight other states have sued J&J. Beshear is also pursuing similar cases against drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK) and drugmaker Endo International Plc (O:ENDP).

791,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan’s Mizuho loses Saudi bond role in ongoing Gulf rift,"By Davide Barbuscia and Sudip Roy
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters/IFR) - Japan's Mizuho Securities has lost a bond mandate for Saudi Arabia, on top of another for Qatar, banking sources said, highlighting how international banks have been caught up in Qatar's ongoing dispute with its neighbors.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, last year cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies those charges and says the boycott is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty.
Last week Saudi Arabia and Qatar had more than $100 billion in total orders for competing U.S. dollar denominated bonds. Mizuho Securities, part of Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), was offered a leading position in both the $11 billion Saudi issue and the $12 billion Qatar bonds.
But Mizuho ended up without either role, losing a possible $1.5-$2 million in fees which would have accompanied the work, as it tried to juggle relationships on both sides of the rift, four banking sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Mizuho confirmed in a statement that it had withdrawn from the Qatar bond transaction after it had been appointed as a bookrunner, but it declined to comment on Wednesday about its role on the Saudi Arabian bond.
Saudi Arabia had chosen the banks for its planned bond before Qatar publicly announced its own list on April 6.
However, Mizuho had not informed the Saudis that it was also in the running for the Qatar deal, two of the bankers said, adding this was the reason the Japanese bank was no longer on the Saudi transaction.
Mizuho, which has significant business interests in the kingdom, then decided to pull out of the Qatar transaction.
""The (Saudi) Ministry of Finance appoints banks based on their capability, commitments and availability to serve the kingdom,"" a Saudi finance ministry spokesperson told Reuters.
A Qatari official declined to comment on Mizuho's decision, which shows how international banks with significant business ties to Saudi Arabia have been treading cautiously to maintain relations on both sides of the diplomatic and economic crisis.
SAUDI ARABIA KEY
An expected wave of privatizations in Saudi Arabia and the expected IPO of Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco, has given banks a money making opportunity they cannot afford to jeopardize.
Mizuho, which earlier this year hired a banker to boost the growth and development of its franchise, was recently hired by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned National Water Co to advise it on bringing private companies into water distribution.
“We are a top-tier banking partner to numerous leading entities in the public and private sectors and Saudi Arabia continues to be a key element of our regional franchise,” Hidefumi Takeuchi, managing director and head of MENA & Central Asia at Mizuho Bank said in a statement earlier this year.
Mizuho's case is not an isolated one. HSBC (L:HSBA) had turned down a role in Qatar's bond as it had decided not to take high-profile roles in major Qatari debt transactions, sources told Reuters earlier this year.
The British bank arranged Saudi Arabia's $11 billion bond last week, together with a consortium of banks including Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) International, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

No bank on the Saudi deal was involved in Qatar’s $12 billion bond, which was arranged by a group of banks including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).

797,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>",World Debt Hits Record $164 Trillion as Crisis Hangover Lingers,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s debt load has ballooned to a record $164 trillion, a trend that could make it harder for countries to respond to the next recession and pay off debts if financing conditions tighten, the International Monetary Fund said.
Global public and private debt swelled to 225 percent of global gross domestic product in 2016, the last year for which the IMF provided figures, the fund said Wednesday in its semi-annual Fiscal Monitor report. The previous peak was in 2009, according to the Washington-based fund.
“One hundred and sixty-four trillion is a huge number,” Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMF’s fiscal affairs department, said in an interview. “When we talk about the risks looming on the horizon, one of the risks has to do with the high level of public and private debt.”
The global debt burden clouded the IMF’s otherwise upbeat outlook of the world economy, which is in its strongest upswing since 2011. The fund on Tuesday forecast expansion of 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, while saying in subsequent years the global economy could be impacted by tighter monetary policy and the fading effects of U.S. fiscal stimulus.
Surging private-sector debt, particularly in China, is driving the build-up. China has accounted for almost three-quarters of the increase in private debt since the global financial crisis, according to the fund.
The IMF figures lay bare the scale of the debt hangover from which the world is still recovering a decade after the financial crisis pushed the global banking system to the brink and tipped the world economy into recession. Governments increased spending to boost growth, while central banks resorted to unconventional methods to ease financing conditions, such as buying bonds.
High levels of sovereign debt could make it difficult for governments to refinance when their debt reaches maturity, especially if financing conditions tighten, the IMF said. Large debts also impede the ability of nations to increase spending if their economies fall into recession, and may cause a drag on growth, according to the fund.
The IMF said countries should take decisive action to rebuild their fiscal buffers so they can increase spending during hard times. The fund urged the U.S., whose budget deficit is expected to surpass $1 trillion by 2020, to “recalibrate” its fiscal policy so government debt-to-GDP levels decline over the medium term.
The combination of last year’s tax cuts and increased government spending in a recent U.S. budget deal will benefit all income groups, the IMF said. However, those in the top quintile of incomes would benefit the most, followed by those in the bottom quintile, the fund said. As a result, the measures may contribute to the further “hollowing out” of middle-class incomes, it said.
Many governments have troubling debt-to-GDP levels, according to the fund. More than one-third of advanced economies had debt-to-GDP levels above 85 percent, three times more nations than in 2000, the IMF said. Among major economies, Japan had the highest debt-to-GDP level last year, at 236 percent, followed by Italy at 132 percent and the U.S. at 108 percent.
Meanwhile, a fifth of emerging markets and middle-income countries had debt levels above 70 percent of GDP, led by Brazil at 84 percent and India at 70.2 percent. Gross government debt in China stood at 47.8 percent last year, according to the IMF.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Volkswagen AG  (DE:VOWG) unit Electrify America will install electric vehicle charging stations at more than 100 Walmart Inc (N:WMT) store locations in 34 U.S. states by mid-2019 as part of Electrify's plans to bolster charging infrastructure across the country, the two companies said on Wednesday.
""We recognize that electric vehicles are going to grow and become more relevant,"" Mark Vanderhelm, vice president for energy at Walmart, the world's largest retailer, told Reuters. ""We are trying to get out in front of that.""
The Walmart charging stations are part of a broader Electrify America project to install 2,000 chargers at nearly 500 charging stations across the country by June 2019. 
Wayne Killen, Electrify America's senior director for infrastructure, said that 80 percent of the Walmart charging stations would be at store locations alongside highways, while the remaining 20 percent would be in metro areas.
Killen said the highway locations will primarily provide chargers for trips between U.S. cities but also cross-country journeys along Interstate 10 between Santa Monica, California and Jacksonville, Florida, plus Interstate 80 that runs from San Francisco and Teaneck, New Jersey.
Major automakers including General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on families of electric vehicles over the next few years, in a direct challenge to money-losing Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
But a lack of infrastructure for U.S. consumers to recharge their vehicles is seen is as a major barrier to the mass adoption of electric vehicles as consumers remain concerned over their limited range.
""These charging stations will go a long way toward convincing folks that there are a lot of chargers out there,"" Electrify America's Killen said.
Clusters of four to 10 chargers will be installed at the Walmart charging stations.
VW has agreed to spend $800 million in California and a total of $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of its agreement after admitting to diesel emissions cheating.
Electrify America said on Tuesday it has selected several suppliers, including Switzerland's ABB Ltd (S:ABBN) and South Korea's  Signet EV  Inc (KN:260870), to install more than 2,000 high-speed electric vehicle chargers by the end of 2019.

Many of the chargers will be able to provide a high-speed recharge for electric vehicles.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sometimes the old-fashioned methods work best and that proved true this week in the high-stakes world of hedge fund trading.
Computer-driven hedge funds lost 8 million pounds ($11.4 million) on Tuesday from their long-standing short positions in AA, betting the shares would fall in value.
In contrast, many hedge funds managed by traders had already banked their profits from AA and bailed out - before a costly jump in the share price following the company's results on Tuesday.
Hedge fund Parvus, which is AA's third-biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters Eikon and not computer-driven, also made money - 11.7 million pounds from a long position.
Shares in the British roadside recovery group and insurer had fallen sharply following a profit warning in February but jumped 17.4 percent after their results.
""A credible recovery is taking shape,"" said Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, which has a buy rating on the stock.
In a short trade, the hedge fund borrows the stock to sell on, on the belief that it will be able to buy shares back later at a cheaper price before returning it to its original holder.
Six hedge funds had outstanding shorts in AA above 0.5 percent in AA, the level above which firms are required to disclose their holdings, the most recent filings with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), from April 16, showed.
Four of the six use computer-driven strategies in which they follow market patterns using algorithms.
Among them, Leda Braga's London-based Systematica Investments lost 1.1 million pounds on Tuesday.
U.S.-based AQR Capital Management faced the biggest loss of 4.4 million pounds, having notched up a gain of 5.86 million pounds on Feb. 21.
AA shares slumped in February after the company issued a profit warning, cut its dividend and outlined a strategic review, following the dismissal of its executive chairman last year for gross misconduct.
The shares hit record lows of 70 pence in March, but have since doubled in price, rallying 23 percent since Tuesday's results alone.
The shares were trading at 140 pence at 1315 GMT, up 4.8 percent on the day, causing further pain for those with short positions.
Traditional stock-picking hedge fund firms, including GLG Partners, Citadel and Millennium Management, all cut their short positions in March, the FCA data showed.
Spokespeople for Millennium, GLG, Systematica and WorldQuant declined to comment while Parvus, AQR and Citadel were not immediately available to comment.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>","UPS goes Groupon, launching discounts for retailers","By Eric M. Johnson
ATLANTA (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) is taking a page out of a retailer's playbook, offering discounts on everything from Costco (O:COST) memberships to luxury clothes and Disneyland tickets to loyal customers, UPS said on Wednesday.
The UPS My Choice Deals program, first reported by Reuters, appears to mark the first time the world's largest package deliverer is hoping to cash in on shippers' products directly.
More than 43 million global consumers will get access to some 500 deals - like 10 percent off Goodyear tires, 20 percent off Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] luxury clothes, or the ability to donate half of one percent of an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) purchase to charity.
UPS hopes to drum up more business and build brand loyalty for retailers, who hopefully would choose UPS over rival FedEx Corp (N:FDX) or other couriers, including Amazon's own logistics and delivery operations.
""If you are receiving something from Macy's (N:M), you'll have an additional deal from Macy's right there in your alert,"" Stu Marcus, UPS vice president of customer technology marketing, said in an interview at its Atlanta headquarters. 
My Choice helps recipients track parcels to their door or choose alternative delivery locations, like an office or a UPS retail store.
The program was launched in 2011 to cut higher costs associated with ""last mile"" delivery to residential addresses by reducing multiple delivery attempts, returns, and customer complaints to retailers. 
Robert W. Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford said the deals program is part of UPS' efforts to increase the penetration of My Choice.
""My Choice enhances customer satisfaction because it provides them more control,"" Hartford said, adding that My Choice could streamline its network, speed up deliveries and reduce per-unit costs and improve margins.
The discount program, tested over the last year and now being rolled out nationwide, reflects changes in UPS' business, Marcus said. In 2011 deliveries to households amounted to about 40 percent of volume, with deliveries between businesses making up the rest. Currently, about half of volume goes directly to households.
My Choice deals are sent to customers in banner ads attached to delivery notifications, or consumers can log into a website to peruse them, Marcus said.
Discount loyalty programs have been long used by retailers, including Amazon's Prime membership,  Groupon Inc  (O:GRPN), or Brad's Deals. 
UPS gets a commission on the deals for promoting the products, Marcus said, declining to discuss revenue expectations. 

""These are active customers receiving deliveries, so the customers who signed up for My Choice have already proven they are willing to receive goods and they are willing to order online. It is a very active group of customers that shippers want to be engaged with,"" Marcus said.

In an interview with CNBC, Blankfein said he did not have a definite ""timeline for succession.""
Speculation over Blankfein's succession surfaced earlier this year, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Blankfein, 63, was expected to retire as soon as this year.
The Journal also reported that he was not looking beyond co-COOs Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon to replace him.
But Schwartz unexpectedly announced in March that he would retire, leaving Solomon as sole president and COO and the most obvious successor to Blankfein.

(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories' (N:ABT) just beat expectations for first quarter profits and revenue on Wednesday but stuck to a full-year profit forecast some investors had expected would be raised, sending the healthcare company's shares lower.
Some analysts also said a 6.9 percent rise in organic sales, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and certain divestitures and acquisitions, was just shy of a roughly 7 percent expected by investors.
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had no consensus estimate for the organic sales.
Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said the miss ""may limit upside to the shares today despite an otherwise very good quarter."" Several other analysts said the company had failed to meet heightened expectations among investors. 
Abbott shares fell 2.7 percent to trade at $58.22 mid-morning in New York. 
On a reported basis, Abbott's sales rose 16.7 percent to $7.39 billion, beating consensus expectations of $7.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Excluding items, Abbott reported a profit of 59 cents per share against expectations of 58 cents per share. 
The company reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast of adjusted earnings from continuing operation between $2.80 to $2.90 per share.
""It's all about the expectations,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said, saying that investors may have been disappointed that the healthcare company only maintained its full-year profit forecast. 
The company's first-quarter results were helped by launches of new medical devices and a turnaround in its business that sells baby and adult nutritional supplements. Sales across all the company's business units, except in its established pharmaceuticals business, beat expectations. 
The established pharmaceuticals, which sells generic drugs in emerging growth countries such as India, raked in sales of 1.04 billion, but missed analysts' consensus estimates of $1.08 billion. 
The weak sales were due to a slowing market growth rate in Russia, Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call. 
""We seem to have a given market that affects our established pharmaceuticals or even our nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it's Russia,"" White said.
The company reported net earnings of $418 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.

Profit from Abbott's medical device business - its largest division - continued to benefit from its $25 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, and from new device launches. Sales for the unit rose 14.6 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",IBM Turnaround Questioned on Slow Growth of New Businesses,"(Bloomberg) -- IBM’s one-quarter growth streak is already in doubt.
Shares of the technology company fell in early trading after it reported narrower profit margins and no revenue growth, excluding help from a weak U.S. dollar. That cast a shadow over an effort to sell more-profitable cloud-based software to revive growth after five years of revenue declines.
Though heading in the right direction, the rebirth of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp. has yet to materialize, Daniel Ives, an analyst with GBH Insights LLC, said in a note to clients. “Patience is wearing thin on the Street around the  IBM  turnaround story, which continues to be elusive.”
First-quarter revenue came in at $19.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $18.8 billion. That’s 5 percent higher than a year earlier, but flat without currency fluctuations. Margins slipped 0.6 percentage points to 43.2 percent. Earlier this year, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said margins would stabilize “immediately” in the first quarter.
The stock dropped as much as 5.6 percent in early trading Wednesday after closing at $160.91 in New York.
Growth in the cloud business was 14 percent, lower than the 2017 average of 24 percent, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana said. That “puts a question mark on IBM’s hybrid cloud strategy,” he added.
During a conference call, Kavanaugh pushed back on questions from analysts about margins and whether revenue can keep expanding. He pointed to growth across the company’s business lines, and said execution problems in IBM’s computer-storage unit and consulting business were partly to blame for the quarter’s challenges.
Kavanaugh described the overall picture as positive and said Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty’s goal of getting about half of sales, or $40 billion, from newer businesses was ahead of schedule.
“This is a good start to the year,” Kavanaugh said. “We’re well on pace to deliver that $40 billion earlier than 2018.” Those new businesses represented 47 percent of revenue over the last 12 months, he noted.
Rometty reversed the trend of revenue declines late last year, though that boost wasn’t fueled as much by new businesses as by cyclical demand for more-traditional mainframe computers. Investors are watching closely for gains in newer software and services to support growth when the bump from hardware sales fades. In the meantime, Rometty has shifted thousands of jobs outside the U.S. and reduced costs.
On average, analysts expected IBM to lift its full-year profit forecast, but the company kept it at $13.80 a share.
Armonk, New York-based IBM said adjusted earnings per share were $2.45 in the quarter, up 4 percent from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $2.42 a share on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Some investors aren’t waiting around to see if Rometty can return Big Blue to its glory days as one of the tech industry’s bellwethers. Warren Buffett, who plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011, exited his position almost completely in recent months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eked out a small gain while the Dow declined after a volatile trading session on Wednesday, with weakness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials offsetting strong gains in the energy and industrial indexes.
Higher oil prices boosted energy stocks while transport stocks such as CSX Corp helped the industrial sector. But IBM's (N:IBM) 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company's quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets.
""There's a lot of headlines pulling the market in different directions. The most notable is energy prices pulling that sector higher,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise in Boston.

In late afternoon trade the S&P briefly lost ground after a Federal Reserve report said robust business borrowing, rising consumer spending, and tight labor markets indicated the U.S. economy is on track for continued growth, with trade war risks being the one big outlier.
However, Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania, said investors were hopeful for a positive outcome with China.
""China trade tensions seem to have moved to the back burner,"" he said. ""Earnings are part of the equation as well. The bar was high. There was a risk expectations would outpace what comes through but generally earnings have been favorable.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Activist investor RBR Capital Advisors, which last year called for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to be broken up, does not hold any registered shares in the bank, both parties said on Wednesday. 
However, a spokesman for RBR said the hedge fund founded by investor Rudolf Bohli had not reduced its stake in Switzerland's second-biggest bank - only that the shares were not registered.
""Rudolf Bohli no longer owns any Credit Suisse shares entered in the share register,"" a Credit Suisse spokesman said. 
He added it was possible RBR held a so-called economic interest in shares via an account with a prime broker, but that this would not give RBR any voting rights.
The RBR spokesman declined to say how its shares were held.
RBR rose to prominence through high-profile, but ultimately unsuccessful, campaigns against asset manager GAM and airline caterer Gategroup.
Last year it proposed a break-up of Credit Suisse, saying it had taken a 0.2 percent stake in October.
But the bank flagged a reduction in RBR's stake just a month and a half later, which the hedge fund denied.
Credit Suisse shares have risen 2.8 percent since Bohli announced his initial proposals on Oct. 17. They were flat at 1405 GMT, in line with the Stoxx European bank index.
Prime brokers, usually large banks, make money from hedge funds by providing services such as stock lending, financing and trade execution.
Credit Suisse holds it annual general meeting on April 27, at which RBR will not be able to make proposals or vote on agenda items.
Major shareholder advisory groups are backing the bank's pay proposals after it overhauled a compensation policy that provoked criticism last year.

In January, RBR announced the closure of one of its funds and said it would be placing greater emphasis on shareholder activism. It also shifted its focus on Credit Suisse by calling for it to revamp its IT platform and cut jobs.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 11:59AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley executives tamp down enthusiasm on record profit,"By Aparajita Saxena and Lauren Tara LaCapra
(Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reported record first-quarter profit on Wednesday thanks to a surge in trading activity, much like other Wall Street banks, but executives warned results through the rest of the year may not be quite as strong.
Capital markets flourished during the first few months of 2018 as major economies expanded around the globe and U.S. interest rates rose, with bouts of volatility proving generally positive for trading. 
As investors flocked to stock, bond, commodity and currency markets to adjust their portfolios, Morgan Stanley’s broader institutional securities business reported its best results since 2007. 
Trading revenue soared 26 percent to $4.4 billion, topping Morgan Stanley’s chief rival,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), in dollar terms.
However, the early days of the second quarter have been defined more by geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts and debates about the direction of yields, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview. That bodes less well for trading revenue, especially since the first quarter is seasonally the strongest.
""If Morgan Stanley's strategy could be defined simply, it would be that we will do fine when the markets are tough and we would do well when the markets are good,"" Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on a call with analysts. 
""There are others who might do better when the markets are good. That's fine. What I care about is how we do when the markets are tough.""
Morgan Stanley can generate at least $7.5 billion in revenue in a worst-case scenario, Gorman said, thanks to steps he has taken to grow more consistent income streams, like wealth management.
Overall, Morgan Stanley’s quarterly profit rose 40 percent year-over-year to $2.6 billion, or $1.45 per share, easily topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.25 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Total revenue rose 14 percent to $11.1 billion.
Analysts were generally positive on the results. In a report titled “Firing on All Cylinders,” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said Morgan Stanley had beat estimates in nearly all of its businesses.
Morgan Stanley shares rose 0.8 percent to $53.65 in morning trading.
Its report followed similarly sunny earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and Goldman Sachs. 
Unlike Morgan Stanley’s Pruzan, Goldman’s finance chief had said he believed the market trends that led to the blockbuster quarter were sustainable.
HIGHER TARGETS AHEAD?
Gorman, 59, joined Morgan Stanley in 2006 as head of wealth management. He became CEO in 2010, as the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. 
His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and emphasizing steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue.
During the call, Gorman made frequent references to how far Morgan Stanley has come since he took the helm, calling it a “different planet now.”
He noted that when he joined, the bank’s wealth business generated $1.25 million in quarterly revenue, a tiny fraction of the $4.4 billion it printed last quarter. 
Overall, Morgan Stanley had been generating returns-on-equity of just 2 percent or so, compared with the annualized return of 14.9 percent last quarter.
That means it is well above the 10 percent minimum investors generally like to see, above the 10 percent to 13 percent target range Gorman set a few months ago, and close to Goldman Sachs, which reported a 15.4 percent return-on-equity in the first quarter.
Asked by analysts whether the target should be raised, Gorman said it would be “silly” to change so quickly, but that he would re-evaluate if Morgan Stanley generates returns above that range through the rest of the year.

“Philosophically, the target range is supposed to represent a normal set of outcomes under kind of tough market environment and a good market environment,” he said. “This was a very good market environment.”

SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -  Malayan Banking Bhd  (Maybank) (KL:MBBM), Malaysia's biggest bank, is preparing to spin off and list its Etiqa insurance arm on the local stock exchange, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Etiqa, which operates in Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia, is estimated to be worth at least $1 billion, two sources said. It would have a bigger market value than insurance peer  Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Bhd  (KL:TAKA), which is valued at about $700 million.
Maybank's insurance business is called Etiqa International Holdings Sdn Bhd, which owns 69 percent of Maybank Ageas Holdings Bhd while Ageas, the Brussels-based international insurer holds the remainder. Maybank Ageas owns various Etiqa units.
Maybank and Etiqa had no immediate response to Reuters queries and Ageas declined to comment.
As part of the transaction, Maybank's investors will receive shares in the insurance company in proportion to their existing holding in the bank, the sources said, adding that no new money is expected to be raised in the listing.
Maybank, Etiqa and Ageas have appointed investment banks for the spin off, said the sources, who declined to be identified as news of the listing is not public.
""The listing will help Maybank unlock value and get it higher valuations,"" said a source, adding that Maybank aims to list the insurance business later this year.

Chairman Ferruccio Ferragamo in March took temporary managing powers at the Florentine shoemaker following the exit of CEO Eraldo Poletto, who had been appointed in August 2016. 
The chairman said at the time he would run the company for as little as possible though the group would take the time needed to find the right candidate, who would come from outside the company. 
One of the sources told Reuters the executive committee the chairman was pulling together would include managers from outside the company. The source added that it could take up to eighteen months to find a new CEO.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Soaring U.S. aluminum prices to diverge from LME after Rusal sanctions,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Aluminium prices in the United States have soared and are expected to diverge from those traded on the London Metal Exchange after the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Russian producer Rusal (HK:0486).
This is because large amounts of Rusal's metal produced before sanctions were imposed on April 6 are expected to be warranted for delivery against the LME's aluminum contract, a move expected to result in sliding or stagnating prices.
Rusal's aluminum was suspended from the LME's list of approved brands from Tuesday, but its metal already in LME registered warehouses before the sanctions were imposed will not be affected.
However, sources say, many banks, traders and brokers will be wary of holding any Rusal aluminum, even if it was produced before April 6, and will offload it as soon as possible onto the LME, a market of last resort during times of low demand. 
Data from the exchange showed aluminum stocks in LME warehouses originating from producers in eastern Europe stood at 450,650 tonnes or 36 percent of the total as of April 6. Sources say this category would be metal mostly produced by Rusal.
Stocks of aluminum in LME warehouses since April 9 have surged more than 12 percent to 1.42 million tonnes.
(For a graphic on 'LME aluminum stocks' click https://reut.rs/2Hb7RFw)
""Lots of people are nervous about holding Rusal's aluminum, even if it is pre-sanction, that will create a discount,"" said Oliver Nugent, commodities strategist at ING.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the United States produced 741,000 tonnes of aluminum last year. It imported 6.2 million tonnes of metal and semi-fabricated products, of which more than 700,000 tonnes came from Russia. 
""U.S. premiums for aluminum are up, there needs to be a divergence against the LME to incentivize exports of primary metal and semi products to the United States,"" Nugent said
Physical market transactions are typically based on a premium - above $460 a tonne for aluminum in the United States and up 15 percent since April 6 - above a price set on futures exchanges such as the LME.
U.S. premiums have doubled since January when the market started factoring in tariffs on aluminum imports.
(For a graphic on 'U.S. aluminum premiums' click https://reut.rs/2HbF7wc)
However, given Rusal accounted for more than six percent of global aluminum supplies estimated at around 63 million tonnes last year, worries about shortages have fueled a rally in LME aluminum, up more than 20 percent to $2,450 a tonne.
""LME prices might go up in the near term, but people will get over the shock and remember there aren't really any real shortages,"" an aluminum consumer in Europe said.
(For a graphic on 'China, U.S. aluminum production' click https://reut.rs/2JUYiMH)
A surplus in top producer China could fill the deficit in the rest of the world, but this would mean premiums would have to be high enough to incentivize shipments to the United States and elsewhere.
These premiums would need to cover transport costs and a 15 percent levy on exports of primary aluminum from China.
(For a graphic on 'China aluminum exports' click https://reut.rs/2H99gfr)
""In terms of foreign material, Rotterdam duty unpaid premiums, for example, have been around $100 a tonne for the past two months,"" analysts at ICBC Standard Bank said in a note published last week. 
""However, if they now also begin to move higher, U.S. mid-west premiums would similarly need to increase in order to incentivize the re-routing of metal.""
Major Japanese trading houses shunning Rusal's metal and scrambling for metal elsewhere have also seen physical market premiums for Japan rise to three-year highs at $170 a tonne from $117 on April 9.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 02:09PM ET</span>","Explainer: Ant Financial's $150 billion valuation, and the big recent bump-up","By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Ant Financial's rapid climb to become the world's biggest super unicorn valued by some investors at around $150 billion showcases investor enthusiasm for the biggest Chinese tech companies and also how quickly valuations can shift. Just two months ago, bankers and investors were tentatively talking of a figure closer to $100 billion. 
WHAT IS ANT FINANCIAL, EXACTLY?
Ant's biggest and best-known business is Alipay, the biggest player in China's $17 trillion online payments market. Ant also sells wealth management products and offers small loans and credit scores, among other ventures. Jack Ma, founder of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) controls Ant.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimate that online payments accounted for 55 per cent of Ant's $8.9 billion revenue last year, but they expect that to fall to one-third by 2021 as the company focuses on encouraging its 600 million customers to use more of its other, higher-margin services.
WHY THE BIG JUMP IN VALUATION? 
At a valuation of around $150 billion, Ant will trail only the big four state-controlled banks and insurer Ping An among financial-focused firms in China. It will also be about 50 percent more valuable than Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
Much of the rapid rise in its valuation is being attributed to the company's disclosure of additional performance data, which although by no means its full financials, included some 2017 full-year figures that showed faster-than-expected growth. That helped investors and analysts tweak their financial models. 
Ant's status as one of the biggest tech groups in China is also boosting demand. 
""It’s not very often to get a chance to invest in super unicorns like Ant, even in China where you’ve seen a tech boom for years,” said one existing investor in Ant. ""If you miss this one, you don’t know when the next one comes."" 
HOW ARE PEOPLE GETTING TO $150 BILLION?
Robert Kapito, co-founder of U.S. asset manager BlackRock, this week described himself as ""shocked"" at Ant's likely valuation but many analysts are not blinking. 
Barclays analysts this month valued the company at $155 billion, based on multiplying their estimate of Ant's 2019 net operating profit less adjusted tax (NOPLAT) by what they said was its conservative price/earnings ratio of 28. 
NOPLAT is often used by analysts to measure companies' operating efficiency because it strips out the impact of interest payments and other financing costs.
Other groups have used alternative means of valuing Ant. Jefferies analysts, who believe up to 70 per cent of Ant's 2017 business came from online payments, used Paypal (O:PYPL) as a comparison and valued Ant at $133 billion, equivalent to seven times their estimate for its 2019 sales - in line with the multiple implied by PayPal's share price. 
Based on traditional price-earnings measures, $150 billion implies a price 71 times Ant's 2017 pre-tax profits or 85 times its net profits, assuming a tax rate of 16 per cent - the average paid by Alibaba in recent years. Ant does not disclose actual profits and its pre-tax earnings of 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) are calculated from disclosures in filings by Alibaba, which is set to become Ant's one-third owner soon. 
Alibaba itself trades at 43 times last year's profits as does rival Tencent (HK:0700), home of Alipay rival WeChat Pay.
WHAT CHALLENGES DOES ANT FACE?
Ant, expected to go public in the next two years, has vowed to reach 2 billion users worldwide in the next decade and it has been investing overseas, buying a stake in Indian payment firm Paytm and Thai financial technology firm Ascend Money, among others.
""Ant has taken a very strategic view of international expansion - with highly-targeted investments, joint ventures, and partnerships across the region,"" said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific Fintech leader at EY. ""While mainland China remains core, I wouldn't underestimate the potential upside of their international endeavors.""
But it could be China itself that causes Ant problems. While Alipay holds 54 per cent of the country's fast-growing mobile payments market, WeChat Pay holds 38.2 per cent, according to Jefferies. Both are keen to increase their dominance. 
Beijing also has a history of unexpected rule changes which can derail business plans. Last year regulators suddenly took steps to rein in the online lending market - a key growth engine for Ant - as part of its wider crackdown on easy credit. 

""These things that Ant is doing are quite innovative and new. They may work this year, but stop working next year, depending on China's regulations,"" said a Hong Kong-based equity analyst with a Japanese asset manager. ""It's hard to analyze their value.""

838,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Trump Makes Another Fine Fed Choice,"(Bloomberg View) -- In the first 15 months of his presidency, Donald Trump has made some highly questionable economic moves -- a large and complex tax cut, tariffs that seem guaranteed to hurt important U.S. industries and the opening salvos of a trade war with China. But in terms of Federal Reserve appointees, Trump has so far been doing a solid job.
Trump’s decision to replace Janet Yellen as head of the Fed was an unnecessary move -- Yellen had been doing a great job, and the change was probably just an attempt to erase former President Barack Obama’s legacy. But Trump’s replacement, Jerome Powell, is as good a pick as could be hoped for. Powell is a steady hand who seems unlikely to veer into hawkish territory, and his decision to maintain closer contact with the Fed’s academic economists is an unexpected but good one.
Some observers, me included, had expected -- and feared -- that Trump would instead nominate economist John Taylor to the top Fed spot. In addition to being a generally hawkish figure, Taylor is wedded to a monetary policy rule that bears his name. That rule, which places a strong emphasis on preventing inflation and less weight on stimulating the economy, would have raised interest rates much earlier after the 2008 crisis, thus threatening the fragile recovery. Here are former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s estimates of what the original Taylor rule would have recommended, contrasted with his own less hawkish preference:
Wisely, Powell is eschewing this hawkish route and is choosing to raise rates only cautiously.
Now, Trump has made another good choice, announcing his intention to nominate economist Richard Clarida for Fed vice chairman. Clarida, who has recently been working at investment firm Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, is also a venerable and respected monetary economist. His work shows why the Fed’s current cautious approach is justified.
As a macroeconomist, Clarida worked on a set of ideas now known as New Keynesian economics. In the 1980s, the idea that central banks could stabilize the real economy had lost some of its sway within the halls of academia -- instead, many believed that preventing inflation should be the only goal. The New Keynesians reversed this in the 1990s, creating models that justified central bank intervention to revive moribund economies.
In 1999, along with Jordi Gali and Mark Gertler, Clarida wrote a lucid, readable article in the Journal of Economic Literature explaining the emerging New Keynesian paradigm. In 2002, the trio extended New Keynesian models to an international setting, tackling the often-ignored question of how central banks in different countries should interact.
The New Keynesians wanted central banks to keep a role for recession-fighting without sacrificing their vigilance against inflation. Clarida, Gali and Gertler called this “soft-hearted” inflation targeting. In a famous 2000 paper, the three economists estimated how the Fed had responded to inflation and recessions in the periods before and after the appointment of Chairman Paul Volcker in 1979. Assuming that the Fed followed a Taylor-type rule, they found that Volcker’s ascendancy brought an increased emphasis on inflation-fighting -- which made sense given the high inflation levels of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Slowly, New Keynesianism won the intellectual battle, and became the dominant school of thought in academic macroeconomics. But even though it was now widely recognized that the Fed and other central banks boost the economy, there remained the crucial question of how much weight they should give to that task, versus fighting inflation. In their New Keynesian manifesto, Clarida, Gali and Gertler estimated that the Fed under Volcker and his successor Alan Greenspan placed substantially more emphasis on economic stimulus than Taylor’s original rule would recommend.
Assuming (as many do) that Volcker and Greenspan did a good job keeping inflation under control while boosting the real economy, this means that Clarida helped to show that the original Taylor rule is too hawkish, and that a more dovish modification is optimal. Bernanke agrees
-- his own version of the rule, pictured in the graph above, put a weighting on economic growth that is similar to Clarica, Gali and Gertler's estimate of what Volcker and Greenspan used.
But that leaves the question of whether Volcker and Greenspan really did such a good job. Although widely praised for keeping inflation low while allowing strong economic growth to proceed during the 1990s, Greenspan has been criticized by some for ignoring the rise of asset bubbles. After the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed, macroeconomists scrambled to add the role of the financial industry to their models. They have also been working to deal with the problem of the zero lower bound -- the fact that nominal interest rates can’t go much below zero, limiting the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy during a long or deep recession.
Clarida hasn't ignored either of those crucial issues. In a 2010 essay, he argued that the Fed’s failure before 2008 wasn’t bad monetary policy, but lax regulation of the financial industry. And he praised the Fed’s decision to use unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing, in addition to forward guidance about future changes in interest rates, after hitting the zero lower bound.
All of this suggests that Clarida’s approach to monetary policy will be very similar to that of Bernanke, Yellen, Powell and other recent Fed officials. He won’t take a hawkish turn or ignore the Fed’s mandate to support growth, but he won’t forget the threat of inflation either. In other words, like Powell, Clarida represents continuity, and a steady hand at the wheel.

839,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 06:33AM ET</span>",Fashion brand Bally increases profits on U.S. and Japanese growth,"By Sonya Dowsett
MADRID (Reuters) - High-end Swiss leather goods brand Bally made its biggest underlying profit in a decade last year, buoyed by growth in the United States and Japan, Chief Executive Officer Frederic de Narp said in an interview.
De Narp, who joined nearly five years ago from jeweler Harry Winston, has brought the privately-held luxury brand back to growth after years of stagnant sales and lackluster collections marked by high turnover of designers and management.
""It's tangible, we've seen sales grow in every single continent,"" he told Reuters at the sidelines of the World Retail Congress in Madrid. 
Sales at the privately-held company have grown over the past two years and the company booked its biggest core profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) in ten years in 2017, he said, declining to elaborate further.
The United States is Bally's fastest-growing market, buoyed by collaborations with rappers and street artists. Sales in the U.S. have grown by more than 20 percent this year, outpacing a 14 percent rise in 2017, he said. 
Name-checked in lyrics by U.S. rappers Doug E Fresh and Slick Rick in the 1980s, Bally has sought to boost its street appeal through product collaborations. 
The latest saw U.S. hip hop recording artist Swizz Beatz and Spanish street artist Ricardo Cavolo produce a capsule collection featuring spark and feather printed sneakers, sweatshirts and bomber jackets.
In February, Bally's owner Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings agreed to sell a majority stake in the company to Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi for an undisclosed sum. 
The Chinese textile maker has risen from its roots as a 1970s wool producer in Shandong province in eastern China to a global luxury house after snapping up brands in an international shopping spree in recent years. 
It adds Bally to a portfolio that includes British suit maker Gieves & Hawkes; Paris-based SMCP, owner of upmarket high-street brands Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot; and menswear designer and fragrance house Cerruti 1881.
Following the departure of creative director Pablo Coppola in December, Bally has grouped three head designers for accessories, shoes and ready-to-wear under brand director Morad Tabrizi who joined Bally from Tom Ford in 2015.
De Narp and his team have committed to stay at Bally for more than five years as a condition of Shandong buying the group, he said.
The company, founded in Switzerland in the mid-nineteenth century, was one of the first luxury brands to enter China in the 1980s when the country opened up to foreign investment. 
Over half of sales are made to Chinese, either in China or while traveling abroad, de Narp said.
However, under de Narp's leadership, Bally closed a third of stores in China over the past three years in order to focus on bigger selling spaces in prime areas and launched new casual ranges to appeal to younger clients. 
Bally will open its first Chinese flagship store in the upmarket China World shopping mall in Beijing this year and has hired Chinese actress Tiffany Tang for promotional campaigns. 
""Five years ago Chinese clientele were on average 10 years younger than western clientele. Today, the Chinese client is around 20 years younger than my western clientele,"" he said.

Millennial shoppers pushed the Chinese market up to 142 billion yuan in sales last year, about 20 percent higher than the year before, according to consultancy Bain & Co. It is by far the steepest jump in over half a decade of sluggish growth.

Around 10 premises in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg were searched by around 160 officials, the prosecutor's office in Porsche's home town of Stuttgart said in a statement.
""The three suspects include a member of the management board and a member of Porsche AG's higher management. The third suspect is no longer employed at Porsche AG,"" it said.
The searches form part of an investigation into employees of Porsche AG suspected of fraud and fraudulent advertising tied to manipulated emissions control systems of diesel passenger cars, the prosecutors said.
A spokesman for Porsche confirmed the searches, but declined to provide further details. 
More than 2-1/2 years after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines in the United States, the carmaker and some of its brands continue to be investigated by authorities. 
Earlier this year, German prosecutors widened a probe of Porsche's sister brand Audi, which developed a 3.0 liter V6 diesel engine used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models found to have been equipped with illicit software. 

Two Audi sites were also searched on Wednesday, Stuttgart prosecutors and an Audi spokesman said. The searches were at Audi's sites in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm, Audi said.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>",Shire faces criticism on CEO pay policy as crunch week looms,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) -  Shire  (L:SHP), the $47 billion rare disease drugmaker being stalked by Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502), faces fresh criticism over its executive pay policy from a leading investor advisory group as a crunch week approaches.
Shareholders will vote on pay and other matters at Shire's annual general meeting on April 24, a day before Takeda must decide whether it will make a takeover bid. Shire will then report first-quarter results on April 26.
Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), which advises pension funds and others how to vote at AGMs, believes that Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov's maximum potential bonus is ""excessive"" at 780 percent of salary, even though he took a pay cut last year.
Ornskov's total remuneration last year fell to $5.3 million, from $10.6 million in 2016, after a disappointing year for the company, which is registered in Jersey, headquartered in Dublin and listed in London. 
Shire faces increased competition both from generic and new drugs made by rivals, prompting Ornskov in January to ditch a previous revenue target of $20 billion by 2020.
Two years ago almost half of its shareholders voted against Shire's executive pay plans during a spate of criticism of pay packages at a number of companies. The Shire remuneration report then won 93 percent support in 2017.
Two other shareholder advisory groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, said they recommended votes in favor of all of Shire's 2018 AGM proposals, including the CEO's pay.
A Shire spokesman declined to comment.
Ornskov has come under fire from investors after his $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016, which exposed Shire to increased risk in the haemophilia market at a time when a new drug from Roche (S:ROG) and pending gene therapies threatened disruption.
The widely criticized Baxalta deal marked a change in sentiment toward Shire, a former stock market darling that was nearly bought by AbbVie (N:ABBV) in 2014, with the U.S. suitor walking away because of changes to U.S. tax rules. 
Two days ago Shire agreed to sell its cancer drugs business to France's Servier for $2.4 billion. The move highlighted value in its portfolio but may also have frustrated Takeda, which cited oncology as one factor behind its interest. 

Shire started life in 1986 as a tiny business selling calcium supplements from above a shop in southern England but has evolved into a global drugmaker, driven by deal-making and some big bets on high-priced speciality medicines.

BERLIN (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp's (N:LMT) Sikorsky has partnererd with more German firms in its bid to win a 4 billion euro ($5 billion) heavy-lift helicopter contract from Berlin, and will showcase the industrial team at next week's Berlin air show.
""This shows how important this campaign is to us. We believe it's a must-win,"" Beth Parcella, who heads international sales for the Sikorsky program, told Reuters on Wednesday.
The U.S. weapons maker's new Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter will make its global debut at the Berlin air show with a ""very compelling flight demonstration,"" Parcella said.
The CH-53K , which the U.S. Marine Corps expects to declare combat-ready in 2019, will vie with Boeing Co's (N:BA) CH-47 Chinook to replace Germany's aging fleet of CH-53G aircraft.
Sikorsky said it is adding to deals already struck with  Rheinmetall  (DE:RHMG), MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn) and Hensoldt Sensors AG, by including ZF Luftfahrttechnik GmbH, Autoflug, Hydro Systems KG, the German unit of Rockwell Collins (N:COL), Jenoptik Germany (DE:JENG), Liebherr and Rohde & Schwarz.
The German defense ministry plans to issue a request for information in the second half of 2018 and award the winning bidder a contract in mid-2020, for deliveries to start in 2023.
Lockheed, in collaboration with Airbus-owned (PA:AIR) European missiles group MBDA, Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italian group Leonardo (MI:LDOF), is also negotiating with Germany's defense ministry on the TLVS missile defense system.
And the company is hoping to sell Germany dozens of F-35 fighter jets to replace older Tornado fighters.
Parcella said it was possible personnel changes in the German defense ministry and procurement agency could stall the program, but said it made sense to quickly replace the existing CH-53G fleet that has been flying for over 45 years.
""The legacy fleet will only become more expensive (to maintain) as time goes on,"" she said.
Some German military officials favor the Boeing CH-47, which is flown by eight other NATO countries, but others say the larger CH-53K would allow growth in future missions.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 05:23AM ET</span>",Airlines inspecting Boeing 737 engines after fatal Southwest incident,"By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some major customers of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's popular 737 jets including Korean Air Lines Co Ltd said on Wednesday they were inspecting engines of the type that blew apart mid-air on a fatal Southwest Airlines Co flight on Tuesday.
European regulators this month began requiring an inspection by early next year, and a person familiar with the matter said U.S. regulators were near a similar rule, which affects a number of 737s in operation globally.
Southwest Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia on Tuesday after an engine ripped apart mid-air, shattering a window on the 737 and nearly sucking a passenger through. One of 144 passengers died.
The actions by regulators show that there has been some concern, albeit non-urgent, about the engine, a workhorse of the global civil aviation fleet that has logged more than 350 million hours of safe travel but was also being examined after a 2016 accident.
The CFM56-7B engine type involved in the Southwest incident was produced by a joint venture of U.S. firm  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA called CFM International. It is one of the most common engines, paired with the world's most-sold plane, the Boeing 737. 
Southwest said it is speeding up inspections of all related engines out of extra caution, which it expects to complete within 30 days.
An early review of the failed Southwest engine found apparent metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters on Tuesday.
""We are very concerned"" about metal fatigue, Sumwalt said. ""There needs to be proper inspection mechanisms in place to check for this before there's a catastrophic event.""
Korean Air said on Wednesday it had not yet been prompted by its regulators for a check but it planned to inspect engines used on its entire 737 fleet by November following the Southwest incident.
About 20 percent to 30 percent of its 35 Boeing 737 jets use the same type of fan blade as the one on the Southwest jet, a Korean Air official said.
A Japan Airlines Co Ltd spokesman said two 737 jets in its fleet had engines with affected fan blades and inspections were due to be completed by the end of the day on Wednesday.
In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine, and debris ripped a foot-long hole above the left wing. Investigators found signs of metal fatigue.
The 2016 incident prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to propose ultrasonic inspections of similar fan blades and their replacement should they fail the test. 
Sumwalt said the NTSB will review whether the engines involved in Tuesday's incident might have been subject to the directive, which is not yet finalised.
The FAA proposal estimated that checks would require two hours of labor per inspection.
Not all airlines operating 737s are affected.
Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd, a large 737 operator, said its engines were of a slightly different model than those targeted for inspection.

Spokespeople for several other major airlines operating 737s could not be reached immediately for comment.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has put on hold privatization plans for King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, the kingdom's second biggest airport, sources familiar with the matter said.
The Gulf Arab state is launching a privatization drive as part of wider economic reforms aimed at boosting efficiency, easing pressure on state finances and diversifying the oil dependent economy.
In July, sources told Reuters that Goldman Sachs (N:GS) was hired by the government to manage Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company's (SAVC) plans to sell a minority stake in Riyadh airport.
""Right now they are looking at the plan again because it is starting to look more like a concession rather than privatization,"" said one source familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is not yet public.
Another source familiar with the deal said the privatization is on hold, without elaborating. Neither source gave a timeline.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the issue when contacted by Reuters. A Saudi aviation authority spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
SAVC Chairman Faisal Hamad al-Sugair had said in December that the goal was for airports in the kingdom to be ""corporatized"", or turned into private companies, in 2018 and that privatization would follow later.
Officials have highlighted transport as a priority sector for privatization, however the process has taken time to get underway. The kingdom had said in November 2015 it expected to begin privatizing airports in the first quarter of 2016.
The airport privatization plan is expected to move faster than those for more complex sectors such as healthcare and electricity, one of the sources said.
The Saudi government has said that it planned to raise about $200 billion through its privatization program in coming years, in addition to some $100 billion through the planned sale of a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco .

853,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 05:14AM ET</span>",European shares advance as earnings season gathers pace,"By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares firmed on Wednesday, supported by well-received company results as the focus turned from international politics to the first-quarter earnings season. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.2 percent by 0852 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) ticked 0.1 percent higher. A rise among more cyclical sectors, such as materials and financials, contributed the most to gains.
Company updates were broadly rewarded with a bounce in shares, as French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) rose 3.4 percent after its first-quarter sales beat forecasts on the back of strong demand for baby food in China.
Private healthcare provider Mediclinic (L:MDCM) rose around 5 percent after a full-year update, while Dutch oil and chemical storage company  Vopak  (AS:VOPA) gained 4 percent after saying it has the potential to improve earnings significantly in 2019.
Russian precious metals miner  Polymetal  (L:POLYP), whose shares have been hit by concerns over U.S. sanctions, was the biggest gainer after saying that its first-quarter revenue rose 19 percent year-on-year.
While the European first-quarter earnings season is not expected to be quite as stellar as the U.S., year-on-year earnings growth for MSCI EMU (European Economic and Monetary Union) is expected to be around 16 percent in dollar terms, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.
""(The earnings season) is going pretty well in Europe, just not quite at the same pace as the U.S. ... the U.S. are just a couple of steps ahead in terms of their movement through the economic cycle,"" Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said.
""We're looking actually at the next set of few quarters of growth, earnings acceleration probably, whereas in the U.S. ... the growth is probably going in the other direction,"" Lawler added. 
Aside from earnings, deal-making was not far from the action after British property company  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) withdrew its recommendation that shareholders back a merger with smaller rival  Intu Properties  (L:INTUP).
""Retail businesses are already struggling with higher business rates as well as declining footfall so today’s news that Hammerson is pulling out of its ... bid for its rival Intu Properties is quite a sensible move,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.
Shares in Hammerson rose 3 percent, while Intu Properties fell more than 4 percent, placing it among the worst-performing stocks on the STOXX 600. 

Last week France's  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) walked away from a bid for Hammerson, saying that the British firm failed to provide ""meaningful engagement"" over a potential deal.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",India jet fuel demand to soar as domestic air travel takes off,"By Koustav Samanta
(Reuters) - An Indian push to connect more cities via airports as an expanding middle class increasingly takes to the skies is set to help propel the country's demand for jet fuel to record highs this year.
That rapid growth in appetite for aviation fuel means the country's refiners are far less likely to send cargoes abroad, tightening markets from Asia to Europe. 
Years of breakneck economic expansion have helped India become the world's fastest growing major domestic aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association.
That has been underpinned by ambitious government plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure, including a push to build airports and offer airlines incentives to fly to smaller cities.
""The country's air transport sector has huge potential to grow in the long-term given its large geographical expanse and growing consumer affluence,"" said Sri Paravaikkarasu, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy FGE.

Average monthly demand for jet fuel could break through 700,000 tonnes this year, up from 2017's record 623,000 tonnes and from 566,000 tonnes in 2016, several industry analysts estimated.
That would be an annual growth rate of around 12 percent, comparable to what China achieved during its main boom years in the early 2000s.
India used 2.02 million tonnes of aviation fuel from January-March this year, up 9.4 percent from a year earlier, the latest government data showed. 
FGE forecasts a 10.5-percent year-on-year increase in Indian demand for jet fuel in 2018, while energy consultancy Trifecta expects growth of 12-15 percent. 
REACH FOR THE SKIES
Under a flagship government scheme, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is set to invest 175 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) in upgrading airport infrastructure over 2019-20.
""Both passenger and freight miles should benefit from the state-led build out in related infrastructure and improving domestic interconnectivity,"" said Emma Richards, a senior oil and gas analyst in London at BMI Research.
In a round of bidding for air routes concluded earlier this year, the AAI awarded over 400,000 kilometers per week to connect smaller cities, known as 'Tier 2' destinations.
Top Indian carrier Interglobe Aviation (NS:INGL), which operates as IndiGo and won most of the tenders, said new routes would include flying from Bhopal in central India to Nashik in the west. 
India's domestic air traffic for the first two months of 2018 jumped nearly 22 percent from the year before to 22.2 million passengers, according to data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.
The country's top five busiest airports - Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata - handled 31.9 million passengers this January and February, up 15.3 percent from the same period last year.
LESS FOR THE REST
Indian oil refineries such as  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) and Essar Oil  are significant exporters of petroleum products including jet fuel. Thomson Reuters data shows India is one of the top three Asian suppliers of jet fuel.
But exports are set to slow as local demand surges.
""Domestic demand growth will certainly limit its ability to service other markets in the region,"" said Richards at BMI.
Already, India's monthly exports dropped by more than 7 percent year-on-year in 2017.
To deal with rising consumption, India's refineries are expanding.

India's Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals - a joint venture between Indian Oil (NS:IOC),  Hindustan Petroleum  (NS:HPCL) and  Bharat Petroleum  (NS:BPCL) - in April signed an initial deal with Saudi Aramco to build a huge refinery in the western state of Maharashtra. Reliance Industries, operator of the world's largest refinery, plans to expand its oil processing capacity by over 40 percent by 2030.

The official, Wang Zhanfeng, is the head of the Guangdong branch of China's banking regulator, the people said.
China's anti-corruption watchdog said on Tuesday it is investigating Huarong Chairman Lai Xiaomin for suspected ""serious discipline violations"", a euphemism for graft, the latest in a string of probes into high-profile financial executives.
Huarong, one of China's largest state-owned bad debt managers, hit the headlines this year after building up a 36 percent stake in a key unit of embattled private energy company CEFC China Energy. The unit, CEFC Hainan International, is acquiring a $9.1 billion stake in Russia's oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN).
Li Xin, chief supervisor of China Orient Asset Management Co Ltd, will be named president of Huarong, the people added, declining to be identified as the information was not public.
When contacted, a representative for Huarong referred to a filing. A filing has yet to be made, according to checks by Reuters. 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to an emailed request seeking comment. Reuters was not able to reach Wang or Li for comment. China Orient declined to comment.
The appointments were announced to a small group of executives internally on Wednesday, one of the sources said, adding that the personnel changes will ""have a large impact"" on the operations of Huarong, a company Lai has headed since 2009.
Huarong's Hong Kong-listed shares (HK:2799), which have a market value of HK$124 billion ($15.80 billion), were suspended from trade on Wednesday, pending a statement. 
Trade in shares of two of its units, Huarong Investment Stock Corp Ltd (HK:2277) and Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd (HK:0993), was also suspended.
State-controlled Huarong is among the Big Four bad debt managers created in 1999 to take over distressed assets from China's Big Four state-owned lenders.
Reuters, Chinese and international media reported in March that Ye Jianming, the chairman and founder of privately owned CEFC, had been investigated for suspected economic crimes. Ye's current whereabouts are unclear.

MENLO PARK, Calif. (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Tuesday it would continue requiring people to accept targeted ads as a condition of using its service, a stance that may help keep its business model largely intact despite a new European Union privacy law.
The EU law, which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.
Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans' permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.
""Facebook is an advertising-supported service,"" Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook's headquarters.
Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but ""all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that's true for offline advertising, as well.""
Facebook, the world's largest social media network, will use what are known as ""permission screens"" - pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance - to notify and obtain approval.
The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.
The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit ""decline."" Instead, they will guide users to either ""accept and continue"" or ""manage data setting,"" according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.
""People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,"" Sherman said.
Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.
Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to U.S. congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook's commitment to privacy.
Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the EU law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

863,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Ford expands U.S. medical ride business built around its vans,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Wednesday that it was expanding a medical transport service called GoRide in Southeast Michigan, one of several efforts by the U.S. automaker to build new ride service businesses around its Transit commercial van.
Under a multi-year agreement with Michigan healthcare system Beaumont Health, Ford will use Transit vans to transport patients to medical appointments, or from hospitals to home or rehabilitation centers.
Ford already has 15 vans serving Beaumont facilities as part of a previously announced test project and plans to deploy 60 vans by the end of the year, the company said.
Van drivers will not be direct Ford employees, said Minyang Jiang, head of the GoRide business.
Like other legacy automakers, Ford has struggled to lift its shares because investors worry that ride services companies such as Uber Technologies Inc and China's Didi Chuxing, or technology companies such as Alphabet Inc, (O:GOOGL) are better positioned to capture revenue from providing transportation as a service, displacing vehicle ownership. 
Uber last year launched a service called Uber Health, also aimed at serving healthcare providers and patients who need rides to medical appointments but who do not need a costly ambulance ride.
Ford has outlined to investors plans to create and operate more services that tie together vehicles that Ford builds, particularly the Transit van, fleet management and route guidance technology the company is developing, and data generated by the vehicles. 
Its ride service efforts, including the Chariot commuter van service, are still in early stages.
Ford plans to expand the GoRide medical transport service to other cities and healthcare companies over the next several years, Marion Harris, vice president of Ford's Mobility Business group, told Reuters. 
""You will see further announcements,"" he said. 
Ford is still deciding whether GoRide will be the brand solely for non-emergency medical transport, or become a brand used more broadly for Ford's ride services, Harris said.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 04:28AM ET</span>",Australia says banking executives responsible for misconduct could face jail,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison warned that financial sector executives responsible for widespread breaches of corporate law could face jail, as a powerful judicial inquiry heard more evidence of misconduct by the country's top financial institutions.
Morrison's comments on Wednesday were made after executives at AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), Australia's largest wealth manager, admitted a day earlier it had lied to the corporate regulator for almost a decade to cover up its practice of charging thousands of customers for services they did not provide.
In further testimony to the so-called Royal Commission on Wednesday, AMP executives admitted that it had charged users of online platforms for advice fees despite not receiving the permission required by law.
""What has occurred here and what has been admitted to in the Royal Commission by AMP is deeply disturbing,"" Morrison told reporters. ""This type of behavior can attract penalties which include jail time. That is how serious these things are.""
The government-backed Royal Commission into Australia's banking sector is just a couple of months into what is expected to be a year-long investigation and public grilling of senior executives in the country's financial sector.
The inquiry will be able to make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and criminal or civil prosecutions.
Under questioning, executives of the country's largest bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) (AX:CBA), on Wednesday also said CBA was the worst of the country's big banks when it came to charging fees for services it did not provide. 
The inquiry heard CBA took more than two years to inform the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) of the issues.
""We apologize for the length of time it has taken,"" said Marianne Perkovic, head of CBA's private banking unit.
ASIC which has been criticized for lacking clout amid a series of corporate scandals, said that it was cooperating with the inquiry and that it had done 18 ""examinations"" of AMP staff related to the misappropriation of fees.
""Making false or misleading statements to ASIC can result in civil and criminal sanctions,"" the regulator said in a statement.
A similar inquiry in 2001 that looked into the collapse of the country's second-biggest insurer, HIH Insurance, led to criminal convictions and prison sentences.
""AMP is deeply disappointed that its advice business has charged customers fees where service has not been provided and for misleading the regulator in this regard,"" an AMP spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. ""We apologize unreservedly to our customers, our regulator and the community more broadly,"" she said.
AMP shares fell 2.2 percent on Wednesday, after sliding 4.4 percent the previous day. The broader market was up 0.4 percent on Wednesday.
The center-right government agreed to call the inquiry in late 2017 after years of scandals in Australia's financial sector, including interest-rate rigging, accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate insurance payouts, and accusations of money-laundering. 
It is currently focusing on the provision of financial advice by AMP and the four largest banks: CBA, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC).
Over the past decade, AMP, the four largest banks and others have paid A$383 million ($297.40 million) in compensation for the misappropriation of fees or for losses caused by bad advice, the inquiry heard on Monday.
In coming months, the inquiry will turn its attention to large insurers and pension funds.

It kept the pace set by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which reported a surge in profits on Tuesday, also driven by a sharp increase in trading as market volatility rose.
Analysts have downgraded their European earnings estimates ahead of the first-quarter results season, while U.S. companies are expected to deliver stellar results. 
Investors were watching Europe's earnings season for signs of strain from a stronger euro, with Continental providing an early indication the currency's rise was hurting exporters. 
The tyre maker fell 4.3 percent, driving a pullback in Germany's DAX, after a negative hit to earnings from exchange rates forced it to lower its outlook.
But a fall in the S&P 500 volatility gauge reflected investors' renewed confidence in the resilience of equity markets. The VIX edged down, near a six-week low.
""Volatility has come down because expectations are very strong for the earnings season and the market is happy to see some hard data,"" said Laurent Godin, equity analyst at Indosuez Wealth Management.
Britain's FTSE 100 stood out with much stronger gains. It was up 0.9 percent after an unexpected fall in British inflation to a one-year low dented the pound -- good news for its high percentage of overseas revenue earners. 
While investors were refocusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML) survey of fund managers showed signs of caution. 
Investors cut their equity allocation to an 18-month low and increased their cash balances.
""Just like they were chasing the market up in January, investors have gradually started to sell,"" said Clark Fenton, chief investment officer at Agilis Investment Management. 
""I think that gives the market scope to rally a bit more as positioning has lightened up.""

TRANS-ATLANTIC YIELD GAP WIDENS, CURRENCIES MUTED
Fund managers named the threat of trade war as the biggest ""tail risk"" in BAML's survey, while they were less concerned about inflation causing convulsions in bond markets.
Monetary tightening, proceeding at a different pace on either side of the Atlantic, was making its mark on bond markets. 
The gap between U.S. and German two-year bonds reached its widest in nearly 30 years, reflecting the diverging monetary policy outlook.
""In some ways I am sort of surprised that it hasn't mattered more,"" said Agilis' Fenton, referring to the trans-Atlantic divergence. ""I would have thought it would have helped European equity prices more on a relative basis.""
The U.S. yield curve - the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year government bond yields -- flattened back slightly, having fallen to a low of 41.8 basis points overnight. 
""I would worry if [the curve] got inverted. It's probably a bit premature to get too bent out of shape about it now,"" said Fenton.
The rise in short-dated yields has pushed the real yield on U.S. two-year Treasuries above the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time in 10 years. https://tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO
Currency market movements, outside of a sliding sterling, were restrained.
The euro was stuck at $1.2362, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index hovered at 89.5.
The yen pulled back to 107.23 against the dollar, pushed down by signs of progress in talks between South and North Korea.
Strong metals prices, boosted by supply concerns after U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminum giant Rusal, helped send Europe's basic resources stocks surging 2.1 percent. [MET/L]
Oil prices also continued their relentless rise. 
Brent crude futures were up 86 cents at $72.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 95 cents to $67.48 a barrel. [O/R]

867,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 10:08PM ET</span>",AT&T subsidiary DirecTV asks to be dropped from antitrust case,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - DirecTV, the biggest U.S. pay TV company and a subsidiary of AT&T (NYSE:T), asked a federal court on Tuesday to drop it from the lawsuit that the government filed to stop AT&T from buying movie and TV production company Time Warner.
""DIRECTV is not the seller, the acquired entity, or a major stockholder of the acquirer,"" lawyers for the company said in a filing.
In its request, DirecTV alleged that the Justice Department included the company as a defendant so it could use critical statements its executives made about the 2011 merger of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and NBCU as part of the government's argument against the AT&T/Time Warner deal. AT&T bought DirecTV in 2015.
Both instances involve a big pay TV distributor buying a movie and TV production company.
In its complaint filed against the merger in November, the Justice Department said DirecTV previously warned that mergers of TV distributors and content makers ""can much more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival (distributors)"" and can ""use such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms."" 
DirecTV has nearly 21 million subscribers, according to the complaint.
Judge Richard Leon, who will decide if the merger may go forward, is hearing evidence on whether the $84.5 billion deal is illegal under antitrust law, as the government alleges, and should be stopped. 

The witnesses this week are expected to include AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Ackman says he supports ADP but puts management on notice,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Liana B. Baker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, who lost a proxy contest at Automatic Data Processing (O:ADP) last year, said on Tuesday that he wants the human-resources technology company to succeed but said he might be back with a fight if ADP fails to perform.
Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings last month reported cutting its holding in ADP to a 7.2 percent economic stake, praised the company for planning an analyst day in June and said he and other shareholders are looking forward to hearing how executives navigate a changed economic environment. ADP will benefit from recent tax cuts, and rising interest rates should help lift guidance, Ackman said at 13D Monitor's 2018 Active-Passive Investor Summit.
""We are rooting for the company,"" Ackman said, adding, ""If we are disappointed we will say, We look forward to seeing you at the next annual meeting.""
Ackman, who runs the $8 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, has had a tense relationship with ADP's chief executive officer, Carlos Rodriguez, who said that shareholders delivered an ""ass-whipping"" to the investor when he lost the proxy contest last November.
Since then, Ackman said relations have been more cordial, and he described a four-hour-long dinner he had with Rodriguez.
Ackman also heaped praise on the new CEO of  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG), Brian Niccol, who started in March. There too, Ackman said he sees plenty of opportunity, noting the restaurant chain could offer breakfast, dessert, longer hours and drive-through options. Pershing owns 10.36 percent of Chipotle, according to Thomson Reuters data.
In a nod to diversity at boards, a topic that is gaining force in corporate America, Ackman said he may run an all-women slate one day and predicted it would win. At ADP he proposed three directors, including himself and one woman. 
Ackman, who closed out the conference, caused some attendees to murmur about his declaration in January that he planned to keep a lower profile as he tries to resurrect his business.
After three years of back-to-back losses, Pershing Square is again in the red in early 2018, but Ackman sounded an optimistic note that a turnaround is possible for him and his portfolio.
""I hope we are on our way back to rebuilding our record,"" he said.

Shares of ADP closed up 0.8 percent at $117.89 on Tuesday, and Chipotle closed up 2.5 percent at $334.61.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",U.S. inspectors probe deadly Southwest jet engine explosion,"(Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday was inspecting the wrecked engine of a Southwest Airlines Co jet that blew up in mid air, killing a passenger in the first deadly U.S. commercial airline accident in nine years.
The engine explosion, which occurred about 20 minutes after the Dallas-bound Southwest Flight 1380 with 149 on board took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, sent pieces of shrapnel flying, including one that shattered a window near the plane's left wing, killing bank executive Jennifer Riordan, 43.
An NTSB inspection crew pored over the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700 and its CFM56 engine, made by a partnership of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE). It was the second time that style of engine had failed on a Southwest jet in the past two years, prompting airlines around the world to step up inspections.
Passengers described scenes of panic as a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a window on the aircraft, almost sucking a female passenger out. Witnesses speaking with Philadelphia media identified Riordan as the passenger nearly sucked out the window.
Videos posed on social media showed passengers grabbing for oxygen masks and screaming as the plane, piloted by 56-year-old Tammie Jo Shults, a former fighter pilot for the U.S. Navy, prepared for its descent into Philadelphia.
""All I could think of in that moment was, I need to communicate with my loved ones,"" passenger Marty Martinez told ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday. During the incident, he logged on to the plane's in-flight WiFi service to send messages to his family.
""I thought, these are my last few moments on Earth and I want people to know what happened,"" said Martinez, who live-streamed the plane's descent into Philadelphia on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Southwest Airlines experienced an unrelated safety incident early on Wednesday when a Phoenix-bound flight was forced to land at Nashville airport shortly after takeoff because of bird strike.
The airline said it would inspect the fan blades of CFM56 engines on all of its 737 jets within 30 days. Minimal flight disruptions may result, it said.
NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said on Tuesday at the Philadelphia airport that a preliminary investigation found an engine fan blade missing, having apparently broken off, and that there was metal fatigue at the point where it would normally be attached. 
Pieces of the engine including its cowling - the smooth metal exterior that covers its inner workings - were found about 60 miles (97 km) away from Philadelphia airport, Sumwalt said.
Sumwalt said the investigation could take 12 to 15 months to complete. NTSB officials said they would next brief the media on their investigation at 4:30 p.m. ET (2030 GMT).
In August 2016, a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. That incident prompted the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to propose last year that similar fan blades undergo ultrasonic inspections and be replaced if they failed.
Riordan's death was the first in a U.S. commercial aviation accident since 2009, according to NTSB statistics.

Riordan was a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to a Wells Fargo official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

1. Beige Book, Fed Speakers on Tap
The Federal Reserve’s beige book at 2.00 p.m. ET, a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from 12 regions, will be closely watched for any subtle change in commentary on inflation following hawkish language seen in the Fed’s March meeting minutes.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting showed that policymakers agreed that gradual rate hikes would be needed as inflation is expected to reach the Fed’s 2% target.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave its benchmark rate unchanged at its May meeting but increase rates at its subsequent meeting in June.
Speeches by FOMC Member Bill Dudley at 8.30 a.m. ET and 3.15 p.m. ET and  FOMC Member Randal Quarles at 4.15 p.m. could offer additional clues on monetary policy.
The dollar pared some of its gains against a basket of major currencies Tuesday despite easing geopolitical tensions and positive economic data, pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.
2. EIA Inventory Data in Focus
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show a draw in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1.4 million barrels in the week ended April 13.
U.S crude output will also be closely watched after International Energy Agency Director Faith Birol warned that if oil prices remained elevated, U.S. shale producers could ramp up output faster than anticipated.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday at $66.52 a barrel, up 30 cents, buoyed by the prospect of a draw in US crude supplies.
3. IBM to Weigh on Dow Jones? 
Shares of  IBM  fell more than 5% in aftermarket hours as the technology giant posted earnings and revenue that topped expectations but guidance for the full year 2018 fell short of consensus.
IBM posted earnings per share of $2.45 on revenue of $19.1 billion Tuesday after the close. That was above consensus estimates for earnings per share of $2.42 on revenue of $18.79 billion.
For the full year 2018, ‘Big Blue’ maintained its guidance for non-GAAP earnings of $13.80 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of $13.84 per share.
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) closed 1.91% at $160.91 on Tuesday but fell 5.51% to $152.04 in afterhours trade. The 5.51% drop in aftermarket hours represents a roughly 57 point drop in the Dow as the tech giant has a 4.42% weighting on the Wall Street index.

The third-largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic reported first-quarter net income of $147 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $99 million, or 32 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. 
Excluding some one-time items, it reported earnings of 50 cents per share. That beat Wall Street's average estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Operating revenue rose to $9 billion from $8.4 billion a year ago, meeting analysts' estimates. 
The Chicago-based carrier adjusted its plans for capacity growth for the year, aiming for a rate of between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent. Its previous expected range was between 4 percent and 6 percent. 
Last quarter United sent airline industry shares lower by sparking concerns about fare wars with its aggressive capacity expansion plans. 

For the second quarter, United said it would increase the number of seats it flies by between 4 percent and 5 percent.

Whitman, the founder of New York-based investment firm Third Avenue Management and known for his ""safe and cheap"" value-investing strategy, died Monday evening at 93, the firm announced on Tuesday. 
Whitman, who was named Morningstar’s mutual fund manager of the year in 1990, became known for The Whitman Way - a reverence for deep-value investing in unappreciated names with strong balance sheets and good long-term potential. 
His Third Avenue Value Fund, which Whitman ran from its 1990 inception through 2012, had an average annual total return of 11.1 percent, compared with 9 percent for the S&P 500 Index, according to Lipper data. 
""Everyone in the Third Avenue family was blessed to have had the opportunity to know Marty and learn from him. He was an extraordinary investor, an impactful teacher, and a true capital markets pioneer,"" the firm's management committee said in a statement.
The Third Avenue Value Fund, and the firm, struggled during and after Whitman's final years in management. The firm’s assets, which reached $26 billion in 2006, sunk to $8 billion at the end of November 2015, right before the firm shut down its Focused Credit Fund - which became the biggest mutual fund blowup since the 2008 financial crisis. 
And investment advisory fees at the firm’s flagship Value Fund were just $22 million in the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, 2014, down 77 percent from $97.2 million in fiscal 2007, fund disclosures show.
While Whitman loved investing, his passion was teaching. 
He frequently taught at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, which was named in his honor. He was a distinguished Management Fellow at the Yale School of Management, conducting seminars for over 30 years. He also served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University Business School. 
In addition to being widely recognized for his frank and insightful quarterly letters to Third Avenue Value Fund shareholders, he authored several books on investing and security analysis.
Most recently, Whitman published a best of anthology of his prolific shareholder letters, ""Dear Fellow Shareholders"" in 2016.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2018 12:48AM ET</span>",Investor urges Facebook to set up risk oversight committee,"(Reuters) - An activist hedge fund that wants Facebook to set up a risk oversight committee asked fellow shareholders on Tuesday to back the proposal, highlighting investor concerns over the company's handling of controversies such as the recent data privacy row.
Trillium Asset Management, which owns about 73,000 shares of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), said existing risk oversight structures at Facebook appeared to lack a ""dedicated focus.""
Facebook has faced public outcry and intense political scrutiny since it was disclosed that the personal information of several millions of users was harvested by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook has also been criticized for its role in Russia's alleged influence over the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
""The sheer volume, magnitude, and frequency of Facebook's controversies strongly suggests that the company's whack-a-mole approach is insufficient - Facebook needs to institutionalize stronger risk oversight mechanisms,"" Trillium said in a letter https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884541/000121465918002848/d417181px14a6g.htm to fellow Facebook shareholders.
Trillium's proposal first came in a regulatory filing on Friday.
Facebook, at the time, appeared to oppose the proposal, saying it would be inefficient to form a separate oversight committee, given that many of its board members were already overseeing risk-related matters.
""We believe that our board and committees have sufficient time and resources to address risk oversight matters along with their other responsibilities,"" Facebook had said.
A Facebook spokeswoman maintained that response on Tuesday.
The social networking giant's lack of attention to risk management has eroded shareholder value, Trillium said, pointing to Facebook's warning last week that new investments in security will ""significantly"" impact future profits.

Facebook has lost nearly $47 billion in market value since the Cambridge Analytica revelations first surfaced last month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday reported a year-on-year jump in debt underwriting revenue after working on financing for big M&A deals that some peers missed out on. 
Analysts have feared slower corporate issuance could weigh on Wall Street debt underwriting and also crimp credit trading as companies adjust for higher interest rates and the U.S. tax code overhaul.
Debt underwriting revenues slumped from a year earlier at other U.S. banks that reported first-quarter results. 
GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2qBWYWK
At  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which reports on Wednesday, fixed-income underwriting revenue could fall 11 percent from the year-ago quarter, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a report earlier this month. 
Goldman's debt capital markets (DCM) business fell from a record fourth quarter but notched its second-best result with $797 million in revenue. 
""It's really M&A as the driver for demand, for the issuance, and you've seen the results flow through into revenues,"" said Goldman finance chief R. Martin Chavez on a call with analysts. 
He highlighted Goldman's role in CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) Corp's $40 billion bond issuance to help fund its acquisition of health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET). 
The bank also said credit trading, which can be supported by issuance, was a factor behind its 23 percent rebound in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue. 
A rebound in commodities and currencies trading during an uptick in broad market volatility also helped the improvement from a weak year-ago period. 
Structured trading in particular boosted the credit business year on year, Goldman said. Peers had called out credit as an area of weakness in first-quarter FICC trading. 
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told reporters on Monday that FICC income for credit products in particular fell from a year earlier because the bank did not see as much DCM activity.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Friday said lower client activity in credit and rates weighed on fixed-income trading. 
On a call with analysts, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank missed out on some ""larger fee events,"" and its pipeline for equities underwriting was likely stronger than for DCM given rising interest rates.
New issues for corporate investment-grade debt fell in the first quarter for the first time in four years to $343.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IFR data. That was the lowest outright value since 2014. 

Shares in Goldman were trading lower Tuesday afternoon, with some analysts citing concerns about the volatile nature of its core businesses.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bankrupt retailer Toys ""R"" Us has rejected an $890 million bid for some of its U.S. stores and locations in Canada from the CEO of Bratz doll maker MGA Entertainment Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Last week, MGA Chief Executive Officer Isaac Larian, who said the wind-down of Toys ""R"" Us would hurt the toy industry long-term, offered $675 million for the U.S. stores, and $215 million for Canadian stores.
“I haven’t yet been notified of the bid rejection but if this is true, it is very disappointing,"" Larian said in a statement. ""It is our hope and expectation that we can continue to participate in the bid process, so we can keep fighting to save Toys 'R Us. We feel confident that we submitted a fair valuation of the company's US assets in an effort to save the business and over 130,000 domestic jobs.” 
The offer does not exceed the value of Toys ""R"" Us in a liquidation of its assets, said the person, who could not be identified because the decision to turn away the offer is not yet public. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported that Toys ""R"" Us had turned down Larian's offer.
Once the largest U.S. toy retailer, Toys ""R"" Us abandoned a plan to emerge from bankruptcy last month and said it would try to maintain more profitable locations in Europe and Asia as an on-going business while liquidating its U.S. and UK operations.
An attorney for Toys ""R"" Us said in court earlier this month that the company had received multiple bids of more than $1 billion for an 85 percent stake in its Asian business.

“Our savviest clients are considering the recent two-months volatility as opportunities to add to, or initiate, positions that are perceived to perform the best over the next three to five-plus years,” Eric Aanes, president and the founder of Titus Wealth, which has $500 million in assets under administration, wrote in an email interview. Emerging markets and the U.S. tech industry “are the areas that will see the greatest degree of organic growth,” he said.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has dropped around 9 percent from a record high reached in late January amid concern an escalation in trade friction between the U.S. and China will damp global growth. The historical volatility on the measure is near the highest level since November 2016.
Among developing nations, India stands out based on the country’s growth outlook and demographic potential, Scot Lance, Titus Wealth’s managing director, wrote in the same interview. The firm recommends investors take a “neutral stance” on Chinese stocks due to decelerating growth and an aging population, in addition to the trade war risks, he said.

GENEVA/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil has secured World Trade Organization backing to press its claims against Canada in a dispute over what it says are unfair subsidies for Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) CSeries jets, a preliminary WTO ruling published on Tuesday showed.
The case plays into a decades-long dispute between Bombardier and its main rival, Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), which gained higher profile after European heavyweight Airbus SE (PA:AIR) agreed to take over the Canadian firm. 
""What happened today was very important for Brazil, it was a small victory,"" Celso Pereira, a Brazilian diplomat at the WTO, told Reuters in a phone interview. ""Now the game will really begin. We've overcome an important barrier.""
Brazil launched the WTO dispute last year, saying the CSeries had received $3 billion in federal, provincial and local subsidies.
Canada objected, saying Brazil had unfairly broadened the case by including four claims that went beyond its original complaint. Brazil said their inclusion did not change the essence of the dispute.
In their preliminary ruling on the case, the three-person WTO dispute panel threw out Canada's argument.
""The panel agrees with Brazil that the four measures at issue fit within the scope and essence of the dispute as described by Brazil, so that the scope of the dispute is not expanded by Brazil's panel request,"" the preliminary ruling said.
Canada had also argued that Brazil had failed to identify specific payments from Canadian research and technology councils.
But the panel rejected that argument too.
""We conclude that Canada's and Quebec's provision of funding, technology transfer, in-kind goods and services, and other support ... is identified with sufficient particularity in Brazil's panel request and therefore falls within the panel's terms of reference,"" the panel said.
The panel will now assess arguments from both Brazil and Canada over the alleged subsidies. Pereira said he expects a final decision sometime next year.

The United States imposed heavy duties on the CSeries jet last year in a damaging trade dispute with Boeing (N:BA), prompting a sale of 50.01 percent of the CSeries to Airbus.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) will close 8,000 company-owned U.S. cafes for the afternoon on May 29 so 175,000 employees can undergo racial tolerance training in response to protests and calls for boycotts after the arrest of two black men waiting in a Philadelphia store.
The company said in the Tuesday announcement that it will also provide training materials for non-company workers at the roughly 6,000 licensed Starbucks cafes that will remain open in locations such as grocery stores and airports. 
The announcement from world's biggest coffee company comes as it tries to cool tensions after the Philadelphia incident last week sparked accusations of racial profiling at the chain, which is the subject of a boycott campaign on social media.
The controversy is the biggest public relations test yet for new Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, who already was fighting to boost traffic to Starbucks amid competition from coffee sellers ranging from hipster cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores.
""While this is not limited to Starbucks, we're committed to being a part of the solution,"" said Johnson, a former technology executive who took the helm about a year ago.
Even if the threatened boycott does not materialize, the 8,000 temporary store closures will almost certainly have an impact on sales. Starbucks did not say how many hours the stores would be shuttered on May 29, but the afternoon is the slowest time for Starbucks' business.
Starbucks is one of the most high-profile and beloved brands in the world and its long-time CEO Howard Schultz was not one to shy away from difficult conversations over thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock.
However U.S. race relations have proven more challenging, even for a company that touts its diverse workforce -- minorities account for 18 percent of Starbucks executives with the title of senior vice president or higher and 43 percent of employees overall.
For example, the company's 2015 ""Race Together"" campaign to foster a conversation on the topic following the high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men stirred an intense social media backlash.
Johnson has apologized for the ""reprehensible"" arrests of the two men in Philadelphia on Thursday and took personal responsibility for the incident, which was captured in a customer video that was shared widely. 
Starbucks attorneys said Johnson and the men, who were released without charges, have ""engaged in constructive discussions about this issue as well as what is happening in communities across the country."" 
Philadelphia Police late on Tuesday released the series of calls that led to their arrests.
It begins with a Starbucks employee reporting ""two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave."" The manager who is believed to have made that call, no longer works for Starbucks.
In a subsequent call, an unidentified man said a ""group of males"" was ""causing a disturbance"" that required backup and a supervisor. 
Philadelphia's police commissioner over the weekend defended the arrests, saying his officers had to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing. 
""It's good that Starbucks is giving all staff race trainings on May 29. But let's not lose sight of the real problem which is police accountability,"" Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the youth and college division at NAACP, told Reuters.

Shares in Starbucks closed up 0.7 percent at $59.83 on Tuesday and are relatively unchanged in the week since the arrests.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a telephone call with the emir of Kuwait in January, U.S. President Donald Trump pressed the Gulf monarch to move forward on a $10 billion fighter jet deal that had been stalled for more than a year.
Trump was acting on behalf of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, America's second-largest defense contractor, which had become frustrated that a long-delayed sale critical to its military aircraft division was going nowhere, several people familiar with the matter said.
With this Oval Office intervention, the details of which have not been previously reported, Trump did something unusual for a U.S. president – he personally helped to close a major arms deal. In private phone calls and public appearances with world leaders, Trump has gone further than any of his predecessors to act as a salesman for the U.S. defense industry, analysts said.
Trump's personal role underscores his determination to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, U.S. officials say, despite concerns from human rights and arms control advocates.
Those efforts will be bolstered by the full weight of the U.S. government when Trump's administration rolls out a new ""Buy American"" initiative this week aimed at allowing more countries to buy more and even bigger weapons. It will loosen U.S. export rules on equipment ranging from fighter jets and drones to warships and artillery, the officials said.
Reuters has learned that the initiative - which industry sources said will be announced on Thursday - will provide guidelines that could allow more countries to be granted faster deal approvals, possibly trimming back to months what has often taken years to finalize.
The strategy will call for members of Trump's cabinet to sometimes act as ""closers"" to help seal major arms deals, according to people familiar with the matter. More top government officials will also be sent to promote U.S. weapons at international air shows and arms bazaars.
Shares of major U.S. defense contractors added to gains after the news and Raytheon hit an all-time high. 
Human rights and arms control advocates warn that the proliferation of a broader range of advanced weaponry to more foreign governments could increase the risk of arms being diverted into the wrong hands and fueling violence in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia.
The Trump administration stresses that the main aims are to help American defense firms compete better against increasingly aggressive Russian and Chinese manufacturers and give greater weight than before to economic benefits of arms sales to create more jobs at home.
One Trump aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new initiative is also intended to ease human rights restrictions that have sometimes led to an effective ""veto"" over certain arms deals.
""This policy seeks to mobilize the full resources of the United States government behind arms transfers that are in the U.S. national and economic security interest,"" a White House official said, responding to a request for comment on the story.
""We recognize that arms transfers may have important human rights consequences,"" the official said. ""Nothing in this policy changes existing legal or regulatory requirements in this regard.""
One of the main architects of the new policy has been economist Peter Navarro, a China trade skeptic ascendant in Trump's inner circle. His effort to boost arms exports has drawn little resistance within the White House, officials said.
'WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT'
The initiative has been in the works for months and some of its expected components have already been reported. But with the rollout nearing, more than a dozen industry sources and current and former U.S. officials have provided Reuters with the most complete picture yet of Trump's policy, though they caution that last-minute changes are still possible.
The policy will call for a ""whole of government"" approach – from the president and his cabinet on down to military attaches and diplomats – to help drum up billions of dollars more in arms business overseas, U.S. officials said.
It will also call for cutting red tape to secure faster deal approval on a broader range of weaponry for NATO members, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners as well as treaty allies such as Japan and South Korea, among others, they said. Many details will remain classified.
Companies that stand to benefit most include Boeing and the other top U.S. defense contractors,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) , Raytheon Co, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC). All of their shares have surged by double-digit percentages, led by the doubling of Boeing's stock price, since Trump took office in January 2017.
Trump's aides also want more senior officials to attend major international arms shows, including cabinet members such as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, to promote U.S.-made weapons the way countries such as France and Israel pitch their companies"" wares.
""If you go to the Paris air show, you see the French foreign minister standing in front of the Airbus pavilion,"" one U.S. official said. ""We're getting outplayed so we have to change our culture.""
In addition to the broad arms export initiative, Trump is expected to sign a separate document easing exports of military drones, an item high on foreign governments' shopping lists, officials said. 
U.S. foreign military sales totaled $42 billion last year, according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Experts say exports from Russia, the largest U.S. competitor, are typically half those of the United States. 
The Aerospace Industries Association trade group said it had first lobbied Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign on the need for ""bolstering U.S. manufacturing"" and encouraging allies to take more responsibility for their own security.
SALESMAN-IN-CHIEF
While many presidents have helped promote the U.S. defense industry, none is known to have done so as unabashedly as Trump, a former real estate developer who seems sometimes at his most comfortable when he is promoting U.S. goods.
Trump regularly discusses specific arms sales with foreign leaders in meetings and on the phone, according to White House statements. And on a trip to Japan last November, he publicly urged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to buy more American weapons.
More recently, at an Oval Office meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last month, Trump held up posters with pictures of U.S. jets, ships and helicopters and other armaments sold to Saudi Arabia. ""We make the best military product in the world,"" he boasted to reporters as the prince sat smiling beside him.
Other presidents, including Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush stressed the need to strengthen the defense industrial base, but they did it more subtly, said William Hartung, director of the arms and security project at the Center for International Policy, a non-partisan think tank.
""Nobody’s been as blatant about it as Trump,"" he added. ""Nobody has yelled it from the rooftops.""
Former President Barack Obama would sometimes talk to allied leaders about weapons systems that he felt suited their security needs, but aides said he preferred to keep weapons salesmanship at arm's length. 
The Trump administration's plan to overhaul the Conventional Arms Transfer policy, the framework for evaluating foreign sales, goes well beyond Obama's relaxation of rules in 2014 that enabled U.S. arms contractors to sell more overseas than ever before. Obama drew a clear line, however, requiring each sale to meet strict human rights standards – though he was criticized at times for allowing some controversial sales.
Trump has already gone ahead with several deals that Obama blocked, including the sale of $7 billion in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia despite human rights groups' concerns they have contributed to civilian deaths in the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen's civil war. 
ANATOMY OF A TRUMP-ERA DEAL
How Boeing's Kuwait deal got on Trump's agenda for the Jan. 17 call with Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah illustrates how seriously the administration is taking the arms export push.
The State Department granted approval in November 2016, in the final months of the Obama administration, for Kuwait to buy 40 F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighters.
But Kuwait, a U.S. Gulf ally, appeared to drag out negotiations, U.S. officials and industry sources said, and the purchase was still not finalized by the time the emir visited Trump at the White House last September.
Trump told reporters at the time that, at the Kuwaiti leader's request, he had intervened and won State Department authorization for the deal – a false claim since that approval had already been granted nearly a year earlier.
Months later, Boeing's request for a presidential nudge to Kuwait was channeled to National Security Council aides, who included it among Trump's ""talking points"" for the January phone call, two people close to the matter said.
This time, Trump did make a difference. Just days later, Kuwaiti state media reported the deal was done.

The Kuwaiti government did not respond to requests for comment. A Boeing spokesman declined comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - ""Who's next?"" investors in Russia are asking as they scramble to clear their portfolios of ""oligarch risk"" - holdings in companies that may be next in line for U.S. sanctions after metals company Rusal was targeted last week.
The threat of more sanctions had already made investors wary of Russian companies, seen as more vulnerable to U.S. action than the sovereign. Their fears proved justified when on April 6, the U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on a range of Russian companies and ""oligarchs"" -- businessmen deemed to be close to the Kremlin.
Aluminum company Rusal, controlled by Oleg Deripaska, has been one of the main targets. Rusal itself has warned that the impact of sanctions could trigger technical default on some of its debts.
Earlier sanctions on major Russian companies were so-called sectoral sanctions which limit U.S. investor participation in debt-raising for sanctioned firms. The sanctions imposed on Rusal this month go further, barring U.S. investors from having any dealings with the sanctioned entities. 
Russia's sovereign debt and assets of other Russian companies are not yet sanctioned but that might change. Washington is looking at new sanctions aimed at Russian companies allegedly dealing with equipment related to chemical weapons in Syria. 
""The question investors have is: who is next? Could you extend Rusal-style sanctions to other companies? Potentially they could,"" said Greg Saichin, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. 
""We know of a number of individuals who are either owners of companies or have stakes in companies, who may be next in line ... There is oligarch risk so we have moved to reduce the Kremlin element in the portfolio,"" he added. 
A list of 210 wealthy Russians named by the U.S. Treasury in January is widely seen as the place to look for clues. It contained 96 oligarchs, including Vladimir Potanin, co-owner of Norilsk Nickel, metals magnates Alisher Usmanov and Alexei Mordashov and CEOs of two big state-run banks.
John Bates, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, said he had reduced exposure to companies with high ""oligarch risk"", noting that if sanctions were expanded ""we could be in another quite severe leg down in terms of valuations.""
The latest U.S. sanctions have caused pain across Russian markets, which were riding high with investors prior to last week's sell off. Investors' Russian bond holdings as of end-March would have been around $46 billion, assuming their allocation to Russia was the same as its share in various global bond indexes, data from State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) shows.
CALCULATED RISKS
Last week, as the rouble dropped 6 percent, equities fell 4.6 percent and Russian corporate dollar bond yields surged by an average 100 basis points, those portfolios would have suffered heavy losses.
Ratings agency Fitch said the sell-off reflected fears the sanctions list would be extended, possibly to companies that transact with the already designated entities and individuals. 
As a result, investors are not ready yet to pick over the wreckage for bargains.
Even before the meltdown, asset managers had been screening Russian companies to avoid exposure to those already subject to sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.
Ironically though, those sanctions made companies' debt more attractive to some investors. A volatile rouble, government pressure to cut external debt and higher barriers to raising debt on international markets steadily reduced their outstanding debt levels.
Russian companies, excluding banks, have about $270 billion in hard currency debt according to TD Securities, and just $13 billion falls due in 2018. Servicing that will not be a problem -- unless they are hit with sanctions too.
Fund managers would have to take a ""calculated risk"" on which Russian names to sell, Saichin of Allianz said.
""If no sanction has been imposed you basically have to sit on it,"" he said, noting there were few buyers for the bonds anyway.
Money managers in general see low sanctions risk for Russian sovereign debt and securities of state-run flagship companies such as Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which supplies a major part of Europe's energy, or Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank.
Others such as Lukoil or Phosagro, which have kept themselves at arms' length from the Kremlin, are also considered a safer bet.
Markets reflect that view -- the bonds of steelmaker Severstal, around 80 percent owned by Alexei Mordashov, were the biggest fallers last week from a list of mining and energy firms, after Rusal and Polyus Gold, Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging markets fixed income beta at SSGA, noted.
Polyus is controlled by the family of Suleiman Kerimov who is on the sanctioned individuals list.
Bonds in Evraz, Norilsk Nickel, Metalloinvest and steel pipe maker TMK also fell an average 3-5 cents last week, while Lukoil and state firm Rosneftegaz fell the least.
""Clearly, the sentiments are against any companies dealing in commodities,"" Kumar said. 
Steelmaker NLMK is controlled by Vladimir Lisin while TMK is majority-owned by Dmitry Pumpyansky. Neither man is on the list of sanctioned individuals.
As for Russia's sovereign debt, most investors are sitting tight, believing Washington will not bar investors from it, even if the U.S. Congress is trying to build support for such a step. 
Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers said the ""mindset"" was not to ditch Russian government debt even if the latest sanctions had raised fears the sovereign might be hit. 
""We think that would be highly unlikely. It would be like an act of war,"" he said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The top U.S., Canadian and Mexican officials driving NAFTA renegotiations will meet in Washington on Thursday, a Canadian government source said on Tuesday, as pressure for a quick deal mounted.
Although the United States is eager to quickly wrap up negotiations to update the $1.2 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement, officials say several contentious issues must still be resolved.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer wants some kind of agreement in place before campaigning for a July 1 presidential election in Mexico gathers pace.
Lighthizer, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo last met on April 6.
Guajardo said on Monday the three officials might meet again this Thursday in Washington, and the Canadian government source confirmed the meeting would go ahead.
""It's a continuation of the conversation they started on two weeks ago,"" said the source, describing recent exchanges between the three nations as very productive.
Guajardo and others have said a NAFTA deal could be possible by early May, but significant differences remain on U.S. proposals to revise content rules for the automotive sector and to change dispute resolution mechanisms as well as other issues.
""I wouldn't be expecting an announcement out of this meeting (on Thursday),"" added the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who blames NAFTA for job losses in the American manufacturing sector, regularly threatens to walk away from the pact unless major changes are made.
Trump and other U.S. politicians are also unhappy with the way Canada uses tariffs and export limits to protect the domestic dairy market. Four Republican Senators sent Freeland a letter on Tuesday urging her to reform the system.
""American dairy products face tariffs upward of 300 percent at the Canadian border, and U.S. farmers cannot fairly compete,"" said Pat Toomey, Cory Gardner, Ron Johnson, and Michael Lee.
The Canadian tariffs are not formally part of NAFTA and Freeland has made clear Ottawa will defend the system.
Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of a business lobby which represents the Mexican private sector, said the three teams were working ""night and day"" to get a deal on the new auto sector rules.

To agree a new NAFTA, the U.S. team would need to show more flexibility, Kalach said in an interview. So far, Trump had not changed his attitude on the toughest issues, he added.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) surged nearly 11 percent on Tuesday and were on track for their best session in two months after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded its recommendation on the social network to ""equal-weight"" from ""underweight"".
Investors are likely to continue to pay a premium for Twitter's stock due to expectations of faster revenue growth in 2018 and signs of progress in a company turnaround, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report. 
Nowak raised his target price for Twitter by a dollar to $29. Twitter traded at $31.69 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.
""Constructive advertiser conversations, improving user growth, and positive revisions make a more compelling risk/reward,"" Nowak wrote.
A surprise return to revenue growth sent Twitter's stock 12 percent higher after its last quarterly report on Feb. 8 and it is up 32 percent year to date.
The social network is popular with celebrities, professional athletes and politicians and is ubiquitous in the media, but it has struggled to turn a profit and consistently grow its revenue. 
Overall, analysts are cautious. Nine recommend selling Twitter, 21 have neutral ratings and seven recommend buying, according to Thomson Reuters data. On average, they expect Twitter's stock to decline to $27.58.
The stock is trading at 45 times expected earnings, compared with Facebook's (O:FB) valuation of 21 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Twitter is expected on average by analysts to post a 10 percent increase in revenue to $605 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of 12 cents when it reports its March-quarter results on April 25. Under GAAP, analysts on average expect a net loss of $23 million.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Goldman may acquire its way to a bigger consumer bank,"By Lauren Tara LaCapra
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) is likely to expand its consumer bank through small acquisitions, its finance chief said on Tuesday, without ruling out the idea that it might buy a traditional lender, too.
During a conference call to discuss quarterly results,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo listed the ways Goldman is trying to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue and asked Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez whether it would simply buy a brick-and-mortar bank.
After explaining that Goldman has a history of building businesses internally, and a preference for ""bolt-on"" acquisitions, if any, Chavez suggested that management routinely considers more transformative deals.
""We are evaluating all these acquisitions, including things that you describe,"" he said. ""We are open-minded and it's all part of the consideration.""
Goldman got into consumer lending much later than big U.S. banking peers, and analysts have asserted on and off through the years that acquiring a big consumer lender would help even out volatile results from businesses like trading and investment banking.
Unlike most rivals, Goldman did not make any significant acquisitions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Such a deal could be more difficult to accomplish now, as the industry has consolidated, values have risen and more regulatory hurdles have been put in place.
Since launching its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, Goldman has been growing the business by paying up for deposits, offering new products like home improvement loans and recently acquiring Clarity Money, a personal finance smartphone app.
Marcus is now lending out $3 billion of its more than $20 billion in deposits, Chavez said, making it a much smaller bank with a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio than lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), or even its closest peer,  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).

Goldman looked at ""well over 100"" businesses to potentially acquire before launching Marcus, Chavez said, but none were the right fit. The company is still examining whether and how to expand offerings in credit cards, wealth management, retirement products and personal finance, he said.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",China's Huawei Tech retrenches in U.S. after years of criticism,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], viewed with suspicion in congress as a potential threat to U.S. national security, has laid off five employees at its Washington office and slashed lobbying expenditures, according to sources familiar with the matter and government filings.
Huawei, the world's third largest smartphone maker, let go its vice president of external affairs Bill Plummer and four other people in the Washington office, sources said. The New York Times was first to report the shake-up.
The company also slashed lobbying expenditures to $60,000 in 2017 from $348,500 in 2016, according to Huawei filings.
""Like every company, we continually evaluate our organization and align our resources to support our business strategy and objectives,"" a Huawei spokesman said. ""Any changes to staffing size or structure are simply a reflection of standard business optimization.""
The retrenchment comes amid a steady drip of bad news for the Chinese telecommunications company prompted by concerns by U.S. national security experts and China hawks who are loath to see equipment made by a Chinese firm installed in the U.S. telecommunications network.
In February, two Republican U.S. senators introduced legislation that would block the government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from Huawei or China's ZTE Corp , citing concerns that the companies might use their access to spy on U.S. officials.
Such concerns have extended to handsets. In January, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) was forced to scrap a plan to offer its customers Huawei handsets after some members of Congress lobbied against the idea with federal regulators.
The United States this week banned American firms from selling parts and software to ZTE for seven years. Washington accused ZTE of violating an agreement on punishing employees after the company illegally shipped U.S. goods to Iran.

Despite being hampered in getting a foothold in the U.S. market, Shenzhen-based Huawei saw net profit rise to 47.5 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) in 2017, sharply up from a 0.4 percent increase in 2016. The rise was partly the result of a 85 percent drop in net financing expenses and partly due to higher revenue.

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rusal may be forced to divest most of its portfolio of overseas operations if the aluminum giant cannot restructure them to evade U.S. sanctions and ensure a flow of raw materials.
U.S. sanctions imposed against key allies of Russian President Putin have already started to cripple United Company Rusal's extensive string of international operations from Sweden to Guinea to Australia.
Rusal, the world's second biggest aluminum producer behind China Hongqiao Group Ltd, is heavily dependent on its international network of mines and refineries. These last year accounted for 53 percent of its output of raw material ore bauxite and 64 percent of production of semi-processed sister alumina.
""How does Rusal continue to fund its operations and produce metal if its raw material supply chain is broken?,"" said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
One key will be finding shipping and logistics firms willing to take the risk to transport those supplies, industry sources said.
Shipping giants Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) both said they were halting any new trade with Russian entities targeted by U.S. sanctions.
""Like everywhere, it's greed and fear. At some point greed wins,"" said a industry source who declined to be named because he was not allowed to speak to the media.
""The bigger the company the more reluctant it will be, but smaller companies that can go under the radar may think the risks are worth it if they can get a really good price.""

FORCE MAJEURE 
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), which supplies bauxite to some of Rusal's refineries and buys refined alumina, said it will declare force majeure on some contracts, showing the immediate impact on Rusal's supply chain.
Rio also said on Friday it was reviewing Rusal's 20 percent stake in the Queensland Alumina refinery.
Illustrating knock-on effects, French aluminum smelters in Dunkirk and St. Jean de Maurienne are scrambling to find alternative alumina supplies after being cut off from material from Rusal's Irish refinery, said Johan Vlietinck, CGT union official at the Dunkirk smelter. 
Rio is selling the Dunkirk smelter to Britain's Liberty House while the other smelter is owned by Germany's Trimet.
Another crucial issue is funding since the U.S. sanctions prohibit Rusal from doing transactions in dollars. 
The Russian government has pledged to provide Rusal with short-term liquidity and offer other assistance, but that help will mainly assist the domestic assets and may do scant good overseas.
""When it comes to Rusal's Russian operations, they should continue to operate without restriction... but the same is not true for the remainder of the portfolio, each one of which has its own set of unique problems,"" said senior analyst Anthony Everiss at consultancy CRU.
Many governments are working behind the scenes to keep Rusal operations running in their countries to safeguard jobs, but the easiest way to ensure this may be to transfer ownership, said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""Rusal's international facilities are...under potential restructuring. The alumina and bauxite facilities...could therefore change hands,"" the bank said in a research report. 
Restructuring asset ownership into non-sanctioned entities has precedents in Russia going back to Gunvor in 2014, it added.

GUINEA SUPPORTIVE 
The authorities are supportive in Guinea, which accounts for more than a quarter of Rusal's bauxite output, and the mines are continuing to operate, according to industry sources in the country.
The main issue will be logistics and finding middlemen who do not have any links with the United States, an industry source said.
The Dian-Dian project, the world's largest bauxite deposit, was still on track to launch production by the end of April, a senior official with the project told Reuters. 
With expected output of 3 million tonnes a year, it would nearly double Rusal's bauxite output in the country.
In Ireland, Rusal's biggest alumina refinery, Aughinish, is under threat because Rio Tinto, which provided bauxite for the plant, has declared force majeure.
The plant has enough bauxite to last to the end of June, local media reports said. The plant did not reply to emails seeking comment. 

The Swedish Kubal aluminum smelter, the only metal producing operation outside of Russia, was still producing but had halted deliveries, a local newspaper said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) will cut 305 jobs and close 49 branches in Britain, the latest in a series of reductions to its workforce and network as it promotes its digital services.
Lloyds said in February it would invest 3 billion pounds over three years in such digital initiatives, but had not said how many branches or jobs it would axe as part of the cost-cutting strategy.
Lloyds said the plan reflected changes in customer behavior, with more people using digital services than branches, which are costly to maintain . 
""Today's announcement involves making difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,"" the bank said in a statement on Tuesday regarding the job losses and closures.
The bank said it remained committed to having the largest branch network among banks in Britain, where it operates around one in every five outlets. 
The latest job losses at Britain's biggest bank follow an announcement in February that Lloyds cut 465 roles in January.
Banks in Britain have between them slashed thousands of branches in recent years to cut costs, drawing criticism from lawmakers who say closures can leave rural communities without a single bank branch.
Politicians in June 2016 called the closures a ""quiet scandal"", citing a Reuters report showing the closures disproportionately affected poorer areas in Britain.
Banks are nonetheless pressing ahead with further cuts, focusing efforts on getting customers to use mobile apps to do the bulk of their transactions and save branch visits for the most complex of their needs.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Activist investor Jana hired staff for new socially responsible fund,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC, the activist investment firm now taking steps into socially responsible investing, has hired a portfolio manager and analyst to help oversee its effort of pushing companies to become better corporate citizens.
Dan Hanson, who for a time managed socially responsible funds at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, and Pulkit Agarwal, who worked at the International Finance Corporation in India before moving to the United States, were hired recently by the New York-based hedge fund, people familiar with the moves said. They will be working on Jana's new portfolio for which the firm is currently raising money.
Hanson will be a co-portfolio manager and share the responsibilities of overseeing the new fund with Charles Penner, a long-time partner at Jana. Agarwal will support them in helping generate ideas for the new fund, which is expected to be called Jana Impact Capital.
Jana, which oversees roughly $4 billion, in January teamed up with the California State Teachers Retirement System, or Calstrs, which controls roughly $2 billion of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, to urge the iPhone maker to develop new tools to help parent limit children's time on mobile devices.
For Jana, it was its forceful foray into pushing for social issues after it has long been successful in prodding corporations to improve their governance. The new fund will look to target other companies on issues like climate change or wage inequality and will likely target as many as 10 companies, people familiar with Jana's plans said.
Jana's new fund is being raised at a time more investors are showing an interest in so-called ESG portfolios which make investment selections by including environmental, social and governance factors.
Pairing Penner, a trained lawyer who has worked on most of Jana's past activist campaigns, and Hanson, a recognized expert in the socially-responsible investing space and investor, will give Jana new tools to identify appropriate targets, industry analysts said.
Before joining Jana, Hanson had been co-chair of the Investment Strategy Committee at Jarislowsky Fraser Global Investment Management, and before that he spent a decade at BlackRock where he was the sole manager of the BlackRock Socially Responsible Equity portfolio. At BlackRock, he was on the proxy voting committee and he was a founding board member the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board.
Agarwal worked with Hanson at Jarislowsky Fraser before moving on to work at Soros Fund Management.
On the West Coast, hedge fund ValueAct, which oversees roughly $16 billion in assets and is also moving into the socially responsible field with a new fund, hired Eva Zlotnicka in February. Previously she had been a Sustainable and Responsible Investment Research analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).

953,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 09:45AM ET</span>",BANK OF AMERICA: Market bulls have been 'silenced' — but there are 2 big reasons why they refuse to give up on stocks,"As the stock market has shaken off recent turbulence and continued its long-running chug higher, some shifts have occurred under the surface that suggest investors aren't as confident as they seem.
For one, cash holdings jumped to 5% from 4.6%, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest monthly fund-manager survey, which includes 216 panelists who manage $646 billion. That risk-averse behavior has also been accompanied by equity hedging levels hitting 18-month highs.
Further, a record number of BAML's survey respondents said companies are excessively levered. 
That would all suggest the stock market is heading for some sort of bearish reckoning — the type that transpires when investor sentiment rolls over and traders flee to safety.
Not so fast, says BAML, which sees two main drivers keeping equity demand afloat.
The first is extremely straightforward: Fund managers simply don't see an imminent catalyst threatening stocks. Just 13% see recession as likely, while only 18% think the nine-year bull market has peaked. As BAML chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett puts it, a ""true bull capitulation is absent.""
Secondly, BAML argues fund managers don't have a favorable alternative. When it comes to investing in bonds over stocks, the firm says 10-year Treasury yields will have to hit 3.5% before such a strategy becomes truly enticing. As of Tuesday morning, it was at 2.83%.
Still, if the last few months have been any indication, stock market conditions can flip at a moment's notice. One potential catalyst is earnings season, which has historically dictated short-term equity fluctuations. While large Wall Street banks have largely exceeded analyst forecasts, BAML's survey shows global growth and profit expectations are at 18-month lows.
If the companies set to report in the coming weeks miss the mark, it's possible that uneasy market bulls will take even more drastic steps toward scaling back risk holdings. After all, if the survey is any indication, they're already headed in that direction."
954,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 09:44AM ET</span>",Netflix doesn't have to worry about the cloud threatening companies like Facebook and Google says CEO Reed Hastings," In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the Russian government's alleged attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, policymakers in the US and abroad are talking seriously about new regulations targeting big tech companies.
Netflix is often grouped with Facebook and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the lists of large technology firms, but company CEO Reed Hastings thinks his company has little to worry about when it comes to the heightened scrutiny of regulators. The streaming video giant doesn't have an advertising-based business and it's more of a media company than a tech firm, he noted on a video conference call Monday following the company's earnings report.
""I think we're substantially inoculated from the other issues that are happening in the industry,"" Hastings said. ""And that's great.""
Hastings is intimately familiar with Facebook's business model, because he serves on its board as a director.
""I'm very glad that we built this business to not be advertising supported, but to be subscription,"" he said. ""We're very different from an ad-supported business.""
Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on Capitol Hill about his company's data protection and privacy practices following news that data on up to 87 million Facebook users was leaked to a data analysis firm linked to President Trump's election campaign. During the hearings, members of Congress brought up the possibility of new laws to protect consumer privacy, and to ensure transparency in online political ads. They also touched on the potential for new antitrust actions against some of tech's giants.
But Netflix stands apart from Facebook because it doesn't sell advertisements, Hastings said. Unlike Facebook, which at one point allowed app developers to download data it had collected about its users, Netflix has placed a premium on protecting the information it has on its customers' viewing habits, he said.
Furthermore, Netflix differs from other tech companies, because it's much more focused on producing, acquiring, and licensing movies and television shows than it is on building technology, Hastings said. The company expects to spend more than $10 billion on such content this year, compared with about $1.3 billion on technology, he said.
""We're really pretty different from the pure tech companies,"" Hastings said.
Earlier on Monday, Netflix announced that it added 5.5 million subscribers in the first quarter,  exceeding Wall Street's expectations. The company's also announced earnings and revenue that were in-line with analyst forecasts."

956,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 09:33AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Warns Markets the Best Times May Be Near an End,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors need to prepare for downside as the end of the economic cycle is near and U.S. markets are priced for best-case scenarios,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says.
While fiscal stimulus is supportive of growth in the near term, the benefits are already likely “in the price” and increase potential downside for markets at the end of the cycle, Morgan Stanley strategists including Michael Zezas, Matthew Hornbach and Andrew Sheets wrote in a note Tuesday. They also said U.S. stock valuations peaked before the tax bill was enacted with a cyclical top for equities later this year, while peak margins and rate of change on organic earnings growth coming by late 2018 or early 2019.
“There’s less reason to behave like it’s ‘morning in America’ than ‘Happy Hour in America,”’ the report said. Markets are “closer to the end of the day than the beginning.”
The report said the fiscal expansion factor supports a range-bound path for stocks, as well as a flatter U.S. Treasury yield curve with a lower yield bias.
“We advocate a focus on sector and stock-specific alpha as these late-cycle dynamics portend narrowing markets and a cyclical top for equities later this year, in our view,” the strategists said. “In Treasuries, we see the curve continuing to flatten on Fed hikes, and yield downside as the year progresses and the economic outlook becomes more mixed.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Alarm bells are ringing over valuations of the world's leading technology stocks with worries over regulation causing many investors to cut exposure to the sector, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BAML)'s April fund manager survey found.
""Long FAANG + BAT (LON:BATS)"" remains the top pick for ""most crowded trade"" for the third month running, BAML strategists said, referring to U.S. tech companies Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google (O:GOOGL), and China's Baidu (O:BIDU),  Alibaba  (N:BABA) and Tencent (HK:0700).
Since December last year, the ""most-crowded"" trades featured in the survey have reversed in a short space of time following the poll's publication. These include long-Bitcoin (December) and short-volatility (January).
While survey participants still saw the tech stocks as popular, allocations to tech actually fell to their lowest since February 2013 on fears companies such as Facebook could face tighter regulation and higher barriers to trade.
Increasing anxiety about stock markets' resilience led investors to reduce their positions on stocks generally, with bank stocks and Japan particularly targeted.
Allocation to equities fell to an 18-month low, while some 40 percent of investors surveyed expected the stock market to peak in the second half of this year.
Only 18 percent said the market had already peaked, however, while 39 percent said the peak wouldn't come until next year. ""Bulls silenced, not routed,"" wrote BAML strategists.
COMMODITIES, UK STOCKS IN DEMAND
Investors meanwhile reduced their bearish bets on bonds.
On average they said U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields would have to reach 3.50 percent before they would rotate from equities back into bonds. The benchmark bonds were last yielding 2.8396 percent. (US10YT=RR)
In equities, fund managers ramped up their allocation to commodities to an eight-year high, and UK stocks to the highest since the Brexit vote in June 2016.
Shorting the U.S. dollar was seen as the second-most crowded trade, followed by buying corporate bonds. Hedge funds have been ramping up their short bets on the dollar to a total value of $27 billion.
After a ratcheting up of protectionist rhetoric between the U.S. and China, 38 percent of investors said they saw the threat of a trade war as the biggest risk, well ahead of concerns about central banks, market structure or inflation.
Average cash balances increased to 5 percent, ahead of the 10-year average of 4.5 percent. Strategists said a cash balance ahead of that average was a ""buy"" signal for equities.
Fund managers were pessimistic on the health of global corporates, however.
Expectations for global growth and profits were at 18-month lows, and only 8 percent of respondents thought earnings per share would rise in the next 12 months, down from 35 percent in February.
Doubts about indebtedness also increased: a record share of surveyed investors said companies are excessively levered.

In contrarian trades, government bonds, the U.S. dollar, and liquid defensives stocks such as pharmaceuticals or consumer staples were seen as the most unusual buys, while investors also saw shorting cyclical stocks and emerging market equities as going against the pack.

(Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) hit a life-time high on Tuesday after the online video streaming service reported a rise in subscriber additions for the fourth straight quarter. 
The stock was up 9.2 percent at $336.11, getting an extra boost after at least 12 brokerages raised their price targets. JP Morgan was the most bullish, pushing its target to $385.
""Netflix's content strength and the global, secular shift to internet entertainment are driving subscriber upside,"" JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note.
The company's market cap touched almost $146 billion at the stock's intra-day high. The shares have gained around 60 percent this year to become the top performer on the S&P 500 index (SPX).
Netflix added 1.96 million subscribers in the United States in the first quarter compared with 1.42 million a year earlier. It added 5.46 million subscribers in its international markets compared with 3.53 million last year. Both figures in the latest quarter came in above analysts' average estimate. 
""We believe the breadth of Netflix's content offering is paying dramatic dividends in terms of subscriber adds and retention,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote. 
Netflix plans to invest around $8 billion on content this year. 
Although Netflix is ahead of its peers, it faces stiff competition from Hulu, Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) prime video. They have all been investing heavily to strengthen content, leading to price increases.
In January, Amazon raised the monthly fee for the U.S. version of its fast-shipping and video-streaming service Amazon Prime by $2. Netflix raised the price of some its plans in the U.S. and Europe last October. 
The push for original content also comes at another price for Netflix as Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said it will stop providing new movies to the company starting in 2019, and plans to launch its own streaming service. 
Analysts said Netflix was also benefiting from its wide range of agreements with wireless carriers and internet service providers, who are bundling Netflix streaming into their service offerings.
In the United States, T-Mobile (O:TMUS), Verizon FiOS (N:VZ), Altice USA's (N:ATUS) Cablevision (NYSE:CVC), Cox Communications and Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) offers Netflix subscriptions. Netflix has similar deals with Proximus (BR:PROX) in Belgium and SFR Altice in France. 
""While these offerings so far are most prevalent in mature markets, leading to a lower Netflix average selling price and also lower churn, partnerships could also become more important in emerging markets,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said. 

Out of the 46 analysts that cover Netflix's stock, 26 rate it at ""buy"" or higher, 17 at ""hold"" and 3 at ""sell"" or lower.

The show of support by Perry came after Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse's bankruptcy filing had raised doubts about the proposed construction of six nuclear reactors in India's Andhra Pradesh state.
The agreement to build reactors, announced in 2016, was the result of a decade of diplomatic efforts as part of a U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement signed in 2008.
""Nobody in the world makes better reactors than Westinghouse,"" Perry told journalists after a meeting with India's oil and gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi.
""They had some challenges in the past from its business practices. We leave that where it is. The bottom line is, that's all behind them. They are lean and mean and ready to get to the work.""
Westinghouse, owned by Japan's Toshiba Corp (T:6502) which is to be bought by a unit of Canada's  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) (N:BAM), is one of the world's leading suppliers of nuclear fuel and provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world's 450 commercial reactors.
Perry and Pradhan released a joint statement to ""reaffirm their strong commitment to early and full implementation of our civil nuclear partnership, including the Westinghouse civil nuclear project"". They also said the two countries would deepen cooperation on oil and gas, power, renewable energy and coal.
""In keeping with the shared objectives to provide a stronger business orientation to our energy cooperation, both sides noted with appreciation the growing investment of Indian companies in the United States and the beginning of oil and gas exports from the United States to India,"" they said in the statement.
The United States under President Donald Trump has been looking to sell more energy products to India, the world's third-biggest buyer of oil.

Pradhan said India wants to buy more U.S. crude oil ""subject to reasonable pricing"". New Delhi has also sought U.S. companies' participation in India's strategic petroleum reserves.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Tesla production pause adds to Model 3 concerns,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shares fell as much as 2 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday, a temporary halt in production of its Model 3 sedan adding to nerves about the electric car maker's consistent failure to keep its promises on vehicle output.
Model 3, the most affordable sedan from Tesla, is seen as crucial to the company's future profitability, but has so far missed several production goals.
The car maker said the halt - the second since February - was to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks to increase production, a regular move by car companies.
""While temporary suspensions to production, in order to improve manufacturing engineering/line rates, are not uncommon in the auto industry, particularly during a ramp-up, we believe that the news will once more be taken negatively by the market; providing more honey to the bears,"" Evercore ISI analysts said.
Tesla's use of robots to assemble Model 3s had led to more complexity and delays, which billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged on Friday in a tweet: ""Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.""
According to Bernstein analysts, Tesla has not only automated stamping, painting and welding like most other manufacturers, but also tried to automate final assembly. This is where the U.S. electric car maker seems to be facing problems.
""Tesla's been trying to run full tilt,"" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors. ""He's (Musk is) sleeping overnight on the production floor. I don't think there is any way they'd purposely want to slow production. It tells me something's not quite right,"" 
Model 3 production fell short of the weekly target of 2,500 at the end of the first quarter and a number of Wall Street analysts say they do not believe it will succeed in producing 5,000 Model 3s per week in the second quarter, as Musk has promised.
""I can' t imagine that Tesla can reach an output of 5,000 cars per week until the end of June,"" said Frank Schwope, an analyst with NORD/LB. ""I expect that Tesla is going to fail (in) their aims for this year, as they did so often.""

Shares of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla was last down nearly 1 percent.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Japan's Mizuho Securities withdrew from its role as a bookrunner for a U.S. dollar-denominated bond issued by Qatar last week, in the latest sign international banks are wary of doing business in the Gulf state amid a regional dispute.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt in June cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, which they accuse of backing terrorism. Qatar denies this, and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty.
Qatar issued $12 billion of bonds last week, its first international debt sale since the dispute erupted.
The gas-rich Gulf state had appointed eight banks including Mizuho, part of Japan's Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), to lead a series of investor meetings ahead of the issue. 
But when the bond was marketed on Thursday, Mizuho was no longer in the group.
""Mizuho can confirm it was a bookrunner to the State of Qatar’s U.S. Dollar denominated bond sale, and has since withdrawn from the transaction,"" the bank said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Due to client confidentiality, we are not able to provide further comment on the matter.""
International banks with business in the Gulf have been treading carefully since the regional dispute flared up, seeking to maintain relationships on both sides.
HSBC (L:HSBA), one of the most active banks in the Gulf, turned down a role in Qatar's bond sale as it had decided not to take high-profile roles in major Qatari debt transactions, sources told Reuters earlier this year. 
The bank, however, retains a branch in Qatar and has not disengaged from the country.
Last week, while Qatari representatives were meeting global investors ahead of the bond deal, Saudi Arabia surprised markets with a jumbo bond transaction, which raised $11 billion. 
The move was seen by many market players as an attempt to absorb demand from investors and force Qatar to offer higher yields to attract interest in its deal.
One Qatari source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday that Mizuho was ""pressured to withdraw from the transaction,"" especially as ""another country"" was going to the market at the same time.
When asked if the Qatari deal was a consideration in the timing of the Saudi bond, the head of Saudi Arabia's debt management office told Reuters last week the decision was determined by market conditions.
The banks hired as bookrunners for the Saudi bond deal included Citi (N:C), Goldman Sachs International (N:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).

No bank on that deal also worked on the Qatari bond, which was arranged by Al Khaliji,  Barclays  (L:BARC), Crédit Agricole CIB (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), QNB Capital (QA:QNBK) and  Standard Chartered  Bank (L:STAN).

LONDON (Reuters) - Legal & General Investment Management, one of Europe's biggest asset managers, has written to the chief executives of some of the world's top companies calling for more action on female representation on boards, gender pay gaps and climate change.
LGIM, the fund arm of insurer Legal & General (L:LGEN), which manages nearly 1 trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) in assets, has taken a lead in improving corporate governance and its voting intentions are keenly watched, particularly by major corporations, in which it is often a leading shareholder.
In a shot across the bows for a number of companies, LGIM said it would vote against British companies where women did not represent at least a quarter of the board, and wanted a full breakdown of any gender pay gap and plans to close it.
""The vast majority of companies are making significant progress – we simply believe there is more to be done,"" Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, said.
It also said boards should consider creating an advisory committee of external experts to help challenge consensus views.
LGIM's tougher stance was backed up by industry trade body the Investment Association, which said it had written a separate letter to 35 FTSE 350 companies that it had singled out, calling on them to improve boardroom gender diversity. They included oil giant  BP  (L:BP) and Britain's second-biggest builder  Persimmon  (L:PSN). BP and Persimmon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The body of research is clear: firms with a diverse management team and pipeline make better decisions and drive innovation,"" the Investment Association's Chief Executive Chris Cummings said. The association's members manage nearly 7 trillion pounds in assets out of Britain.
LGIM's April 17 letter and the IA's letters, sent out between April 11 and April 16, come as annual general meetings get underway and as clients increasingly demand their investments take into account the impact on returns of environmental, social and governance-related matters.
LGIM's parent company Legal & General, has three females on its 10-member group board. In addition to diversity, LGIM said more needed to be done on climate change, long-term strategy and shareholder rights.
On climate change, LGIM said it wanted to see companies report in line with guidance from the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, which was set up by the G20.
""We also expect you to outline the potential impact on your business, where material, of a rise in world temperatures above the two degrees Celsius target set in the Paris climate accord,"" it said, referring to the 2015 deal on global warming.
Companies should also relate their strategy to the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, where relevant, it said, referring to a plan to tackle a range of issues including poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease by 2030.
Firms should also make greater efforts to demonstrate their long-term strategy was sound by showing how sustainability was reflected in their operations, through an analysis of risks and opportunities, target setting and public disclosures.
As more companies look to list with reduced shareholder rights, such as U.S. tech firm Snap (N:SNAP) did recently, LGIM said it was ""increasingly concerned"" and would work with regulators and others to ""strengthen the integrity of the market"".

973,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 03:03PM ET</span>",Goldman's faith in roaring markets met with skepticism on Wall Street,"By Aparajita Saxena and Lauren Tara LaCapra
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) is so confident in its recent business boom that it will pause share buybacks in the second quarter and instead use capital to facilitate trades, loans and deals for customers, its finance chief said on Tuesday.
""Clients' demand for our balance sheet continues to be strong,"" Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez said on a call with analysts to discuss Goldman's first-quarter results, which blew past Wall Street expectations.
Goldman reported gains in all four of its major business units, especially trading, as a surge in volatility led customers to transact more in capital markets.
Net income rose 27 percent to $2.7 billion, or $6.95 per share, easily topping the average analyst estimate of $5.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Its return-on-equity, a closely watched measure of how much profit a bank can generate from shareholder money, was 15.4 percent, the highest in more than five years. Investors generally like to see the figure above 10 percent.
Even so, Goldman shares fell 1.9 percent in afternoon trading, with analysts citing concerns about the volatile nature of its core businesses. Some said the first quarter of 2017 had set a particularly low bar for improvement.
""High capital market volatility and engaged client activity in trading is challenging to predict and difficult for Goldman Sachs to execute consistently,"" said CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon.
Historically, Goldman offered little in the way of disclosures or business targets, but maintained a premium on its stock price because investors had faith the Wall Street bank would generate best-in-class results. 
That has changed over the past year or two as its bond trading business stumbled and investors demanded better explanations.
In September, Goldman outlined how it aimed to add $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020, but even that plan has faced skepticism.
That is especially true of Goldman’s aspirations in consumer lending, where it has a relatively small business that analysts say will take time, or a significant acquisition, to grow meaningfully. 
The $3 billion worth of loans Goldman’s Marcus business has generated since launching in 2016 compares with more than $400 billion in consumer loans at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM). 
Trading remains Goldman's biggest business, and revenue there soared 31 percent in the first quarter as investors reacted to volatility across stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.
Overall revenue rose 25 percent to $10 billion, with investment banking, investment management and investing and lending each reporting better results. Financial advisory, which handles M&A transactions, was the only sub-segment to report a year-on-year decline.
The uptick seems sustainable because it is based on global economic growth, rising interest rates, positive labor data and the U.S. tax code overhaul, Chavez said. The last time the bank reported such strong results, three years ago, most of the surge came from one-time oddities.
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr described the $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion in revenue Goldman generated from each of its units as ""pretty impressive.""
""Obviously it won't always be this good,” he said in a note to clients, “but sure is cool to see a good old Goldman beat in a quarter that was far from the perfect backdrop.”

Investors have been underwhelmed by earnings beats and record profits from other big U.S. banks in recent days. Goldman rival  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reports results on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose about 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by gains in technology companies and as strong earnings from Netflix and UnitedHealth boosted optimism over what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years.
Netflix (O:NFLX) shares rose 10 percent to hit an all-time high after the video-streaming pioneer smashed analysts' quarterly subscriber estimates.
UnitedHealth (N:UNH) jumped 3 percent after the largest U.S. health insurer raised its earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates.
Analysts expect profits of S&P 500 companies to rise 18.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""Being able to surprise on the upside in the phase of higher expectations would be a real sign of strength,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.
Hopes about a strong reporting season have helped divert attention from geopolitical and trade worries, which have roiled the markets in recent months.
""We've seen enough pessimism build up in investors as people are trying to look for the worst ... things blowing up from a geopolitical perspective. Earnings so far have been good enough to help leave some of the pessimism that's out there,"" Delwiche said.
At 12:36 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.88 percent at 24,789.21. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1 percent to 2,704.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) gained 1.67 percent to 7,275.82.
At their session highs, all three indexes were above their 50-day moving averages.
Data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in March amid a rebound in the construction of multi-family housing units. The PHLX housing index (HGX) rose 1.12 percent.
Ten of 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by the technology index's (SPLRCT) 1.9 percent gain. The consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) rose 1.64 percent, boosted by Netflix and Amazon, which gained 3.2 percent.
BofA Merrill Lynch's April fund manager survey found the world's biggest tech stocks were investors' top pick for the third straight month despite mounting worries over regulation.
Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN), Netflix and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) — collectively known as the FAANG group — rose between 1.4 percent and 9.7 percent.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) reversed course to drop 1.7 percent, mirroring other big U.S. banks, shares of which declined despite beating Wall Street's profit expectations.
J&J (N:JNJ) fell 1.43 percent after the healthcare conglomerate raised its sales forecast for the year but kept its outlook for full-year profit unchanged.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.74-to-1 ratio, and on the Nasdaq, for a 2.52-to-1 ratio.

The financial services firm reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.95 in the first three months of the year.
Analysts’ forecast pointed to earnings of $5.58 a share.
Meanwhile, the firm’s revenue increased 25.0% from the same quarter a year earlier to $10.04 billion, beating the forecast for $8.74 billion.
In the press release, Goldman noted that the effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 17.2%, down from the full year rate of 61.5% for 2017.
The firm also reported that revenue from equities sales and trade was $2.31 billion, beating the consensus forecast of $1.85 billion.
FICC sales and trading revenue (from fixed income, currencies and commodities) was $2.07 billion in the first quarter, narrowly topping analyst estimates for $2.04 billion.
Furthermore,Goldman increased its quarterly dividend by 6.7% to $0.80 per share.
Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein referred to that the first quarter results as a “solid performance”.
“We are well positioned to serve our clients as the global economy continues to show strength and central banks unwind certain aspects of policy stimulus,” he said in the press release.
“We are also broadening our client base and further diversifying ourvbusinesses to drive more revenue and earnings growth for the firm,” Blankfein added.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Investors in Japan discount political risk as Abe troubles mount,"By Tomo Uetake and Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - From a rising Nikkei stock market to falling measures of volatility, there is little in Japan's financial markets to suggest that this may be a nation on the verge of a political upheaval.
Public support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the architect of the Abenomics brand of reforms that has helped weaken the yen, raised economic growth levels and lifted corporate profits, is at record lows as his administration is embroiled in scandals involving suspected cronyism.
That has drastically reduced the odds of Abe being re-elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in September and becoming Japan's longest serving prime minister. A popular predecessor even predicted this week that Abe would probably resign in June.
But investors don't appear to be worried.
""As an investor, I have no plan to do any Abexit trade,"" said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo. He said most investors are now looking at economic and company prospects rather than politics to gain an advantage in the market.
The belief among some that Abe has already set in motion an irreversible economic recovery is behind some of this optimism.
The three-pronged Abenomics platform implemented in 2012, comprising fiscal expansion, monetary easing, and structural reform, has already seen the Nikkei stocks index more than double in value. The economy is growing at its best in three decades and is no longer mired in deflation.
""The Japanese economy and Japanese corporate earnings have acquired an independent energy, and do not depend on the maintenance of the Abe administration,"" said Richard Kaye, portfolio manager at French asset management firm Comgest.
There is also an expectation among investors that the policies of Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan governor who was reappointed by Abe this year and who is seen as the person behind Japan's monetary stimulus, would survive an Abe exit. And that's even if Kuroda himself were to depart early.
Relatively cheap valuations and the other cross currents facing Japan are other reasons investors are disregarding the possibility of an Abe departure.
Though it is trading close to the 22,000 mark, the Nikkei isn't that expensive, with a price-to-earnings ratio below 16.
Political and economic risk in Japan could prompt a flight to the safety of the yen, though the Japanese currency is already up more than 5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year, partly owing to the increasing threat of trade protectionism. 
NO CLEAR SUCCESSOR
The absence of a clear successor to Abe isn't bothering investors either.
""There is not perhaps that much new in terms of policy that Abe is offering,"" said Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS Wealth Management.
""A change in leadership may matter if the next prime minister has a radically different agenda. But were Abe to resign, that of itself would not necessarily change existing policy.""
A survey by broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday showed Abe's support had sunk to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in December 2012. An Asahi newspaper poll on Monday put his support at 31 percent.
His possible replacements include former cabinet minister Shigeru Ishiba, the popular young LDP lawmaker Shinjiro Koizumi who is ex-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's son, and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida.
""The prospect of Abe being removed would be negative for markets in the short term, but the overall policy framework of Abenomics, including the BOJ, would most likely remain in place,"" said Jeremy Osborne, an investment director at Fidelity International in Japan.
The markets reflect that composure. 
The Nikkei volatility index, Japan's version of the global risk and volatility barometer VIX, fell to a 2-1/2-month low this week. The implied volatility on the dollar-yen currency pair is at its lowest levels in about three months. 
But there are some who think there is still a risk of political dislocation in the near term.
Tetsuro Ii, CEO of asset manager Commons Asset, said foreign investors have already lightened their Japanese holdings while domestic investors are waiting and watching.

""But the situation could change as early as early May,"" Ii said. ""Politics can change quickly once it gets moving. So we need to be careful.""

978,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 08:22AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo loses steam in commercial lending as rivals pounce,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's two biggest competitors have been nabbing market share in lending to commercial and industrial customers in the American heartland, a sign of how difficult it has become for the scandal-tarnished bank to defend its position against rivals.
Earnings reports in recent days showed Wells Fargo's book of C&I loans in the United States down 1 percent, on average, during the first quarter compared with the year-earlier period. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co's gained 5 percent and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's was 4 percent higher.
Although the banks define C&I loans somewhat differently, their reports track government data showing Wells falling behind over the past five years from a near-tie with Bank of America and losing ground to JPMorgan. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2qDp7Na)
Those two banks attributed gains to opening offices and adding bankers in smaller cities around the country, a strategy Wells Fargo has embraced for decades. But as Wells struggles to recover from a sales scandal that has touched customers in businesses ranges from deposits, credit cards, mortgages and auto lending to wealth management, it has become harder for the bank to maintain its competitive edge.
Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said as much on Friday when an analyst asked whether Wells Fargo is losing any customers because of negative headlines.
""We have to compete a little bit harder,"" he said, noting that rivals have been trying harder to steal business during Wells Fargo's time of vulnerability.
Asked by Reuters about the decline in C&I lending specifically, Shrewsberry said that while Wells Fargo competes aggressively on pricing, it has been stricter about loan structures than other banks. For example, Wells might give a borrower a lower interest rate but would not offer a bigger loan or extend the duration or relax loan terms. 
Since 2010, JPMorgan has opened 52 new commercial lending offices, including in San Francisco, where Wells is based, as well as in Silicon Valley's Palo Alto, Omaha, Nebraska, and Memphis, Tennessee. It has also hired as many as 100 commercial bankers each year, many of whom cater to companies with annual revenue of just $20 million to $500 million.
Using a similar strategy, Bank of America has hired some 400 commercial bankers in recent years.
Banks tend to forge long-lasting bonds with C&I borrowers that can lead to additional work, such as managing cash, handling payments, issuing corporate credit cards, raising money in capital markets and even advising on acquisitions. That makes Wells Fargo's market share decline particularly troubling, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl.
""If you are winning the C&I piece, you are deepening the relationship, which is good for revenue growth,"" he said.
The market share shift represents a change in fortune for Wells, which came through the 2007-2009 financial crisis strong enough to acquire a failing rival and avoid many of the embarrassing scandals that plagued other big banks.
That changed in September 2016, when Wells reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over opening what turned out to be as many as 3.5 million phony customer accounts to hit sales targets. Since then, the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets has discovered several other problems and now faces another regulatory penalty of $1 billion.
Executives have downplayed the scandal's impact on profitability or market share, saying Wells is ""open for business,"" and that few customers have left.
But analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe the scandal is starting to hurt Wells Fargo's competitive edge, either because customers are displeased or because executives are too distracted by lawsuits, regulatory probes and organizational changes to run the bank as well as they otherwise would.
""Obviously, management has been focused on the issues around the sales practices,"" said Allen Tischler, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service who has tracked the lost market share.
Nonetheless, Wells' CFO Shrewsberry was optimistic about the outlook for C&I lending, which he expects to grow this year as commercial borrowers take on more leverage for expansion plans.
Speaking about Wells Fargo's balance sheet more broadly, he said areas with sharp declines, like auto and home equity loans, are where the bank has purposefully pulled back because of credit concerns.

""Our loan portfolio is getting safer and safer,"" he said, ""and it's smaller.""

The healthcare conglomerate, whose stock had climbed about 3 percent over the previous six days, reported better-than-expected profit in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its cancer treatments.
J&J said it was not revising its earnings forecast higher for the year because certain divestments it previously expected to make this year might be pushed into 2019.

Several cases were brought to the EU's Court of Justice after German airline TUIfly said a 2016 wildcat strike - one not formally initiated by a trade union - was an extraordinary event, and so it was not liable to compensate for delays.
The strike followed the company's announcement of a restructuring plan.
EU regulation gives passengers on a delayed flight the right to compensation of up to 600 euros ($745), depending on the distance of the flight.
Airlines are exempt from paying this if they can show there were ""extraordinary circumstances"" which they could not have reasonably avoided.
The court disagreed with TUIfly (DE:TUIGn), saying such circumstances were only applicable if they were not part of the normal activity of the airline and were beyond its control.
Judges said restructuring was part of normal business, with the foreseeable risk of disagreements and conflict with staff.
""The 'wildcat strike' at issue in the present case cannot be regarded as beyond TUIfly's actual control,"" the Court of Justice said.
The dispute, which saw staff placing themselves on sick leave, was brought to an end by an agreement in October 2016.
The court added that making a distinction between wildcat strikes and those organized by a trade union would make passenger compensation dependent on the rules in different EU countries, which could undermine air passenger rights.

989,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",U.S. Ban Risks Leaving China's Rising Tech Star `Half Dead',"(Bloomberg) -- ZTE Corp. may have just gone from being a serious contender in the high-stakes world of next-generation networking to -- quite possibly -- a mobile industry washout.
China’s No. 2 telecommunications gear-maker was preparing to lead the country’s charge into the era of blazing fast fifth-generation wireless technology, along with local rival Huawei Technologies Co. Instead, ZTE ran afoul of Washington for the second time in a year, inciting a moratorium on purchases from U.S. suppliers and suffering a devastating blow to its global ambitions.
It couldn’t have happened at a worse time. ZTE finds itself grappling with life-threatening sanctions once more just as major wireless carriers prepare to roll out 5G networks worldwide. The U.S. government slapped a seven-year ban on its purchase of components from American companies for ignoring promises made in 2017 to resolve a sanctions dispute -- then lying about it.
The moratorium threatens a swathe of components needed to hawk gear to clients like China Mobile Ltd. and Europe’s  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) SA. The Chinese firm relies on suppliers from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). to Lumentum Holdings Inc. and Acacia Communications Inc. for optical components and chipsets in the equipment and smartphones it sells globally.
“Even if this doesn’t kill them, ZTE will be half-dead,” said Qian Kai, an analyst with brokerage CICC.
ZTE’s best hope may be for swift intervention to resolve the dispute from Beijing -- but that is a long shot given rising tensions between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese imports in retaliation for alleged violations of intellectual property rights, while Beijing has vowed to retaliate on everything from American soybeans to planes.
Following the ZTE ban, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday said it would take necessary measures to protect the interests of its companies. And ZTE said it was aware of the sanctions and evaluating their impact. Its shares were suspended from trade in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

U.S.-made components account for only 10 to 15 percent of ZTE’s production costs, estimates Nomura analyst Joel Ying. “But these are essential parts that aren’t easily replaced,” he said. ZTE’s smartphones, for instance, rely on Qualcomm’s chips. “At least for the next five to ten years, ZTE can’t exist without American companies.”
Things seemed to be going well for ZTE. A year ago, it appeared to mollify a U.S. Commerce Department incensed over illegal exports to Iran by agreeing to pay a fine of up to $1.2 billion and punish wayward staff. ZTE’s market value doubled over the past year, and consumer division chief Cheng Lixin spoke openly about breaking into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s home turf. And 5G spending looked like a tremendous boon: Chinese carriers alone are expected to spend 3.38 trillion yuan ($538 billion) on networks from 2018 to 2025, Jefferies estimates.
Then the U.S. issued its ban, charging that instead of punishing employees for violating sanctions ZTE had paid them full bonuses. U.S. optical suppliers such as Acacia and Lumentum dived, while greater China partners also plummeted.
Analysts delivered a flurry of downgrades on concern ZTE will miss out on future business. The 5G networks are supposed to usher in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other bleeding-edge applications.
The ban “will likely cause ZTE to lose market share in both transmission and handsets,” Edison Lee, an analyst with Jefferies, wrote Tuesday. “Expect another settlement with the U.S. to take 3 to 5 months. But customer confidence outside China will take longer to restore, especially potential 5G customers.”
ZTE Folly Will Kick China’s Chip Plan Into Overdrive: Gadfly
The ban comes days after President Xi Jinping called on the U.S. to allow Chinese companies to buy more high-tech products from American companies -- whittling away at a ballooning trade surplus. Now, a potential victim could be Qualcomm: Chinese antitrust regulators are reviewing its proposed NXP Semiconductors acquisition, CICC reminded investors.
ZTE could try sussing out alternatives in Japan, Korea or Taiwan for certain non-essential components. But it depends on the U.S. for top-notch processors such as high-speed analog-to-digital converters and communications chips, according to Roger Sheng, an analyst with Gartner.
CICC analysts Huang Leping and Wang Xinglin estimate ZTE harbors about one to two months of inventory, after which the U.S. sanctions will begin to bite. But for now, ZTE’s woes represent a boon for larger rival Huawei, which remains unfettered by similar restrictions.
Together, they rank among the world’s largest providers of networking equipment and are active across Europe and Asia -- less so in the U.S., where the government remains suspicious of their alleged government connections. Both have dismissed such accusations. CICC estimates ZTE commands about a 10 percent share of the global telecoms equipment market, and 30 percent of China. Huawei could now take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding its competitor.
But the troubles for both companies may not be over. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday plans to consider a ban on networking equipment from companies including ZTE and Huawei.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",U.S. strike on China's ZTE another blow for Qualcomm,"By Adam Jourdan and Cate Cadell
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A move by the United States to ban American firms selling components to the Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp will also hit a target closer to home: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, a U.S. company that is a major supplier of chips for ZTE's phones.
The U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sales to ZTE on Monday for breaking terms of an agreement reached last year after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. 
Caught in the crossfire is Qualcomm, whose products account for the lion's share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. The Chinese company shipped an estimated 46.4 million phones last year, according to IHS Markit.
""If you look at ZTE it sells around 45 million smartphones per year globally, and almost half of them have Qualcomm chips,"" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research.
""So if you look at an average of 25 dollars per chip set that's close to half a billion dollars in revenue.""
Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimate that a higher 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips.
Loss of business could be just the start for the U.S. company, which had sales of $22 billion last year. As Washington and Beijing square off with threats of tariffs and trade barriers, Qualcomm is a clear target for retaliation.
Technology is the crux of the tensions. 
China wants to boost domestic champions like Huawei, which also makes chips. The United States, meanwhile, concerned about China's growing might, has shot down Chinese technology deals overseas, citing national security concerns.
That puts Qualcomm, which makes the bulk of its sales in China, in an awkward position.
""Domestically there are competing attitudes: for someone like Huawei, Qualcomm is the enemy,"" said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at Control Risks. ""But for many smaller Chinese phone makers they are actually very dependent on Qualcomm.""
SNAPDRAGON
Qualcomm, which has government and defense contracts at home, is closely tied to the United States government; it is also grappling with regulator approval in China for a $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors.
It may, ironically, get hit by the ZTE issues more in the United States than in China.
ZTE, while China's second-largest telecommunication equipment maker, has dropped out of the top ten in terms of domestic smartphone sales in recent years, according to Canalys, as rivals such as Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi have surged.
But in the United States it is the fourth largest smartphone vendor after iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and LG Electronics of South Korea.
ZTE held 11.2 percent of the U.S. market last year, according to data from the consultancy Canalys.
Its phones in the United States use chip sets and processors from Qualcomm, according to company specifications on its U.S. website, which showed all its ""signature"" phones using Qualcomm chip sets such as Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 617.
""Most carriers want Qualcomm chip sets in the United States, so basically they are in deep trouble,"" said Shah, referring to ZTE. He estimated the United States at close to one fourth of the company's handset business. ""They'd be losing one of their biggest markets.""
Qualcomm was not immediately available for comment.
TRIPLE THREAT
The ZTE issue could create a triple threat for Qualcomm: the loss of an important customer, rivals bolstered as they step in to fill the vacuum, and a potential hit as China looks to retaliate against the United States.
China's commerce ministry said Tuesday that it will closely monitor the ZTE case and be prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms.
The impact of the trade war is already being felt. Qualcomm withdrew, and plans to refile, an antitrust application for its pivotal NXP deal on Saturday at the request of China's commerce ministry, sources told Reuters.
Qualcomm's shares dropped 1.7 percent on Monday. Smaller U.S. optical components firms such as the ZTE supplier Acacia Communications fell more steeply.
Counterpoint's Shah said ZTE could now look to rivals like Samsung, Taiwan's MediaTek Inc or China's Spreadtrum for alternative chips. Huawei on Tuesday repeated a long-held policy of not selling its Kirin chips to outside parties. 

Shah added, however, that ZTE phones might need expensive redesigns and other chips wouldn't have the same level of performance: ""Either way the costs will be high for ZTE.""

Data from China however gave a mixed picture of the country's economic health as growth hit a welcome 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 but separate figures showed March industrial output missed expectations.
""After a calming of geopolitical concerns and optimism about the Q1 earnings season, mixed data from China may revive queries about the strength of the world’s #2 economy,"" Accendo Markets analysts Mike van Dulken and Artjom Hatsaturjants told their clients. 
Sweden's Intrum Justitia (ST:INTRUM) surged more than 11 percent, and posted the best performance of the index after it filed a binding bid for Intesa Sanpaolo's (MI:ISP) debt collection unit in a 3.6 billion euro deal that rids the Italian bank of 10.8 billion euros ($13 billion) in bad debts.
While Italy's non-performing loans used to be seen as a major threat to the country's economy and by extension to the Euro zone, they are no longer the concern they used to be and Milan's stock market has been outperforming its peers for months.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  was up 0.7 percent while Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) rose 0.3 percent, ahead of other indices such as Paris' CAC 40 (FCHI) up 0.1 percent of Germany's DAX (GDAXI) 0.2 percent. 
Britain's Associated British Foods (L:ABF) was a top performer, up 3.6 percent after reporting first-half profit, with a resilient performance at its Primark fashion business and a previously flagged reduction in sugar revenues.
Shares in French healthcare group Sanofi (PA:SASY) retreated slightly, down 0.2 percent after it announced exclusive talks with private equity firm Advent International to sell its Zentiva European generics drugs arm to Advent for 1.9 billion euros ($2.4 billion).
Still on the French M&A front, Lagardere (PA:LAGA), the French media group whose assets include Paris Match magazine and Europe 1 radio, rose 0.8 percent after it said it would sell some eastern European radio assets to Czech Media Invest.

Shares in French supermarket  Casino  (PA:CASP) rose 0.6 percent after the company reported a 3.1 percent rise in first-quarter sales that reflected stronger performance in its Geant Casino hypermarkets and in Brazil despite food inflation.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: South Korea's KDB, GM Korea may sign preliminary funding deal by April 27","By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - Korea Development Bank (KDB) may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27 to financially support General Motors Co's (N:GM) troubled South Korean unit, provided interim due-diligence on the unit is satisfactory, the chairman of the lender said.
This is the first time KDB has offered a time-frame for a decision on whether to financially back GM Korea, in which the state-run lender has a 17 percent stake. The bank and government officials have so far been non-committal.
GM proposed in February an investment of $2.8 billion into its money-losing South Korean operations over 10 years, days after announcing a sweeping restructuring. It has asked Seoul to provide a share of the funds for the overhaul.
The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), controls the remaining 6 percent.
KDB may offer about 500 billion won ($468.42 million), proportional to its stake, to help fund GM's pledged investment in the unit, KDB Chairman and CEO Lee Dong-gull told Reuters.
GM's president told Reuters last week that common ground must be reached on a long-term restructuring of GM Korea by this Friday, and if there was none, the operation would likely seek bankruptcy protection.
GM shocked South Korea in February with plans to close one local plant and leaving the fate of three others unclear. It is seeking government funding and incentives as well as labor cost cuts to save the unit, which in 2017 posted a net loss of $1.1 billion, its fourth straight year in the red.
""If GM injects equity into the unit, we will inject equity. If GM extends loans to the unit, we will extend loans as well,"" Lee said, adding KDB prefers to take part in a rights offering rather than lending to the unit. 
""We may be able to reach a very meaningful agreement by April 27, whether it is a verbal promise or conditional MOU,"" he said, referring to a memorandum of understanding.
KDB's interim due diligence report on GM Korea is scheduled to be out on Friday, but GM Korea has so far not submitted sufficient documents for South Korea to assess its financial viability, Lee added.
He said the bank would be able to sign a legally binding deal with the automaker after a final report is out in late April or early May.
""We are in continued discussions with the KDB and the government with intent to inject new funds and convert debt into equity,"" a GM Korea spokesman said.
LEGAL ACTION
Lee said KDB would have no choice but to consider taking ""appropriate legal action"" should the U.S. automaker opt to liquidate its unit without consulting the bank.
Lee said GM should offer a long-term commitment to South Korea to get government support.
He said many South Koreans believe GM may eventually leave South Korea when government subsidies dry up, as the U.S. automaker did in Australia and Europe.
""They have to show a commitment to remaining as a good corporate citizen,"" Lee said.
""What GM really needs to know is that anti-GM sentiment is very strong in South Korea. I told GM that they need to make me feel comfortable before I can make some kind of decisions.""
Lee had a series of meetings with Barry Engle, head of GM's international operations, who visited South Korea to discuss a restructuring plan with the government and the GM Korea union.
GM Korea was one of GM's major manufacturing and engineering bases in Asia after its 2002 purchase of failed South Korean car maker Daewoo Motors. But the unit has struggled in recent years since GM pulled its Chevy brand from Europe, hitting exports to GM Korea's major market.
""The mutual trust hit rock bottom. We have to enhance trust and this will not happen overnight,"" Lee said. 
GM Korea and its union plan to hold another round of talks on a restructuring deal on Wednesday morning, a union spokesman said. ""We are trying to resolve the problem with a dialogue.""
On Tuesday, Hong Young-pyo, a ruling party lawmaker, met GM and union officials and called for the two sides to reach an agreement by April 20 to pave the way for government support. 
""The time bomb is ticking,"" he told reporters.

Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket group, had written to its stores this month recommending they expand a boycott of some Nestle products, an escalation of a pricing row between the world's biggest packaged food maker and European retailers.
Nestle and Edeka-led AgeCore -- the Geneva-based group of six European retailers that also includes Switzerland's Coop -- have not yet reached a breakthrough and the discussions could still fail, the source said on condition of anonymity.
""It's not yet home and dry,"" the source told Reuters. ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The talks are ongoing.""
Earlier, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported that a tentative compromise had been reached and that officials from both sides were hammering out the details of a new contract, citing an anonymous source that the German newspaper said was involved in negotiations.
""Nestle managers were willing to make concessions on key points,"" the source told FAZ.
The newspaper reported that the supermarket group was demanding, among other things, that Kit Kat maker Nestle contribute more to cooperative marketing campaigns.
Nestle and Edeka declined to comment on any potential deal to end the dispute, which has emerged as the latest outward sign of tension between European retailers and suppliers at a time of changing consumer tastes and new online competition.
Nestle, under the leadership of new Chief Executive Mark Schneider, is reeling from its weakest annual sales growth in at least two decades that has prompted shareholder pressure to boost revenue and profit margins.

It releases first-quarter sales on Thursday.

LONDON (Reuters) - A gradual return of risk appetite lifted world shares on Tuesday, while there were milestones aplenty as sterling hit a post-Brexit high and U.S. sanctions on Russia drove aluminum prices to a near seven-year peak.
Chinese data that provided a bit of something for everyone had kept Asia in check, but Europe (EU) was going for its third rise in four days and Wall Street (N) was pointing higher as latest earnings from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) pleased traders.
More signs that China is opening up its economy and a 'hotline' being set up between North and South Korea helped too, while steadier bond and gold markets showed investors were also gradually shifting attention away from Syria tensions.
Some of the upward moves though, including gains for sterling, metals and Russia's rouble after Washington had held off from fresh sanctions, had started to reverse as profit-taking kicked in. 
""It looks like China may be willing to cooperate with the U.S. so that might be spurring risk appetite and the positive mood in markets,"" said Rabobank analyst Bas Van Geffen.
But there were still some trade war tensions being felt. 
Stocks in Shanghai (SS) closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp had hit tech stocks. 
Beijing then said it would slap a hefty temporary tariff on U.S. sorghum imports, which sent grain futures prices jumping.
A plunge in German investor morale to its lowest in more than five years was also blamed on the trade war worries.
""This (German data) has been a solid leading indicator in the past to a downturn,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy, as the euro swiftly slid back below $1.2365. 
China's economic data meanwhile showed its economy grew 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year, unchanged from the previous quarter.
March retail sales jumped over 10 percent too, the strongest pace in four months, though other figures saw industrial output miss expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed.
STERLING AND EARNINGS
The main S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq stock futures were up over 0.5 percent ahead of the Wall Street restart as a 27 percent rise in Goldman Sachs' quarterly profit and strong earnings from Netflix and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) all boosted optimism over what is expected to be a strong earnings season.
Goldman's 23 percent increase in fixed income trading revenue was in sharp contrast to those of larger rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), which reported a flat number, and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), where it fell 7 percent.
S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Commodity markets meanwhile were still focused on the geopolitical situation in Syria and the fallout from U.S. sanctions on Russia.
Buoyed by growing expectations over tighter supply in the aftermath of sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal, aluminum prices jumped to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed it all. [MET/L] 
Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminum supply.
Oil steadied at $66.26 a barrel for U.S. crude and $71.43 a barrel for Brent, having tumbled nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over the Middle East eased. [O/R]
In another sign of the returning risk appetite, the yen fell flat at 107 per dollar and Southern European government debt outperformed better-rated peers. [GVD/EUR]
""We have had a long enough period of extended volatility now that some of the more extended positions in risk assets have been reduced, so that is also a positive,"" said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets.
On sterling, which was buying just over $1.43, he added that with so much good Brexit news priced in by investors in recent weeks and rate hike bets growing, it was difficult to see how much further it could go. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's comments on Monday about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies continued to weigh somewhat on the dollar, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants a weaker currency. [FRX/]

""It was a warning shot at China and Russia about devaluation. China has devalued their currency in the past,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin then said during a television interview early on Tuesday. ""He's watching it.""

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>","After setbacks, Anglo American counting on turnaround for Minas-Rio mine","By Alexandra Alper and Barbara Lewis
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Two leaks in a month, a 90-day outage and $58 million in fines is not enough to temper Anglo American's (L:AAL) ambition for its long-delayed, multi-billion dollar Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil.
Purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion,  Anglo American  was once counting on Minas-Rio to produce 26.5 million tons of iron ore by 2016. The mine's strength is its high-grade iron ore that commands a premium as the world's biggest commodity consumer China seeks to cut pollution.
Minas-Rio is Anglo American’s biggest development project, and its bet on the future of iron ore, but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in ramp-up phase.
The project has been delayed by Brazil's labyrinthine permitting process, and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline, which will be shut during a three month inspection. Renewed focus on environmental standards at mines, after leaks at the Norwegian-owned Alunorte refinery and from Anglo's pipelines, has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes.
Brazil’s federal environmental regulator Ibama levied fines against Anglo American of 71 million reais ($21.1 million) related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine. That was in addition to 125.6 million reais ($37.3 million) from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais on April 4. 
Ibama said it will need to evaluate a technical report provided by Anglo after its pipeline inspection before it can resume operations. Ibama did not provide a timeline for that evaluation.
Anglo American executives are confident Minas-Rio - a project that has cost more than $8 billion to build - will hit that 26.5 million ton production target in 2020, and expect the mine will soon break even, with output expected at only around 10 million tons this year. 
""Regardless of the leak, we expect a cash flow very close to the break even (this year),"" Anglo American CEO for Brazil Ruben Fernandes told Reuters, adding he expects the company to get a vital final permit from Brazil.
Some industry veterans see financial woes weighing heavily, as Anglo continues to pay fixed costs and stops receiving revenue for the expensive mine. 
""This without a doubt is a setback,” for Anglo said Roberto Castello Branco, a former senior executive at Vale and board member at Petrobas of the Minas-Rio leak. 
He added it is also a negative for the Brazilian mining industry which may now face tougher scrutiny to operate a mine in a country that has suffered repeated environmental damage from mining. 
""It is a situation in which everyone loses,"" said Branco.
Rival miners have already pulled back production after their own leaks. Norway's Hydro (OL:NHY) has halved capacity at its Alunorte alumina refinery after a leak, while Samarco - a joint venture between BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) and Vale (SA:VALE3) - has yet to resume output after a dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people.
Recovering Anglo’s initial investment was complex but not impossible, Fernandes said. 
He has not put a figure on lost revenue during the shutdown over next few months, telling Reuters that the focus is on ""stable production of 26 million and a half in keeping with the project. Then we will know the cost of production.""
Without the permit to expand, Minas-Rio would run out of ore at the end of the year. 
Anglo American executives have played down the pipeline leaks, saying the spills were not toxic and swiftly contained. ""We should be ready to apply for the operating license in the third quarter of this year,"" Fernandes said. 
PREMIUM ORE 
The stakes for Brazil are high when it comes to how strict its regulators get on mine safety, given the country is well-placed to supply the United States as President Donald Trump's tariff war aims to boost his domestic steel industry. 
A more robust U.S. industry would need more iron ore and Brazil is geographically in the right region to supply it, having gotten a tariff exemption. 
""If the iron-ore price stays high, it will be a very profitable asset,"" said Steve Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management, a top 20 Anglo American shareholder. 
""But we have to acknowledge that because of past mistakes, the company spent a huge amount on it, so the return on the total investment won’t be good."" That said, Anglo has outperformed peers this year in part because of improved efficiency in production of bulk commodities coal and iron ore and strong output from its Kumba operations in South Africa. 
For the full-year 2017, Anglo American's most profitable divisions were coal followed by iron ore and manganese, accounting for respectively 32 and 27 percent of EBITDA. 
RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said the bank continued to see ""relative upside in Anglo American versus peers on a 12-month view"" because it has recovered well from 2015-16 crash, cost cutting and improved efficiency. But acquiring permits remains a worry.
Hennie Faul, Anglo American’s global copper unit CEO, said ""each country has its own challenges"" but the company’s balance sheet was well-positioned to keep developing its Brazil assets, which also include nickel.

""We're certainly not trying to get out of Brazil,"" Faul told Reuters in Santiago.

China's first quarter GDP growth was in focus as it came in slightly higher than expectations. Traders now look ahead to a speech by the incoming head of the New York Fed John Williams later this week.
China’s GDP growth figures for the first quarter of 2018 came in at 6.8% year-on-year, slightly above market expectation of 6.7%, official data showed on Tuesday. Strong consumer demand and surprisingly robust property investment were cited as supportive. Impacts on the equities seemed to be limited however, with the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both falling more than 0.6% following the release of the data.
Meanwhile, China's industrial production data came in worse than expected, posting 6.0% compared to the estimated 6.4% and the 7.2% for the January-February period. Meanwhile, retail sales beat expectations in March, rising 10.1% from a year ago as sales of cosmetics, clothing, furniture and home appliances rose during the period. The data is compared to the consensus forecast of 9.9%.
After an initial climb into a positive territory following the data release, the Hang Seng index fell back into the red and traded 0.3% lower by 1:11AM ET (05:11 GMT).
Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed telecommunications-gear maker ZTE Corp-H (HK:0763) made headlines after the U.S. blocked the company from exporting “sensitive technology” from America. The company was accused of making false statements to U.S. officials, reports suggested.
In Japan, the Nikkei slipped 0.1% in afternoon trade. U.S. President Donald Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are set to meet on Wednesday to discuss trade, among other things, reports on Tuesday suggested. Investors also watch closely if U.S. officials try to put pressure on Japan after the U.S. Treasury’s semi-annual currency report published on Friday kept Japan on a monitoring list for possible manipulation. In addition, Trump accused China and Russia of devaluing their currencies.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.2% lower, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched 0.2% higher after the Reserve Bank of Australia maintained its dovish monetary policy to keep interest rate at 1.5% as the Bank’s minutes showed on Tuesday that inflation remained below target."
1002,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2018 12:10AM ET</span>",Walmart gives its website a makeover in latest e-commerce push,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, said on Tuesday it has made extensive changes to its website, betting that a cleaner, more modern walmart.com will help it win market share from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Walmart, which announced in October that it was redesigning its website, has been investing heavily in its e-commerce business and using its more than 4,700 U.S. stores to make it easier to shop online.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company has been letting shoppers pick up and return online orders in stores, and said in March that it planned to expand its grocery home delivery services to reach more than 40 percent of U.S. households.
The changes, to take effect at the start of May, will include a wider range of colors, fonts and more informal photographs. The retailer declined to comment on the total cost of the redesign.
The last time Walmart updated its website was in 2014, but the changes were not as dramatic, Walmart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said. 
Walmart's new homepage will be personalized to customers' locations, allowing them to buy products that are trending in their towns and see which of these online services their local stores provide, Marc Lore, the head of Walmart's e-commerce business, said in an interview on Monday.
Lore also said the website would soon have different layouts depending on product categories, allowing customers to shop for groceries differently from how they buy clothes and accessories, or home improvement products.
Lore said these changes had been well-received by the website's brands, which will have more space and different ways to advertise. Retailers, including Amazon and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, often give brands space on their websites to increase e-commerce traffic and boost online assortments.
""We can see from the research that it's going to appeal to customers,"" Lore said.
Walmart said in February that online sales increased 23 percent in the most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. The company posted about $11.5 billion in U.S. e-commerce revenue for the full year. Total U.S. sales were $318.5 billion.

The slowing online sales growth raised concerns among analysts that the retailer might be unable to keep pace with Amazon. Company officials said at the time that Walmart was still on track to increase its e-commerce sales by 40 percent this year.

1003,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:39PM ET</span>","Asian Equities Slip; Earnings, China GDP In Focus ","Investing.com – Asian equities slipped in morning trade on Tuesday. Investors’ attention now turned to first quarter earnings and China’s GDP report due at 10PM ET (02:00 GMT) as geopolitical tensions eased. Traders also look ahead to a speech by the incoming head of the New York Fed John Williams later this week.
Economists expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5% this year, while maintaining a more upbeat view of the first quarter, according to reports. Regulatory crackdown and a growing trade dispute with the U.S. are expected to be seen as key risks.
Overnight, U.S stocks gained as trade tensions and Syria concerns faded. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, while the Dow gained 0.9% and the Nasdaq up 0.7%.
Reports that U.S. President Donald Trump accused China and Russia of devaluing their currencies raised some eye brows as his comment contradicted his own Treasury chief’s earlier view, who said China is not a currency manipulator.
“Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!” Trump said on Twitter, without providing any evidence to support his claim.
His comments came amid intensifying trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
In Japan, the Nikkei slipped 0.2% by 9:39PM ET (01:39 GMT). The country’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to meet Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday to discuss the U.S.’s unexpected decision to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The two were also expected to open talks on the tariffs on Japanese steel and aluminum exports.
Meanwhile, Chinese telecommunications-gear maker ZTE Corp (HK:0763) made headlines after the U.S. blocked the company from exporting “sensitive technology” from America. The company was accused of making false statements to U.S. officials, reports suggested. The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both 0.01% lower.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.2% lower, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 inched 0.2% higher in morning trade."
1004,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",U.S. Cuts Off China's ZTE From American Tech for Seven Years,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government said Chinese telecommunications-gear maker ZTE Corp. violated the terms of a sanctions settlement and imposed a seven-year ban on purchases of crucial American technology needed to keep it competitive.
The Commerce Department determined ZTE, which was previously fined for shipping telecommunication equipment to Iran and North Korea, subsequently paid full bonuses to employees who engaged in the illegal conduct, failed to issue letters of reprimand and lied about the practices to U.S. authorities, the department said.
“Instead of reprimanding ZTE staff and senior management, ZTE rewarded them,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in the statement. “This egregious behavior cannot be ignored.”
The ZTE rebuke may aggravate tensions between the U.S. and China over trade between the world’s two biggest economies. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese imports in retaliation for alleged violations of intellectual property rights, while Beijing has vowed to retaliate on everything from American soybeans to planes. Trump on Monday accused China along with Russia of devaluing their currencies, opening a new front in his argument that foreign governments are exploiting the U.S.
For ZTE, the latest Commerce action means one of the world’s top ten makers of smartphones will no longer be able to buy technology from U.S. suppliers, including components central to its products. ZTE has purchased chips from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., and optical components from Acacia Communications Inc. and Lumentum Holdings Inc. A seven-year ban would effectively cover a critical period during which the world’s telecoms carriers and suppliers are developing and rolling out fifth-generation wireless technology.
“All hell breaks loose,” wrote Edison Lee and Timothy Chau, analysts at Jefferies, after the export ban was announced.
They downgraded ZTE shares to underperform and cut their price target on its stock by more than half. Shares in Acacia and Lumentum plunged on the news. Trading in ZTE shares was suspended in Hong Kong.
ZTE faces tough options in particular due to the ban on buying Qualcomm’s processors and modems, the main components in smartphones. China’s Huawei Technologies Co. makes those chips for use in its own handsets, while MediaTek Inc. is Qualcomm’s largest rival in offering chips on a so-called merchant basis. ZTE may have to either buy from a competitor or get chips from a Taiwanese company whose products generally lag those of its U.S. rival’s in performance.
ZTE said it was aware of the sanctions and is evaluating its impact while talking with related parties. Qualcomm declined to comment.

Separately, the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre warned the country’s telecommunications companies and regulator that national security risks from using ZTE equipment and services “cannot be mitigated.”
A senior official with the Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security told reporters that the ZTE decision was unrelated to the administration’s threats to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, saying the actions against the Chinese company are part of an investigation. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the timing of the ZTE action was unfortunate because it could seem related to U.S. steps to stop alleged theft of intellectual property.
ZTE agreed in March of last year to plead guilty and pay as much as $1.2 billion for violating U.S. laws restricting sale of American technology to Iran.

The agreement called for the company to pay $892 million in fines and forfeitures and be subject to an additional $300 million in penalties if it violates the terms of the settlement. It was the largest criminal fine for the Justice Department in an export control or sanctions case.
“ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company,” ZTE’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Zhao Xianming said at the time. The company is making personnel changes and instituting new compliance procedures, he said.
Denying ZTE export privileges prevents the company from “participating in any way in any transaction” subject to the U.S. government’s Export Administration Regulations, which govern sales of sensitive technology abroad. It’s also illegal for other businesses or individuals to participate in transactions with a company that has been denied export privileges, according to the department.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday plans to consider a ban on networking equipment from companies such as ZTE and Huawei.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 11:07PM ET</span>",Australia's AMP misled corporate watchdog for almost a decade: inquiry hears,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) lied to the country's corporate watchdog for almost a decade to cover its widespread practice of charging customers for services it did not provide, an inquiry heard on Tuesday.
AMP had told the Australian regulator that in 2009 it was charging fees after customers stopped receiving advice, by mistake, and that it was moving to correct the practice; however documents presented in the inquiry revealed the practice had been discussed by management and approved.
By June 2017, the practice had affected about 29,000 clients and AMP was telling the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) its processes had failed, even though there were no processes to stop the misappropriation of funds.
""Do you agree with me that statement (to ASIC) was also misleading because there was no reference or explanation that, in fact, in some cases it wasn’t a failure of process, it was a deliberate decision that had been made by AMP,"" Michael Hodge, the barrister assisting the commission asked AMP's current head of advice Anthony Regan. 
""The answer to your question is yes,"" Regan responded.
Shares in AMP were down 3 percent in late morning, while the broader market was slightly higher. 
The Royal Commission, as the inquiry into corporate wrongdoing is called, has identified at least 18 instances where AMP management lied to the regulator to cover its practices in the period from Jan. 2009 to June 2017, documents presented to the inquiry on Monday and Tuesday show. 
The inquiry, which began last month and is scheduled to last a year, could lead to greater regulation and even criminal charges.
It is currently focusing on the provision of financial advice by AMP and the four largest banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC). 
The center-right government agreed to call the inquiry after years of scandals in Australia's financial sector, including interest-rate rigging, accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate insurance payouts, and accusations of money-laundering.
""This is shocking,"" Australia's treasurer Scott Morrison said on Tuesday when asked about the revelations.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 08:13PM ET</span>",Tesla says Model 3 production shut down temporarily,"By Alexandria Sage and Munsif Vengattil
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line in what the company said on Monday was a planned production pause, as the automaker continues to face challenges ramping up its new sedan.
It was the second time since February that Tesla has temporarily shut down its production line for the Model 3 at its Fremont, California plant.
""These periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates,"" a Tesla representative said on Monday.
BuzzFeed, which first reported the news, said workers were expected to use vacation days or stay home without pay during the four- to five-day production pause.
After repeated delays in production of its Model 3 sedan, Tesla is now trying to catch up to a target of building 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter. Problems within its heavily roboticized assembly line have complicated those efforts. 
On Friday, Musk acknowledged for the first time that he had overrelied on automation in the Model 3 assembly line, a stunning concession from Tesla's leader who has previously scoffed at competitors' manufacturing prowess and bragged about creating an ""Alien Dreadnought"" within the Fremont factory by 2018. 
""Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,"" Musk tweeted on Friday. ""To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.""
He also tweeted on Friday that Tesla would be profitable and cash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters, with no need to raise money. 
Many analysts dispute this analysis, which hinges on a rapid rise in production of the Model 3 sedan. Delays and lower-than-expected volume have postponed revenue from cars being delivered to customers from reaching Tesla's bottom line.
Shares did not move after hours after falling 3 percent on Monday, pressured by Musk's acknowledgement, a report alleging that Tesla undercounted worker injuries - which the company denies - and an amended lawsuit originally filed last year that alleges Musk misled investors about Model 3 production.
In February, Tesla suspended production of its Model 3 for four days in what it said was planned work to adjust equipment in order to improve automation and address bottlenecks. It warned of possibly more periods of downtime in coming months.

Automakers generally do stop or slow production of new models to iron out problems with the production system, although Tesla took shortcuts with the testing of its production line in order to get to market more quickly, shortcuts that some experts say have resulted in early manufacturing problems.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",Britain reviews powers of its accounting watchdog,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has launched a ""root and branch"" review of its audit watchdog after corporate scandals raised questions about its ability to police how accountants check the books of companies.
The independent review of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) aims to bolster Britain's reputation for upholding corporate standards, seen as critical to maintaining the country's attractiveness for investment after it leaves the European Union next year.
Business minister Greg Clark said the review will be chaired by John Kingman, a former top finance ministry official and now chairman of insurer Legal & General (L:LGEN). It will assess how the FRC is run, its impact and powers. It is due to be completed by the end of this year.
""The UK has a strong reputation as a dependable place to do business, but this needs to be continuously updated and it's important to ensure all of our regulators continue to drive high standards,"" Clark said in a statement on Tuesday.
""This review is part of the government's industrial strategy aim of creating a business environment that ensures our regulators are fit for the future and our markets are working for consumers.""
FRC faced tough questions from lawmakers after taxpayers had to bail out several lenders during the global banking crisis, only months after accountants gave the green light to financial statements.
FRC Chairman Win Bischoff welcomed the review.
""Meeting public expectations means using our powers effectively, working closely with other regulators and identifying where gaps in those powers exist,"" Bischoff said.
The watchdog has been criticized for being too slow to intervene, though it has repeatedly pointed out major gaps in its armory, forcing it to rely on other regulators to take action. 
It can only pursue company executives who are members of a professional accounting body, such as with two ex-finance directors of bankrupt construction company  Carillion  (L:CLLN) last month.
The FRC writes Britain's company governance code but it has no power to enforce it and must leave any challenges to the shareholders of companies. This gap in power was highlighted by lawmaker anger over how  Sports Direct  (L:SPD) was treating some of its staff. 
Last week the FRC announced two initiatives to strengthen its clout by pushing for bigger fines and by vetting senior hires at the six biggest accounting firms, KPMG, Deloitte, EY, PwC, Grant Thornton and BDO.

The Kingman review will include a consultation.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:13PM ET</span>","Elon Musk's Boring Co raises $112.5 million in funding, most from Musk","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Elon Musk's Boring Co said on Monday it raised $112.5 million in equity, with 90 percent coming from Musk himself, as the company seeks to build underground tunnels for its hyperloop transportation project.
In a regulatory filing, the company listed 31 unnamed investors as participants in the funding round. Besides Musk, the rest of the investors were early Boring employees, according to the company. 
Musk, who also leads electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and rocket company SpaceX, is seeking to revolutionize transportation by sending passengers packed into pods through an intercity system of giant, underground vacuum tubes known as the hyperloop. Forbes magazine estimates Musk's net worth at $19.3 billion.
The funding comes about five months after Musk said Boring Co would compete to fund, build and operate a ""loop"" to connect downtown Chicago with O'Hare Airport.
Musk earlier sold Boring Co hats and flamethrowers to raise funds.
The company says tunnel-digging projects can cost as much as $1 billion per mile, but its goal is to lower these costs by a factor of 10 or more.
In October, the Maryland Department of Transportation gave ""conditional approval to the construction of a tunnel from Baltimore to Washington"" for the project by issuing a utility permit.
Last month, six Democratic members of Congress from Maryland and Washington wrote to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan seeking information about the state's support for the proposed Hyperloop Project, including the regulatory standards that will apply.

""While the Hyperloop is an exciting project that has the potential to transform transportation along the entire U.S. East Coast, it is also a project that would utilize a wholly new technology and could have significant impacts on our constituents,"" the members wrote.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 05:58PM ET</span>",Exclusive: BlackRock's biggest stock-picking fund likes Facebook shares,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest stock-picking fund at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) raised its bet on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) in March, a source familiar with the matter said, making the social media company a top 10 equity holding and apparently betting that Facebook's privacy scandal will not weigh on the stock for long. 
A person familiar with the matter said the Global Allocation Fund - run by Dan Chamby, Russ Koesterich, David Clayton and Kent Hogshire - had boosted its Facebook share count. The person, who requested anonymity because BlackRock does not discuss individual stocks, declined to say specifically how many Facebook shares the fund had acquired or when during the month they were purchased.
Facebook and BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with $6.32 trillion under management, declined to comment.
The increases in Facebook holdings were enough to make the social media company the $36.7 billion fund's sixth largest stock holding at March 30, up 10 spots from where it had been two months earlier, according to the fund's website and Thomson Reuters data. The March disclosures also do not spell out when shares were acquired or how many were bought.
Facebook had not recently been listed in the top 10 holdings, a list updated monthly. As of Jan. 31, the date of its most recent detailed filings, the Global Allocation Fund held 1.38 million Facebook shares, making it the No. 16 equity holding valued at about $258 million at that time.
Facebook shares are down more than 10 percent after the New York Times and London's Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company's users.
Even with the increased stake, which has not been previously reported, Facebook accounts for less than 1 percent of the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, which holds hundreds of stocks and also invests in bonds as well as gold and other commodities. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is listed as the fund's top stock holding, accounting for 2.24 percent of assets at the end of March.
Yet the buying represents an endorsement of Facebook by a major outside shareholder at a time when the company faces questions about whether its targeted advertising business can survive stricter regulation and calls for users to ""#DeleteFacebook.""
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in testimony to U.S. lawmakers last week that the company's major investments in security ""will significantly impact our profitability going forward.""
Overall, Facebook shares are down more than 6 percent year-to-date. Short-sellers, who warned the market was overvalued and have been raising alarm about social media privacy issues, made $4 billion on paper profits in the last two weeks of March, betting against the ""FANG"" group. They comprise four closely watched internet stocks: Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. 
Facebook is the seventh largest U.S. equity short at $5.22 billion with short interest increasing by $447 million in April and $1.11 billion for the year, according to S3 Partners.
Still, for other investors, the Cambridge Analytica news created an opportunity to buy a company with one of fastest-growing revenue lines in the S&P 500 at a discount. 
The stock is still near its cheapest ever, according to a price-to-earnings ratio based on profits Wall Street analysts expect Facebook to deliver over the coming 12 months.

For BlackRock, scooping up battered shares of Facebook could turn out to be a lucrative bet that could help boost its fund. Relatively low-fee shares of the Global Allocation Fund are down 0.05 percent this year, through Friday, beating most its peers. Overall, the fund is on course the post its fourth straight year of withdrawals, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>",Battle over board seats at Destination Maternity heats up,"BOSTON (Reuters) - One of Destination Maternity Corp'slargest investors on Monday accused the retailer of ""governance shenanigans"" and asked it to clarify exactly how many directors will be elected at the annual meeting, a regulatory filing shows.
In the last two weeks the company has increased and then decreased the size of its board, creating what investor Nathan G. Miller calls confusion and worse for investors, he wrote to the Moorestown, New Jersey-based company on Monday, according to the filing.
Investors like Miller who are pushing for changes at corporations around the country have a short time to nominate dissident investors and company lawyers force them to follow strict nomination rules for their slates to be valid. Industry analysts say Destination Maternity's shifts in board size are unusual and raise questions for investors.
Miller, whose NGM Asset Management owns 7.8 percent of the company's stock and is pushing it to add female directors, said the back-and-forth is leaving investors in the dark about how many people will eventually oversee how the company operates. 
On April 3, the company increased the board to six directors from four. Then it cut the board back to five directors on April 12 when one of the recently appointed directors quit after only nine days on the job, the filing says.
Another board member then said he would not run again, but the company did not reduce the size of the board, saying it would do so only after the 2018 annual meeting began, the filing says.
We ""are concerned that these governance shenanigans are an attempt to gain an improper advantage in the election of directors at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders,"" Miller wrote, demanding an ""unequivocal statement regarding the maximum number of Board seats that are up for election.""
The annual meeting is scheduled for May 23, according to a Feb. 28 statement by the company.
Miller asked the company to use a universal proxy card so investors can choose directors from both the management and dissident slates. The company refused to use it.
Both Miller and a representative for Destination Maternity declined to comment.
Destination Maternity's stock lost 3.6 percent to $2.59 in Nasdaq trading on Monday.

China’s ownership of U.S. bonds, bills and notes increased by $8.5 billion to $1.18 trillion in February, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury department on Monday. China remained the largest foreign creditor to the U.S., followed by Japan whose holdings dropped to $1.06 trillion, from $1.07 trillion in January.
Speculation is growing about whether China could use its vast Treasury holdings as a bargaining chip in a trade dispute with the U.S. While Chinese ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai didn’t rule out the possibility of the Asian nation scaling back Treasury purchases in response to tariffs proposed by the Trump administration in March, some observers have said a wide-scale sell-off is unlikely given that China has few alternatives to invest in.
Still, China is evaluating the impact of a gradual yuan depreciation as the country’s leaders mull their options in the trade spat with the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. The world’s two largest economies are threatening to impose tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods, fueling worries of a trade war that could roil financial markets.
President Donald Trump weighed into the currency-market debate on Monday, accusing China and Russia of devaluing their currencies. His comments on Twitter contradicted the findings of his Treasury Department, which said in its semi-annual foreign-currency report on Friday that no major trading partners are currency manipulators.
China’s stockpile of foreign-exchange dipped in February, marking the first decline in more than a year amid volatility in the global financial markets. The yuan has gained almost 10 percent over the past year as stricter capital controls have kept money from flowing out.
The Treasury data released Monday also reflected some of the commotion in the financial markets in February. Net foreign sales of U.S. equities totaled $1.2 billion in February, the first outflows since August and compared with $34.5 billion in purchases in January."

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Netflix programming binge pays off with subscriber surge,"By Lisa Richwine and Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) - Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Inc's blitz of original programs attracted a surprisingly high 7.4 million new customers from January to March, reassuring investors who are betting the video-streaming pioneer's massive spending will fuel growth around the world.
New shows like ""Altered Carbon"" and ""O Mecanismo"" helped Netflix smash analysts' subscriber estimates, and its better-than-expected second-quarter outlook soothed concerns about competition from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Shares of Netflix jumped more than 7 percent in after-hours trading on Monday to $330.30. The stock is the top performer on the S&P 500 this year, gaining more than 60 percent.
""I don't think this is a one-time thing,"" said Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors. ""It's very similar to the results we saw last quarter. It's getting better.""
Wall Street expected Netflix to add 6.5 million new subscribers, according to FactSet data. Netflix topped that and also said it would bring in 6.2 million more customers from April through June, 1 million more than analyst predictions.
Netflix says it will spend up to $8 billion on global TV shows and movies in 2018. As it has expanded to some 190 countries, investors accepted negative free cash flow in exchange for the potential of outsized growth in future years.
""We have big plans for content growth and you should expect that to continue,"" Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on a post-earnings webcast. 
In the first three months of the year, Netflix boosted original programing by 85 percent from a year earlier to a record 483 hours, according to Cowen & Co analysts. 
The slate included science fiction series ""Altered Carbon"" and Marvel action drama ""Jessica Jones."" 
Non-English programing also is gaining traction, Netflix said. ""O Mecanismo"" is on pace to become one of the service's most-viewed original series in Brazil, and Spanish-language heist thriller ""La Casa de Papel"" was the most-watched non-English series ever on Netflix, according to the company.
For the just-ended quarter, revenue grew 40 percent year-over-year to $3.7 billion, the fastest pace in the company's history. The average cost of a Netflix membership rose 14 percent during that time, and customer ranks swelled to 125 million.
""Subscribers are accelerating even at higher pricing,"" BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. ""Content spend is having a direct effect on its subscriber growth.""
In a quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix said it will ""continue to raise debt as needed to fund our increase in original content,"" adding that its debt levels were ""quite modest as a percentage of our enterprise value."" 
The company's market capitalization stands at $137.2 billion, more than double a year earlier.
But it faces growing competition as technology companies such as Apple and Amazon pour money into premium programing, international rivals jump into streaming and traditional media companies pursue digital customers. 
Walt Disney Co will stop supplying new movies to Netflix starting next year and will start its own streaming service for families.
Investors have appeared bullish on the company's ability to add more members. Netflix recently traded at 93 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Amazon at 133 times earnings and Disney at 17 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Net income rose to $290.1 million, or 64 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $178.2 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier.

Revenue grew 40 percent year-over-year to $3.7 billion, the fastest pace in the company's history.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Well known U.S. activist investors including Nelson Peltz and William Ackman took a hit from the first-quarter U.S. stock market slump, with their funds losing money while some smaller players delivered gains.
Peltz's $11 billion Trian Fund Management lost roughly 4 percent during the first three months of the year while Ackman's $8 billion Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management's flagship hedge fund dropped 5.7 percent, investors said.
Returns among activists have been lower than usual as the market favored growth stocks instead of the underpriced value stocks that activists traditionally target for corporate improvements. The firms either did not return requests for comment or declined to comment. 
Daniel Plants' Voce Capital, which invests roughly $200 million, gained 7.9 percent and James Mitarotonda's Barington Capital Group climbed 6.8 percent. Smaller activists tend to focus on smaller companies where changes may occur faster, helping boost returns.
The quarter was tough for most stock investors as fears of faster interest hikes coupled with tough language on trade from U.S. President Donald Trump left the Standard & Poor's 500 with a 1.2 percent loss, the first quarter drop since late 2015.
Declining returns came as activists launched a record 73 new campaigns and put $25 billion to work in the first quarter, data from Lazard show. The average activist fund lost 1 percent, lagging behind the average hedge fund which was roughly flat at 0.4 percent, Hedge Fund Research data showed.
Even some of the industry's most widely admired agitators did not have much to brag about in early 2018. Daniel Loeb's Third Point slipped 0.7 percent while Jeffrey Smith's Starboard Value was up 0.71 percent.
ValueAct, founded by Jeffrey Ubben and now run by Mason Morfit, gained 1.6 percent. Despite the positive return, ValueAct told clients in February that it plans to return $1.5 billion in capital.
Some firms' losses swelled. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which occasionally engages in activism, lost 14 percent in the first quarter, while Glenn Welling's Engaged Capital dropped 7.9 percent and Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital was off roughly 5 percent. Jana Partners was off 2.4 percent. 
Explanations for sluggish returns vary, ranging from criticism that many activists are not good at hedging their portfolios through short selling, industry investors said, to bad news at some portfolio companies.

Despite sluggish returns, activists are pushing for change at a fast pace, data showed. ""In a market that lacks direction or a down market, activist investors can catalyze change and unlock value and outperform,"" said Engaged Capital's chief investment officer Glenn Welling.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of  Allegiant Travel  Co (O:ALGT), the parent company of Allegiant Air, fell sharply in Monday afternoon trading, following a segment on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that alleged the airline suffered a high number of mechanical problems. 
Allegiant shares dropped 2.95 percent to $146.60 on the Sunday CBS piece, which found more than 100 ""serious mechanical incidents"" on the ultra-low-cost carrier between January 2016 and October 2017. The report was based on a review of data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and interviews with industry experts. 
In a statement on Monday, Allegiant dismissed the claims in the CBS story as a ""false narrative"" and called any suggestions of intentional regulatory violations ""offensive and defamatory.""
""CBS produced a one-sided narrative by cherry-picking interviews and ignoring publicly available facts,"" Allegiant Vice President of Operations Eric Gust said in a statement. 
""Allegiant complies with all FAA requirements and participates in numerous voluntary safety programs to ensure we operate to the highest standards.""
The CBS story is just the latest examination of the carrier in recent years that has found significantly higher safety problems aboard Allegiant flights as compared to its rivals. 
Some 300 pages of FAA records obtained in 2016 by Alternative Research Services owner Robert MacArthur found that the airline was plagued by emergency landings, failed takeoffs, engine troubles and other issues.
A Washington Post analysis of FAA documents at the time found that Las Vegas-based Allegiant had about nine times as many ""serious incidents"" from January 2015 through March 2016 as Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), the second-largest U.S. carrier, despite Delta having flown about three times as many comparable planes in the period. 
In response to inquiries, the FAA provided a copy of a letter it sent to ""60 Minutes"" producers Michael Karzis and Vanessa Fica on April 11. 
""The FAA has conducted ongoing evaluations of Allegiant's safety compliance, as it does with all carriers, and has not identified any significant or systemic problems with the carrier's current operation,"" FAA Associate Administrator Ali Bahrami wrote. 
""Had we identified such problems, the FAA would have taken immediate action."" 
The agency said that Allegiant's reported incidents rate has trended downward in recent years, including diversions and emergency landings, with Allegiant having reported 0.0029 events per 1,000 departures in 2017.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense on Monday updated its request for proposals from potential bidders on a $10 billion project for cloud computing services, in a deal that has been closely watched because Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has been considered to be a top contender.
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said he would take a serious look at policies to address what he says are the unfair business advantages of online retailer Amazon, which has been interpreted as a threat to Amazon winning the cloud deal.
The competition has attracted criticism from companies that fear Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud unit, will win the contract, snuffing out hopes that others will break into government cloud computing. Amazon Web Services is the only company the U.S. government has approved to handle secret and top secret data.
The Defense Department's under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, Ellen Lord, told reporters in her Pentagon office on Friday morning that at least 50 companies were competing for the contract.
Proposals from industry, according to a letter from the Pentagon to potential bidders, are needed to help the Defense Department with its broad modernization effort that will move data off older data storage facilities and into cloud computing, which is commonly used by businesses.
The selection process for the $10 billion a year contract was set for completion in September.

Several other U.S. companies including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google are expected to compete for the two-year contract.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix (O:NFLX) slipped 1 percent on Monday ahead of the video streaming service's quarterly report as investors braced for signs of whether it and other leading stocks are likely to carry the market higher over the next few weeks.
Options activity implied traders expect a move of at least 9 percent up or down in Netflix by Friday, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Netflix has surged 35 percent since its previous quarterly report on Jan. 22, making it one of Wall Street's best performers as the S&P 500 has slipped into correction territory and investors worry a nine-year bull market may be ending.
Netflix's March-quarter report after the bell on Monday will be the first from the so-called FANG stocks, which also includes  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), that have powered the market higher in recent years. 
Investors will track how Netflix shares react in extended trade for clues about the market's willingness to push valuations higher.
Netflix's popularity with investors has put its stock price at 100 times expected earnings, down from a multiple of 117 times earnings in January but far higher than the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 16, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Investors on the Robinhood stock trading app, which is popular with young people, were buying Netflix shares 7 percent more than they were selling them ahead of Netflix's report. That compares to a buy/sell ratio of 20 percent ahead of Netflix's previous report, Robinhood said in an email.
Global Google searches for Netflix in the first quarter rose 32 percent year over year, slightly more than the 26 percent increase in the prior quarter, suggesting solid growth but no big upside surprise, wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Barton Crockett in a note to clients.
Netflix in January said it expected to add 6.35 million new streaming customers in the first quarter, helped by original content including ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown.""
""We believe management commentary on the impact of content and marketing investments, progress in emerging and more recently localized markets and long-term cash flow potential will be key to the sustained investment thesis,"" Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris wrote in a preview.

Analysts on average expect quarterly revenue to jump 40 percent to $3.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Adjusted non-GAAP net income is expected to rise 60.5 percent to $286 million, or 64 cents per share, according to average analyst estimates.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Toyota to launch 'talking' vehicles in United States in 2021,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) plans to start selling U.S. vehicles that can talk to each other using short-range wireless technology in 2021, the Japanese automaker said on Monday, potentially preventing thousands of accidents annually.
The U.S. Transportation Department must decide whether to adopt a pending proposal that would require all future vehicles to have the advanced technology. 
Toyota hopes to adopt the dedicated short-range communications systems in the United States across most of its lineup by the mid-2020s. Toyota said it hopes that by announcing its plans, other automakers will follow suit.
The Obama administration in December 2016 proposed requiring the technology and giving automakers at least four years to comply. The proposal requires automakers to ensure all vehicles ""speak the same language through a standard technology.""
Automakers were granted a block of spectrum in 1999 in the 5.9 GHz band for ""vehicle-to-vehicle"" and ""vehicle to infrastructure"" communications and have studied the technology for more than a decade, but it has gone largely unused. Some in Congress and at the Federal Communications Commission think it should be opened to other uses.
In 2017, General Motors Co (N:GM) began offering vehicle-to-vehicle technologies on its Cadillac CTS model, but it is currently the only commercially available vehicle with the system.Talking vehicles, which have been tested in pilot projects and by U.S. carmakers for more than a decade, use dedicated short-range communications to transmit data up to 300 meters, including location, direction and speed, to nearby vehicles.
The data is broadcast up to 10 times per second to nearby vehicles, which can identify risks and provide warnings to avoid imminent crashes, especially at intersections.
Toyota has deployed the technology in Japan to more than 100,000 vehicles since 2015.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last year the regulation could eventually cost between $135 and $300 per new vehicle, or up to $5 billion annually but could prevent up to 600,000 crashes and reduce costs by $71 billion annually when fully deployed.
NHTSA said last year it has ""not made any final decision"" on requiring the technology, but no decision is expected before December.

Last year, major automakers, state regulators and others urged U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to finalize standards for the technology and protect the spectrum that has been reserved, saying there is a need to expand deployment and uses of the traffic safety technology.

Stocks of drug distributors McKesson (N:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (N:ABC) and  Cardinal Health  (N:CAH) rose 2 to 3 percent, while drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA) and CVS Health (N:CVS) each advanced about 5 percent.
Healthcare investors expect Amazon (O:AMZN) will become a major force in the industry, fueled by recent media reports that the Seattle-based company was considering entering the pharmacy business.
CNBC, which reported Amazon's plans on Monday, said the change comes partly because the e-commerce company had not been able to convince big hospitals to change their traditional purchasing process.
The company, through its Amazon Business unit, will instead focus on selling less sensitive medical supplies to hospitals and smaller clinics, CNBC said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Amazon told Reuters it does not comment on rumors or speculation.
""After months of hype and fear it appears now that Amazon's entry into the drug distribution space has been indefinitely delayed,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken. Amazon is likely to remain focused on selling dental and medical products, he added.
The presence of established drug suppliers, along with difficulties in distributing highly regulated treatments, likely deterred the technology giant from entering the industry, analysts said.
""Even with Amazon's large war-chest, it is still a difficult prospect given the dynamics of the whole pharmaceutical market,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekhraj said.

In January, Amazon,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) unveiled plans to form a company to cut healthcare costs for hundreds of thousands of employees.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","PSA, German union in standoff over Opel's Eisenach plant","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The future of Opel's Eisenach factory in Germany hung in the balance on Monday after shop stewards rejected wage concessions demanded by Opel owner PSA Group (PA:PEUP) in exchange for a commitment to invest in a production line for a new model there.
The carmaker's management met on Friday with the works council and labor union IG Metall to discuss proposals from French carmaker PSA after German sites were excluded from a sweeping investment plan.
PSA completed a $2.6 billion takeover of Opel last year as General Motors (N:GM) sold off its loss-making European operations, but CEO Carlos Tavares has been frustrated in his bid to cut high production costs.
Both sides exchanged blames of not presenting solid bids.
""This is very disappointing,"" Opel's new Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said in a letter to staff.
Lohscheller said labor representatives did not offer any concrete proposal on how to reach productivity targets at the Eisenach plant, one of its three main German sites, which employs 1,800 workers.
The labor side rejected management's demand for wage concessions such as delaying the 4.3 percent pay rise agreed in collective bargaining for the industry, due at the end of April.
""Contracts must be observed and we demand that from Opel as well,"" Joerg Koehlinger, an IG Metall regional director said in a statement on Monday .
The failed talks on Friday prompted PSA to put a decision on hold to produce a new ""electrifiable"" vehicle at Eisenach plant, Lohscheller said. A person familiar with the matter identified the planned vehicle as the Grandland SUV model. 

""Unfortunately, the conditions for investment approval were not completely met because last Friday's meeting with our social partners did not deliver the required outcome,"" Lohscheller said, adding that both parties agreed to continue the talks.

Peugeot parent company PSA bought Opel and Vauxhall last year when it acquired General Motors’ loss-making European arm and has been pursuing a restructuring plan to return it to profitability.
Vauxhall's new boss Stephen Norman is tasked with turning around falling sales in what has traditionally been Opel-Vauxhall's biggest market, where demand fell 22 percent in 2017, compared with an overall market decline of 5.7 percent. 
""The requirements of the industry going forward and the requirements of the brands Opel and Vauxhall ... would not require as many retail outlets as the brands currently have,"" Norman told reporters. 
Consumers are increasingly going online rather than making multiple visits to showrooms. 
The chief executive of a dealership group, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters last month that Vauxhall wants to cut its showrooms by roughly a third to around 200 outlets to ensure its sales per outlet are ""in a good place"".

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Schlumberger fights to boost patent damages at U.S. Supreme Court,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday appeared divided over whether to make it easier for companies to recoup profits lost due to the unauthorized use of their patented technology overseas in a dispute involving Schlumberger NV (N:SLB), the world's largest oilfield services provider.
The nine justices heard about an hour of arguments that will resolve the amount of money that rival ION Geophysical Corp (N:IO) must pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps search for oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. Both companies are based in Houston.
Some justices, including conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, expressed concerns about applying U.S. patent laws abroad, while others indicated that Schlumberger should be fully compensated. 
Schlumberger is appealing a lower court ruling that barred it from recovering $93.4 million in lost profits stemming from foreign contracts the company said it missed out on as a result of the infringement. 
Schlumberger said federal patent law protects against infringement that occurs when components of a patented invention are supplied from the United States for assembly abroad, and so it should be fully compensated for its lost foreign sales. 
Gorsuch and Breyer expressed skepticism about imposing damages based on the use of the technology by ION's overseas customers. Breyer said if other countries did the same it could pose problems for U.S. companies as well. 
""I see chaos or confusion,"" Breyer said. 
Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy, as well as liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, signaled sympathy for Schlumberger. 
Kennedy told ION's attorney Kannon Shanmugam that the company's position would confine patent owners in how they use their own patents and mean they would not be fully compensated for infringement. Shanmugam said that U.S. patent laws have a ""presumption against extraterritoriality.""
A decision in Schlumberger's favor would expand the ability of patent owners to recover foreign-based damages, increasing the threat posed by certain infringement suits in the United States.
Schlumberger said that the lower court ruling harms innovation by allowing companies to infringe competitors' patents while risking minimal punishment. 
Other observers, including a group representing internet-based companies, said the opposite is true because extending patent damages beyond national borders would expose U.S. high-technology firms to greater patent-related risks overseas. 
The case involves four patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations.
ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts. The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties as well as the $93.4 million in lost profits.
In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent disputes, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion, saying U.S. patent law does not apply outside the country.
President Donald Trump's administration backed Schlumberger, and urged the justices to overturn the lower court ruling, which it said ""systematically undercompensates"" U.S. patent owners who participate in cross-border commerce.

The justices are due to issue their ruling by the end of June.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 01:48PM ET</span>",Starbucks CEO says arrests of two black men 'reprehensible',"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) Chief Executive Kevin Johnson hopes to meet with the two black men arrested at one of its Philadelphia cafes last week to apologize for the incident, which has sparked accusations of racial profiling at the coffee chain.
The men, who had not made a purchase, were handcuffed and arrested for trespassing on Thursday after a store manager called 911 and reported them for refusing to leave. Witnesses said the men were calmly sitting in the cafe and in a widely viewed video, some patrons asked police whether they were targeted because they are black. 
Police released the men, who were not charged.
""The circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome in our store on Thursday were reprehensible ... they were wrong,"" Johnson told ABC's Good Morning America on Monday, amid protests and calls for a boycott on social media.
The incident came at a time when the company is grappling with flat traffic and lackluster sales growth at its more than 14,000 U.S. cafes. It is a high-profile public relations test for Johnson, a former technology executive who took the helm at Starbucks roughly a year ago.
Johnson, who was interviewed from Philadelphia, said it was ""completely inappropriate to engage the police."" He said a disciplinary review was under way and added that Starbucks would conduct training to prevent unconscious bias.
In a ""mutual"" decision, the manager who reported the men to police has left the company, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 
Representatives from Starbucks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the two men could not immediately be reached.
Protesters crowded the store that was the scene of the arrest on Monday morning. It was closed at around midday. More protests and a company news conference were expected in the afternoon. 

The Reverend Mark Tyler, part of an interfaith group organizing a protest on Monday afternoon, said he had not heard reports of similar issues at other area Starbucks. Still, he said, ""the idea of black people being unwanted in downtown Philadelphia is not new ... this is the underbelly of gentrification.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking compensation from the United States for U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum, despite Washington's assertion that they are not subject to World Trade Organization rules, a WTO filing showed on Monday.
In a step already taken by China, the EU said it did not accept the ""national security"" justification for the U.S. tariffs but said they had been imposed just to protect U.S. industry. 
""Notwithstanding the United States' characterization of these measures as security measures, they are in essence safeguard measures,"" the EU statement said.
Safeguard tariffs can be imposed on imports of a particular product if a country's own industry is at risk of serious damage from a sudden surge of imports. In the U.S. case, critics of Trump's policy say there is no such threat.
The EU said it wanted to hold consultations with the United States as soon as possible. 
U.S. President Donald Trump announced the tariffs last month, causing a global outcry because the penalties were seen as unjustified and populist.
Countries can claim exemption from many international trade rules if they can show they are imposing tariffs to protect their national security. But those exemptions do not apply for safeguard sanctions. 
The EU and other U.S. allies are not only worried the tariffs will limit that amount of their goods getting into the United States. They also fear steel barred from the United States will flood back into their markets, causing a glut.
China had said it will retaliate by putting duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fruit, nuts and wine.

The EU is drawing up its own list of duties.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Google unveils vetting process for drug rehab ads,"By Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google told Reuters Monday it would resume accepting ads from U.S. addiction treatment centers in July, nearly a year after the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) unit suspended the lucrative category of advertisers for numerous deceptive and misleading ads.
Treatment centers now will be able to run ads after being vetted by Portland, Ore. firm LegitScript, Google said. 
Interest in treatment for abuse of opioids and other prescription drugs has soared in recent years amid what authorities have described as a nationwide epidemic.
Scammers found that Google ads were an easy way to defraud treatment-seekers in an industry in which regulations vary greatly by jurisdiction, authorities and patient advocacy organizations have said.
Google suspended alcohol and drug treatment advertising on search pages and millions of third-party apps and websites in the U.S. in September, the week after tech publication The Verge posted a lengthy story about scams. Google expanded the prohibition globally in January.
The move cut off at least $78 million annually worth of advertising in the U.S. alone, research firm Kantar Media estimated. 
Most advertisers can buy ads through Google with few hurdles to clear. But Google has adopted additional vetting for locksmiths, garage-door repairers, drug makers and online pharmacies following public pressure. Google has said it also will begin seeking more documentation from political advertisers this year.
The addiction treatment rules apply to in-person facilities, crisis hotlines and support groups. 
LegitScript will evaluate treatment providers beginning Monday on 15 criteria, including criminal background checks and license and insurance verification. They must also provide ""written policies and procedures demonstrating a commitment to best practices, effective recovery and continuous improvement,"" according to LegitScript, which will charge $995 upfront and then $1,995 annually for vetting.
The National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers and the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse support the standards, John Horton, chief executive of LegitScript, said in an interview last week.
A vetting process for sober-living houses and non-U.S. treatment centers has yet to be set, he said.
Horton acknowledged the ""extra step"" may frustrate rehab centers.
""It's unfortunate, but this is one way the market gets cleaner and people get the help they deserve,"" he said. 
Marcia Lee Taylor, chief policy officer of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, to whom Google has donated advertising space, said earlier efforts to certify treatment services have failed because there was no ""business incentive to answer all these invasive questions.""
Tying access to the world's biggest online advertising system to certification makes applying worthwhile, Taylor said.

The new rules do not affect free business listings on Google Maps, which also have been susceptible to fraud. Google said it is continuously developing ways to combat Maps spammers.

Shares of Dean Foods Company (NYSE:DF), the largest U.S. bottler, fell as much as 8.9 percent to a six-year low after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the stock. Weakening sales volume may limit the benefits of cheaper milk costs, analyst Judy Hong said Monday.
Americans are turning away from milk amid a wealth of other beverage options and as non-dairy substitutes like almond and oat milk gain popularity. In March, a gallon of whole milk fell to about $2.90 at U.S. grocery stores, the cheapest in 14 years, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dean Foods earlier this year unveiled a cost-cutting initiative and has planned to end supply contracts with some farmers as the processing sector gets more competitive. Retail chain Food Lion is also ending a contract with Dean.
“Industry fundamentals remain challenging,” Hong said in the report, adding that consolidation in the retail industry and lower pricing for private-label brands are adding pressure for the company.
A Dean Foods spokesperson didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",VW's trucks division open to buying majority of Navistar,"By Andreas Cremer
MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is open to buying a majority stake in U.S. truckmaker Navistar ""at some point,"" it said on Monday, as the German automaker prepares its trucks business for a possible stock market listing that could help raise funds to expand. 
Volkswagen Truck & Bus acquired a 16.9 percent stake in  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV) in 2016 and last week joined forces with Toyota's (T:7203) Hino Motors as it strives to compete more effectively with global truck market leaders  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo (ST:VOLVb).
Volkswagen (VW) plans to convert its trucks division, which includes the Scania and MAN brands and a Brazil-based commercial vehicles business, into a public limited company as a prelude to a potential stock market listing.
""(Taking over Navistar) would make sense at some point,"" Matthias Gruendler, the finance chief of VW truck and bus, told reporters on Monday. 
A takeover would require between 3 and 4 billion in extra costs and could be shouldered without proceeds from a possible initial public offering (IPO), he said, without specifying whether he was talking about euros or dollars.
""The cooperation (with Navistar) is working really well,"" he added.
U.S. law would require VW to issue a formal takeover bid for Navistar if the German manufacturer raises its stake in the U.S. company above 17 percent, Gruendler said. 
VW paid $256 million for its stake in Navistar, bolstering Europe's biggest automaker's access to the lucrative North American truck market. 
VW's trucks unit had ""significant"" synergies from joint procurement with Navistar last year, division CEO Andreas Renschler said.
Foreign expansion, as well as more joint development and purchasing of parts between MAN and Scania, may help VW's truck and bus operations increase their operating margin to 9 percent by about 2025 from 6.9 percent last year, Renschler added.
VW group's supervisory board last Thursday paved the way for a potential IPO of its trucks business as part of a sweeping shake-up that also included naming a new group CEO and plans to streamline its multiple car brands.
Renschler said preparations to tap capital markets either through an IPO or selling debt would take 12 months, adding MAN's (DE:MANG) Diesel & Turbo engine unit and transmissions maker Renk would be switched to VW.

""We need a lot of investment and funding,"" Renschler said. ""We are lifting the (trucks) group to the next level.""

The Charlotte-based bank said it earned an adjusted $0.62 per share on revenue of $23.2 billion in the first quarter. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected earnings of $0.59 and revenue of $23 billion.
""Our responsible growth model continues to deliver consistent results. Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid U.S. consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings,"" CEO Brian Moynihan  said in a press release. ""We continue to invest in new capabilities in our mobile banking app, the expansion and renovation of our financial centers, and the hiring of additional client relationship professionals. We believe these investments, and our focus on operational excellence, will drive sustainable growth over time.”
Consumer banking led the way for the US's third-largest bank by assets, with average deposits rising 3% to an all-time high of $1.3 trillion.
The bank also said its effective tax rate dropped by 9 percentage points, thanks to the newly enacted tax law.

1079,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:57AM ET</span>",GOLDMAN SACHS: Tech stocks face a looming risk besides regulation that would make them less appealing,"Tech investors and analysts were captivated last week as  Mark Zuckerberg faced two days of grilling on Capitol Hill over  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s handling of users' data. 
Their concern was that lawmakers may create new regulations that threaten Facebook and its competitors' growth. 
At a Goldman Sachs conference with policy experts during Zuckerberg's testimony, the consensus was that new regulation is unlikely this year, according to David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist. 
However, there's another risk that investors should be watching just as closely, he said. 
 S&P Dow Jones Indices is set to make some changes to the S&P 500 in September. It will take some media and tech stocks and add them to the current Telecommunication Services sector, forming a new one called Communication Services. That's in recognition of the fact that many companies have become more integrated;  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for example, provides internet access through Google Fiber and original media content on YouTube.
""Constituent re-classification represents a second risk to the tech sector,"" Kostin said in a note on Friday. 
He added: ""With two of the largest and fastest-growing companies transitioning out of Information Technology, the sector will lose some of its appeal to growth investors. The future 'legacy' Tech (i.e., firms remaining in the sector) will have much slower expected sales and earnings growth and lower margins than both the current Tech sector and the new Communication Services sector, which will also include Telecom and select Consumer Discretionary stocks (DIS,  NFLX, and others).""
But this change also represents opportunities for stock pickers, who study the fundamentals of each company before making a trading decision.
""Attractive opportunities exist in the future 'legacy' Tech sector, which will have lower earnings growth, lower valuation, higher shareholder yield, and less regulatory risk than the departing firms,"" Kostin said. 
For example, the largest tech stocks in what's remaining of the sector after the upcoming changes will be  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). They each have lower earnings growth but also lower valuations, Kostin said. 
Below is a breakdown of how the changes would affect the largest tech stocks and their current and future sectors."

At 9:33AM ET (13:33GMT), the Dow Jones jumped 193 points, or 0.79%, the S&P 500 gained 16 points, or 0.60%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 38 points, or 0.54%.
Tension over escalating conflict in Syria seemed to fade over the weekend after the U.S., France and UK undertook an airstrike on chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7.
Although Russian President Vladmir Putin warned Sunday that further attacks on Syria could cause “chaos in international relations”, U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration of “mission accomplished” led market participants to interpret that no immediate military escalation would be forthcoming.
With caution over geopolitical tensions in the background, traders were set for a big week of first quarter earnings including a handful of Dow components and dozens of S&P 500 firms.
Earnings growth is expected to be up about 18.5%, according to Thomson Reuters data, the highest in seven years, as results are likely to have been boosted by President Trump's tax cuts.
As earnings season begins to rev it engines, the first 30 S&P firms to report last week clocked profit of growth of 26.8%, according to The Earnings Scout.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) appeared to follow the trend as the second largest U.S. bank by assets reported a 34% increase in profit, topping consensus on both the top and bottom line. Shares were last up 0.8%.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is scheduled to release its own quarterly numbers after the market close.
Among major firms reporting this week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) will post results on Tuesday.
On Wednesday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) report earnings.
Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) are on the docket Thursday.
Finally, corporate results from Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) round up the week on Friday.
Among Monday’s economic data, retail sales climbed 0.6% in March, beating expectations for a 0.4% rise, but the NY Empire State manufacturing index fell to 15.8 in April, missing calls for smaller drop to 18.80 from the prior 22.5.
Still ahead on Monday, February business inventories and the NAHB housing market index for April will both be released at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).
Markets will also pay attention to appearances from Federal Reserve policymakers Robert Kaplan, Neel Kashkari and Raphael Bostic as they look for hints on the path of interest rates.
Fed fund futures price in the odds of the next hike for the June meeting at 90%, while Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool shows the probability of a third hike in December at around 84%.
Ahead of the rest of Monday’s data and Fed appearances, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.45% to 89.11 by 9:34AM ET (13:34GMT), while gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged up 0.15% to $1,349.90.
Elsewhere, Europe’s major bourses were slightly lower. However, London’s FTSE 100 was down around 0.5% with the index plagued by losses in commodities and a stronger pound.
Oil prices sank around 1% on Monday after having gained 8% last week. Traders opted to take profit after Baker Hughes’ data released late Friday showed that U.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to April 13, bringing the total count to 815, the highest number since March 2015. The data underscored worries that rising U.S. output could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn on Monday nominated a five-person slate of his employees and business associates to replace the  SandRidge Energy  Inc (N:SD) board of directors, escalating his fight for control of the U.S. shale oil producer.
The move sets up a showdown at SandRidge's annual meeting later this year between the existing board and the hard-driving investor who has been trying to force the company to sell itself outright to either himself or another potential bidder.
Icahn has spent recent months blasting SandRidge's leadership, at one point accusing it of an apparent ""disregard for any semblance of accountability.""
He has successfully scuttled SandRidge's planned buyout of rival  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  (N:BCEI) and forced the removal of the company's chief executive and finance chief.
Now, Icahn has set his sights on the company's board. 
A SandRidge spokesperson said the company will be reviewing Icahn's proposed candidates and declined further comment. 
Icahn, who waited until a Monday deadline to nominate his slate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares of Oklahoma City-based SandRidge, which produces oil in Oklahoma and Colorado, were off a penny at $14.64 in afternoon trading on Monday. 
SandRidge's stock has lost nearly a third of its value since January, far below levels where Icahn first amassed his majority stake last fall.
Icahn had telegraphed earlier this month that he was likely to nominate directors. He has said he is willing to make an all-cash offer to buy the company.
SandRidge has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting. The 2017 meeting was held in June. Most companies hold their annual meetings at the same time each year.
NOMINEES 
Icahn's slate includes current employees and employees or board members of companies he has controlled.
Icahn, who owns about 13.5 percent of SandRidge's float, nominated Jonathan Frates and Nicholas Graziano, both of whom work for the investor's companies. 
The other three nominees are John Lipinski and Bob Alexander who have worked with refining company  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), which is majority owned by Icahn, and Randolph Read, who has worked with investment fund Nevada Strategic Credit Investment.

Icahn has not always been successful in agitating for change at energy companies. In 2016, his hand-picked director at Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) resigned in what was widely seen as a tacit admission that the investor's turnaround strategy was not working fast enough.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce has banned American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years after breaking an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran, U.S. officials said on Monday.
The U.S. action, first reported by Reuters (https://reut.rs/2H3p0Vl), could be devastating to ZTE since American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.
The ban is the result of ZTE's failure to comply with an agreement with the U.S. government after it pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Texas to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran, the Commerce Department said. 
The Chinese company, which sells smartphones in the United States, paid $890 million in fines and penalties, with an additional penalty of $300 million that could be imposed.
""If the company is not able to resolve it, they may very well be put out of business by this. Many banks and companies even outside the U.S. are not going to want to deal with them,"" said Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce who was heavily involved in the case. 
As part of the agreement, Shenzhen-based ZTE Corp promised to dismiss four senior employees and discipline 35 others by either reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them, senior Commerce Department officials told Reuters. But the Chinese company admitted in March that while it had fired the four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to the 35 others.
ZTE officials did not respond to requests for comment. The Commerce Department order quoted a ZTE official's letter admitting it ""had not executed in full"" some disciplinary measures and that there were ""inaccuracies"" in a 2017 letter. But, the Commerce order said, ZTE ""argued that it would have been irrational for ZTE to knowingly or intentionally mislead the U.S. government in light of the seriousness of the suspended sanctions.""
Under terms of the ban, U.S. companies cannot export prohibited goods, such as chip sets, directly to ZTE or via another country, beginning immediately.
Shares of big U.S. ZTE suppliers fell sharply on the Commerce ban. Optical networking equipment maker Acacia Communications Inc, which got 30 percent of its total 2017 revenue from ZTE, tumbled 35 percent, hitting a near two-year low. Acacia said it was suspending affected transactions and assessing the impact.
Shares of optical component companies including Lumentum Holdings Inc fell 8.9 percent and Finisar Corp dropped 4.0 percent. Oclaro Inc, which got 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, lost 14.1 percent.
ZTE ""provided information back to us basically admitting that they had made these false statements,"" said a senior department official. ""That was in response to the U.S. asking for the information.""
The ban on supplying ZTE comes two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or its Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.
""China does not play by our rules, and we must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security,"" said Republican Representative Robert Pittenger after the Commerce announcement. Pittenger is sponsoring legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investments.
Meanwhile, Britain's main cyber security agency said on Monday it has written to organizations in the UK's telecommunications sector warning about using services or equipment from ZTE.
'DEVASTATING'
Douglas Jacobson, an exports control lawyer who represents suppliers to ZTE, called the ban highly unusual and said it would severely affect the company. 
“This will be devastating to the company, given their reliance on U.S. products and software,” said Jacobson. “It’s certainly going to make it very difficult for them to produce and will have a potentially significant short- and long-term negative impact on the company.”
ZTE has sold handset devices to U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. It has relied on U.S. companies including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) for some components.
Shares of Taiwan's MediaTek Inc, which sells smartphone chips and competes with Qualcomm, were not trading when the announcement was made.
The U.S. action against ZTE is likely to further exacerbate current tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade. After the U.S. placed export restrictions on ZTE in 2016 for Iran sanctions violations, China’s Ministry of Commerce and Foreign Ministry criticized the decision.
A five-year federal investigation found last year that ZTE had conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran.
ZTE, which devised elaborate schemes to hide the illegal activity, agreed to plead guilty after the Commerce Department took actions that threatened to cut off its global supply chain. 
The U.S. government had allowed the company continued access to the U.S. market under the 2017 agreement. 
The new restrictions stem from a Jan. 16 report by a U.S. monitor appointed by a federal judge in Texas who accepted the guilty plea in March 2017. Although Commerce Department officials would not discuss the report, they said the department followed up in February. 
The U.S. government’s investigation into sanctions violations by ZTE followed reports by Reuters in 2012 https://reut.rs/2H3p0Vl that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars’ worth of hardware and software from some of the best known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is cashing out of casino business Tropicana Entertainment (PK:TPCA) in a $1.85 billion deal that will see Eldorado Resorts (O:ERI) picking up Tropicana's casino operations including its crown jewel in Atlantic City.
Under the deal announced on Monday, six of the eight casino properties run by Tropicana will be sold by  Icahn Enterprises  LP (O:IEP) to real estate investment trust Gaming and Leisure Properties (O:GLPI) for $1.21 billion.
The casino operations will be taken over by Eldorado, which will pay the remaining $640 million and lease the properties from GLPI for an initial 15-year period.
Eldorado's shares jumped as much as 21 percent to an all-time high of $43.15, while those of Gaming and Leisure Properties were up 4.7 percent at $34.85.
""(Tropicana Entertainment's) assets are in very good shape. Tropicana Atlantic City, Lumiere and Evansville - all stand out as top notch assets,"" Union Gaming Research analyst John DeCree said.
The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. gambling sector in recent years as companies expand their reach, diversify their businesses and take advantage of recent legalization of gaming in some states.
""We did not foresee any need for near-term capital investments of any scale across the properties,"" Eldorado Chief Executive Officer Gary Carano said.
The addition of Tropicana's ""high quality"" assets will allow Eldorado to save about $40 million in the first year following the close of the deal later in 2018.
This is Icahn's second major sale in as many weeks. Last week, he agreed to sell auto parts maker Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Inc (N:TEN) in a $5.4 billion deal, unloading an investment he has held for nearly two decades.
Icahn Enterprises said in its statement that the deal did not include Tropicana's Aruba casino and resort in the Caribbean, which would be sold separately as a condition of closing the deal.
Reno-based Eldorado owns and operates twenty properties in 10 U.S. states, including Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

The company, which bought Isle of Capri Casinos in a $1.7 billion deal in 2017, on Monday also agreed to acquire Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin, Illinois for $327.5 million in cash.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Investor Gatemore pushes for break-up of logistics firm Wincanton,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Gatemore Capital Management has built a stake in Wincanton and called on the British logistics company to break itself up by selling one of its two divisions, according to a letter sent by Gatemore to its own investors.
The asset management firm, which often pursues activist campaigns at companies where it has bought shares, said in the letter it had built a 2 percent stake in Wincanton. 
Gatemore believes the company, which has a market capitalization of about 284 million pounds ($406 million), is ""a sleeping giant whose intrinsic value is underestimated by the market,"" according to the investor letter seen by Reuters.
Wincanton traces its roots back to 1925, when it started as a milk distribution business, and has since grown into a haulage and warehousing company with a fleet of about 3,600 vehicles. 
It is organized into two main divisions, a retail business that supplies grocers and general retailers, and a construction and transport business that handles industrial products such as bricks and fuel. 
The firm's retirement scheme had a deficit of 69.3 million pounds at the end of September, a shortfall that a division sale would help to resolve, according to Gatemore. 
""We have engaged in constructive discussions with Wincanton's management and, in private, are calling for the company to conduct a strategic review, sell one of its two divisions, fund the pension, and refocus the business,"" Liad Meidar, Gatemore's managing partner, wrote in the letter.
""In due course, we will discuss our ideas with other large shareholders and seek their support in promoting productive change in the company.""
A spokesman for Wincanton said the company was aware of the letter and would respond directly to Gatemore. Wincanton shares were up 2.2 percent at 233 pence on Monday afternoon.
Gatemore is familiar with the British logistics market, having built a 24 percent stake in courier and logistics business DX Group, overhauled its board, and helped the firm with financing.
Its proposal for Wincanton comes amid a rise in activist investment in Britain, aimed at boosting returns for shareholders. 
Recent campaigns include a push by U.S. hedge funds Elliott and Sachem Head for leisure company  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) to split its Costa coffee shop chain from its Premier Inn hotels business, and an unsuccessful attempt by Sandell Asset Management to force supermarket giant  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) to lift its takeover offer for wholesaler Booker.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 07:37AM ET</span>",China tariffs on U.S. business jets no clear boost to rivals: aviation executives,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's planned tariffs on U.S. business jets may do little to buoy rivals despite concerns the moves could create an unequal playing field in the fast-growing China market, aviation executives said in Shanghai on Monday.
China earlier this month announced retaliatory tariffs against key U.S. imports, among which is a proposed 25 percent tariff on U.S. aircraft with an ""empty weight"" of between 15,000 kilograms and 45,000 kilograms.
The growing trade spat between Beijing and Washington creates a potential threat to U.S. plane makers including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Gulfstream, which could see prices of some planes rise. European rivals, however, said it wasn't so clear-cut.
""You have many other parameters that lead to a sale. Price is one of them, but not the only one,"" said Carlos Brana, senior vice president of civil aircraft at Dassault Aviation.
The category impacted by the potential tariffs would include General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Corp's popular Gulfstream G550 and G650s and the larger Boeing Business Jet 1 that competes against models from European rival Airbus SE. 
""Our view is that trade war benefits nobody,"" said David Velupillai, marketing director at Airbus Corporate Jets at a press conference on Monday ahead of the Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition in Shanghai.
Thanks to demand from China's newly minted billionaires and globally minded state-owned enterprises, the growth of its business jet fleet has outpaced that of other countries in the region, making it a key target market for private jet makers. 
At the end of 2017, there were 1,179 jets in the Asia Pacific region, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, according to a report published by aviation consultancy Asian Sky Group on Monday. The largest market is China, which has 339 planes. 
Canada's Bombardier Inc, Gulfstream and Textron (NYSE:TXT) Inc's Cessna are currently the top three manufacturers in the region, respectively holding a 26 percent, 25 percent and 19 percent share of the fleet, the report added. 
Gulfstream's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales, Scott Neal, told Reuters the company had already raised its concerns about the potential tariffs with industry organizations but that it would be premature to talk about any impact. 
Boeing declined to comment on the issue when asked about it at a media briefing, referring to a statement earlier this month in which it said nothing drastic had happened yet.
Khader Mattar, Bombardier's vice president of sales for the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and China, told Reuters there was no sign the proposed tariffs was impacting sentiment for the Canadian manufacturer's business aircraft.

""But we will keep monitoring the situation and we will act accordingly,"" he said.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 09:19AM ET</span>","BofA profit beats estimates on higher interest rates, loan growth","By Sweta Singh and Elizabeth Dilts
(Reuters) - Bank of America (N:BAC) reported a 34 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Monday, topping Wall Street estimates, as the lender benefited from higher interest rates and growth in loans and deposits.
Revenue rose at three of BofA's four major businesses. In consumer banking, its biggest business, revenue increased 9 percent as higher interest rates helped BofA charge more for loans while keeping deposit rates low.
Profit also got a boost from Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan's efforts to cut costs as well as lower tax expenses following President Donald Trump's sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code.
Shares of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets rose 1 percent in premarket trading. They have gained 33 percent in the past 12 months, but fell about 3 percent along with other U.S. banks on Friday.
""Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid U.S. consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings,"" Moynihan said in a statement.
BofA's net interest income rose 5 percent in the first quarter, pushing total revenue up 4 percent to $23.28 billion. The lender relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.
Total loans and leases rose 3 percent, while total deposits increased 4.4 percent.
The only business to record a fall in revenue was global banking, hurt by lower investment banking fees.
Non-interest expenses declined 1 percent, while income tax expenses fell about 26 percent.
The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of revenue divided by expenses, was 60 percent in the first quarter, down from 63 percent a year earlier. A low ratio indicates a bank is more efficient.
Jefferies analysts said BofA results looked best among peers that have reported so far.
The bank, however, underperformed in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading because of a decline in bond issuance from corporations, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with journalists. Less bond issuance can, in turn, affect credit trading in secondary markets.
Trading revenue was up only 1 percent. Equities trading revenue, excluding items, rose 38 percent, while revenue from trading fixed income fell 13 percent.
BofA's trading results mirrored those of rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C). Revenue from stock trading rose at both the banks, but weakness in bond trading crimped total trading revenue growth.
Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $6.49 billion from $4.84 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 62 cents, beating the average analyst estimate of 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The blue-chip Dow futures gained 143 points, or 0.59%, by 6:51AM ET (10:51GMT), the S&P 500 futures rose 15 points, or 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 40 points, or 0.61%
Tension over escalating conflict in Syria seemed to fade over the weekend after the U.S., France and UK undertook an airstrike on chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7.
Although Russian President Vladmir Putin warned Sunday that further attacks on Syria could cause “chaos in international relations”, U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration of “mission accomplished” led market participants to interpret that no immediate military escalation would be forthcoming.
With caution over geopolitical tensions in the background, traders were set for a big week of first quarter earnings including a handful of Dow components and dozens of S&P 500 firms.
Earnings growth is expected to be up about 18.5%, according to Thomson Reuters data, the highest in seven years, as results are likely to have been boosted by President Trump's tax cuts.
For Monday’s session, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) saw shares gain about 0.4% in pre-market trade after the firm reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.62 on revenue of $23.27 billion. That compared to forecasts for $0.59 and $23.06, respectively.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is scheduled to release its own quarterly numbers after the market close.
On the data front, investors will digest March retail sales and the NY Empire State manufacturing index for April at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT), followed by February business inventories and the NAHB housing market index for April at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT).

Fed fund futures price in the odds of the next hike for the June meeting at 90%, while Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool shows the probability of a third hike in December at around 84%.
Ahead of the data releases and Fed appearances, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.27% to 89.27 by 6:52AM ET (10:52GMT), while gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged down 0.13% to $1,346.10.
Elsewhere, Europe’s major bourses were little changed. However, London’s FTSE 100 was down around 0.4% with the index plagued by losses in commodities and a stronger pound.
Earlier, in Asia, most markets in the region closed lower, led by declines in Hong Kong and mainland China over worries about the Hong Kong dollar.
Oil prices sank around 1% on Monday after having gained 8% last week. Traders opted to take profit after Baker Hughes’ data released late Friday showed that U.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to April 13, bringing the total count to 815, the highest number since March 2015. The data underscored worries that rising U.S. output could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut."

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Domino's unveils pizza delivery 'hotspots' as competition rages,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) is ramping up the food delivery wars, adding online ordering for more than 150,000 new delivery ""hotspots"" at U.S. parks, beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses.
Executives say the move opens new sales opportunities for the company, a pioneer and dominant player in restaurant delivery, as traditional eateries and supermarkets face pressure from third-party delivery ""disruptors"" that are flush with venture capital or subject to less stringent expectations when it comes to profits. 
""We know that delivery is all about convenience, and Domino's Hotspots are ... all about flexible delivery options,"" said Russell Weiner, president of Domino's USA. 
While customers previously could ask Domino's to deliver to offbeat locations, the initiative establishes set drop-off points that customers can find with the location services on their smartphones. 
This will help customers order via Dominos.com and the chain's mobile app, said Dennis Maloney, the chain's chief digital officer. Such orders previously were only available by telephone. 
Customers pre-pay the orders, select a location from a menu and have the option to add instructions to help drivers identify them. Domino's texts them order status updates, including estimated arrival times. Customers also supply mobile phone numbers in the event of a hiccup, he said.
Despite the company's name for them, the locations are not wifi hotspots. 
Domino's declined to disclose costs related to the project and said it had no immediate plans to hire additional drivers. Roughly 60 percent of its orders are digital and Domino's delivers around 65 percent of overall orders.
U.S. sales from third-party restaurant and grocery delivery services are forecast to nearly double within five years, significantly outpacing growth in the U.S. food industry overall.
Strategy firm Pentallect Inc expects the third-party food delivery industry's sales to grow from $13 billion in 2017 to $24.5 billion by 2022. The firm say the industry has a 13.5 percent annual growth rate, versus the 3 percent rate for the U.S. food industry overall. 
Restaurant delivery companies GrubHub Inc (N:GRUB), UberEats and DoorDash, the latter of which has raised funding totaling $722 million, are in a fierce battle to win the segment that was once the domain of national pizza chains like Domino's, Papa John's (O:PZZA) and Yum Brands' (N:YUM) Pizza Hut.
At the same time, Whole Foods owner Amazon.com (O:AMZN),  Target  Corp-owned (N:TGT) Shipt and Instacart, which has raised about $1 billion, are shaking up the grocery industry with home delivery. 
While venture capital firms and deep-pocketed retailers invest heavily in third-party delivery, many restaurant operators are weighing whether it is best to work with outside delivery providers who take a percentage of sales, often 15 to 30 percent, or to spend the money to do it themselves. 
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) is partnering with UberEats for delivery in the United States, even though its stores in China and elsewhere dispatch their own delivery drivers - often on scooters. 
Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) Co, which has spent about $150 million on technology that underpins delivery and other services, has built its own U.S. delivery service. It hired 10,000 drivers in 2017 and is on track to do the same this year. 
Restaurants lose margin ""every time you have more hands in your pocket,"" Panera CEO Blaine Hurst said, referring to third-party services. 
Nevertheless, the chain continues to experiment with third-party delivery companies as it looks for better, more efficient ways to provide the service, Hurst said. 

Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands, took a different tack earlier this year, spending $200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in GrubHub.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 05:28AM ET</span>",AirAsia X won't buy 'too expensive' Airbus A350: co-group CEO,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia's  AirAsia X Bhd  (KL:AIRX) has no plans to buy the Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350 widebody jet, the airline's co-group CEO said on Monday, despite the airline having 10 of them on order.
""The A350 is not an aircraft we will buy,"" AirAsia X co-group CEO Tony Fernandes said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live chat from London. ""Too expensive. Fares would go up.""
AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), placed a firm order for 10 A350s in June 2009. It later ordered 66 A330neos, an updated version of the A330s it has in its current fleet. 
The A350-900 has a longer range but also comes with a higher list price of $317.4 million, compared with the $296.4 million price of the A330-900neo. Airlines typically receive large discounts from the list prices.
Manufacturers sometimes allow airlines to swap models even though they have placed firm orders and paid deposits, meaning AirAsia X might be able to convert the A350 order to other Airbus jets like the A330neo or A320 family.
The AirAsia group is one of Airbus' largest customers, but AirAsia X has also been talking to  Boeing Co  (N:BA) about buying the rival 787-10 jet, according to a source familiar with the discussions. 
A final decision on AirAsia X's future fleet is expected later this year, the source said on condition of anonymity. The 787-10 has a list price of $325.8 million.

A spokeswoman for the AirAsia group said it was unable to comment on the fate of the A350 orders or whether the airline was in talks with Boeing about the 787-10.

The company, which builds nearly one in three of Britain's 1.7 million cars, will lay off some of its agency workers at its central English Solihull site and move just over 360 people to the location from its nearby Castle Bromwich plant. 
""We are not renewing the contracts of 1,000 agency workers at Solihull,"" a spokesman told Reuters. 
Jaguar sales are down 26 percent so far this year whilst Land Rover demand dropped 20 percent in its home market as buyers shun diesel. 
About 90 percent of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) sales in Britain are diesel models, which compares with around 45 percent globally.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Monday as investors expected there would be no immediate military escalation in Syria following the weekend's American-led strike.
Trading however remained cautious as tensions between Western powers and Russia persisted and markets braced for new U.S. sanctions on Russia over its continued support of Syrian President Bashar-al Assad.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 03:34AM ET</span>","Australians getting short-changed for financial advice, inquiry hears","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's four biggest retail banks and wealth manager AMP (AX:AMP) have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to customers for poor advice over the past decade, a major inquiry into the financial sector heard on Monday.
Financial advice came under scrutiny at the start of a fortnight of hearings by the Royal Commission into corporate wrongdoing and abuse of power by Australia's financial sector, which could lead to greater regulation and criminal charges.
Rowena Orr, barrister assisting the independent inquiry, said more than three hundred thousand people had been compensated and the lenders had acknowledged cases of fraud, poor advice and charging for products that were not delivered.
""The financial advice industry has been the subject of considerable scrutiny in recent years. There is good reason for this scrutiny,"" she said.
Over the past decade Australia's four largest banks, AMP and others had paid A$383 million ($297.5 million) in compensation for fees paid for no service or losses caused by bad advice, she added, quoting figures by the corporate watchdog.
The inquiry, which began last month and is scheduled to last a year, is currently focusing on Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC). In coming months, it will turn its attention to large insurers and pension funds.
Orr said the inquiry had been inundated with submissions from members of the public complaining about poor advice or being charged for financial advice, including instances when no adviser was assigned to their accounts.
""Many submissions refer to financial advisers providing advice encouraging Australians to engage in lending they are not capable of servicing over the long term,"" Orr said.
The focus on the advice industry comes after an earlier set of hearings last month revealed the banks had abused their power and routinely breached laws when issuing home loans, credit cards and other consumer loans.
The center-right government agreed to call the inquiry after years of scandals in Australia's financial sector, including interest-rate rigging, accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate insurance payouts, and accusations of money-laundering.
Demand for financial advice in Australia has increased in the last decade, driven by growth in the mandatory A$2.6 trillion savings system, the country's high levels of household debt, and the complex tax laws that apply to aging Australians.
ANZ last year sold its financial planning unit to IOOF Holdings (AX:IFL), while CBA is also seeking to exit the business.
ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac declined to comment while AMP did not respond to requests for comment.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Shire sells cancer drugs to Servier for $2.4 billion as Takeda circles,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Shire, the London-listed rare diseases specialist that is a potential takeover target for Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, is selling its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion.
The deal suggests there is value locked up within Shire's portfolio - despite a dismal share price performance in the past two years - as its management braces for a possible $50-billion bid battle with Japan's biggest drugmaker.
Shire said on Monday it would consider returning proceeds from the sale to shareholders through a buyback and that further selective disposals of non-strategic assets were possible.
The divestment of the cancer business may be a deterrent for Takeda, since oncology was one of the areas it had highlighted as driving the case for a Shire deal, along with gastrointestinal medicine and neuroscience.
Still, given the small contribution of the cancer business to Shire's overall profits,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said this was unlikely to be a deal breaker.
A Takeda spokesman declined to comment. 
Shire was at pains to point out that it started exploring the sale of oncology in December and commenced the disposal process in January, during which it identified multiple possible U.S., European and Japanese buyers. Takeda's interest in Shire was made public only at the end of last month.
Under UK takeover regulations, Takeda has until April 25 to announce whether or not it will bid for Shire, which has a market value of around $47 billion. 
Britain has strict rules about the conduct of bids, including defensive actions taken by target companies. A spokesman said Shire had consulted the UK Takeover Panel on the Servier deal and been told it did not constitute a ""frustrating action"" under the Takeover Code.
EMBEDDED VALUE
Buying Shire would be transformational for Takeda but would be a huge financial stretch, since the company is worth around $10 billion more than the Japanese group. Shire also had debt of around $19 billion as of the end of 2017.
The drugs industry has seen a surge in deal-making this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines, but a Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest yet. 
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said last week that Takeda had sounded out its major creditors for loans to fund a potential Shire bid.
Shire Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said the sale of the oncology business to Servier demonstrated the value embedded in Shire as shares in the company rose 0.8 percent by 1230 GMT.
Jefferies analysts said the sale ""should boost Shire's negotiating position on asking price in the current offer period with Takeda"".
Shire has long been seen as a likely takeover target and was nearly bought by U.S. drugmaker AbbVie in 2014, until U.S. tax rule changes caused it to walk away. 
Shire itself also has a track record of acquisitions, but its biggest ever deal - the $32 billion purchase of Baxalta in 2016 - was widely criticized by shareholders.
Its oncology business had sales of $262 million last year, putting the divestment on a respectable revenue multiple of 9.2 times. 
For privately held Servier, acquiring Shire's oncology operation allows it to establish a direct commercial presence in the United States and boosts its presence in cancer.
Drugs being acquired include the two already marketed products Oncaspar for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and rights outside the United States to Onivyde for pancreatic cancer.

Servier also gets the experimental drug calaspargase pegol for leukemia and an early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors shed safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds while oil prices plummeted on Monday on expectations that the weekend's missile attacks on Syria would not mark the start of greater Western involvement in the conflict there.
European shares were broadly flat, however, adding to a mixed picture in Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution still prevails.
""There is some relief that a direct confrontation between the U.S. and Russia over Syria has been avoided,"" said DZ Bank rate strategist Daniel Lenz, after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that further Western attacks in Syria would bring chaos to world affairs.
Saturday's strikes marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia, which is facing further economic sanctions over its role in the conflict there.
The United States, Britain and France said the missile strikes targeted Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and were not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ""Mission accomplished"" after the attack, underlining expectations that Western action would be limited. 
Gold prices  fell a quarter of a percent to $1,341.51 an ounce while European and U.S. government bond yields -- which move inversely to prices -- rose across the board. 
Yield on both German and U.S. 10-year government bonds, seen as among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were both at their highest level in three weeks. (DE10YT=RR)

MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day and a pan-European stock index (STOXX) was marginally lower. 
U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher opening on Wall Street. (ESc1) 
That market is now focused on U.S. first quarter earnings, especially after February's sell-off and tech sector woes took valuations down to more reasonable levels, said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. 
""If there is a genuine dent in earnings, people will sit up and take notice -- stock and sector-specific issues are becoming important,"" he said. 
He added that regulation will also be a powerful driver for the tech sector -- citing the example of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) -- and for the banking sector. 
EYEING ABE
The dollar failed to hold its early gains on the yen and eased to 107.20 , though that was still up on last week's low around 106.62.
Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012.
Abe's sliding ratings are raising doubts about whether he can win a third three-year term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader in a September vote, or if he might even resign before the party election.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A $117 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and a supplier in favor of a man who said his asbestos-related cancer was caused by long-term use of J&J's Baby Powder could open a new front for thousands of cases claiming the widely-used product caused cancer, legal experts and plaintiffs lawyers said.
J&J has been battling some 6,000 cases claiming its baby powder and Shower to Shower products cause ovarian cancer. The $117 million verdict by a New Jersey jury last week, however, involved a different form of cancer that is clearly linked to asbestos.
Plaintiffs lawyers claim that internal J&J documents seen in that trial show that baby powder had been contaminated with asbestos. They now plan to use the documents in upcoming ovarian cancer trials to allege that the asbestos contamination also caused that form of cancer.
J&J and Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SA, have vowed to appeal the New Jersey verdict and deny asbestos has ever been present in their products or that their talc can cause any form of cancer.
The case of Stephen Lanzo, a New Jersey resident who claimed he developed mesothelioma after using baby powder since his birth in 1972, was the first time a jury saw the internal J&J documents which plaintiffs claim show that J&J knew since the 1970s that the talc in its baby powder was contaminated by asbestos during the mining process.
J&J says the documents present no such evidence, but merely show the company's caution.
Peter Bicks, a lawyer leading J&J's talc asbestos defense, said that in the early 1970s, the company was looking at how it could potentially remove asbestos from talc if the two became intermingled in the mining process. He says no contamination was ever found, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists.
Bicks called the claims of a link between talc and asbestos ""junk science."" 
Mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos, affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities.
While the link between asbestos and mesothelioma is sufficiently established, scientists are divided on whether asbestos exposure can cause ovarian cancer. Some studies have shown an association between the two, while other studies have found no such link.
Elizabeth Burch, holder of the Charles H. Kirbo Chair of Law at the University of Georgia, said it remained an open question whether talc contained asbestos and that each case would turn on the facts. 
But J&J, which had $76.5 billion in sales in 2017, gives the plaintiffs' bar an enticing new target, said Nathan Schachtman, a lecturer at Columbia University who used to defend asbestos cases.
Some 3,000 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year, according to the American Cancer Society, a number that Howard Erichson, a law professor at Fordham University who specializes in mass tort litigation, called significant from a legal standpoint. 
But the roughly 22,000 women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year, according to the National Cancer Institute, provide lawyers with a potentially much larger pool of plaintiffs to tap. 
""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers representing consumers, who said plaintiffs would file thousands of additional mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cases.
New Jersey-based J&J in a statement after the Lanzo verdict said plaintiffs' attorneys had shifted their strategy to focus on asbestos after a series of losses at trial and in court rulings over previous allegations that the talc itself causes cancer.
Of the six ovarian cancer trials to date, juries found J&J liable five times, but a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict and a California judge tossed another. Appeals of the other cases are pending.
J&J in November also won the first trial over allegations that its talc contained asbestos and caused a woman's mesothelioma. Plaintiffs lawyers say the jury in that case did not see the documents presented during the Lanzo trial.
But Erichson said the widespread use of J&J's consumer products generally make the company an attractive litigation target.
""Baby powder is as ubiquitous a product you can think of and there are lots of people who can testify they've been exposed to it,"" he said.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 03:33AM ET</span>",Korean Air 'nut rage' sister apologizes for angry outburst,"By Joyce Lee and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Korean Air Lines' unions have called for the youngest daughter of its chairman, a sister of the infamous 'nut rage' heiress, to step down from management after her alleged abusive behavior against an advertising agency official caused public outrage. 
Cho Hyun-min, also known as Emily Cho and a senior vice president at Korean Air, apologized on Thursday for what she called her ""foolish behavior"" after media reports said she threw water at the face of an advertising agency manager during a recent business meeting.
Korean Air said on Friday, in response to media reports Cho had thrown a water bottle at someone's face, said she had thrown either a water bottle or a cup on the floor, but not at anyone's face. On Monday, the airline said it was a cup. 
Cho, speaking to TV channel MBC after she cut short a vacation overseas and arrived at Incheon International Airport on Sunday, denied she had thrown a cup of water at the manager's face but said she had ""pushed"" it.
She said her action was ""foolish"". 
Cho hired a lawyer from one of South Korea's largest law firms, Shin & Kim, to represent her, an official at the law firm said on Monday, after police launched a preliminary inquiry to see whether Cho had abused her power or broken any law.
Korean Air said on Monday it was aware of the police probe. ""After we observe the outcome of the investigation, the company plans to take appropriate measures,"" the airline said. 
It is the latest controversy to engulf the owner family of South Korea's largest airline group. 
Cho's elder sister Cho Hyun-ah, or Heather Cho, made headlines over a notorious ""nut rage"" incident in 2014, when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in first class before takeoff from New York.
Heather Cho demanded the flight crew chief be expelled from the plane after she was served macadamia nuts in a bag and not on a dish. The South Korea-bound plane had to return to the gate.
Cho was sentenced to one year in jail for violating airline safety laws, but was released after five months. She returned as an executive of Korean Air's hotel affiliate in March. 
Her younger sister's tantrum has reignited public impatience with family-run conglomerates known as chaebol, over what some South Koreans see as unchecked bad behavior by the rich and powerful, especially second and third-generation children of the founders. 
""Founders of conglomerates are considered myths, sacred. They have legitimacy, because they built the conglomerates from nothing,"" said Chang Sea-jin, a business professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. 
""But second-generation and third-generation leaders do not have such legitimacy. They are simply born with 'golden spoons' in their mouths,"" he said. 
REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE
Korean Air's employee union and two pilots' unions said in a joint statement on Sunday that Cho Hyun-min's actions harmed the reputation of Korean Air. They want her to step down and offer a sincere apology to all employees and the public. 
""The controversy surrounding management taking advantage of its power has become the most-searched term and the subject of unending breaking news, and ... leading to criticism for around 20,000 employees who have devoted blood and sweat working on the front lines,"" the unions said. 
""Why must our employees feel shame? Why must our employees, who have committed no crime, be the subject of criticism?""
Cho apologized to employees in a mass email on Sunday, according to a copy of the email seen by Reuters.
""As I was focusing on my passion for the work, I was unable to control my thoughtless words and deeds, through which I caused injury and disappointment for a lot of people,"" she said.
Korean Air confirmed that the email was sent to all Korean Air employees, but declined to comment further.
Traditionally loyal to their employers and reluctant to become a whistleblower due to fears of retaliation, more rank and file employees are now reporting problems, encouraged by growing public and government calls to reform chaebols in the wake of corruption scandals, said Park Ju-gun, the head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score.
Former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail this month on charges of receiving or demanding bribes from top conglomerates including Samsung (KS:005930) and Lotte. 
""The environment has changed. The government has changed,"" Park said. 
Dozens of petitions demanding that Cho be punished and ""Korean"" removed from the airline's name were posted on Monday on the presidential Blue House's online petition page.
One petition calling for the change to the company's name had 50,182 signatures by mid-day.

Shares in Korean Air Lines fell 4 percent in early trade to a near three-week low, while shares of its home rival Asiana Airlines rose 3.5 percent.

Speaking to reporters after a policy meeting in Seoul, Kim Dong-yeon said major shareholders and other parties involved need to swiftly come to an agreement on sharing the burden of improving the loss-making operation. 
GM shocked South Korea in February with plans to close one local plant and leaving the fate of three others unclear.

1123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2018 10:31PM ET</span>",IMF Says China's Complex Fiscal System Needs `Crucial' Overhaul,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s sprawling local government financing system needs “crucial” reforms to increase consumption, build prosperity and encourage economic rebalancing, the International Monetary Fund said.
Among the IMF’s recommendations is to fund local governments by imposing recurring property taxes and adding local surcharges to national individual income taxes.
China’s fiscal system is the world’s most decentralized, with local bodies responsible for 85 percent of government spending, the fund said in a report, citing the breadth across 31 provincial level governments, 334 prefectures, 2,850 counties, 40,000 townships and 900,000 informal village jurisdictions. Including off-budget spending by local government financing vehicles brings the ratio up to 89 percent of all public expenditures.
Such a complex network must be overhauled to better deliver services, increase social spending and reduce regional disparities, Philippe Wingender, an economist in the tax policy division of the fiscal affairs department, said in a paper released on Saturday. Revenue changes are needed to reduce risk from “excessive sub-national borrowing” and increase efficiency.
“These reforms will allow China’s government to improve social safety nets and better protect citizens from adverse economic and health shocks,” Wingender wrote. “In turn, this would improve welfare and promote consumption and economic rebalancing.”
A 2014 budget law aimed to improve budgeting and increase transparency and accountability in local government finances by requiring multi-year spending plans and setting conditions for managing annual deficits and surpluses. But it doesn’t address the misalignment of spending and taxing powers and the large imbalance across levels of government that’s prevailed since the last major fiscal reform in 1994, Wingender said.
“Efforts to improve government borrowing and contain fiscal risks will only succeed if supported by reforms to reduce unfunded mandates for sub-national governments,” he said. Counties have the largest fiscal mandate among all levels of government, with spending equal to 9 percent of gross domestic product, according to the report.
Almost 50 percent of total tax revenues come from the value-added tax and corporate income tax, a high level compared with advanced economies. Meanwhile, personal income taxes contribute around 5 percent of total revenue, significantly less than the 25 percent average for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. The drawback of that structure is “very limited progressivity of the tax system,” the report said.

Fujifilm and Xerox struck a $6.1 billion deal in January to combine the U.S. company into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox, to gain scale and cut costs as demand for office printing equipment declines.
The board advised Jacobson in November to halt negotiations because it was considering firing him, the newspaper reported, citing an amended suit filed in a New York state court on Sunday by Darwin Deason, a Xerox holder who opposes the deal, saying it undervalues the copier and printer company. 
The company denied the assertion in a statement on Sunday.
""Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson was fully authorized to engage in discussions with Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox on the proposed combination,"" Xerox Chairman Robert Keegan said in the statement.
He added that the lawsuit ""distorts many of the facts regarding the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox."" 
Deason and activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who together hold about 15 percent of Xerox shares, are fighting the combination, which they say ""disproportionately"" favors Fuji. They are separately looking to shake up the Xerox board. 
Deason wants to nominate directors to the Xerox board, despite missing a deadline, arguing in his suit that the current board had made a series of significant decisions and disclosures to stockholders after the nomination deadline.

A representative for Deason was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 12:24PM ET</span>","Britain's WPP, investors adjust to life without Sorrell","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) entered uncharted territory on Monday after the exit of founder Martin Sorrell left the world's biggest advertising company rudderless at a time of intense industry change.
Shares in WPP fell 6 percent after Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion, stepped down on Saturday after the board investigated an allegation of misconduct.
David Herro of Harris Associates, WPP's biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data, said Sorrell would be missed.
""Sir Martin is a visionary, a legend in advertising and a skilful businessman,"" he said. ""The circumstances surrounding this are regrettable as is a leadership transition without Sir Martin's involvement. 
The sudden departure of Sorrell, the face of the company which he founded in 1985, has sparked questions as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies across 112 countries.
It has also prompted fears that without Sorrell's contacts it could lose clients and talent while it seeks a new CEO. 
""We think the lack of operational direction for the group and potential for client losses are clear downside risks over the short to medium term,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said. 
""The potential for asset sales or even a break-up may provide some support, but these are highly uncertain and unlikely to take place in the near-term."" 
WPP said that chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman while its digital boss Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the chief operating officer of WPP Europe who oversaw acquisitions, become joint chief operating officers.
They inherit a difficult task, with WPP in March publishing its weakest results since the financial crisis as consumer goods groups such as  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) and P&G cut spending and other customers jumped ship.
The industry is also battling the might of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which dominate the online advertising market, and watching nervously as consultants such as Accenture move more aggressively into the sector.
The changing dynamics have meant the previous idea of building marketing groups up to offer advertising, branding, planning and research on a global scale - championed by Sorrell and followed by others - is now under threat as clients want more nimble relationships in a digital age.
Many are starting to ask if they can do things differently - creating their own content to place directly on online platforms or working with smaller ad groups.
Analysts are already saying that WPP's market research arm Kantar could be sold off for around 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion), compared with the group's overall market value of 14.5 billion pounds, and question whether there are synergies from holding PR assets like Finsbury. 
Sorrell had argued that the insight provided from market research had set WPP apart from peers such as Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG), enabling it to improve its decision making when planning and buying media space for ads. 
The group also owns stakes in groups such as Chime Communications, Vice, AppNexus and Chime Communications which could be reviewed. 
ALL CHANGE
With so much change in the industry, some analysts have questioned whether the group should seek a new CEO from outside who could look at it dispassionately.
Names already in the frame include Jerry Buhlmann, who runs the Dentsu Aegis network, and Adam Crozier who previously ran broadcaster  ITV  (LON:ITV) and  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG). Jeremy Darroch, the well regarded CEO of bid target Sky, and Andrew Robertson, boss of rival ad agency BBDO, have also been linked with the job. 
From inside WPP Read, 51, is seen as the lead candidate. 
While a common refrain heard about WPP is that no one knows the company like Sorrell, Read is the one man who comes close after he wrote to the WPP boss asking for a job in 1989. 
From the company's office in Farm Street, Mayfair, he watched as Sorrell pulled off a string of takeovers before building his own profile by growing its digital operations. 
He spent nearly 10 years on the WPP board, introducing him to investors, and is regarded by peers as a strategic thinker who can win corporate pitches to bring in work. 
Scott, 49, is better known in the corporate world than the advertising community, having worked on the company's acquisition strategy. 
""Mark will be responsible for clients, operating companies and people,"" a spokesman said. ""Andrew will focus on financial and operational performance and implementing on-going reorganization of the group's portfolio.""
They will ""report to and be supported"" by Quarta. Read has already contacted senior executives within WPP to offer to speak to clients and reassure them that work will continue as normal. 
Whoever replaces Sorrell however will face longer-term questions as to whether a group that was built in his mould should remain intact after his departure. Already executives are predicting that bits will be sold off in a move that could once again become a model for the wider industry. 
David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas and the founder of tech marketing group You and Mr Jones, predicted WPP would eventually end up missing Sorrell more than he would WPP.
""No one else can keep that company together the way he has been able to because he built it,"" he told Reuters. 
""It's the fall of an emperor and one that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.""

Sorrell, 73, did not have a non-compete clause and could set up a new advertising business. He owns 1.4 percent of WPP, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The deal reflects the U.S. food manufacturing outsourcing sector's appeal to private equity firms. Major food and drink companies turn to contract manufacturers such as Hearthside to cut production costs and boost their profitability.
The consortium of Partners Group and Charlesbank outbid other private equity firms in the auction for Hearthside, and is negotiating final terms with the company's existing owners, Vestar Capital Partners and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc's (N:GS) private equity arm, the sources said.
Partners Group and Charlesbank have agreed to pay the equivalent of about 11 times Hearthside's 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the sources added.
If the negotiations are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as Monday, the sources added, cautioning there was always a possibility that talks fall apart at the last minute.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deal discussions are confidential. Vestar and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Partners Group, Charlesbank and Hearthside did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Hearthside produces baked foods and snacks, including energy bars, cookies and pretzels, out of 24 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe for the world’s premier food companies, according to its website.
The company, based in Downers Grove, Illinois, was created in 2009 by private equity firm Wind Point Partners and Rich Scalise, a former Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products president and veteran of ConAgra Foods Inc (N:CAG). Scalise now serves as Hearthside’s chairman and chief executive officer.
Goldman Sachs and Vestar acquired Hearthside for $1.1 billion from Wind Point in 2014. Hearthside has since acquired other companies, including Standard Function Foods Group last year.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Ad king Sorrell's abdication leaves WPP at crossroads,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell's sudden exit from WPP (LON:WPP) marks a shocking end to the career of a chief executive who through sheer force of personality made it the world's biggest advertising firm.
WPP said in early April it had appointed lawyers to investigate a whistleblower's allegation of personal misconduct against Sorrell, who over 33 years turned a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies present in 112 countries.
The 73-year-old said on Saturday he was standing down, departing at a crucial time for WPP which has seen its share price fall 30 percent this year due to lower client spending, contract losses and a growing threat from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""I shall miss all of you greatly,"" he wrote in an email to staff. ""As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that."" 
WPP did not give any details of the allegation and Sorrell denied the charges, initially saying that he understood the need to investigate. However, when the matter made it into the Wall Street Journal he told friends he thought it was being used as a weapon to force him out, one source said. 
A former rival chief executive and a current CEO told Reuters last week that the fact Sorrell was under investigation showed how the dynamic within WPP had changed. 
""To me it's not actually about whether he did anything wrong but it's the fact that three years ago the board would not even have gone down this path,"" the former CEO said. ""Martin was all powerful and WPP without Martin was not worth thinking about."" 
MAKING A NAME
The son of an electronics retailer who was educated at the University of Cambridge, Sorrell made his name as the finance director of the start-up British ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. 
He took center stage in 1985, buying a stake in a small manufacturing firm Wire and Plastic Products Plc to use it as a public vehicle to buy communications groups around the world. 
Within a few years he had sealed a string of takeovers, snapping up such storied creative agencies as J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy before moving into the cash cow of media planning and buying by creating Group M. Market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury followed. 
Known for a ferocious work ethic and microscopic attention to detail, Sorrell built up the group by pitching aggressively for work, often leading the charge himself and going above the heads of marketing officers to deal directly with their bosses.
The role meant Sorrell became an authority not just on advertising but on the global economy and an ever present voice on the media and at events such as Davos.
Respected by his peers, he was however shown little affection by them in the ego-driven ad business and was sometimes dismissed as a ""beancounter"" because of his financial rather than advertising background.
David Ogilvy famously referred to Sorrell as an ""odious little jerk"" when the WPP CEO sought to buy his company. The two ad men later made up and Sorrell signed off WPP's annual report that year as ""OLJ"".
""He is so brutally competitive,"" the former CEO said. ""He is such a competitor and he can get so angry when he loses."" 
Many executives recount stories of the CEO taking contract losses personally, including one who told Reuters how Sorrell had shared an hour's car journey in complete silence after his rival mentioned an account he had recently won from WPP.
Sorrell sparred repeatedly with the long-time boss of French rival Publicis, Maurice Levy, and enjoyed pointing out to journalists the failings of his rivals. 
His combative style earned respect from the senior staff who worked for him however. One New York-based executive told Reuters how, on a night out, senior executives would all email Sorrell at exactly the same time to see who he would respond to first. 
""He has an astounding grasp of detail if you consider the scale of the enterprise,"" said another executive who knew Sorrell professionally for many decades. ""It's practically a stage show."" 
The success also brought great wealth for the father of four, with the perma-tanned executive earning around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone due to a performance-linked bonus scheme that angered many shareholders. 
BACK TO THE FUTURE 
CEOs and executives, who asked not to be named, lamented that Sorrell would not get the chance to reposition WPP, which in March posted its weakest results since the financial crash. 
Whoever takes over will have to decide whether the group of 200,000 people should remain in its current form. 
Having run the agencies as separate companies for years to stimulate competition, WPP had started to break down the barriers to appease clients who found it unwieldy and unsuited to the digital age where clients could create their own content and place it directly on Google and Facebook. 
Brian Wieser, advertising analyst at Pivotal Research, said WPP had the right assets but it had not packaged them properly in recent years and the fact it was more fragmented than Omnicom and Publicis meant it was now harder to reposition.
The initial task will fall to Chairman Roberto Quarta, who described Sorrell as the ""driving force"" behind WPP, and executives Mark Read and Andrew Scott who will be joint chief operating officers while the company seeks a new CEO.
Sorrell told staff that WPP had come through difficult times before and would do so again, saying he would be available to anyone who wanted advice.

""For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP,"" he said. ""Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now, Back to the Future.""

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2018 10:33AM ET</span>",South Dakota e-commerce sale tax fight reaches U.S. Supreme Court,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-stakes showdown at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday will determine whether states can force out-of-state online retailers to collect sales taxes in a fight between South Dakota and e-commerce businesses.
South Dakota is asking the nine justices to overturn a 1992 Supreme Court precedent that states cannot require retailers to collect state sales taxes on purchases unless the businesses have a ""physical presence"" in the state.
The state, appealing a lower court decision that favored Wayfair Inc,  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc and Newegg Inc, is being supported by President Donald Trump's administration.
A ruling favoring South Dakota could help small brick-and-mortar retailers compete with online rivals while funneling up to $18 billion into the coffers of the affected states, according to a 2017 federal report.
The justices will hear arguments in the case on Tuesday against a backdrop of Trump's harsh criticism of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the dominant player in online retail, on the issue of taxes and other matters. Trump has assailed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, a newspaper that the Republican president also has disparaged.
Amazon, which is not involved in the Supreme Court case, collects sales taxes on direct purchases on its site but does not collect taxes for items sold on its platform by third-party venders, constituting around half of total sales. 
South Dakota depends more than most states on sales taxes because it is one of nine that do not have a state income tax. South Dakota projects its revenue losses because of online sales that do not collect state taxes at around $50 million annually, while its opponents in the case estimate it as less than half that figure.
Major retailers that have brick-and-mortar stores, and therefore already collect taxes, are represented by industry groups that back South Dakota. The National Retail Federation, which supports the state, has a membership list that includes Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), as well as Amazon.
Stephanie Martz, the federation's general counsel, said in an interview the case gives the Supreme Court a chance to adapt the law to new circumstances prompted by the rise of internet shopping.
""Things have changed a lot since 1992. The entire nature of interstate commerce has changed,"" Martz said.
E-commerce companies supporting Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg include two that provide online platforms for individuals to sell online: eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Etsy Inc.
""Win or lose at the Supreme Court, we will continue to advocate for a legislative solution and a level playing field where all retailers collect and remit sales tax on the same basis,"" Wayfair spokeswoman Jane Carpenter said in a statement.
Brian Bieron, eBay's senior director of government relations, said in an interview the 1992 precedent ""provides the many small businesses that use the internet with a very clear and simple and stable legal environment in which to grow their business.""
Overturning the ruling while not replacing it with a new national framework ""is really going to be a negative move in terms of e-commerce,"" Bieron added.
A 2016 South Dakota law requires out-of-state online retailers to collect sales tax if they clear $100,000 in sales or 200 separate transactions. State legislators knew the measure was unlawful under the 1992 precedent.

The state sued a group of online retailers after the law was enacted to force them to collect the state sale taxes, with the aim of overturning the precedent.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2018 05:52PM ET</span>",Starbucks chief executive apologizes for arrests of two black men,"(Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson apologized late on Saturday for the arrests of two black men at a Philadelphia coffee shop last week, which sparked accusations of racial profiling.
Promising to make everything right, Johnson promised a thorough investigation of the incident caught on video by a patron Thursday and shared widely online.
The men were accused of trespassing but have said they were waiting for a friend before ordering.
""The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values,"" Johnson said in a statement.
He added, ""The basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong.""
Philadelphia's police commissioner on Saturday defended the arrest, saying his officers had to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing.
Video of Thursday's incident showed other patrons telling officers the pair were doing nothing wrong and appeared to have been targeted merely because of their race.
Police Commissioner Richard Ross said he knew the incident had prompted a lot of concern, but said his officers ""did absolutely nothing wrong.""
In a video statement, Ross said store employees called 911 to report a disturbance and trespassing. 
When officers arrived, Ross said, staff told them the two men had wanted to use the restroom but were informed it was only for paying customers. The pair repeatedly refused to leave when politely asked to do so by the employees and officers, he said.
""If you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, they (the officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that,"" Ross said.
""They were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen, and instead they got the opposite back.""
Ross said that as an African-American man he was acutely aware of implicit bias. ""We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department,"" he said.
The two men were released, Ross said, after officers learned Starbucks was ""no longer interested"" in prosecuting them.
In a post on Twitter earlier on Saturday,  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) said it was sorry for what took place. 
Johnson added his apology, saying the company would review its policies and ""further train our partners to better know when police assistance is warranted.""
Melissa DePino, an author who posted video of the arrest, said staff called police because the two men had not ordered anything while waiting for a friend. She said white customers were ""wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing.""

Police departments across the United States have come under criticism for repeated instances of killing unarmed black men in recent years, which activists blame on racial biases in the criminal justice system.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Proxy adviser ISS recommends against five Equifax directors over cyberbreach,"(Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on Saturday recommended investors vote against the re-election of five  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX) directors who served on the company's audit and technology committees prior to a 2017 data breach. 
The Atlanta-based consumer credit company last fall said hackers had stolen personally identifiable information of U.S., British and Canadian consumers, including names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver's license and credit card numbers. Over time, Equifax has increased the number affected to more than 147 million people.
ISS said in a report to shareholders sent to Reuters by a spokesman that the company's reputation and shareholder value had been damaged by the extent of the breach and the company's slow response to it, placing a cloud over the company. 
In response, it recommended against voting for directors Mark L. Feidler, G. Thomas Hough, John A. McKinley, Elane B. Stock and Mark B. Templeton, who served on the two committees with relevant oversight duties. It recommended votes in support of the remaining five director candidates at the company, including Siri S. Marshall, head of the governance committee. 
An Equifax spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the recommendations. 
Equifax has said breach-related costs could reach $439 million through year-end, potentially making it the most costly U.S. hack yet disclosed. The company has lost 19 percent of its market value since the massive cybertheft was disclosed. Its shares traded at $116 on Friday. [L2N1QK1Q1] 
The credit reporting company is facing 100s of lawsuits by consumers, financial institutions and even the city of Chicago relating to the cybersecurity breach. The company disputes the claims and has said it intends to defend against them. 
ISS also recommended ""cautionary support"" for the company's say-on-pay resolution, noting the compensation committee's decision to not pay annual incentives, steps to adjust incentive metrics and strengthen clawback provisions. However, it said there are ongoing questions about former Chief Executive Richard F. Smith's pay and ""the issue warrants continued monitoring."" 
It also recommended a vote in favor of a shareholder resolution seeking a report on political contributions by the company, saying holders would benefit from more disclosure of the company's political spending, payments to trade groups, its management of related risks.

The company's annual general meeting is scheduled for May 3.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2018 07:44PM ET</span>",Martin Sorrell quits as head of world's biggest ad group WPP,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, who built WPP (LON:WPP) into the world's biggest advertising agency through 33 years of dealmaking, quit on Saturday after an allegation of personal misconduct. 
The departure of the CEO who built a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies with 200,000 staff in 112 countries leaves WPP without a boss at a pivotal time for the industry and when the group is under great strain. 
WPP stunned the market last week when it said it had appointed lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sorrell. He denied the allegations but in a letter to WPP staff published late on Saturday he said the ""current disruption"" was ""putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business"".
He said he had decided that ""in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside"".
Chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman until a new chief executive is found, while Mark Read, a WPP digital executive, and Andrew Scott, chief operating officer, Europe, have been appointed as joint chief operating officers.
Read, who previously sat on WPP's main board, is well regarded in the industry while Scott was involved in its acquisition strategy and was not involved with clients.
The company will consider internal and external candidates for the top job in a process that could take several months.
""Obviously I am sad to leave WPP after 33 years,"" Sorrell said in a statement. ""It has been a passion, focus and source of energy for so long. However, I believe it is in the best interests of the business if I step down now."" 
WPP said the investigation, which regarded financial impropriety, had concluded. It made no further comment but repeated a previous statement that the allegation did not involve amounts that were material to the company. 
A source close to Sorrell said he had been unhappy with how the investigation was handled, leaving him uncertain whether he could work with the board again.
Analysts have speculated that the sprawling group, which was being restructured after a year of lower spending from some clients, could now sell off some assets if led by different management.
PASSION AND FOCUS
The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into one of Britain's biggest companies by three decades of relentless dealmaking. He is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in the country.
In his time the group expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers, market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury.
Present in 112 countries, WPP serves clients including Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), P&G and a string of major corporations around the world. 
It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom, Publicis and IPG in the years that followed the financial crisis as the group pitched aggressively for new work. But it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in spending from consumer goods groups Unilever and P&G, and the loss of some big accounts.
The migration of advertising online and the encroachment into market research of consultancies such as Accenture have compounded the pressures. Its shares are down around 30 percent this year. 
The company said Sorrell would be available to assist with the transition, and the man synonymous with the British marketing group told the staff they would come through this difficult time. 

""As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that,"" Sorrell said. ""Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now back to the future.""

Qualcomm Inc's (O:QCOM) proposed $44 billion purchase of Dutch chip maker  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI) could be at risk due to the delayed review. China is the only country that has not yet signed off on the deal, or on Toshiba Corp's (T:6502) planned $19 billion sale of its chip unit to a Bain Capital consortium, according to the newspaper. 
Qualcomm's merger agreement with NXP was extended for a second time in January, giving the two until to April 25, although the parties could decide to extend the deadline.
China's Vice President, Wang Qishan, last month assured Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf that the review would not be affected by politics, the newspaper said. 
Qualcomm and Toshiba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In a move to force China to lower its $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S., the Trump administration this month unveiled tariffs representing about $50 billion on Chinese technology, transport and medical products, drawing an immediate threat of retaliatory action from Beijing.

At the same time, China pledged to further open the country's economy and lower import tariffs on certain products, moves it said were unrelated to the trade spat.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) N.V.'s emergency allergy antidote EpiPen is in short supply in Canada and Britain, but remains available in the United States, the treatment's manufacturer said on Friday.
EpiPens deliver potentially lifesaving doses of the generic drug epinephrine, via an automatic injector that a patient or caregiver can administer in the event of severe allergic reaction. 
""We are shipping product. Currently there is no shortage in the U.S.,"" said Steve Danehy, a spokesman for  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), which produces the global supply of EpiPens for Mylan out of a single facility near St. Louis, Missouri.
Mylan is in charge of managing allocation of the EpiPen supply, Danehy said in an email to Reuters. It was not immediately clear why Canada and the UK would be subject to a shortage at this time. A Mylan spokeswoman was not available for comment. 
Mylan's EpiPen sales practices in the United States sparked public outrage in 2016 as consumers saw the price for a pack of two auto-injectors rise sixfold to $600 in less than a decade, making the devices unaffordable for a growing number of families. 
Since then, the company has launched a generic version of EpiPen for half the price, though the U.S. market is still the most lucrative. 
Meridian Medical Technologies Inc, the unit of Pfizer that manufactures EpiPens, has been hit by a series of manufacturing problems. In March 2017, Mylan recalled tens of thousands of devices after complaints that some had failed to activate. 
In September, Meridian received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA said Meridian had failed to thoroughly investigate product failures, including EpiPen products that were associated with patient deaths and severe illnesses. It said the company failed to take corrective actions until FDA's inspection.
At the time, Mylan said it did not anticipate any impact on EpiPen supply based on the warning letter. 
But on Thursday, Pfizer Canada said it was ""experiencing supply constraints"" for EpiPens used by both adults and children ""due to delays at the manufacturing facility,"" as well as problems in sourcing a component for the device from an outside supplier.
There are no alternatives on the market in Canada, federal health officials there said. They advised patients and caregivers to use expired EpiPens in an emergency if they have nothing else on hand, and then call 911. 
""Pfizer understands and regrets the challenges that these ongoing supply constraints pose to patients and the healthcare community,"" the company said in a statement on its website.
On Friday, the UK website for EpiPen notified consumers of ""intermittent supply constraints"" for the adult injector. It said the next shipment to EpiPen's distributor in the country was expected toward the end of April. 

Mylan's revenue from EpiPen dropped sharply over the last year due to increased competition, the launch of its own cheaper generic and higher rebates that it has had to pay to as a result of a settlement for overcharging the U.S. government.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Friday it took a $4.24 billion equity charge and reduced earnings for the last two years by 30 cents a share, figures in line with expectations the company set earlier this year when it said it would comply with new accounting standards.
The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical devices and other industrial goods had estimated the after-tax, non-cash impact would be about $4.2 billion, plus reduced earnings for 2016 and 2017 of about 29 cents a share. 
The accounting change prompted GE to recast two years of past financial statements to reflect lower income and asset values under the new standard, and those will be reflected when GE reports first-quarter results on April 20. 
The value of GE's contract assets are being written down, but that does not change the value of the long-term contracts GE has, nor does it affect GE's cash flow or earnings estimates for 2018, GE said. 
The adjustments appear within expectations, Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said. ""Now the focus moves to next Friday's earnings.""
The figures suggest GE executives have gotten to the bottom of some accounting issues and bolster confidence in Chief Executive Officer John Flannery after a series of financial surprises, including underestimating the impact of insurance policies that prompted a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, analysts said. 
GE shares were down 1 percent at $13.35 in aftermarket trading after rising 2.4 percent on Friday.
The new accounting standard governs how companies estimate and recognize revenue from long-term contracts, and is designed to make a company's cash flow more closely match its income, accounting experts and analysts said.
The prior standard allowed companies to recognize future revenue from such agreements more quickly. The new standard shifts revenue to later in the contract duration, analysts said.
Companies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for estimating future revenue from the contracts, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts as assets on the balance sheet, experts say.
GE's contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE's regulatory filings.
GE also made adjustments for new accounting standards for pensions, cash flow and taxes on Friday. 
GE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range of between $1.00 and $1.07 a share.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GE's accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern but GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.
GE said in February that it expects to make the adjustments as it switches to the new accounting standards for contracts. 

GE said it chose to restate 2016 and 2017 earnings, a more exacting standard under the new rules, because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years.

Zuckerberg spent much of last year traveling after he pledged to visit all the U.S. states that he had not previously been to.
His security expenses climbed to $7.3 million in 2017 from $4.9 million a year earlier.
Menlo Park, California-based Facebook paid to buy, install and maintain security measures for Zuckerberg's personal residences, which include properties in San Francisco and Palo Alto, the filing showed.
The Facebook board's compensation committee authorized Zuckerberg's security program, the filing said, ""to address safety concerns due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder, Chairman, and CEO.""
Zuckerberg's base salary was unchanged at $1, while his total voting power at Facebook rose marginally to 59.9 percent.
Facebook, which has consistently reported stronger-than-expected earnings over the past two years, has faced public outcry over its role in Russia's alleged influence over the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Earlier this week, Zuckerberg emerged largely unscathed after facing hours of questioning from U.S. lawmakers on how the personal information of several million Facebook users might have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Aberdeen urges voting system change to replace Brazil's BRF board,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A campaign by  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc  (LON:ADNl) and other activist shareholders urging Brazilian food company BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) to adopt a new voting system is aimed at bringing transparency to the process of replacing the board of directors, an Aberdeen executive said on Friday.
The firm, which owns 5 percent of BRF, wants the food processor to adopt a system in which shareholders can vote on individual board candidates, rather than a slate of previously agreed candidates, Peter Taylor, its head of Brazilian equities, said in an interview on Friday.
BRF declined to comment.
Certain BRF shareholders are pushing for a management shake-up after the company posted its worst ever annual results. BRF also faces accusations that it acted to evade food safety rules and a trade ban on its chicken exports to Europe.
The proposed voting shift signals a deepening rift between shareholders and the company's board. Its shares fell almost 4.6 percent on Friday.
BRF formally disclosed Aberdeen's request to change the voting system on Thursday.
Pension funds Petros and Previ, which own a combined 22 percent of BRF, have been leading the charge to replace the board. The funds had been attempting to negotiate a slate of candidates for the board with a faction led by Chairman Abilio Diniz, although talks fell apart.
Instead, a competing slate of candidates has emerged, prompting Aberdeen to call for adoption of a system known as cumulative voting, Taylor said.
""The reason why we have called for the adoption of cumulative voting is to provide clarity and transparency for foreign investors who are facing voting deadlines in the next few days,"" Taylor said.
A cumulative voting system is generally regarded as a strategy to ensure minority shareholders greater representation in the board of a company.
Petros said in a statement the cumulative vote requested by Aberdeen ""aims to preserve the rights of BRF's entire shareholder base.""
Aberdeen supports the pension funds' list, Taylor said, adding that he expected their group to elect the majority of board members at a shareholder meeting on April 26. Other investors would be free to nominate competing names, he said.
A dissolution of BRF's board would likely entail the removal of Diniz, a retail magnate who took the reins five years ago and owns nearly 4 percent of the company.

Diniz did not have an immediate comment.

1153,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 05:03PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. First-Quarter Earnings Season Begins on Sour Note
The start of earnings season in earnest on Friday did not go according to plan as an earnings beat by major Wall Street banks failed to induce a stock market rally.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) posted above street consensus first-quarter earnings Friday but fell more than 1%, dragging the broader market lower.
Wells Fargo was the biggest decliner among the trio, falling more than 3%, as the lender warned it may significantly change its first quarter results amid a looming regulatory settlement that could set the bank back by as much as $1 billion.
Geopolitical tensions and trade-war fears were a constant threat to risk appetite as equities ebbed and flowed to tweets from President Trump on Syria. While a WSJ report Friday, suggesting the White House would continue its aggressive stance on trade and threaten to block Chinese technology investment in the United States weighed on risk appetite.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was also in the spotlight this week as CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the rounds on Capitol Hill, testifying in a two-day congressional hearing.
Zuckerberg didn’t fluff his lines, much to the delight of Facebook shareholders, as the social media giant’s shares snapped a four-week losing streak to close up nearly 5% for the week.
The S&P 500 index closed about 2.0% higher for the week.
2. Crude Oil: Traders Up Bets on ‘Fear Premium’ 
Crude oil prices ended the week at three-year highs after rallying for five-straight days as concerns about rising U.S. oil output and supplies took a backseat amid geopolitical tensions.
The oil price rally this week was supported by expectations that producers in the Middle East, could suffer supply disruptions in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions, adding a “fear premium” to oil prices, according to RBC.
Sentiment on oil was also bolstered by a trio of reports from the Energy Information Administration, OPEC, and the International Energy Agency confirming that OPEC cuts continued to lower global supplies, which are predicted to reach the five-year average levels later this year. 
Total OPEC production fell to the lowest since March 2017, according to a monthly report from OPEC.
On Friday U.S. crude futures gained 0.48% to settle at $67.39 a barrel on Friday, and notched a 8.6% gain for the week.
3. Dollar Slips as Fed Minutes Fail to Boost Appetite
The dollar struggled to find its footing this week after forays higher were met with resistance as geopolitical tensions weighed, while a strong rally in sterling also kept a lid on upward momentum.
The weakness in the dollar came despite growing investor expectations for a June rate hike after the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes revealed policymakers were more certain about inflation hitting the Fed’s 2% target, raising the need for gradual rate hikes.
The dollar was knocked back by sterling’s solid gains this week on expectations the Bank of England would likely raise interest rates next month.
The dollar fell 0.01% to 89.48 against a basket of major currencies on Friday.
4. Gold Continues to Shine as Geopolitical Tensions Flared
Gold prices notched a second-straight weekly gain Friday, benefitting from continued safe-haven demand as traders sought refuge from geopolitical headwinds.
The yellow metal enjoyed its biggest move earlier in the week following a tweet from President Trump warning Russia to “get ready,” hinting at U.S. missile strikes on Syria. But gold prices gave up some of their gains after Trump backed away from his aggressive stance. 
Dollar weakness, meanwhile, also supported upside momentum in the precious metal as the greenback struggled for direction amid geopolitical tensions and mixed inflation data as producer inflation topped expectations, while consumer inflation fell short.
Despite the bullish week for gold prices, traders appeared to take some profit on recent gains as data Friday showed bullish bets on the yellow metal declined. 
CFTC COT data showed money managers reduced their net long positions in gold futures to 155,400 lots from 166,600 lots for the week ended April 10.
5. Bitcoin: What a Difference a Week Makes 
Bitcoin had its best week in almost two-months, as an impressive rally on Thursday turned sentiment positive on both the popular digital currency and the wider crypto market.
While there wasn’t any specific reason behind the move, some cited news that Spanish banking giant Santander (MC:SAN) was starting a blockchain based international payment service as the catalyst for the rally which got underway Thursday.
Santander rolled out its cross-border payments system, “One Pay FX,” for its customers in Spain, the UK, Brazil and Poland on Friday. One Pay was said to use distributed ledger technology developed by Ripple.
The move by the Spanish bank revived battered hopes that the digital ledger technology - which powers most cryptos including bitcoin - has a role to play in the mainstream payments space.
The turn in sentiment on cryptocurrencies was characterised by a $75 billion leap in the total cryptocurrency market cap to about $325 billion, at the time of writing, from about $250 billion last week.
Bitcoin rose 3.03% to $7,955.2, on the Bitfinex exchange, while Ethereum rose to $500, up 7.68%. Ripple XRP rose to $0.66203, up 13.81% on the Poloniex exchange."

The U.S. has yet to present a proposal for automotive content rules that would be viable for the industry, said Moises Kalach, the trade head for the national business chamber known by its Spanish abbreviation, CCE. Work on a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has the three nations ready to close nine to 10 chapters focused on modernization, including telecommunications, energy, and the environment, which would leave chapters with the most contentious issues as those to resolve, he said.
“There are five or six demands that are unacceptable for Mexico and unacceptable for the Mexican private sector,” Kalach said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Washington on Friday. “Those demands like the sunset clause, that has the sudden death to it, seasonality to limit exports on fresh products, trade remedies -- those are things that the Mexican private sector is not willing to accept and those demands are still on the table. That’s what’s really holding up this negotiation.”
Negotiators this week are trying to make progress on the most contentious issues, including dispute resolution, access to U.S. procurement deals, a proposal to require more auto manufacturing in North America, seasonal barriers to agriculture trade and a clause that would terminate Nafta after five years unless the nations agree to continue it. Meanwhile, Canada’s minister responsible for industry, Navdeep Bains, met with carmakers Friday and said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about progress made on the crucial auto issue.

The U.S. push to announce a framework deal this week looks to have fallen short after President Donald Trump canceled his trip to Peru to participate in a regional summit. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo on Monday said he sees an 80 percent chance of an initial agreement by the first week of May.
On the talks for cars, one of the most contentious issues, “we haven’t seen a proposal that’s achievable up to now,” Kalach said. “That has to change in order for this to happen.”
The U.S. has at least twice softened demands for changes to the auto sector. U.S. negotiators are now proposing that as much as 75 percent of car parts be sourced from the three countries to quality for tariff exemptions under Nafta, down from an initial proposal of as much as 85 percent, according to three people familiar with the talks, who asked not to be named as the negotiations are private. The current Nafta level is 62.5 percent.
Bains met with Canadian automakers and auto-part makers to discuss several issues including ongoing Nafta talks. “We’re making progress,” the minister said. He cited one-time U.S. interests, such as a border-adjustment tax and a U.S.-specific auto content requirement, that are no longer on the table as positive signs.
He and the auto sector representatives discussed the future of the industry, including the role artificial intelligence will play and how the country can attract auto jobs of the future, he said, warning that any sharp changes in Nafta’s rules could hurt the sector. “Any change add costs, any new rules could potentially add costs and that could undermine the ability to compete, that could raise the cost for vehicles,” Bains said.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 09:08PM ET</span>",Wall Street eyes earnings stabilizer after FAANG stocks wobble,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Wall Street is hoping that first-quarter earnings growth and corporate forecasts are strong enough to bring the FAANG group of stocks back into favor and take the spotlight off worries that caused the recent sell-off in the high-flying group. 
With valuations below recent peaks, the group - comprised of Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - could get some relief if the companies beat, or at least meet, Wall Street estimates. 
Shares in the group, which led the S&P 500 to record highs in January, often trade together. They were pummeled late in the quarter on worries about a data privacy scandal at Facebook (O:FB) and U.S. President Donald Trump's public criticism of Amazon.com (O:AMZN). On top of this, fears of a trade war with China escalated during the quarter. 
For the group, analysts expect average first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth of 25.8 percent, up from 12.4 percent growth in the fourth quarter and a 12.8 percent increase a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""All we're getting now is negative news ... once we start to see the numbers, you're going to see a bigger spotlight on the success these companies are having,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, which holds shares in the FAANG stocks.
Morgan says he is in a wait-and-see mode until after the first report from Netflix, which is due to be issued on Monday. Analysts expect Netflix earnings growth of 59 percent and revenue growth of 39 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The entire group was hurt by fears that Facebook and other internet firms including Google would face onerous regulations or slowing advertising revenue growth after Facebook said nearly 87 million of its members' personal data was improperly leaked.
Facebook fell almost 24 percent below its early February record to hit $149.02 on March 26, its lowest point since July last year, due to the scandal. Google had fallen almost 18 percent below its late January record by March 28.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia said the $76-million Chase Growth fund cut its Facebook investments to 1.8 percent from 3.1 percent of its portfolio due to the scandal. Tuz may stay on the sidelines until there is more clarity on Facebook's prospects.
""If fundamentals remain strong with usage staying strong and the company doesn't get hit with any severe fines or regulations we might very well buy again,"" said Tuz, whose firm also owns Amazon.com, Apple and Google shares. 
""We feel good about three out of the five FAANGs- Amazon, Apple, Google,"" he said. 
Amazon.com stock was hurt by criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would take a serious look at what he claimed were the online retailer's unfair advantages with taxes and shipping rates. It fell 16.3 percent between March 13 and April 4.
The broader technology sector was also hammered by fears of a trade war with China, a big source of revenue. Apple derived about 20 percent of its revenue from China in its fiscal year 2017. Investors seek details how big the financial risks are in the face of events such as a trade war, new regulations or a stronger dollar. 
""The guidance will be more important,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, referring to comments on quarterly conference calls about the potential financial impact of all these issues.
But Patrick Palfrey, equity Strategist at Credit-Suisse in New York is mainly focused on strong estimates for the sector, which has posted impressive growth ""time and time again.""
""I can't help but look at the group and have a positive outlook even with the current uncertainties,"" said Palfrey.
Fund flow data shows investors were warming up to the sector again. Science and technology funds showed inflows of $152 million on the week ending April 11 after outflows of $610.9 million the previous week, which had marked the first weekly retreat since early February, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.
Facebook has risen about 11 percent from its most recent low while Google has climbed 5 percent above its recent trough; Apple is roughly 6 percent higher than its early April low, as is Amazon.com. Netflix has gained about 15 percent in the last 7 sessions. 
Options trading flows suggest that much of the fear of the recent sell-off has faded. But while bears have been exiting positions, bulls have yet to make a big move into the space.
Open options contracts on key sector exchange-traded funds, PowerShares QQQ Trust (O:QQQ) and Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLK), show investor preferences for puts at or close to multi-month lows, according to Trade Alert data. Put options give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future and are often used as a hedge.    

""Investors have been buying the dip a little bit, but in very small sizes, without very large conviction, until they see the earnings,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital LLC, in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for credit losses which is effective for some firms as early as January 2019 and is expected to dent firms' balance sheets. 

The Fed has proposed changing its regulatory capital treatment of credit loss allowances under the new standard and would also allow banks to phase in the effects of adopting the new standard over three years.

Larian has offered $675 million for U.S. stores and $215 million for Canadian stores, MGA said in a statement.
The funds to purchase the stores will come from Larian's own coffers as well as from other investors and financing from banks, said privately held MGA, which also makes Little Tikes and Lol Surprise toys.
Toys 'R' Us filed for bankruptcy in September in the face of strong competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Once the largest U.S. toy retailer, Toys 'R' Us abandoned a plan to emerge from bankruptcy last month and said it would try to maintain more profitable locations in Europe and Asia as an on-going business while liquidating its U.S. and U.K. operations. 
""Everyday that goes by, the value of Toys 'R' Us declines and more people lose their jobs. I did my part and now it's up to the other side to accept this offer,"" Larian said in a statement.
Larian also led a crowdfunding effort through GoFundMe to raise $1 billion in an effort to buy the iconic toy retailer. The campaign has raised over $200 million till date.

Earlier this month, Toys 'R' Us lawyer Joshua Sussberg said the company received multiple bids of more than $1 billion for an 85 percent stake in its Asian business as it plans to sell some non-U.S. operations.

1175,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 02:24PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo CFO says government, not banks, should set gun policy","NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) believes the U.S. government, rather than banks, should set rules to promote gun safety, its finance chief said on Friday.
The No. 3 U.S. lender has been talking to customers who legally manufacture firearms, but is ""not currently setting policy in our extension of credit,"" Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said during a call with reporters.
Major financial firms have been under pressure from gun-control activists to limit their support for firearms makers and retailers since 17 people died in a school shooting in Florida in February.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C), for instance, last month slapped restrictions on new clients in the retail sector who sell guns, such as having the retailers require customers to pass background checks.
In addition, Bank of America (N:BAC) plans to stop lending to companies that make military-style firearms for civilians, a Bank of America executive said this week.
However, Wells Fargo believes solutions should come from the government, Shrewsberry said.
""The best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process,"" he said. ""In the meantime, Wells Fargo is engaging our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety in our communities.""
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, has been reaching out to clients in the consumer firearms industry to make sure they hear input the bank has received from other customers, investors, employees and citizens, according to materials provided by a spokesman.
The bank also routinely analyzes customers from a risk-management perspective, suggesting that its relationship with gunmaker clients could change in the future.

1176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Aramco Accounts Show Scale of Challenge Facing Crown Prince,"(Bloomberg) -- The first look at the financial guts of Saudi Aramco show a corporate cash gusher, pumping billions in profit every month and beating every other big name in global business.
But they also illustrate the scale of the challenge Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman faces to achieve his twin desires -- a $2 trillion valuation in an initial public offering of the state-owned behemoth, plus a generous flow of cash into government coffers to fund a crowded policy agenda.
The financial information reviewed by Bloomberg News revealed huge profits, a pristine balance sheet and world-beating production costs. The figures also show the Saudi Finance Ministry, rather than investors, as the main beneficiary from oil’s rise above $70 a barrel, and it would reap an even greater share of any gains above $100.
There’s one obvious tool Riyadh could use to resolve this issue: oil prices. Holding off on the IPO until crude is high enough could keep sufficient funds flowing to the government while also polishing up Aramco’s valuation.
""Now it’s a matter of choosing the right time,"" Prince Mohammed told Time magazine earlier this month. ""We believe oil prices will get higher in this year and also get higher in 2019, so we are trying to pick the right time.""
With Brent crude, the international benchmark, trading above $70, officials from the kingdom are now signaling an ambition for it to rise to $80, according to people familiar with their thinking.
""The Saudis want to extract the highest price they think the market can bear,"" said Yasser Elguindi, senior market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd. in New York.
Asked to comment on the figures, Saudi Aramco said in a statement: ""This is inaccurate, Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.”
Shattering Records
Prince Mohammed has made the IPO a key part of his “Vision 2030” plan to ready the kingdom for the post-oil age. It’s an effort defined by soaring aspirations, including the construction of a futuristic mega-city called Neom and a vast solar power project.
The Aramco listing is similarly ambitious, seeking to raise a record $100 billion by selling 5 percent of the company’s shares. That would shatter the previous record -- $25 billion raised by Chinese internet retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in 2014.
""The Aramco IPO is a cornerstone of the sweeping and ambitious reform effort in Saudi Arabia,"" said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC. The money raised in the share sale would also be “imperative” for the process.
Some oil industry executives, consultants and analysts, including Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. and Rystad Energy AS, have questioned the $2 trillion valuation target, suggesting a figure between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion as more realistic.
Even at the low end of that range, Aramco would become the world’s largest company by market value, well ahead of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
For a detailed assessment of Aramco’s potential valuation, click here.
Aramco’s financial data give credence to the more cautious view. Institutional investors who used the figures published by Bloomberg in back-of-the-envelope models said the state-owned company could achieve a valuation of $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. That would assume a long-term oil price of about $60 a barrel and use valuation methods similar to other major oil companies. The investors asked not to be named because their estimates weren’t official.
Heavy Burden
Saudi Arabia depends on Aramco to finance social and military spending, as well as the lavish lifestyles of hundreds of princes. This places a heavy burden on the company’s cash flow -- in the form of income tax and royalties.
The importance of oil revenue to the kingdom became clear in late 2014, when crude prices plunged, eventually hitting a 12-year low. The Saudi government struggled to keep the economy running, using more than $250 billion of its foreign-exchange reserves and selling billions of dollars in sovereign bonds to balance the budget.
For the first time in decades, Riyadh had to impose budgetary austerity. The salary cuts and subsidy reductions not only sent the economy into recession, they also threatened to weaken the kingdom’s decades-old social contract -- generous state handouts in return for the political loyalty that maintains stability in the birthplace of Islam.
Tremendous Deal
So far, the Saudi government hasn’t made any changes that would divert significant amounts of cash away from its own coffers in order to boost Aramco’s appeal to foreign investors.
A year ago, the kingdom lowered the company’s income tax rate to 50 percent, from 85 percent previously. But the newly published financial information also reveals that Riyadh secretly introduced a new sliding royalty that takes a bigger share of revenue as crude prices rise. The change also broadened the scope of the levy to cover a greater proportion of its sales -- limiting any potential gains to IPO investors from an improving global oil market.
No matter what final valuation Aramco achieves, the first look at its books illustrated the tremendous deal the kingdom cut in 1976 to fully nationalize the company. It paid the forerunners of  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) about $1.5 billion for their shares."

The idea is straightforward: Stock price trends should show logical and fundamental consistency across industries. Volume confirms price. And, most important, equity prices move in long-term patterns. More than 100 years after the theory was developed by Charles H. Dow, traders still adhere to its basic tenets.
These time-proven rules can be adapted to a new problem: How to track the market’s worry over the possibility of a global trade war. After decades of increasing globalization, investors do not have much of a map for this journey.
But by merging the Dow Theory with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Charles Dow’s other notable creation, investors can quantify market sentiment about changes in global trade structure and track how it shifts over time. Despite its advanced age, the Dow does have unique features that make it fit for this purpose:
So what does “Dow Theory meets Dow Jones Industrial Average” tell us about the current intersection of U.S. equity markets and global trade negotiations? 
The Dow is telling us that we’re not out of the woods yet. The stocks mentioned above, which are highly exposed to trade, are all still under pressure. Boeing’s contribution to the index -- an artifice of its high stock price -- masks this weakness. But Dow Theory reminds us to always look at leading indicators. And those signal more volatility ahead.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 02:43PM ET</span>",U.S. bank executives see delayed boost from tax overhaul,"By Meredith Mazzilli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks have not reaped the full benefit of U.S. tax cuts, Wall Street executives said on Friday after a string of quarterly results, with expected business growth and higher consumer spending yet to materialize.
Analysts and investors are still trying to work out the longer-term effects of the tax rewrite signed into law in December, which slashed the federal corporate rate.
Asked what impact  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is seeing from the new tax law, the bank’s finance chief, John Shrewsberry, said “not much yet.” 
Bank executives said last quarter that tax cuts and changes in capital expense deductions should stoke broad economic growth, fueling expectations of higher lending and capital markets activity.
“It has not been a big mover of our business or what you can see in the real economy,” Shrewsberry said, though he expects that to change later this year.
There has been some wage growth but consumer spending has not picked up accordingly, he said. Wells Fargo has not had any unusual uptick in loan demand or meaningful changes to how products and services are priced, he added. 
""As much as we’re all eager to see the benefits ... I think we have to recognize that tax reform is still in the early phases,” JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a media conference call after the bank reported first-quarter results. 
She told reporters earlier that JPMorgan expects to see benefits, but “with a lag.”
""While client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet, and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline,"" Lake said about loan demand.
Financial markets have already reflected investors' enthusiasm about the cuts,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a call with reporters to discuss results, and the actual benefit to the U.S. economy will only come once investment plans are finalized. 
""A lot of corporate actions are in the planning stage. People usually have nine to 12 months to plan for tax reform. People had a chance to digest this right around the last three weeks of last year,"" Gerspach said. 
A cut in the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent has helped banks boost profit, but other details of the new tax code have not helped their bottom line.
Wells Fargo said interest income slipped 1 percent in the first quarter due in part to lower income from so-called tax-advantaged products in light of newly lowered tax rates. 
Lower tax-equivalent yields on municipal bonds should weigh on year-over-year comparisons of the lender's net interest margin by around 4 basis points for the rest of the year, Shrewsberry said on an analyst call. 

The third-largest U.S. bank by assets also flagged that tax changes had weighed on new debt issuance and secondary trading, though strong equity trading helped boost its total trading-related revenue.

1196,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Analyst Who Called '98 Russia Crash Says Stock Outlook Is `Grim',"(Bloomberg) -- Veteran Russia strategist John-Paul Smith has a warning for anyone looking to buy the nation’s stocks on the cheap after this week’s selloff.
“Investors could become collateral damage from the actions of either side in the new cool war,” Smith, a former  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) strategist and founder of research firm Ecstrat, said in a note published Friday. While he doesn’t rule out a short-term rebound in the ruble or the nation’s benchmark equity index after the market rout, the longer-term prognosis “remains grim.”
Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS Index suffered its biggest weekly plunge in more than two years after the harshest U.S. sanctions to date blocked trading of a handful of companies, including billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s metals giant United Co. Rusal. While some traders see the panic selling around the move as a buying opportunity, others are questioning whether all Russian assets are now vulnerable to penalties.
For Smith, investors have indeed “been far too complacent about the implications” of the standoff between Russia and the West, which he described as “a clash of political, economic and financial systems.”
A long-time bear on Russia, Smith won recognition for warning early in 1998 that investors were too optimistic on the country’s assets, saying it faced an unsustainable financial crisis that could trigger a devaluation. Months later, the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt and the ruble went into freefall.
Investors are now waiting to see how Russia will retaliate against the U.S. penalties. Proposals currently under consideration include curbs on imports of American farm products and cooperation in nuclear energy and space launches, as well as a possible ban on titanium sales to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. Another key risk is the escalation of the conflict in Syria, where the U.S. and Russia are also at loggerheads.
Washington’s sanctions “seem to be achieving their purpose by firing a so-far-metaphorical shot across the bows of the Kremlin,” Smith said. “The next move is left hanging in the air, but it is clear that almost any of the major listed companies could become targets for actions by the U.S., which would cause much broader complications.”

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",WPP's Sorrell to attend board meeting as investigation continues: source,"LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) Chief Executive Martin Sorrell is expected to attend a long-planned board meeting next Tuesday despite an ongoing investigation into an allegation of misconduct that was ordered by the directors, a person familiar with his plans said.
WPP stunned the industry last week when it said it had appointed lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sorrell, the founder of the company who built a two-man outfit into the world's biggest advertising group with 200,000 employees.
Sorrell, 73, has said the allegation regards the misuse of public funds and that he denies them unreservedly. 
One person familiar with the process said the investigation was unlikely to be resolved before the end of next week. A second person familiar with Sorrell's plans said he was expected to attend the meeting because he has continued to work as normal throughout the investigation.
Both spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. The board meeting has been scheduled in the diary for many months. 
The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into the world's biggest advertising group by three decades of relentless dealmaking and is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in Britain.
The company is now present in 112 countries and provides services to clients including Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR),  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) and P&G through creative agencies such as J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather, and research groups and media buyers.

The U.S. Treasury on April 6 announced sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world.
""The sanctions are likely to have a profound effect on the designated companies, which would be unable to transact in U.S. dollars - the standard denomination currency in commodities trading and the main currency in counterparty transactions in international trading,"" Fitch said.
The sanctions hit Russian markets hard, denting the rouble and sending shares in four publicly listed companies with links to those sanctioned plummeting both in Russia and elsewhere: Rusal (HK:0486), EN+ Group (L:ENPLq), GAZ group (MM:GAZA) and Polyus (MM:PLZL). 
Fitch said it stopped rating Rusal and EN+ Group, describing the latest round of sanctions as ""the most significant affecting Russian corporates"" since 2014 when the West first imposed sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's role in the Ukrainian crisis.
According to Reuters calculations, three Russian tycoons targeted by a new list of U.S. sanctions may have lost a combined $7.5 billion in less than a week since the list was announced. 
Fitch noted Russia's strong external balance sheet, saying it means Russia is well positioned to meet forex needs from other parts of the economy, while the free-floating rouble provides a shock absorber, something that was not available in 2014. 
""However, uncertainty stemming from the sanctions and their possible extension could deter investment and thereby undermine potential economic growth,"" Fitch said.
This year, the economy is on track to grow by up to two percent, the central bank forecast, after expanding by 1.5 percent in 2017.
Fitch revised Russia's sovereign rating outlook to positive from stable in September and said the rating itself would be one notch higher than its current BBB- level if not the U.S. sanctions.

1213,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo's Revenue Beats Estimates Despite Punishment by Fed,"(Bloomberg) --  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. reported higher profit and a smaller drop in revenue than Wall Street expected, after the Federal Reserve prohibited the scandal-plagued bank from increasing assets until it fixes its missteps.
First-quarter revenue fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier to $21.9 billion, the San Francisco-based lender said Friday in a statement. That beat the $21.7 billion average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The bank warned that it may need to take a charge in coming weeks to resolve a regulatory matter.
“We recognize that it will take time to put all of our challenges behind us,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said in the statement.
Profit also beat Wall Street expectations, climbing 5.7 percent.
Shares of Wells Fargo rose 1.3 percent to $53.36 at 8:10 a.m. in New York. The stock had dropped 13 percent this year through Thursday, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.
In February, the Fed curbed Wells Fargo’s progress toward recovering from a long-running scandal involving misleading sales practices at its consumer bank. Since then, the nation’s third-largest lender by assets has faced more scrutiny, with the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission examining the wealth-management unit, a person familiar with the probes had said.
The bank said it’s in ongoing discussions with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency over issues in its auto lending and mortgage units. Those regulators have offered to resolve the matter for $1 billion in penalties, which could force the lender to revise its latest results. Wells Fargo booked a record $3.25 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to regulatory investigations, sales practices and other matters.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). also reported first-quarter results Friday, with both posting strong gains in equities trading as stock-market volatility exploded after several years of relative calm.

 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported a 6% jump in quarterly profit but was also hit by a penalty of $1 billion to settle an investigation related to auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses. Its stocks fell 1.76%.
Stocks were also bolstered on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on his response to the suspected chemical attack in Syria, as tensions between the U.S. and Russia eased.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 10:52AM ET</span>",U.S. funds file suit alleging banks' collusion in Mexico bond market,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two U.S. pension funds filed a proposed class action in New York on March 30 against financial institutions in the market for Mexican government bonds, alleging they conspired to fix prices.
The lawsuit was filed by the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension & Retirement System and the Electrical Workers Pension Fund Local.
The banks named in the lawsuit are  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria,  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co, HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
The lawsuit, first reported by Mexican newspaper Reforma, stems from an investigation announced by the Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or Cofece, in April 2017, into possible breaches of competition laws in the public debt market.
The case, which Cofece described as its largest probe to date into public debt sales, reflects the Mexican government's halting efforts to increase market oversight. 
The lawsuit comes amid a wave of private litigation in New York federal court accusing big banks of conspiring to fix interest rate benchmarks and prices for bonds, commodities and currencies at ordinary investors' expense. 
Spokesmen for Barclays and JP Morgan and a spokeswoman for Citi declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The pension funds, which said in the complaint that they had purchased tens of millions of dollars' worth of Mexican government bonds, allege that they overpaid as a result of the banks' pricing scheme. 
The pension funds allege that prices for the bonds rose significantly after Cofece announced its investigation, suggesting the banks had been colluding previously. 
Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment further on the case.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) will be profitable in the third and fourth quarters of this year and will not have to raise any money from investors, billionaire Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Friday, driving shares in the electric carmaker higher. 
Tesla has already sought this month to play down widespread Wall Street speculation that it would need to return to capital markets this year to raise more funds for the money-losing company as it ramps up production of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial to its long-term profitability. 
The Silicon Valley car maker, which has consistently fallen short of promised production targets and is fighting bad publicity over a fatal crash of a car using its Autopilot system, said 10 days ago it would have positive cash flow from the third quarter.
Musk went further on Friday in a tweeted response to a story in The Economist which cited estimates Tesla would need $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year in additional funding. 
""The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it's just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money,"" Musk wrote.
Tesla shares, which have gained nearly 10 percent since disclosing the Model 3 production numbers on April 3, were up 1.8 percent in afternoon trading on Wall Street. 
Musk's claim about profit and cash flow hinges on a rapid rise in production of the Model 3 sedan, Tesla's latest vehicle to have experienced production delays. That has postponed revenue from reaching Tesla's bottom line from cars being delivered to customers.
An unprecedented level of robots used in the Model 3's final assembly, in a break with automotive manufacturing norms, has added complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged on Friday. 
""Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake,"" Musk tweeted. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.""
Thomson Reuters consensus of analyst estimates predicts Tesla's free cash flow to be negative well into 2019, thanks in part to heavy investments. Only one of 19 analysts covering the stock see positive adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, with that number growing to four for the fourth quarter.
Wall Street brokerage Jefferies, which provided the funding estimate cited by The Economist, said in a note last week it expects refinancing risk to remain high for Tesla until it can consistently produce 10,000 Model 3s a week.
The company again missed its own 2,500 target for weekly production at the end of the first quarter, and analysts and fund managers doubt Tesla's ability to keep production growing to a promised 5,000 Model 3s per week in three months time.
Musk in July said Tesla was going through ""manufacturing hell"" in ramping up production of the Model 3.
He told ""CBS News"" in an interview that aired Friday the company ""got complacent"" and ""put too much new technology into the Model 3 all at once."" Part of the interview took place in a Tesla Model 3 Musk was driving with Autopilot activated at times. 
Musk told CBS Tesla is currently producing 2,000 Model 3 cars a week.
Last month, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s credit rating to B3 from B2, reflecting ""the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company’s Model 3.""
Moody's added that its negative outlook for Tesla ""reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.""
On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board said that after a series of public disclosures by Tesla it had taken the unusual step of revoking Tesla's status as a formal party to its investigation of a March 23 crash in California that killed a driver who was using Autopilot. The NTSB is also investigating two other Tesla crashes.
Tesla lashed out at the NTSB and said it planned to complain to Congress.
Asked by CBS if there was a defect with Autopilot, Musk responded: ""The system worked as described, which is that it is a hands-on system. It is not a self-driving system.""

At one point during the interview, Musk did not have his hands on the wheel and the car beeped at him to retake the wheel.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Options markets still flashing red for Russia's battered rouble,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's rouble has endured its worst week in more than 2-1/2 years but foreign exchange derivatives predict more pain ahead as bond and equity investors continue slashing exposure to the market after tough new sanctions from the United States.
While a market bounce in the past two days has helped the rouble nearly halve its weekly losses since Wednesday, option market indicators such as implied volatility and risk reversals on the Russian currency remain at extremely elevated levels.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected swings in a currency - surged this week to over 20 , effectively predicting a rouble swing of nearly 20 percent. The vol, as it is known in market parlance, stood below 10 last Friday. 
(GRAPHIC: Rouble Vol jumps https://reut.rs/2qtwIgt)
More significant for the near-term outlook is the inversion in the implied volatility curve, with one-month options trading well above longer-dated ones, something which has happened in the rouble curve fewer than 10 times in the past decade.
Such has been the jump in front-end that the spread between one-year and one-month vol has inverted to its biggest level in nearly three years. 
""What the rouble vol surge indicates is that the market can no longer price a stable path for the rouble being in a range and that will continue,"" Unicredit (MI:CRDI) strategist Kiran Kowshik said who recommends buying a covered call on the dollar against the rouble over a one-month period.
Demand for bets favoring the dollar against the rouble have also mushroomed.
One-month risk reversals, which measure the relative demand for options on a currency rising or falling against the dollar, show a growing bias for further weakness in the rouble , hitting the highest in three years. 
(GRAPHIC: Rouble risk reversals and spot https://reut.rs/2IN3vEP)
The distress stems from Russia's popularity with foreign investors thanks to its low external funding reliance, high bond yields and rising oil prices -- over 70 percent of emerging debt funds were ""overweight"" rouble debt,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates. 
Russia was also the No. 1 holding in emerging equity portfolios, according to Copley Fund Research.
As a result net speculative long rouble positions were above 60 percent of total positions prior to the selloff, data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) showed.
""I don’t think anyone was expecting a 10 percent move. Everyone was so long on Russia, and there was a lot of unwinding. I think the market is still long, so there is some more pain to come,"" said Nikolaos Sgouropoulos, a currency strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
(GRAPHIC: Rouble Positions https://reut.rs/2IRlXMA)
But when sanctions hit, investors who were caught off-guard and unable to immediately liquidate stock and bond positions turned to currency markets to limit investment losses, either by hedging the currency or selling outright.

""The rouble has been hit the most as the most liquid asset class: fixed income investors, for example, tend to hedge negative news by selling the currency as it could take time to liquidate local bond holdings,"" said Gabriele Foa, a market strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in London.

(Reuters) - Two U.S. regulators have proposed  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) pay $1 billion in penalties to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses at the third largest U.S. bank, overshadowing its first quarter results.
The San Francisco-based lender, which reported a quarterly profit, said it may have to restate results to reflect the final settlement. The proposed penalties were reported earlier this week by Reuters.
Analysts said that while the $1 billion penalty would not make a significant dent to its balance sheet, it may take the bank some time to repair the damage to its reputation.
Shares of the bank fell 3.4 percent to $50.89.
""Operationally, Wells Fargo can recover, but reputationally and how a billion dollars will weigh on them - only time can tell,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley in Boston.
""Companies have come back from worse than this but right now they're still in the eye of the storm,"" he added.
The bank, still smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, found inconsistencies at its auto lending and mortgage in the summer of 2017 - leading to further probes by regulators.
To appease investors and regulators, the bank overhauled its operational structure, shook up its board and hired a new compliance officer.
But this failed to impress the U.S. Federal Reserve, which imposed restrictions in February on the bank's growth, forbidding it to expand its balance sheet beyond 2017 levels until it makes internal changes that addressed risk management.
""A bank's balance sheet is the engine for profit growth,"" said Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones. ""The constraints on Well's ability to take on deposits and make new loans will likely result in lagging earnings growth for Wells relative to peers in the near-term.""
Wells estimates restrictions on balance sheet growth will cut annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan repeatedly sought to reassure investors that the bank was stable despite the regulatory restrictions.
""I'm confident that our outstanding team will continue to transform Wells Fargo into a better, stronger company; however, we recognise that it will take time to put all of our challenges behind us,"" Sloan said in the bank's first-quarter results statement on Friday.
But as recently as last month, the bank also said it was examining its wealth and investment management business for possible customer abuse, including overcharging and inappropriate referrals, after inquiries from government agencies.
PROFIT RISES, REVENUE DIPS
Despite its ongoing woes, the bank reported a 6 percent jump in profit, saying net income applicable to common stock rose to $5.53 billion, or $1.12 per share in the quarter ended March 31, from $5.23 billion, or $1.03 per share a year ago. (https://reut.rs/2HgHNMt)
Analysts on average expected $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Wells Fargo has been struggling to reduce expenses, but failed to keep a leash on costs in the quarter despite Sloan's vow to slash $4 billion in costs by 2019 by closing hundreds of branches and taking other measures.
Total noninterest expenses for the first quarter rose 3.3 percent to $14.24 billion.
Sloan reiterated his 2019 cost savings target, and said his non-interest expense dollar target range for full-year 2018 remains unchanged.
In January, the company had said it remained committed to reducing its expenses by $2 billion by the end of 2018.
Total revenue in the quarter fell 1.4 percent to $21.93 billion. Total loans slipped 1.2 percent to $947.3 billion, hurt most by a decline in average loans in its community banking unit, which includes consumer banking.
Non-interest income from mortgage banking, an area where the bank supersedes its peers, fell 23.9 percent due to rising interest rates.

Income tax expenses fell 36 percent to $1.37 billion following President Donald Trump's tax overhaul last year.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, driven by strength in its consumer banking business and a surge in equities trading.
Global consumer banking revenue increased 7 percent on gains in North America, Mexico and Asia. Equity markets revenue jumped 38 percent, gaining from increased volatility in the quarter.
But weakness in the lender's investment banking business was a sore point for investors. Citi's stock was down nearly 3 percent in afternoon trade as the bank reported a 10 percent drop in revenue from the business.
Larger rival JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) quarterly profit was also dented by a 7 decline in investment banking revenue.
""There were a lot of deals announced, but there were not a lot of deals closed on a year-over-year basis,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.
""I think that's going to impact all of those involved in investment banking, Citigroup included.""
Still, Citi's net income rose 13 percent in the first quarter. On a per share basis, Citi earned $1.68, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.61, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""Good quarter for Citi as they continue to show progress in their return of & return on capital mantra,"" Evercore analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients.
The results benefited from a busy trading desk as volatility rocked global markets amid inflation fears and heightened trade tensions, in contrast to a calm 2017.
Total revenue rose about 3 percent to $18.87 billion, while operating expenses rose 2 percent to $10.92 billion.
The rise in equity markets revenue offset a 7 percent drop in Citi's bigger fixed income trading business. Combined, the two were up 1 percent.
Investment banking revenue fell to $1.13 billion from $1.29 billion and Citi blamed ""declines in the overall market wallet and the timing of episodic deal activity.""
Return on tangible common equity, a measure of profitability, reached 11.4 percent in part to the company having had to mark down its equity value in the fourth quarter because of the tax law change.
Citi said in January it expected return on common tangible equity at 10.5 percent for the full year.

Shares of the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets were down 2.8 percent at $70.10. They have gained 23 percent in the last 12 months.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",JPMorgan profit just below estimates on weak investment banking,"By Sweta Singh and David Henry
(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street expectations on Friday as lower revenue from investment banking ate into gains from stock trading and higher interest rates.
Investment banking revenue fell 7 percent as it underwrote fewer debt and equity offerings, a dark spot in an otherwise strong quarterly report.
Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets were down nearly 1 percent, paring early gains. The stock has risen 33 percent in the past 12 months.
JPMorgan gained from a strengthening economy and higher interest rates that lifted lending revenue more than the its cost of money. Its equity markets business had a robust quarter, driven by a surge in volatility in global markets.
Overall, profit rose 35 percent to an all-time high, while revenue was up 10 percent.
""We are pleased with the firm's performance this quarter, with all of our businesses showing continued and broad strength and an overall environment that remains supportive,"" Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a call.
She expects tax cuts and higher interest rates to provide even more of a ""tailwind"" to profits going forward.
JPMorgan, like its rivals, had indicated that President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to the U.S. tax law would kick-start economic growth and help lenders boost their revenue as corporations borrow more to expand their businesses.
Income tax expense was down 8.6 percent at $2.56 billion as the corporate tax rate fell.
Markets revenue rose 7 percent, excluding special items, on a 26 percent jump in equity trading.
Global markets have been in churn since February due to worries over inflation, rising bond yields and heightened trade tensions between the United States and China.
Net interest income rose 9 percent to $13.5 billion as the rates it received for loans rose faster than its costs of funds.
The bank's net income rose 35 percent to $8.71 billion in the quarter.
Excluding items, it earned $2.26 per share, missing average estimate of $2.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Net revenue was $28.52 billion, beating the average estimate of $27.68 billion.

Return on tangible common equity, a performance measure, was 19 percent, compared with 13 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan in February raised its return target for three years out to 17 percent, largely because of lower tax rates.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 07:05AM ET</span>","Want to make money? Invest like Norway's wealth fund, says author","By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund has lessons for retail investors according to a book out this week: Think long-term, don't sell when stocks markets go down and be mindful of your home biases.
The fund invests revenues from the Nordic country's oil and gas production in stocks, bonds and property. 
Set up as a sovereign wealth fund in 1998, after a first cash injection in 1996 of 1.98 billion crowns ($255 million), the fund has grown into the world's largest and is now worth $1 trillion, or $197,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child. 
For Clemens Bomsdorf, a financial journalist who has worked for the Wall Street Journal, Die Zeit and Focus, there were lessons that retail investors could learn from.
His book, ""How to Become Rich Like Norway: Easy Tips on How to Build a Fortune"", is out in Germany this week with translations into English and Norwegian planned. 
""What strikes me ... about the Norwegian wealth fund is that many countries have been rich because of oil. But they have squandered the riches whereas Norway has not,"" the 41-year-old told Reuters. 
""For the average investor, the fund is a very good blueprint.""
The first lesson is to think long-term, he said. The fund was set up for future generations not to generate cash for every purpose. 
""So for retail investors, that means think of putting it away for 15 years at least,"" said Bomsdorf.
The fund tends to always buy stocks, even when markets are low. The 2008 financial crisis coincided with a period when the fund was increasing its share of equities in the fund to 60 percent from 40 percent, which in hindsight was an opportunity. 
The fund's worst ever year, 2008, when the fund lost 23.3 percent of its value, was followed by its best, when it returned 25.6 percent in 2009, partly as a result of that move. 
But Bomsdorf also said there were things retail investors should not do like the fund, such as its tendency to ignore stocks from emerging markets and small caps.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 06:34AM ET</span>","Trade war or not, China is closing the gap on U.S. in technology IP race","By Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's rising investment in research and expansion of its higher education system mean that it is fast closing the gap with the United States in intellectual property and the struggle to be the No.1 global technology power, according to patent experts.
While U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of punitive tariffs on high-tech U.S. exports could slow Beijing's momentum, it won't turn back the tide, they say. Washington's allegation that the Chinese have engaged in intellectual property theft over many years - which is denied by Beijing - is a central reason for the worsening trade conflict between the U.S. and China.
Forecasts for how long it will take for Beijing to close the technological gap vary - though several patent specialists say it could happen in the next decade. And China is already leapfrogging ahead in a couple of areas.
""With the number of scientists China is training every year it will eventually catch up, regardless of what the U.S. does,"" said David Shen, head of IP for China at global law firm Allen & Overy.
Indeed, IP lawyers now see President Xi Jinping's pledge earlier this week to protect foreign IP rights as projecting confidence in China's position as a leading innovator in sectors such as telecommunications and online payments, as well as its ability to catch up in other areas.
Last year, China overtook Japan as the No. 2 patent filer in the world, with 13.4 percent annual growth, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. If maintained, the pace will take it above the United States in just over a year, a strong indication of its ambitions.
That progress has been built on foundations which are likely to strengthen further.
China now spends 2.1 percent of its gross domestic product on research and development, not yet matching U.S. levels of 2.75 percent, but a remarkable increase from just 0.7 percent in the 1990s and nearing the 2.35 percent average among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
World Bank data shows China now produces 1,177 R&D researchers per million of its population, three times the level in the 1990s and in line with the world average. The U.S. produces many more researchers per million - at 4,321 - but that is more than offset by China's population being about four times the size.
And the number of Chinese researchers is only going to increase.
According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, China now enrols more than 40 percent of its students in tertiary education, half the U.S. percentage, but a staggering rise from 0.1 percent in the 1970s.
""If you're looking out 5-10 years you'll see a much more level playing field in terms of innovation, especially around online platforms, digital innovation, machine learning and artificial intelligence,"" said Richard Titherington, chief investment officer for Asian emerging markets at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who overseas $80 billion in assets.
Titherington says online payments is the clearest example where China has leapfrogged the United States, with mobile phones replacing credit cards almost entirely as a form of payment in major Chinese cities, while ""many Americans still use cheques.""
He said that stock markets provide one sign of Chinese progress - at least in the eyes of investors. The total returns on  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) stock since its listing in 2012 were 373 percent, versus 883 percent for its Chinese social media rival Tencent Holdings. In microblogging,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) returned a 28 percent loss since its 2014 listing, while Weibo Corp a whopping 656 percent gain. 
IP experts, however, say China is still behind in areas such as semiconductors, robotics, and biotech.
QUALITY GAP
Patent numbers also do not tell the whole story. There is a perceived gap in quality, which suggests China will take a while longer to catch up.
Smartphone maker Huawei Technologies is the only Chinese company that made it into Clarivate Analytics' top 100 innovators last year, a ranking based not only on patent volumes, but also on their influence on other organizations.
In 2016, China produced almost 500,000 scientific papers according to data from global information analytics firm Elsevier, taking the No.2 spot globally and closing in on America's 600,000. The gap has halved in five years.
But on average, a Chinese paper gets 0.93 citations, versus 1.23 for U.S. documents. Citations are an indication of how valuable a researcher’s work is seen by his or her peers.
On that metric, China is 11 places behind the United States in 33rd, with only countries that published more than 10,000 papers included. Gabriela Kennedy, head of Asia IP at global law firm Mayer Brown JSM, says that could be a proxy for the quality of each country's research work.
""(The Chinese) are very successful in what they're doing in some large companies, but if you look beyond that they're not particularly innovative,"" Kennedy said. ""But I don't think it's going to take them long.""
If Washington wants to slow China's technological advance, it might consider measures that further restrict what products U.S. companies license to Chinese firms and broaden definitions of trade secrets, lawyers say.
But they also warn tougher rules could be counterproductive as firms can find ways around them, including by setting up entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions to maintain access to the vast Chinese market.
""If the U.S. government were to go to the extreme of not allowing U.S. companies to disclose their IP in China, that could hurt the U.S. companies as well,"" said Ling Ho, a partner with law firm Clifford Chance, and a specialist in IP disputes.
POLITICAL WILL
Xi pledged on Tuesday China will protect the intellectual property of foreign firms, saying he hoped foreign countries did the same.
Lawyers say Chinese IP protection laws are comparable to U.S. and European legal standards. The fault is in implementation, with high levels of bureaucracy, court decisions applying on a provincial level rather than nationally and judges often having different interpretations of the laws.
The recent creation of a State Intellectual Property Office, however, shows political intent and should lead to more uniform enforcement, said Loke-Khoon Tan, head of the IP Practice Group in Hong Kong and China at Baker McKenzie and author of the book ""Pirates in the Middle Kingdom: The Art of Trademark War"".
""The political will is articulated in a very powerful way and once it's communicated to each of the bureaucracies lower down I expect very positive things,"" he said. ""Our clients would be more encouraged and incentivised to test their cases.""

The technical requirements implement a deal announced last August following a meeting between Argentine President Mauricio Macri and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence in Buenos Aires.
Argentina had blocked imports of U.S. pork for about 26 years, citing animal health concerns. The deal is expected to open up a potential $10-million-per-year market for U.S. pork producers, the U.S. agencies said.
The United States, the world's leading pork exporter with global sales of $6.5 billion, exports about 27 percent of its pork production, making it highly dependent on foreign markets at a time when hog supplies are growing seasonally. 
Japan, Mexico and Canada are the top three destinations for U.S. pork. 
Since the announcement in August, USDA and USTR have been working with Argentina's Ministry of Agro-Industry on new, science-based market access terms that are consistent with international animal health standards. 
""Once the people of Argentina get a taste of American pork products after all this time, we are sure they'll want more of it,"" USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The deal shows the Trump administration's commitment to trade by launching markets for agricultural products, Perdue added.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 05:28AM ET</span>",Mylan seeks deal for German Merck's consumer products unit: sources,"FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Generic drug maker Mylan (O:MYL) is in advanced discussions to acquire Merck (NYSE:MRK) KGaA's (DE:MRCG) consumer health business after other bidders failed to meet the German company's price expectations, people familiar with the matter said.
The precise value of Mylan's offer could not be established but the sources said the companies were negotiating a price between 3.5 billion and 4 billion euros ($4.3-$4.9 billion). 
There is no certainty that Mylan will secure a deal, the sources said, adding that Merck had also been in talks with private equity groups on the asset.
Mylan's talks with Merck come as other contenders for the business, including Nestle (S:NESN) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB) dropped out of the bidding.
Merck said last year it was looking to sell its consumer healthcare business, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, to help to fund its research into prescription drugs. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck declined to comment, while Mylan did not respond to requests for comment.
Mylan has in the past bought assets from the German rival, paying 5 billion euros in 2007 for Merck's generics business, which included branded drugs like EpiPen for treatment of life-threatening allergic reactions and DuoNeb for treatment of smokers' lung. 
Consumer health is a fragmented sector ranging from over-the-counter medicines and vitamins to sports nutrition products and condoms.
It has proved fertile ground for deals in recent years, as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand.
But the global consumer health market has slowed, from 4 to 6 percent like-for-like sales growth to zero to 3 percent growth,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in December.
Major players in the over-the-counter market have been grappling with pricing pressure stoked by online players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) and private label competitors.
However, buyers and sellers have struggled to agree on deals, as estimates differ over how commoditized many of these products are. 
 Pfizer  Inc's (N:PFE) sales process for its consumer health business, which it was hoping would fetch as much as $20 billion, has also stalled, sources have said. 
Merck's over-the-counter brands up for sale include Neurobion vitamins and Seven Seas nutritional supplements.
Mylan has been looking for acquisitions to bolster growth. It said in February its fourth-quarter earnings fell due to declining revenue from EpiPen and weak U.S. prices for generic drugs.

GM Korea said its 2017 net loss came in 1.16 trillion won ($1.1 billion), 84 percent bigger than its loss the previous year.
It made an operating loss of 854 billion won, compared to 531 billion won in 2016. 
GM Korea said the result was due to large fixed costs for unused facilities and ""continuously rising labor costs,"" adding that business conditions in South Korea and overseas had deteriorated.

1254,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 03:51AM ET</span>",U.S. trade war fears ripple through China's 'workshop of the world',"By James Pomfret
DONGGUAN, China (Reuters) - Allan Chau, the general manager of a Chinese factory making precision metal parts for U.S. customers, is still calling it a ""proposed"" trade war, but that hasn't stopped him from planning for the worst.
Unlike last year, when U.S. President Donald Trump sounded protectionist warnings that were largely dismissed as bluster, Chau and other factory bosses across China say the risks from this trade spat are now far more tangible.
As a result they warn of a possible wave of small factory closures, a shift of some production away from China, and the use of questionable practices to dodge increased tariffs.
""Before, we didn't think we're affected because we're doing little metallic parts,"" said Chau at his three-storey beige-colored-plant in Dongguan. ""(Now), everybody is talking about this proposed war."" 
The city of Dongguan is one of the main export hubs in southern China's Pearl River Delta. The region has been dubbed the ""workshop of the world"" and accounts for around a quarter of China's exports.
As hundreds of computer-controlled lathes hummed around him, fashioning slender aluminum, steel and brass rods into intricate parts, Chau pointed out a car valve, the size of a thumb - used in car braking systems assembled in U.S. plants - as an example of a product caught up in the storm.
Of the 1,500 or so metal parts made in Chau's plant, including needles for espresso machines to puncture coffee capsules, he says around 200 could be hit by the proposed U.S. tariffs that stand to affect $50 billion worth of Chinese goods.
""If they're going to propose 25 percent tax on those things, we have a lot of counter-measures we've got to do to keep ourselves alive,"" said Chau, whose company, Tien Po International, has run factories in China for more than 30 years.
Chau says he's now considering building a warehouse in Malaysia, Vietnam or Thailand, where he could ship his goods for re-export, or he talks of setting up a small factory in a Southeast Asian country to avoid the increased tariffs altogether.
EXACERBATE THE PAIN
China's reliance on exports as an economic driver has declined over the past decade, with total exports as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product dropping to 18 percent in 2017 from 35 percent in 2006, according to research by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
But at a more micro level, at the heart of China's vast industrial supply chains, the tariffs stand to exacerbate the pain of already struggling plants. 
Many have already been buffeted by an appreciating currency, soaring wage costs, and labor shortages as a younger generation shuns a life on the factory floor.
The Trump threat has been a further sideswipe for many exporters and soured sentiment, even as the full implications are unclear. 
""The U.S. is a huge market and some of the companies, especially those less competitive, may be washed out,"" said Danny He, the founder of Alpha Lighting, a small LED maker in Dongguan with 100 workers.
In interviews with six other Chinese manufacturers of LED lighting products, another affected sector, four expect some closures of Chinese factories, particularly those making more generic products like bulbs and LED panels.
Places like Dongguan, with large clusters of grittier industrial plants, are especially vulnerable.
Dongguan's economic growth of 8.1 percent last year while robust, doesn't fully reflect its long struggle to upgrade rusting factories and catch up with the likes of neighboring technology powerhouse Shenzhen.
""If you are those without special technology or products, you will die,"" said Rose Qiu, a director with Zhejiang Fonda Technology, another LED maker. 
Jacky Patel, the president of OM Lighting, an exporter of Chinese lighting products to several U.S. states including Florida, said the tariffs would be passed onto U.S. consumers.
""The customer will have to pay 30 to 35 percent more.""
""They won't be happy but we have no other choice. We just have to go with the flow.""
All six LED makers interviewed by Reuters also said they would pass on any extra costs to U.S. customers.
""We are considering moving our core market out of the U.S., said James Chou, the boss of Poly Dragon, who has run an LED factory in Dongguan for the past 17 years. 
""I worry even more about the global economy going into a recession under a trade war.""
Chinese manufacturers talk of being stuck in limbo.
""Over in the U.S. right now they don't dare make new orders ... So everyone is just monitoring things and no one knows what will happen next,"" said Chau from the precision metal parts factory. 
GREY AREAS
Under a so-called harmonized system of tariffs - Chinese products are now coded specifically so that the same product would face higher U.S. tariffs if used in a higher-tech sector like nuclear energy, rather than a more generic category like household electronics.
""There's still a gray area,"" said one manufacturer who declined to be named, adding that there was scope for some factories to fudge such codes to avoid tariffs.
He said some U.S. customers were also proposing components be shipped to Mexico to blur the country of origin. Such a practice could technically be illegal. 
More broadly, should the retaliatory trade moves escalate, and the U.S. slap tariffs on more mainstream goods like household appliances, consumer electronics or toys, the repercussions would be substantially higher.
Ye Xiaqing, with the China Household Electrical Appliance Association, told Reuters that so far, only 5 percent of household appliance exports to the U.S. were affected by the proposed increase in tariffs.
""If they impose tax on the household appliances, they're going to raise the price and that will affect the citizens of the U.S. at the end,"" said Chau, the Dongguan factory owner.
""Donald Trump doesn't want to do that. He's already pissed off enough people there.""

The company, whose sales fell a sharp 30 percent in February, said on Friday its sales in the first three months of this year totaled 207,139 vehicles, down 19 percent from a year earlier. 
The big decline in February volume was due in part to fewer working days in the month because of a late Chinese lunar new year holiday, but Ford's first-quarter numbers reveal the continued difficulty facing the Michigan-based automaker.

Company officials have said Ford's business in China this year will remain pressured by a dearth of new or significantly redesigned cars models in its product lineup – a situation they indicated should last through the end of 2018 or through early 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares inched up to new one-month highs on Friday as trade tensions showed signs of easing, while results disappointments drove some sharp moves.
The STOXX 600 rose 0.2 percent while Germany's DAX, which is highly sensitive to trade and China, gained 0.5 percent after U.S. President Trump made comments indicating he would want to avoid a Sino-U.S. trade war and rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.
""Markets have given cautious welcome to this news. Welcome, because avoiding a trade war is a clear economic positive. Cautious, because market trust in U.S. presidential announcements is, perhaps, a little limited,"" said UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan.
The index was on track for its third straight week of gains, its longest winning streak since January.
Investors have begun to shrug off geopolitical concerns to focus instead on a results season expected to support equity markets. 
The beginnings of European companies' first-quarter results were largely positive, though misses were badly punished. 
Shares in British software firm Sage sank 19 percent, the biggest decline on the STOXX, after the company cut its full-year revenue guidance as software subscription growth slowed in the first half.
On the other hand, Finnish paper maker Stora Enso gained 3.7 percent after reporting stronger than expected first-quarter results. 
Cosmetics giant L'Oreal reported a strong sales beat thanks to good performance from China and luxury cosmetics.
""L'Oreal reported a much stronger-than-expected start to the year as first-quarter like-for-like sales growth of +6.8 percent came in well ahead of DB and consensus (forecasts), undoubtedly making L'Oreal best-in-class among its European HPC (and staples) peers,"" wrote  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts. 
But the shares came back after touching a five-month high in early deals, last trading up just 0.5 percent. Traders put the muted reaction down to technical selling and profit-taking. 
M&A news continued to be a key driver. 
Klepierre shares rose 2.2 percent after the commercial real estate firm said it had dropped a bid for Hammerson and would not pursue a takeover of the UK firm.
""Klepierre throws in the towel,"" wrote Stifel analysts, adding they do not see a different potential bidder for Hammerson. 
Hammerson's shares meanwhile dropped 13 percent to trade at 452.7 pence, erasing nearly all the gains the stock had made after Klepierre's first takeover bid on March 19.
Micro Focus rose 5.4 percent to the top of the STOXX, its second day of strong gains after reports Elliott Management had taken a stake in the firm.
Elsewhere Galapagos rose 4.2 percent after the biotech firm said its Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis drug was moving into phase III trials.
Overall mining and industrial stocks were the best-performing, enjoying a boost from metals prices which surged higher this week after sanctions on Russian aluminum firm Rusal.

The EU and the United States imposed sanctions on two Russian high-ranking energy ministry officials and two Russian companies involved in delivering the turbines to Crimea.

The move follows a decision by European Union privacy watchdogs to look deeper into the harvesting of personal data from social networks for economic or political purposes.
Outside the United States, the Philippines had the largest amount of user data acquired by Cambridge Analytica, with 1.17 million accounts in the country affected, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) said last week.
In a letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, dated April 11, the NPC said it would look into how Facebook shares personal data of Filipino users with third parties, and demand concrete action to protect their data privacy rights.
""We are launching an investigation into Facebook to determine whether there is unauthorized processing of personal data of Filipinos, and other possible violations of the Data Privacy Act,"" it said in the letter, made available to the media on Friday.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company is committed to protecting people's information and is engaged with the Philippines' privacy watchdog.
""We've recently made significant updates to make our privacy tools easier to find, restrict data access on Facebook, and make our terms and data policy clearer,"" Facebook said.
Recent research has shown Filipinos to be among the most active social media users in the world, spending on average more than four hours a day on platforms like Facebook.
Facebook has admitted that personal data of nearly 87 million users was improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign among its clients.
A Hong Kong newspaper has said several people involved in President Rodrigo Duterte's 2016 election campaign had met in 2015 with Alexander Nix, the now-suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica. 
Those officials said the meeting with Nix was during a lunch break at an information technology seminar in Manila and there has been no contact since.
The president's spokesman said on Tuesday that Duterte's election campaign did not rely on information bought from anybody, nor did it hire Cambridge Analytica's services. 
Duterte, a former mayor from outside of the sphere of national politics, successfully tapped Filipinos' insatiable appetite for social media to help him win a 2016 election by a huge margin.
His office uses social media with gusto, courting popular bloggers, in some cases hiring them, to promote Duterte and discredit his opponents, and amplifying the message through ""shares"" and ""likes"". 
Duterte, however, has said he does not need social media, and on Friday denied any links to Cambridge Analytica.

""Why will I pay those Cambridge fools to work on my campaign? I could have lost with that,"" Duterte told reporters.

Last weekend retail banking specialist Christian Sewing replaced John Cryan as Deutsche's CEO, raising the prospect of radical change at Germany's flagship lender, which has been slower than rivals to reform after the financial crisis.
S&P said the placing of the bank's ""A-"" long-term issuer credit rating on credit watch with negative implications reflected its view that the restructuring could now take longer and cost more than current expectations.
The agency affirmed its ratings on Deutsche Bank's subordinated debt issues.
S&P said it believed that Sewing and the leadership team had the expertise to carry out the bank's restructuring, adding that it would be better placed to assess the management's strategy in coming weeks once Sewing's priorities are known.
""This change could still act as a springboard for the bank to move more rapidly toward a sustainable, solidly profitable business model. However, in our view, it also implies that the bank may need to broaden the restructuring effort,"" S&P said.
The agency said it would decide by the end of May at the latest whether to downgrade Deutsche Bank's credit ratings once further details of the new leadership's strategy are known.
 Deutsche Bank  said it respected S&P's decision and appreciated the agency's statement showing trust in the new leadership team.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) top labor representative has backed the company's management shake-up, signaling that new CEO Herbert Diess could face less resistance in his efforts to revamp Europe's biggest carmaker than in his previous role.
Diess was appointed late on Thursday to succeed ousted group chief Matthias Mueller as part of an overhaul that includes the streamlining of VW's multiple car brands into three groups while preparing its truck business for a potential listing.
""We are convinced that, with Diess, we have the right man on board,"" works council chief Bernd Osterloh said in a letter to employees on Friday.
Osterloh's comments come after repeated clashes over Diess's drive to cut costs and improve profits at the carmaker's core VW brand, where Diess was handed the reins only three months before the Dieselgate emissions scandal erupted.
The labor chief had accused Diess of betraying workers and trying to use the emissions scandal as a pretext for pushing through job cuts.
""Back then, we were not immediately on the same page,"" Osterloh said in his letter. ""But, as is well known, that issue was laid to rest a long time ago."" 
Osterloh and Diess struck a deal in November 2016 on cost savings and job cuts through natural attrition, and on Friday Osterloh said job security and profitability were now equally important at the company.
The planned group overhaul is Volkswagen's biggest revamp since it became a multi-brand conglomerate under former CEO Ferdinand Piech, a grandson of VW Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche.
Osterloh said that labor representatives also back Volkswagen's decision to prepare its truck and bus division for ""capital market readiness"" by making it a public limited company.
""The works councils of Scania and MAN support this next step because it continues the work done so far,"" he said.

Shares in Volkswagen rose 0.8 percent to 178.04 euros by 0800 GMT, against a 0.5 percent rise for the STOXX 600 automotive index (SXAP).

Rolls said it would reprioritize spending to mitigate the costs and kept its 2018 free cash flow guidance unchanged at around 450 million pounds ($643 million), give or take 100 million pounds. 
Shares in Rolls, one of the biggest names in British manufacturing, were down 1 percent at 1053 GMT.
It announced the need for stepped up inspections after liaising with authorities over a separate issue with the compressor on Trent 1000 Package C series engines. 
Rolls said there were 380 such engines in service. 
Boeing said about 25 percent of the 787 Dreamliners flying were powered by the engine and it was deploying support teams to mitigate service disruptions. 
 General Electric  (N:GE) engines used on some 787s are not affected.
SHORTAGES
The need to inspect and repair Trent 1000 engines has led to an industry-wide shortage. 
East said Rolls was working with Boeing and airlines to minimize the disruption. 
""Our team of technical experts and service engineers is working around the clock to ensure we return them to full service as soon as possible,"" he said.
A Rolls spokesman added that aviation safety regulators would be issuing guidance to the airlines in the coming days. ""We recognize that the application of these actions may cause additional disruption to our airline customers.""
Virgin Atlantic said it had up to four 787s grounded at any one time while it sourced replacement engines with Rolls. 
Virgin has also leased three Airbus A330-200s to help cover its flying program. 
A Virgin spokeswoman said it had been aware of the increased inspections announced on Friday and that the cover it had in place would be sufficient.
British Airways, Japan's ANA, Air New Zealand and Thai Airways, which also use Trent 1000 engines, were not available for immediate comment.
Scoot, a budget carrier owned by Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), said it expected some impact on operations.
In December, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ordered airlines to replace some Rolls Trent 1000 engines. 

In March, Rolls said the cash hit from the problem should hit a peak of 340 million pounds in 2018 before falling in 2019.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Goldman's Schwimmer to steer London Stock Exchange through Brexit,"By Maiya Keidan, Noor Zainab Hussain and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) named Goldman Sachs' veteran David Schwimmer as chief executive officer on Friday, with an initial challenge of helping the 300-year-old institution to navigate Brexit.
Analysts expressed relief that the LSE had finally been able to find an external candidate after a boardroom battle involving activist hedge fund TCI led to the departure last November of CEO Xavier Rolet.
Schwimmer, a 49-year old New Yorker who has been with Goldman for 20 years and most recently served as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in investment banking, takes up the role at the start of August.
Schwimmer, who attended Harvard Law School and Yale University, will earn an annual salary of 775,000 pounds ($1.11 million), with a bonus of up to 225 percent of his salary, LSE said.
He will also get 1.05 million pounds in compensation in March next year for giving up his 2018 cash awards at Goldman.
Frenchman Rolet left after almost a decade at the helm, during which he transformed the company with a string of deals, lifting its market value to almost 14 billion pounds from less than 1 billion.
Schwimmer takes charge as Britain's planned departure from the European Union in 2019 raises questions about the LSE's strategy at the heart of Europe's biggest financial center.
Although the LSE owns the Milan Exchange and has clearing operations in Paris, it is unclear how much direct access financial firms in Britain will have to EU customers after Brexit.
Schwimmer will have to protect LSE's dominance in euro clearing as rival Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt is already seeking to exploit uncertainty to build up business.
He will also lead the LSE's efforts to woo oil giant Saudi Aramco  to London for what is expected to be the world's largest initial public offering.
""David is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector ... as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets,"" LSE Chairman Donald Brydon said in a statement. 
""He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike,"" Brydon added.
Group CFO David Warren, who was acting CEO, will continue as the company's finance boss.
TAKEOVER TARGET?
The LSE is seen in the market as a takeover target rather than a predator with rivals Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE) and CME (O:CME) in the United States long seen as suitors, analysts said.
""We think the appointment of Mr. Schwimmer, a former M&A banker, will allow LSE to continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities, in line with LSE's strategy,"" UBS analyst Michael Werner said in a note to clients.
UBS sees no big change in the LSE's focus on developing its suite of indexes and the LCH clearing unit.
Hedge fund TCI, an LSE investor, predicted a 15 billion pound bid for the group from ICE and CME during an investor conference call earlier this year.
Rolet's exit triggered a fight between Brydon and TCI, whose attempt to push him out was eventually defeated at a shareholder meeting in December.
Brydon has said he will not stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in 2019. 
Since TCI's defeat, LSE shares have risen more than 14 percent as investors bet on a takeover approach after a planned tie-up with Deutsche Boerse collapsed. LSE shares were up marginally at 4240 pence at 1010 GMT.
Graphic: LSE share and EPS performance under Chairman Brydon https://reut.rs/2GS677M
TCI holds a 5.18 percent stake in LSE, and its founder Chris Hohn, declined to comment on Friday when contacted by Reuters.
Rolet was credited with turning LSE into a diversified exchange group by buying a controlling stake in LCH, one of the world's biggest clearing houses, and expanding the bourse's activities in stock indexes.
Under Rolet's leadership, LSE was unable to seal a merger with Deutsche Boerse, the third attempt at an Anglo-German tie up.
""It hasn't been an orthodox transition, but we’re pleased to see clear leadership being put in place,” said a top-20 investor in LSE.
LSE emerged from what was a troubling 2017 with a 47 percent profit jump despite turgid markets.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 01:52AM ET</span>",More delays in GE power plants a worry for Pakistan's ruling party,"By Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A pledge by Pakistan's ruling party to end electricity outages ahead of a general election in mid-2018 is being undermined by the possibility of further delays in new power plants that run on General Electric's flagship gas turbines.
State-owned gas company Pakistan LNG has been diverting liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments earmarked for the three plants, trade and government sources said, a move suggesting doubts in parts of the government that the power plants would not be at full capacity in time for the election, likely to be held in July.
The delays come at a rocky time for GE's power business, which suffered a 45 percent drop in profit last year in part due to weak sales of new power equipment and services. GE's shares have plunged more than 50 percent in the past 12 months and the power unit is cutting 12,000 jobs, 18 percent of its workforce. 
Pakistan made a big bet on the promised efficiency of GE's new flagship 9HA gas turbines as part of its solution to crippling power outages - pushing to finish three new plants in a shorter than usual time frame.
The Pakistan plants, being constructed by Chinese contractors, were together due to add 3,600 megawatts of power by January this year after the final phase of installation. Now, some officials say, they are likely to come on stream over April and May.
A senior energy official told Reuters that Pakistan had been scheduled to import 540 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas for the power plants, but that this has been slashed to about 250-300 mmcfd until around July.
A trader familiar with the situation confirmed LNG cargoes were being shipped elsewhere instead of Pakistan due to power plant delays. 
The energy ministry in Islamabad did not respond to requests for comment.
Asked about the possible delays, GE did not say when the plants were likely to be fully operational. It said its role is to provide equipment to the project contractors.
""GE understands the significance of the projects to help meet Pakistan’s growing energy demands and has repeatedly gone beyond contractually-defined obligations to support them,"" a GE spokesperson said. 
""We remain committed to helping our (contractor) customers bring the plants online as soon as possible."" 
ENDING ""LOAD SHEDDING""
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) swept to power in 2013 vowing to end power outages that have crippled most of the country, and in the past year senior PML-N politicians have frequently touted the reduction in blackouts as proof the country is on a path to increased prosperity.
Since PML-N assumed office, scheduled outages, also known as load shedding, in urban areas has sharply reduced from about 12 hours a day during peak summer demand to about a few hours last summer. This summer, the government has promised there will be no load shedding.
A key plank of PML-N's plan to fulfill their electoral promise rests on the three major power stations.
But the delays to the three plants, all in Pakistan's most populous state Punjab, have unnerved PML-N officials. Punjab is the party's power base.
One senior PML-N official said he believes outages will be ended if two of the three LNG plants are operational by May.
""It really is going down to the wire but we still think we will be able to pull it off,"" he said.
Two weeks ago, GE said a Reliability Run Test (RRT) test has been completed on Haveli, one of the three power plants, with the turbines running ""under real conditions, without any failure, for a period of 7 days"".
That signals that the Haveli plant is close to being fully functional.
All the Pakistani officials said they expect Haveli to begin operating fully by mid-April at combined cycle mode, when the turbines can generate maximum capacity of 1,230MW. 
The senior PML-N official said it was hoped Bhikki, a sister LNG plant, would come online in late April.
But the third plant, Balloki, has been delayed due to a ""bushing problem on a transformer"", which means the aim for the plant to come online between mid-to-late May, according to a second senior energy ministry official.
He added the delays were due to ambitious deadlines for plants that are normally constructed in 35-40 months. 
""The Chinese and GE have tried to do it in 27 months but they are more likely to do it in 30-32 months. That's not so bad,"" he said, adding that the plants are 30-year projects and would save Pakistan huge sums in the long term.
The senior PML-N figure said he hoped voters who remember daily rolling blackouts of 12 hours per day in urban areas would be willing to overlook outages of an hour or two.
""I think people will be more than willing to forgive us,"" he said.
However, others within the ruling party are skeptical.
""If load shedding persists or gets worse, it's going to affect the results for PML-N,"" said Enver Baig, a retired senator and active PML-N member who has been critical of the party's leadership.

""You have these very hot summers in Pakistan, and everyone is heating up. Of course their anger will come out on the day of the election.""

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 01:43AM ET</span>",Trade war backfire: Steel tariff shrapnel hits U.S. farmers,"By Tom Polansek and P.J. Huffstutter
KANE COUNTY, Ill. (Reuters) - Lucas Strom, who runs a century-old family farm in rural Illinois, canceled an order to buy a new $71,000 grain storage bin last month - after the seller raised the price 5 percent in a day. 
The reason: steel prices jumped right after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs.
Throughout U.S. farm country, where Trump has enjoyed strong support, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are boosting costs for equipment and infrastructure and causing some farmers and agricultural firms to scrap purchases and expansion plans, according to Reuters' interviews with farmers, manufacturers, construction firms and food shippers.
The impact of rising steel prices on agriculture illustrates the unintended and unpredictable consequences of aggressive protectionism in a global economy. And the blow comes as farmers fear a more direct hit from retaliatory tariffs threatened by China on crops such as sorghum and soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export.
A&P Grain Systems in Maple Park, Illinois - the seller of the storage bin Strom wanted to buy with a neighboring farmer - raised its price two days after Trump announced aluminum and steel tariffs on March 1 to protect U.S. producers of the metals. Strom and his neighbor backed out. 
""Would that price destroy us? No,"" Strom said. ""But these days, you have to be smart about your expenses.""
The metals tariffs also hitting makers and sellers of farm equipment, from smaller firms like A&P Grain to global giants such as Deere & Co (N:DE) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT). Such firms are struggling with whether and how to pass along their higher raw materials costs to farmers who are already reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut.
The world's two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods recent weeks. 
Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China. He has since temporarily excluded the European Union and six other allies from the duties and given them until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions.
A&P Grain President Dave Altepeter said the steel used in their bins is made in the United States, but domestic steel prices also have soared because of the tariffs.
U.S. steel mills typically adjust their prices once a year, normally in the first quarter, Altepeter said. But this year, those prices have jumped four times, he said.
The price of steel used in A&P's grain bins has jumped about 20 percent since January 1.
""Any time there's any type of negative talk that affects the steel mill, they’ve raised the price,"" said Altepeter.
Last year, about 95,000 tons of steel was shipped to the agriculture industry, compared to the 14 million tons for the U.S. auto industry, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.
Other factors had been driving up steel prices before the recent trade disputes, including an improving global economy and accelerating manufacturing and construction, particularly in the U.S.
The White House referred questions from Reuters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have vowed the U.S. government will protect farmers from China's tariffs, but not explained how. 
U.S. farmers can ill-afford any loss of sales. Farm income has dropped by more than half since 2013, following years of massive harvests that have depressed prices for staples such as corn and soybeans.
U.S. competitors Brazil, Argentina and Russia have all raised grain output in recent years, eating into the U.S. share of global markets. Mexico imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year and is set to buy even more in 2018 on worries that renegotiations of the NAFTA trade pact could disrupt their U.S. supplies. 
Strom said he has also pushed back plans to build a new metal storage building to house his planter and the combine head he uses for harvesting corn and soybeans. Other farmers, food producers and beer makers have scrambled to finalize deals for steel-based equipment before prices climb more.
CONSTRUCTION POSTPONED 
In Riverton, Illinois, farmer Allen Entwistle said he postponed construction of a new $800,000 storage system for grain after AGCO Corp's (N:AGCO) GSI unit increased prices by 15 percent.
Entwistle, who voted for Trump, will instead store corn in bags on the ground.
""President Trump keeps telling us he's going to get a better deal,"" Entwistle said. ""When are we gonna make it better?""
AGCO said Trump's tariffs will raise its costs and make price hikes to customers unavoidable.
""As the entire grain storage industry has weathered increased steel prices, AGCO and GSI are constantly looking for new ways to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact to customers,"" said spokeswoman Kelli Cook.
Other companies, including Deere and Caterpillar, are also facing pain from rising steel prices, which account for about 10 percent of equipment manufacturers' direct costs.
Deere CEO Samuel Allen told Reuters last month the company will have to absorb the price increase and cut costs elsewhere. China's threatened tariffs on U.S. crops could hurt the company even more by undermining demand from farmers, he said. 
""This has a huge effect on livelihood of the farmer right now, and at the same time it has a huge impact on manufacturers,"" said Dennis Slater, president at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, an industry group.
U.S. net farm income is forecast to drop to $59.5 billion in 2018 dollars, down from $64.9 billion in 2017, an 8.3 percent decline, according to the USDA. 
TARIFF 'DOOM-AND-GLOOM'
In Sheffield, Iowa, Sukup Manufacturing has seen steel prices soar 40 percent since November, said Brent Hansen, the company's commercial accounts manager. 
The maker of grain bins and pre-manufactured steel buildings has encouraged customers to buy quickly before prices jump more. But some have already postponed projects, Hansen said.
""That's obviously a big price increase for an industry that's a little bit doom-and-gloom over tariffs,"" Hansen said. 
Sukup used to give customers up to two months to consider its bids for projects. Now, it allows just a week in some cases because of volatile steel prices, Hansen said.
Prices have jumped by 25 percent for thermal insulated panels that keep food cold – which can use either steel, aluminum or both, said Glenn Todd, owner of Todd Construction Services. The company has built food processing and storage facilities for Bumble Bee Seafoods and poultry company Foster Farms.
Richard Adkins, director of sales at Discovery Designs Refrigeration in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, thought his company wouldn’t have to worry about Trump's tariffs. Most of the metal they use to design industrial refrigeration systems comes from Canada and Mexico, he said, and the president has exempted both countries from the levies. 
It didn’t matter. Price-hike notices from vendors landed in Adkins’ mailbox days after Trump announced the duties. 
""There’s this knee-jerk reaction,"" Adkins said. “We’re quoting prices for projects that won’t be awarded for another six or eight months, and no one wants to be hung out to dry.""

Shares of SJM, which has a market value of HK$39 billion ($5 billion), jumped as much as 10.5 percent on Friday to their highest level in nearly two months, outpacing a flat broader market.
Ho, 96, will become chairman emeritus while Daisy Ho, one of his daughters who is already on the board, will take over the running of the business.
""Dr Ho has justifiably been acknowledged as the founding father of Macau's gaming industry, which has for some time been the largest in the world in terms of revenue,"" SJM said in the filing late on Thursday.
The flamboyant tycoon is one of Hong Kong's best-known businessmen. His swashbuckling corporate deal-making style transformed Macau from a sleepy peninsula dotted with seedy, windowless gambling dens into the world's biggest casino center.
Ho was shielded from challengers by a four-decade monopoly on gambling that he lost in 2002 when Macau was opened up to competition, three years after the territory returned to Chinese rule.
SJM is one of Macau's six licensed operators, which include  Sands China Ltd  (HK:1928) and  Wynn Macau  Ltd (HK:1128). 
His retirement comes just weeks after Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, announced his retirement as chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd (HK:0001), bringing to a close a rags-to-riches story that made him a hero in the capitalist hub.
Last June, Ho stepped down as chairman of Hong Kong conglomerate Shun Tak Holdings Ltd (HK:0242), with his daughter Pansy Ho taking over the position.

Export unexpectedly fell 2.7% in March from a year earlier, missed the estimate of a 11.8% increase, while trade surplus with the U.S. rose 19.4% in the first quarter to $58.3 billion from the same period a year earlier, the country’s custom administration said on Friday.
The Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component fell 0.4% and 0.1% by 1:44PM ET (05:44 GMT) following the release of the data. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were unchanged at 30,851.
Asian stocks were supported by reports that Trump is considering to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal that he pulled out shortly after taking office. Meanwhile, Trump said on Thursday that China and the U.S. might not levy any new tariffs on each other after all.
“Now we’re really negotiating and I think they’re going to treat us really fairly,” Trump said during a White House meeting with Republican governors and lawmakers from farm states. “I think they want to.”
Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.7%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.3%. The Reserve Bank of Australia cautioned on Friday that the danger of high household financial debt remains, although the incidences are not widespread at the moment.
Reports that Japan’s government would set up a new panel to look into options to mitigate the impact of the upcoming sales tax would have on the economy were in focus. The news came after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said earlier that the government could consider fiscal spending and other measures to ensure the tax hike does not hurt the economy.
A previous increase in the tax rate in 2014 pushed the economy into recession.
Elsewhere, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years on Friday, and acknowledged risks from the U.S.-China trade tensions.
The central bank said it would slightly increase the slope of the Singapore dollars policy band from the previous zero percent.
""This policy stance is consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path of the nominal effective exchange rate policy band that will ensure medium-term price stability,"" the MAS said.
""An escalation of the US-China trade dispute remains possible, and if it occurs, will have significant consequences for global trade,"" the MAS said."
1271,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 02:47AM ET</span>","Deal-making spike seen as positive sign for U.S. stock market, for now","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are optimistic that a pickup in corporate acquisitions stands to support the volatile U.S. stock market, and does not represent a worrisome cyclical sign.
Global mergers and acquisitions have had their strongest start to a year ever, according to data from Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence. The $1.23 trillion in first-quarter global deal-making came in just shy of the $1.31 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2015, which on a quarterly basis marked a multi-year high. 
However, heightened deal-making could be an ominous signal, if it suggests companies are desperate to find growth as the economic expansion winds down, or if it indicates a euphoria echoed among stock investors. For example, global M&A on a quarterly basis hit multi-year peaks in 2000 and in 2007, preceding sustained stock market declines. 
But market watchers told Reuters they see other reasons for the latest rise in mergers and acquisitions – including incentives from U.S. tax reform and the desire to take advantage of still relatively low interest rates – and instead view the M&A pop as positive for stocks.
""It’s a sign we’re late in the cycle and it eventually gets worrisome,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Boston. ""But in the near term it’s probably a plus in that you get deal premiums and more money employed in taking equity out.""
For an interactive graphic on global deal-making, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS-DEALS/0H0010QM0JY/index.html 
At a time when some on Wall Street worry stocks are trading at expensive valuation levels, investors said the willingness by companies to make purchases is encouraging.
""To the extent you can get cash deals done, it provides a lot of support for the market,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
""It takes out equities, where holders are likely to reinvest in other stocks, and helps re-establish that the prices that stocks are trading at are not too high.""
Global quarterly deal-making hit a record $1.42 trillion in the second quarter of 2007. Several months later the S&P 500 began a decline that eventually cut the benchmark index by more than half as the U.S. economy sank into one of the worst recessions in decades.
King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, recalls that 2007 M&A spree as fueled by debt, and at the time, there were other signs the economic expansion cycle was ending, as opposed to now.
""I just think we are not at that point in the cycle,"" Lip said. ""I still think we are mid-cycle in terms of this recovery.""
Indeed, investors point to overall strength in the economy, including S&P 500 profits expected to rise about 20 percent this year.
Another factor that separates the current climate is the recently enacted U.S. tax law, which cuts the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and includes a tax break for multi-national companies to bring back profits stored overseas.
""I just view this increase in M&A more so related to the increased levels of cash that tax reform is producing,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
While the spike in deal-making can indicate too much euphoria in the market, the lack of other indicators also pointing toward over-confidence suggests M&A could be an outlier in this respect, says Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 

M&A is ""more positive than negative right now,"" Massocca said. ""If everything was over-euphoric, and people were more and more positive, then I would think it is a more dangerous indicator than it is today.""

TOKYO/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks were cautiously higher on Friday ahead of the U.S. earnings season and as investors pondered the implications of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of a global trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump's tendency to change his mind over key policy and political issues has fuelled wild market gyrations in recent weeks. 
Spreadbetters pointed to a largely muted start for Europe, with FTSE futures a shade higher (FFIc1) and DAX futures (FDXc1) up 0.2 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P500 (ESc1) were unchanged as were Dow futures (1YMc1). 
Investors were also reviewing mixed data from China which showed March exports unexpectedly fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier while imports jumped more than forecast. 
While the figures pointed to robust demand from the world's top consumer of crude, copper and iron ore, they left the country with a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion for the month, the first since last February.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up a slim 0.1 percent, having risen as much as 0.5 percent in morning trading. 
It is still up about 2 percent on the week.
Chinese shares took a knock, with both the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) and Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite (SSEC) falling 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) inched lower too while Japan's Nikkei (N225) gained 0.55 percent.
The earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC).
Analysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Still, investors also had reason to fret.
""The worry-list for investors remains long with another military strike on Syria after yet another chemical attack looming large and the Mueller inquiry getting even closer to Trump,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP Capital.
Markets heaved a sigh of relief over suggestions from Trump that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent. However, the threat of a strike remained after Washington's earlier warnings against the Syrian government for what is said was a suspected poison gas attack on its civilians.
TRADE WAR?
Trade tensions also wasn't far off the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. 
In the most recent change of tack, Trump Thursday asked his advisers to look at re-joining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from early last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the creation of a task force to study the U.S. Postal Service and its financial difficulties, after recently claiming without evidence that deliveries for Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) were costing the service money.
The task force will look into the post office's business model, similar to a commission set up by U.S. President George Bush in 2002.
""The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout,"" said the order, signed by Trump. It said the Postal Service had lost $65 billion since the 2007-2009 recession.
The Postal Service, which is supposed to be self-sustaining, must ask Congress for permission to raise rates and must pre-fund decades worth of retiree health benefits.
The order did not mention Amazon, which Trump has regularly criticized in recent weeks.
However, the order asked the task force to evaluate ""the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS's role in competitive markets,"" among other issues.
Deliveries for Amazon and other online retailers have been the fastest-growing part of the U.S. Postal Service business, helping offset a sharp decline in regular first-class mail.
Details of Amazon's payments to USPS are not publicly known.
Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays USPS roughly half what it would to  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) or FedEx Corp (N:FDX) to deliver a package.
The order's language will likely encourage the task force to see if USPS can charge companies like Amazon more for parcel delivery, a person who previously worked at the Postal Regulatory Commission said on condition of anonymity.
Amazon declined to comment. Though the company is one of the Postal Service's biggest customers, it is increasingly growing its own delivery capacity, which could help it stem any impact from changes to USPS. 

The task force will be chaired by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or his designee, and it will consult with the Postmaster General and the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, among others, the executive order said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T's (N:T) proposed merger with  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) would save consumers money because the marriage of a pay-TV provider with a movie and TV giant would create a more efficient company, an economist testifying for AT&T said in court on Thursday
Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, sought to rebut testimony on Wednesday from an economist for the government, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley, who said the $84.5 billion deal would cost American consumers some $286 annually in higher prices. 
The government filed a lawsuit in November to block the deal, citing antitrust concerns. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon will order the deal stopped if he determines it would raise prices for pay TV consumers or threaten the development of online video.
Shapiro had argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T, which owns DirecTV, to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows. 
He also said the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services.
Carlton attacked the assumptions in Shapiro's testimony and used newer data to show that by his tally, the deal would provide a net benefit to consumers of 52 cents per pay TV subscriber a month.
""There is an efficiency from vertical integration,"" argued Carlton. The proposed transaction is considered a vertical deal since AT&T, which owns satellite television company DirecTV, is buying a content supplier, Time Warner.
Carlton said Shapiro underestimated how many people were dropping pay TV altogether and overestimated how many people would leave their pay TV provider if they lost access to Turner's channels.
On cross-examination, government attorney Craig Conrath sought unsuccessfully to push Carlton to concede that a previous vertical deal, Comcast's purchase of NBCU, led to more expensive TV shows and movies when NBCU negotiated new contracts with other pay TV companies.
The trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.
In a sign of the high stakes of the trial, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, sat at the government counsel’s table on Thursday, prompting a reaction from Leon, who said: ""My goodness gracious,"" when Delrahim introduced himself.

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Don't rule out diesel car refits, German environment minister warns","BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government should not rule out requiring retrofits of heavily-polluting diesel cars, center-left Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said, underscoring differences among the parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition.
Schulze, a Social Democrat (SPD), said Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of the CSU Bavarian conservatives, was too optimistic when he said Germany could meet emissions targets without imposing driving bans and requiring carmakers to modify the exhaust systems of existing diesel cars.
Disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions - known to cause respiratory disease - threaten to further strain already difficult relations between Merkel's conservatives and the SPD. 
Merkel on Wednesday had played down the possibility of forcing carmakers to make expensive modifications to diesel car exhaust systems, as her new government tries to avoid driving bans in cities with air quality problems.
The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe's biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests.
Schulze told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper it would ""would be nice"" if German cities could meet NOx targets without retrofits.
""But I don't share this optimism when it comes to big cites like Munich, Stuttgart and several others,"" Schulze said in an interview published on Friday.
She said an expert commission set up by the transport ministry to examine the feasibility of retrofits should complete its work quickly, and then implement what is ""technically possible and economically reasonable.""
Schulze joined Scheuer in rejecting government funding for possible retrofits, adding, ""It cannot be that taxpayers should have to pay for what the automakers screwed up.""
Merkel told reporters on Wednesday she would do everything possible to avoid driving bans, saying that in 2-3 years only about 10 cities would have excess levels of NOx, compared with about 70 cities originally.
The issue came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe's biggest car market.

Merkel's government has been criticized for having too cozy ties with the auto industry due to its importance for jobs and exports. France and Britain have said they will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Ex-telecom company CEO accused of luring investors with fake contracts,"By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief executive officer of an Alaska-based telecommunications company was charged on Thursday with forging contracts to secure investments of more than $250 million in a fiber optic cable network.
Elizabeth Ann Pierce, who was CEO of Anchorage-based Quintillion Networks until she resigned last year, surrendered to authorities Thursday morning, prosecutors said.
She was released on bail following a hearing in Manhattan federal court Thursday afternoon, according to Nick Biase, a spokesman for the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan.
Joshua Lowther, a lawyer for Pierce, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The company said in a statement that ""Quintillion values its partnerships with customers and investors and the alleged actions of Ms. Pierce are not aligned with how Quintillion conducts business.""
In a criminal complaint, prosecutors said that Pierce, 54, obtained investments in Quintillion from 2015 to 2017 by claiming that it had secured contracts with other telecommunications companies that guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from its planned fiber optic network in Alaska. The network was launched in the state last year.
In fact, prosecutors said, the contracts were fake. In some cases, Pierce forged counterparties' signatures on contracts that never existed, while in others she altered real contracts to make them more favorable to Quintillion, prosecutors said.
A New York private equity fund invested more than $200 million in Quintillion based on Pierce's claims about the contracts, making it the company's majority shareholder, according to the complaint. It also helped arrange a $50 million loan through a French investment banking firm, the complaint said.
Quintillion's majority shareholder as of August was New York-based Cooper Investment Partners LLC, according to public statements from the company. Quintillion announced in January 2017 that it had obtained $50 million in financing through France's  Natixis  SA (PA:CNAT).
Cooper and Natixis, which were not named in court papers, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Prosecutors said the fraud was uncovered after a Quintillion employee sent an invoice to one of the other telecommunications companies based on a forged contract. It responded by producing the genuine contract, prompting Quintillion to investigate, according to the complaint.

NEW YORK (IFR) - A proposal to delay disclosure of large corporate bond purchases in order to improve market liquidity is getting push-back from some of the investors who could benefit most from the change.
An SEC subcommittee on Monday suggested that secondary high-grade sales over US$10m and high-yield sales over US$3m not be made public for 48 hours. The current lag is 15 minutes.
The Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee, which includes large investors, borrowers and traders, proposed a one-year trial for the arrangement.
The thinking is that delayed disclosure would encourage more market-making by dealers, who tend to be wary of holding large positions.
The transactions targeted in the proposal only account for about 1%-3% of the total number of trades between 2013 and 2017, but represent a hefty 33-41% of their total par value traded.
And many on the buyside believe any reduction in transparency is a bad idea.
""For the most part liquidity is a risk you need to manage around,"" said Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager at Invesco. ""You can't just ask for opaqueness.""
John McClain, a high-yield portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, suggested the proposed rule would not help everyone.
""People arguing for this change are trying to benefit their shareholders at the expense of the other market participants,"" he said.
""It doesn't solve any issue and it decreases transparency. It doesn't make any sense to me.""
Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and manager of the firm's bond fund, also expressed reservations. 
""Loomis might benefit from it, but it's not good for the markets,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. ""I like transparency.""
TRACE ELEMENTS
The National Association of Securities Dealers introduced the TRACE system that publishes bond trade data in 2002, saying it hoped to improve both transparency and liquidity.
Since then, however, liquidity has largely declined - partly because asset managers have got so much bigger and more homogeneous - while issuance has skyrocketed.
And if the market truly is close to the end of the credit cycle as so many expect, the huge asset managers may have difficulties unwinding their massive holdings.
The total amount of US corporate bonds outstanding has approximately doubled over the past 10 years, according to data from Sifma.
""The proposal is a natural consequence of an increasingly concentrated market,"" said one senior head of credit research.
""Delaying disclosure is an attempt to suppress price volatility,"" he said. ""It addresses a symptom - not necessarily the cause.""
Chris White, chief executive of ViableMkts, said more transparency was needed before trades are executed - and has launched BondCliQ, which is expected to consolidate dealer quotes, to do that. 
""The problem doesn't start with reporting the trade, but with asset managers' ability to find a dealer that can complete that trade,"" he said.
""There is a problem with the search process of finding a counterparty, but the solution is not to take away the tape or to delay the tape.""
LIQUID PAPER
But others believe the virtually instant dissemination of trade data discourages risk-taking in the market.
Everyone watching TRACE knows what a buyer has paid, leading to a ripple effect in pricing - often to the detriment of the new bondholder. 
""Delayed (disclosure) could give dealers more confidence to take on larger trades,"" said one credit strategist who asked not to be named.
""Ironically, price disclosure required under TRACE has contributed to illiquidity for larger-sized secondary trades.""
Meanwhile some believe liquidity is not as bad as it as been.
""Over three-quarters of corporate bond investors (feel) it is easy or extremely easy to execute orders up to US$5m in size,"" Greenwich Associates said in a report last month.
""This is a stark contrast to the sentiment only a year ago, where that same metric was barely one-third."" 
And in its bi-annual monetary policy report in July 2017, the Federal Reserve said liquidity overall has been good since the crisis.
Whatever the case, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority would still have to design the trial program - and the SEC would have to approve it - meaning changes are not likely coming soon.
In the interim the market knows there is ""no easy fix"", as Brill at Invesco puts it. 
""You're never going to be able to trade bonds like stocks. You're always going to have to understand the nuances of individual bonds and the nuances of liquidity. There's no magic pill.""

DETROIT/SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) president said common ground must be reached on a long-term financial restructuring of GM's South Korean auto unit by April 20 and if there was none, the operation would likely seek bankruptcy protection.
GM has been in talks since February, seeking support and incentives for the money-losing operation from the Korean government as well as concessions on wages from labor unions. The automaker plans to close one GM Korea plant and is weighing the fate of three others.
The April 20 deadline, first given in late March, ratchets up pressure on the South Korean government and the state-funded Korea Development Bank. They said this week they need until early May to complete due diligence on GM Korea and the automaker's financial plan before committing public funds.
""Our preferred path remains to find a successful outcome here,"" GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview. ""It's the right thing for all the stakeholders. But everybody has got to come to the table by next Friday.""
A spokesman for KDB, which owns 17 percent stake in the unit, declined to comment.
While there were early signs that GM Korea's union may be more accommodating than in the past, tensions have grown.
Last week, some union members entered the office of the GM Korea CEO and destroyed furniture as the automaker was unable to make planned bonus payments. Talks with the union on Thursday were canceled after the company demanded security cameras be set up at the site due to safety concerns. 
GM headquarters this week also banned employee travel to GM Korea sites until further notice due to worries about security.
GM has offered to invest $2.8 billion in GM Korea, part of which would be shouldered by KDB. It is also seeking tax incentives and has proposed converting $2.7 billion debt owed to it by GM Korea into equity.
If GM Korea sought protection in South Korean bankruptcy courts, it could continue to build cars. However, it is not clear where the financing to continue operations would come from. The unit's creditors and employees also could take financial hits if GM Korea is restructured in court.
Complicating matters, GM Korea must make payments to workers who agreed to leave the company as part of a voluntary severance plan in the week beginning April 23. The unit does not have the cash to make the payments, and GM has so far indicated it will not provide any more cash unless there is a deal with unions and the South Korean government.
Quitting Korea would, however, not be an easy call for GM. 
The Detroit automaker relies on Korean plants to build vehicles for the United States and Latin America, although it could build models such as the Chevrolet Trax elsewhere.

GM also uses GM Korea to prepare what are known as ""knock down"" kits - partially assembled vehicles that are shipped to other markets for final assembly. GM also has strong relationships with South Korean suppliers that could suffer from a messy exit.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 05:12PM ET</span>",Auto industry lawyers warn automated driving hype will be a legal matter,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deadly crashes involving Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] vehicles operating entirely or in part under automated systems have made a once-abstract problem very real for auto industry lawyers gathered at a recent conference.
It is crucial that companies accurately outline limitations of automatic driving systems and the circumstances in which they can and cannot take over steering, braking and lane-keeping, attorneys for the U.S. units of carmakers including Hyundai (KS:011760), Toyota (T:7203), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and supplier company Continental (DE:CONG) said at a recent legal conference.
""The OEMs (carmakers) right now are trying really hard to accurately describe what this equipment can do and can't do,"" said Tom Vanderford, associate general counsel at Hyundai, at a conference last Friday in Phoenix, Arizona attended by Reuters. 
The American Bar Association conference took place just a few miles from the scene of a fatal accident involving an Uber test vehicle in autonomous mode. The crash cranked up pressure on the self-driving vehicle industry to prove its software and sensors are safe.
On Thursday, Tesla came under more pressure from regulators and consumer groups for its response to a deadly crash in California of a Tesla vehicle operating on Autopilot, the name the company uses for an enhanced cruise control system.
Fully automated vehicles are not expected to become available to consumers for several years. However, increasingly sophisticated driver assistance features are already sold under various names, carrying disclaimers warning that drivers cannot rely on the systems to safely operate the car in all circumstances.
Such technologies include collision avoidance systems that steer the car away from pedestrians. There are also automatic braking systems and audio and visual alerts when cameras, radar or other sensors detect obstacles.
David Cades, a human factor scientist at engineering consulting firm Exponent, said terminology matters in descriptions of these systems because people might misuse or misunderstand the technology.
Cades, who has testified in automotive cases as an expert witness, said automakers should not use the term ""collision avoidance system."" Instead, he urged manufacturers to use terms such as ""collision mitigation systems.""
""Even in naming and marketing these systems care needs to be taken in how they are promoted,"" Cades said.
John Gersch, managing counsel at Toyota and another conference participant, pointed to a promotional video shown at the conference, in which Tesla (O:TSLA) touts its Autopilot semi-automated system. 
""The overreliance issue is probably the most serious issue with all these systems, so that goes with Tesla that was shown there,"" said Gersch. 
Even though its marketing materials feature the automatic system, Tesla's owners manual tells buyers that they are required to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before activating the system. 
The family of a driver killed last month in a Tesla car crash has hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, the firm said on Wednesday, adding the Autopilot feature was defective and probably caused his death. Tesla in a statement said Walter Huang, the victim in the California crash, ""was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect."" Tesla added that Huang told his family that Autopilot ""was not reliable in that exact location"" of the crash. It said he took his hands off the wheel ""several times"" before the crash.
Investigating a 2016 fatal crash, the National Transportation Safety Board last year said Autopilot lacked safeguards, giving too much leeway to the driver to divert attention. The NTSB in a statement on Thursday urged Tesla to act on the safety recommendations in that report.
Following the 2016 accident, Tesla introduced more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. After three warnings, the software now blocks Autopilot until the driver stops and restarts.
""Tesla warns, but in products liability warnings don't protect you against design defect claims,"" said University of South Carolina law professor Bryant Walker Smith, who focuses on automated driving.
Car accident litigation usually turns on a driver's alleged negligence. By contrast, a lawsuit involving automated technology could scrutinize whether the system had a design defect.
Smith said plaintiffs suing Tesla could point to alternative designs, such as General Motors Co's (N:GM) semi-autonomous Super Cruise system which tracks eye movement to monitor whether a driver pays attention.
GM says Super Cruise relies on a pre-defined map and only allows hands-off driving on designated highways and only when the driver is paying attention to the road. 
Any litigation arising from accidents involving fully or partially automated vehicles could also pit software suppliers against vehicle manufacturers.
Industry lawyers said carmakers increasingly indemnify smaller technology companies working on self-driving features.
But Tammy Fanning, deputy general counsel for parts maker Continental, which manufactures radar for blind spot detection systems, told the conference the general automotive liability chain will not change.

""From a product liability perspective it will all stay the same: suppliers will be paying for everything in the end, every recall, all replacements,"" Fanning said.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar raised $12 billion in a bond issue on Thursday, the largest placement by an emerging market sovereign this year, marking a successful comeback to the international debt markets despite a 10-month-long rift with its Gulf neighbors.
The issuance will be seen as a big success for Doha amid a boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, which severed diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of supporting terrorism. 
Doha denies the charge and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty.
Saudi Arabia launched a rival $11 billion bond during the same week, in a move seen as an attempt to absorb demand from the market and force Qatar to offer higher yields to attract interest.
But the sale in the tiny Gulf state and major gas exporter was heavily oversubscribed.
""The overall success of the issue clearly reflects the strength of the Qatari economy and the confidence the state enjoys from international investors,"" a Qatari government official said when asked about the outcome of the bond placement.
U.S. President Donald Trump said this week ties with Qatar were working “extremely well” as he welcomed Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani to the White House for bilateral talks.
The meeting marked a major turnaround for Qatar as Trump has previously accused Qatar of sponsoring terrorism.
On Thursday, Qatar raised a triple-tranche U.S. dollar-denominated bond with orders estimated to have exceeded $52-53 billion.
Qatar gave initial price guidance earlier on Thursday, with the five-year tranche marketed at around 170 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries, the 10-year at 200 bps over Treasuries and the 30-year at around 230 bps over.
It then tightened the guidance to final spreads of 135 bps over U.S. Treasuries for $3 billion in five-year notes, 170 bps over the benchmark for $3 billion in 10-year notes and to 205 bps over for $6 billion in 30-year paper.

1293,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here's a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday, April 13.
1. Jobs, Consumer Sentiment, Fed Speak in Focus 
Labor market data and a raft of University of Michigan data due Friday will cap of yet another week that has so far been dominated by geopolitical issues as markets head into the start of earnings season. 
Michigan’s consumer expectations due 10:00 am, are expected to show a preliminary reading of 88.1 for April, while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a preliminary reading of 100.6 from 101.4 in the previous month.
The U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report at 10:00 am ET, is expected to show job openings in February fell to about 6.11 million.
Speeches by FOMC members’ Eric Rosengren at 08:00 am ET, James Bullard at 09:00 am ET and Robert Kaplan at 13:00 ET will likely be monitored for clues on whether policymakers remain optimism on inflation and economic growth.
The Fed’s minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers remained confident that inflation would hit the Fed’s 2% target. That lifted expectations for a June rate hike, Investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool showed.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.28% to 89.17 as geopolitical tensions calmed. 
2. Banks Get Earnings Season Underway 
Ahead of the start of earnings season in earnest Friday, when major banks are slated to release first-quarter earnings, investors piled into financials betting that tax reform, and further rate hikes would boost growth.
While performance from trading, is likely to be closely scrutinised after the return of volatility in markets.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC)  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) closed the session more than 1% higher.
All four financial institutions are slated to release earnings before the market opens.They're expected to show respective earnings per share gains of $1.61, $2.28, $2.24 and $1.06, according to FactSet.
Blackrock had set the tone for a bullish start for financials to earnings season after the asset management firm posted better-than-expected first-quarter results Thursday.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count Data, International Energy Agency Report on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday at 1:00 pm ET, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs rebounded sharply after falling in the prior week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) releases its monthly report at 04:00 a.m. ET outlining key developments impacting oil market trends.
The IEA’s forecast on U.S. production will likely draw special attention after the energy watchdog in March warned that oil demand could outstrip supply despite the ramp up in shale output.
Crude futures bounced back from session lows Thursday to settle at three-year highs as traders continued to bet that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East would lead to supply disruptions, extending the rally in crude prices."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is set to demand tech giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) do more to stop the spread of fake news on their websites by the end of the year to avoid possible regulatory actions, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
The draft document sets out for the first time the measures the EU would like to see the tech giants take within a certain timeline. The companies have come under fire in Europe for not doing enough to remove misleading or illegal content, including incitement to hatred, extremism and the online sale of counterfeit products. 
The European Commission plans to draw up a ""Code of Practice"" by July that will commit online platforms and advertisers to take a number of measures to prevent fake news being both uploaded and disseminated, ""with a view to producing measurable effects by the end of 2018"", the draft policy document says.
""Should the results prove unsatisfactory, the Commission may propose further actions, including actions of a regulatory nature, if necessary.""
The measures include improving the scrutiny of advertisement placements, stepping up efforts to close fake accounts, ensuring that fighting disinformation is factored in by design when developing online tools and preventing the unauthorized use of users' personal data by third parties - a clear reference to the Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfing Facebook.
The revelations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica - which worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign - improperly accessed the data of up to 87 million Facebook users have hit the social network's share price and led to 10 hours of questioning for its CEO by U.S. lawmakers. 
""So far, platforms have been unable to address the challenge posed by disinformation and some have turned a blind eye to the manipulative use of their infrastructures,"" the document says.
""The gravity of the threat, however, has become increasingly clear as exemplified by the recent revelations about personal data mined from social media used in a electoral context.""
Facebook has stepped up fact-checking in its fight against fake news and is working on making it uneconomical for people to post such content by lowering its ranking and making it less visible.
The world's largest social network is also working on giving its users more context and background about the content they read on the platform.
Some European countries have already moved to tackle the problem, like Germany which has passed a law requiring social media companies quickly remove hate speech. France is also looking at rules to block fake news.
Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about inflammatory subjects, setting up events and buying ads.
""Platforms have by and large failed to ensure sufficient transparency on political advertising and sponsored content,"" the Commission document - which is due to be published at the end of April - says.

The Commission also wants companies and advertisers to ""establish clear marking systems and rules for bots and ensure their activities cannot be confused with human interactions.""

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2018 12:16AM ET</span>",U.S. judge says Uber drivers are not company's employees,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Philadelphia has ruled that limousine drivers for Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] are independent contractors and not the company's employees under federal law, the first ruling of its kind on a crucial issue for the ride-hailing company. 
U.S. District Judge Michael Baylson on Wednesday said San Francisco-based Uber does not exert enough control over drivers for its limo service, UberBLACK, to be considered their employer under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The drivers work when they want to and are free to nap, run personal errands, or smoke cigarettes in between rides, Baylson said. 
The legal classification of workers has been a major issue for ""gig economy"" companies that rely on independent contractors. Uber, in particular, has been hit with dozens of lawsuits in recent years claiming that its drivers are employees and are entitled to minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections not afforded to contractors.
An Uber spokeswoman said the company is pleased with the decision. 
Jeremy Abay, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he would appeal the ruling to the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 3rd Circuit would be the first federal appeals court to consider whether Uber drivers are properly classified as independent contractors. 
Many of the cases filed against Uber have been sent to arbitration, but the plaintiffs in the Philadelphia case were among a small minority of drivers who had opted not to sign arbitration agreements with the company. 
Last year, a state appeals court in Florida said Uber's drivers were not its employees under Florida law. But state agencies in California and New York have said that they are under those states' laws.
Baylson in Wednesday's ruling said he was the first judge to rule on the classification of Uber drivers under federal law. His ruling comes about two months after a federal judge in San Francisco said that food delivery workers for Grubhub Inc were not the company's employees. 
The Grubhub case was the first of its kind against a so-called gig economy company to go to trial. 
The Philadelphia lawsuit was filed in February 2016. The plaintiffs said Uber failed to pay them minimum wage and overtime in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which only applies to employees. The plaintiffs were seeking to represent all drivers in Philadelphia for Uber's limousine service, UberBLACK.

The case is Razak v. Uber Technologies Inc, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 2:16-cv-00573.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 03:59PM ET</span>",VW names new boss to steer sweeping overhaul,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has chosen Herbert Diess as its new chief executive in an overhaul that includes streamlining the company's multiple car brands into just three groups while preparing its truck business for a potential listing.
The plans were announced after Volkswagen board of directors ousted Matthias Mueller as CEO and discussed ways to overhaul the company, which spans motorbikes, buses, trucks and passenger car brands including Ducati, Bentley, Porsche, Audi, Scania and Skoda.
Mueller's replacement with VW brand chief Diess follows slow progress in reorganizing the group's car brands, a key pillar of ""Strategy 2025"" to transform the Germany's biggest car company into a leader in cleaner cars and to move on from its diesel emissions scandal of 2015. 
For Volkswagen its the biggest overhaul since it became a multi-brand conglomerate under former chief executive Ferdinand Piech, a grandson of VW Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche.
Under the plans, announced on Thursday, Volkswagen will divide itself into six new business areas, plus a portfolio for China, as part of an effort to decentralize responsibility and improve efficiency. 
The carmaker will prepare its truck and bus division for ""capital market readiness"" by making it a public limited company as a prelude to a potential listing, confirming a Reuters report from last month. 
The new car brands will be Volume, Premium and Super Premium. Earlier on Thursday, sources had told Reuters that VW would reorganize its brands into these groups. 
Analysts welcomed the appointment of Diess, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive who has more than doubled profitability at the VW brand since taking charge in 2015.
""Diess is a man of action, he is the most plausible choice at VW to lead the group into the next phase of its transformation,"" said Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope, who has a ""buy"" rating on Volkswagen.
Separately, VW said works council executive Gunnar Kilian, a close aide to labor boss Bernd Osterloh, will replace group human resources chief Karlheinz Blessing who will stay at VW as an adviser. Earlier this week, sources told Reuters that Kilian would replace Blessing.
Purchasing chief Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, the longest-serving top executive at VW, will leave the company, the carmaker said. 
VW will tighten leadership duties within the group and empower the heads of the three vehicle categories to take on company-wide responsibilities.
With VW's core namesake brand shouldering the bulk of development spending within the group, Diess will also become responsible for R&D activities across the group. Rupert Stadler, CEO of luxury division Audi (DE:NSUG) will take charge of group sales.
Oliver Blume, head of sports car brand Porsche and newly appointed to the group executive board, will oversee production at the multi-brand organization, VW said, confirming a Reuters report.
Diess, Stadler and Blume will also take charge of the new groups Volume, Premium and Super Premium respectively, VW said, without giving more details. 
The German carmaker's deliberations come as rival carmakers and suppliers including Fiat and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) work on ways to slim down and divest non-core assets.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) say there is 160 billion euros worth of ""hidden value"" in the European autos sector that could be unlocked through portfolio simplifications.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 06:05PM ET</span>",Bombardier to bid on New Jersey rail contract: sources,"By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Bombardier (TO:BBDb) will bid on an upcoming New Jersey Transit rail car contract, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the Canadian plane and train maker seeks to boost its North American business after losing ground in the region to rivals.
NJ Transit, the largest statewide public transportation system in the United States, has previously said it will order 113 multilevel passenger cars to modernize its aging fleet, which has been criticized for overcrowding and delays. 
The agency is also considering an estimated 900 more railcars as options, according to the industry sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because the tendering process is private. 
Proposals are expected in June, according to the agency's website. The deal is expected to range from around $500 million into the billions of dollars, depending on how many, if any, options are exercised, one of the sources said. 
Bombardier declined to comment. NJ Transit did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite a healthy $34 billion global backlog, Bombardier Transportation is under pressure to improve performance in North America following delays to orders in Ontario and recent losses to other railmakers in Canada and the United States. 
The company, which lost a Montreal rail deal worth more than C$1 billion ($794.03 million) to France's  Alstom  SA (PA:ALSO), had to drop out of a 2017 competition held by New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority that was later won by Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T).
In 2016, China's CRRC Corp (SS:601766), the world's largest maker of rail cars, beat Bombardier for a $1.3 billion Chicago contract. 
But Bombardier is seen to have an advantage in the New Jersey procurement, one of the sources said, because it has already made 429 multilevel vehicles over the years for the agency, a longstanding client.
Bombardier is also getting a boost in the U.S. market as a member of the winning team selected for a $4.9 billion contract to develop and maintain a new people-mover, or automated train system at Los Angeles International Airport. Bombardier, which will provide the people mover's operating system, including all vehicles, would not disclose the value of its portion of the deal approved on Wednesday by L.A. city council. 
The NJ order comes as public transit agencies are reviewing the potential impact of a U.S.-China trade dispute on procurement costs, including tariffs on steel from countries such as China, introduced in March by President Donald Trump's administration.
The cost of new car builds could rise if the vehicles are made in the United States from steel produced in countries affected by the new U.S. tariffs.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Norway's Wideroe says may increase Embraer jet order,"By Tim Hepher
ABERDEEN (Reuters) - Scandinavia's largest regional airline said on Thursday it aims to increase its order for E2 jets after it received the first of three new-generation aircraft from Brazil's Embraer to become its inaugural operator.
Wideroe's purchase of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) upgraded E190-E2 marks its first foray into jets after decades linking communities near the Arctic Circle with turboprops. It has options to buy another 12.
""We will work extremely hard to ensure that we can receive the remaining 12,"" Chief Executive Stein Nilsen said during an Aberdeen stopover as the jet was being delivered to Norway.
He said Wideroe could also be interested in the smaller E175-E2, due to enter service in 2021 and currently prevented by union scope clauses from operating in the United States.
The boss of Norway's oldest airline shrugged off a potential offer by British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) for budget carrier Norwegian (OL:NWC), saying there was no direct competition with Wideroe which serves mainly small domestic airports.
""We are focusing on our niche,"" he told Reuters.
Embraer Commercial Aircraft CEO John Slattery said he sees ""real and advanced"" opportunities for sales as the E2 reaches its first operator, adding he would be disappointed if Embraer only sold as many of the overall family as it delivered in 2018.
The E190-E2 is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer’s commercial jet line-up with new wings and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.
Embraer is also expanding the size and range of its largest commercial jet, the E195, whose upgraded E2 version enters service in 2019, posing a challenge to Bombardier's CSeries.
Embraer expects a market for 6,400 jets in the 70-130 seat segment over the next 20 years. 
""The pipeline of opportunities is as robust as I've seen in seven years at Embraer,"" Slattery said. The Brazilian company has gone through a slow patch in sales of the E2 model.
He declined comment on reports Embraer is close to agreeing the sale of its commercial arm to Boeing (N:BA). 
EXPANSION PLANS
Wideroe, which once linked rural networks with former owner SAS Scandinavian Airlines and is now run independently under a consortium of investors, plans to introduce the jet on April 24.
It will replace Bombardier (TO:BBDb) Q400 turboprops on some routes and will hold 114 passengers in a single-class layout.
Nilsen said fewer domestic airports and sharp rises of up to 70 percent in airport fees had prompted Wideroe to scale up from smaller despite harsh winter conditions in Norway.
""It has been a real challenge to further the route developments in thee rural areas of Norway,"" he said.

Wideroe however plans to expand international flights and rent out some of the new jets with crews to carry passengers on behalf of Finnair (HE:FIA1S).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators on Thursday asked the Federal Communications Commission to investigate Sinclair Broadcasting Group (O:SBGI) for ""deliberately distorting news"" and asked the commission to pause its ongoing review of the company's proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO).
Sinclair, which is already the largest U.S. broadcaststation owner, announced plans in May 2017 to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.
In a letter, the senators, 11 Democrats and independent Bernie Sanders, expressed concern about local news anchors at Sinclair-owned stations around the country being forced to read company-mandated scripts. The scripts criticized ""the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country"" and have drawn fire.
""We are concerned that Sinclair is engaged in a systematic news distortion operation that seeks to undermine freedom of the press and the robust localism and diversity of viewpoint that is the foundation of our national broadcasting laws,” the senators wrote. They added that it ""may have violated the FCC’s longstanding policy against broadcast licensees deliberately distorting news by staging, slanting, or falsifying information.""
In a letter to senators on Thursday reviewed by Reuters, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai rejected their request, saying the agency does not have authority to revoke a license based on the content of a particular newscast. Pai made similar comments last year when President Donald Trump suggested NBC's licenses could be challenged over its news reporting.
""I can hardly think of an action more chilling of free speech than the federal government investigating a broadcast station because of disagreement with its news coverage or promotion of that coverage,"" Pai wrote.
After the scripts drew significant public attention, Trump tweeted on April 2 in defense of Sinclair: ""Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC.""
In February, Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said the FCC's inspector general was investigating whether Pai was biased in Sinclair's favor.
Pallone in November asked the inspector general to investigate, citing a string of FCC decisions he said benefited Sinclair and a media report that Trump's election campaign struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.
Pai has repeatedly denied he has taken actions aimed at benefiting a single company and Sinclair has denied improper conduct.

Sinclair declined to comment on the senators' letter, signed by the 11 Democrats, including Senators Maria Cantwell, Tom Udall, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Sanders.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 05:38PM ET</span>",Buffett's Berkshire will oppose USG board nominees after Knauf bid,"By Jonathan Stempel and Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) plans to vote against four board nominees proposed by  USG Corp  (N:USG), giving a boost to a $5.9 billion takeover bid by German's Gebr Knauf AG that the building products company had rejected.
Berkshire, which is USG's largest shareholder with a 31 percent stake, announced its intention on Thursday, two days after Knauf called on USG shareholders to pressure that company to enter merger talks by withholding support for its director slate.
Knauf owns about 10.5 percent of USG.
""Berkshire's present intention is to vote against the four directors proposed by management,"" Buffett's assistant, Debbie Bosanek, said in an email.
A USG spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
Knauf's takeover bid values USG at $42 per share. USG shares closed up 2.4 percent at $40.77 on Thursday. They closed at $33.51 on March 23, before Knauf's bid became public.
Buffett has called his more than 17-year USG investment disappointing but ""no disaster.""
A USG takeover could add to the $116 billion of cash and equivalents his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has to invest.
""You don't normally see this kind of stuff from Berkshire,"" said Morningstar Inc analyst Greggory Warren. ""It's not like they need the capital.""
Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance. Buffett has long preferred owning whole companies to individual stocks.
Earlier on Thursday, USG sent an open shareholder letter calling Knauf's opposition to its director slate ""a misguided attempt"" to pressure the board into accepting a takeover ""substantially below our intrinsic value.""
Berkshire's offer to sell its roughly 43.4 million USG shares essentially created a pricing floor for any sale.
It was structured as a six-month option contingent on Knauf buying the rest of USG, with Knauf paying $2 per share upfront that Berkshire would keep if no merger occurred in that period.
Berkshire has owned USG since 2000, the year before asbestos liabilities helped push the Chicago-based company into bankruptcy for five years.
In 2008, after the housing market imploded, Berkshire bought $300 million of USG convertible debt, which was later swapped into stock.
USG's board has 10 members but is ""staggered,"" meaning only four seats are being filled at its May 9 annual meeting.
Chief Executive Jennifer Scanlon and Chairman Steven Leer are not among the directors up for election. USG also has a ""poison pill"" defense to help thwart unwelcome takeovers.

Knauf said in a statement it is pleased by Berkshire's support.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Rolls-Royce and Boeing back UK minnow's rocket engine technology,"LONDON (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) have both invested in rocket engine company Reaction Engines as the latest blue-chip companies to back the start-up's thermal management technology.
Reaction Engines, based in Oxfordshire, England, said on Thursday that it had raised 26.5 million pounds ($37.7 million)from a range of new investors including Rolls-Royce and Boeing's investment arm Boeing HorizonX Ventures. 
They join defense giant and existing investor BAE Systems (L:BAES), which increased its investment in the latest fundraising round.
Reaction Engines is working on ultra light, miniature and extremely powerful heat exchangers to develop an engine that could power hypersonic planes and help to deliver satellites to space. 
In the shorter term, however, the company is focusing on commercializing parts of its technology so it can start generating revenue in the next 18 months.
Chief Executive Mark Thomas told Reuters that he is initially targeting electric vehicles, energy generation and aero engines. 
Rolls-Royce, for instance, could use the technology in the next-generation engines it is working on and is keen to explore that area, Thomas said. 
""Potentially it could enable you to have a more efficient and cleaner, so greener, civil aero engine by improving the thermal dynamics of that engine,"" he said. 
Boeing, meanwhile, has ambitions to develop commercial supersonic and hypersonic planes. 
Reaction Engines did not say what stake Rolls-Royce and Boeing will hold in the company, which is owned by a range of strategic and financial investors and employees.

1334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Should Facebook Pay More in Taxes? IMF Wades Into Thorny Debate,"(Bloomberg) -- The International Monetary Fund is wading into a thorny debate over whether online giants such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). pay enough taxes.
Some digital industries are prone to become monopolies, because the first company that establishes a technology often becomes dominant, the IMF said in an analysis released Thursday. The question of how to tax the incomes of companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google unit has become a “contentious and urgent issue,” the fund said.
“The resulting market distortions are best addressed through regulatory rather than tax measures. However, in their absence, the high profit generated provides an attractive tax base, especially given that some technology giants are among the largest companies in the world,” the fund said in the analysis its semi-annual Fiscal Monitor. The full report will be released April 18 at the IMF’s spring meetings in Washington.
The U.S. president has suggested tech companies should pay more tax. “I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments,” President Donald Trump wrote in a Twitter message last month.
EU Levy
The “first wave” of research on the subject recommended against taxing digital companies in a special way, the IMF noted. But calls have been growing to make tech firms pay a bigger share, with the European Union planning a new levy on companies such as Google and Facebook that route their EU profits through low-tax countries.
The tax push adds to the headaches for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned in Congress this week on the social network’s data practices, after information from as many as 87 million users was siphoned to a firm with ties to Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Digital companies rely on intangible assets such as software algorithms, the IMF said. Taxing such assets can be challenging, given the ease with which companies can locate them in low-tax jurisdictions, the fund said.
Under international tax rules, firms only pay corporate income taxes when they have a physical presence in a country -- a rule some tech companies can skirt because they may have little or no physical presence in a country even though they sell services to its citizens, the IMF said.
Any effort to tax digital transactions should be “internationally coordinated,” the IMF said. Among other things, policy makers will need to decide which principles to use in taxing online companies, such as having companies pay taxes in the nations where their users reside, it said.
In the same report, the IMF warned that countries ramping up the use of digital tools to make their governments more efficient need to guard against the risk of fraud and privacy breaches."

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Top bankers warn London's status as a global finance center at risk from Brexit,"By Andrew MacAskill and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Leading bankers warned on Thursday that Britain is yet to feel the real impact of Brexit which will undermine its status as a global finance center as companies prepare to shift jobs out of London to preserve access to Europe's single market.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said that while the U.S. bank will keep its new $1.4 billion new European headquarters in London, it might have chosen another location if it had known Brexit was coming.
""We're still building it, the cranes are working but we might have made a different decision a few years ago,"" Blankfein told Politico in an interview.
The future of London as Europe's financial center is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because it is Britain's largest export sector and biggest source of tax. Rival cities within the EU are battling to draw highly-paid banking jobs and the revenues they bring.
As Prime Minister Theresa May plots Britain's course for Brexit, London's financial services industry is scrambling to prepare for losing access to the world's biggest trading bloc, its biggest challenge since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
The sector accounts for about 12 percent of Britain's economic output and pays more taxes than any other industry.
Blankfein said companies are taking decisions that may result in less economic activity in Britain although he said that he was surprised at how little effect Brexit has had at this stage. Britain is due to leave the EU next March.
""I am at least wrong in that I would've thought there would be a worse outcome by now,"" he said. 
The chairwoman of Spain's biggest bank  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Ana Botin warned that growth in London's financial center was set to stall due to the turmoil triggered by Brexit.
""I don't think so many companies or people are going to leave the UK, it is the people that are not coming that we should worry about because the UK was on a huge upward trend and that is not as strong now,"" Botin told the audience at an event organized by the Wall Street Journal in London.
But Britain's Brexit minister David Davis was more upbeat. He told a conference in London that the city will retain its crown as Europe's financial hub and said the government's plans for immigration after Brexit will not hurt businesses.
""There is not going to be a mass migration, the critical mass is still going to be here,"" Davis said.

""We are still going to be the biggest and most important financial center in the world in five years, in 10 years.""

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","Boeing-Embraer proposal brings tie-up closer, not imminent: sources","By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Brad Haynes
RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A new proposal for a tie-up between planemakers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) that was submitted to Brazil's government on Tuesday brings the deal closer, but there are still issues to be ironed out, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The two companies said in December that they were discussing ""a potential combination,"" but the Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer, needs to give its blessing.
The new proposal is expected to go before President Michel Temer in the coming weeks, according to two of the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the confidential talks.
""It's not an easy operation. It's quite complex, but it's moving along. It's just not going to come out imminently,"" said one of the sources.
Embraer shares, which had climbed 10 percent in two days on anticipation of the deal, fell as much as 2 percent in Sao Paulo on Thursday after the report.
Embraer and Brazil's Defense Ministry, which has been heading up the government's working group on the deal, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
At an event in Scotland, the head of Embraer's commercial aviation unit, John Slattery, declined to comment.
Boeing referred to comments by chief executive Dennis Muilenburg in February, saying the timing was right for the companies to combine forces and a tie-up would be ""a great strategic fit, but it's not a must do.""
While the broad outlines of a deal seem to have satisfied all parties' main concerns, there are finer points to settle between the companies, whose partnership in the 70- to 130-seat regional jet segment would mean stiffer competition for  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) CSeries program. 
For example, negotiators still need to define Boeing's final stake in a new joint venture containing Embraer's commercial aviation business, which is likely to be just over 80 percent in return for a cash payment, according to two of the sources. It was still unclear if Embraer would have a seat on the board of the new company, they added.
But they said key government concerns are addressed in the plan, which ensures that Embraer, which would keep its defense and business jet divisions, retains the engineering capacity necessary to design and build new aircraft. Long-term service agreements between Embraer and the new company should also guarantee their long-term viability, sources said.

Investing.com - For investors looking to limit or avoid exposure to a possible U.S. trade war with China, here's three investment plays.Small-cap companies tend to derive most if not all of their revenue from domestic sales. They're also less likely to be in the high-tech sector, which thrives on exports. Small-cap companies are also benefitting from the corporate tax cuts and the continuing strength of the U.S. economy.There are also domestic-oriented sectors with large-cap companies, such as utilities, real estate, railroads and telecoms. In most cases, these companies make all of their money at home in the U.S. Finally, looking further afield, there are emerging markets, such as India. Indonesia and Brazil, with large, fast-growing economies that are less dependent on global trade. A weaker dollar, higher commodities prices and more investor-friendly policies are all positives for emerging market stocks."

Reuters reported on the production issue in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program on Wednesday. When the Defense Department stops taking deliveries of F-35s, foreign customers can also be affected.
""F-35 deliveries have been temporarily paused while the government and Lockheed Martin reach an agreement on a contractual issue regarding repair work to remediate the known aircraft fastener hole primer quality escape,"" the Pentagon said in a statement, referring to a primer applied to aluminum fasteners to prevent corrosion.  
""This is not a safety of flight issue but rather a contractual resourcing issue that needs to be resolved. The government has implemented this pause to ensure the warfighter receives a quality product from industry."" 
Neither party discovered the issue at the time of production, so each has pointed to the other to fix it. It was not clear when the suspension of deliveries began.

The F-35 makes up a quarter of Lockheed's total revenue.

The firm expects earnings to exceed consensus estimates by 4 percent to 5 percent this season, even after those forecasts were raised 6 percent following the passage of tax cuts. The firm has already said it sees upside for U.S. stocks in this reporting period due to factors such as the tax overhaul, a pickup in deal activity and support from buybacks.
“Company guidance and Street estimates are likely too low with respect to actual tax benefits, weaker U.S. dollar and higher oil,” JPMorgan strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and Marko Kolanovic wrote in a note Thursday.
JPMorgan says valuations on the S&P 500 are below their historical median based on forward consensus earnings-per-share estimates. They also say that companies’ record cash holdings in a low-rate environment are supportive of stocks. U.S. corporate earnings have beat consensus estimates by an average of 3.1 percent over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Net-income margins could reach a record 13 percent on the lower effective tax rates, the note said, adding that “the Street has underappreciated the margin potential historically.”
Also, if new risks such as further escalation in Middle East tensions or a ramped-up U.S.-China trade spat don’t emerge, a shift in focus back to fundamentals should help bring realized volatility down from its current levels and drive systematic buying, the report said.
Lakos-Bujas has a year-end price target on the S&P 500 Index of 3,000, which would be a gain of about 14 percent from current levels. And he isn’t pushing the envelope -- that’s the median of strategist projections compiled by Bloomberg.
This earnings season should bring the “strongest growth of this cycle with room for estimates to be revised higher,” the strategists said."

DanoneWave is also changing its name to Danone North America, the company said in a statement on Thursday.
Danone's chief executive Emmanuel Faber has been pushing on with a dual financial and social agenda, which - like that of many blue-chip companies - aims to not only boost profits and returns for shareholders value but also meet other targets regarding environmental and social policies.
The Danone group has vowed to become the first multinational group to be certified as a B-Corp in the world as part of that broader strategy.
DanoneWave, with more than $6 billion in revenue and 6,000 employees, was born from the 2017 combination of Danone's dairy business in north America with that of U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave.
As more consumers, notably the so-called ""Millennial"" generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, Danone and its rivals such as Nestle (S:NESN) have been seeking to adapt.
In February, Danone amended its 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) syndicated credit facility to introduce global environmental and social criteria, directly impacting the margin payable to its banks over the entire duration of the facility.
Danone also launched in March its inaugural 300 million euro seven-year social bond, reflecting growing appetite in financial markets in the area of ethical investing.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Spotify puts bank IPO paydays under fund manager scrutiny,"By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - After shaking up the music industry, Spotify is now prompting investors to question the value they get from investment banks underwriting new listings with its low-cost IPO.
The music streaming firm effectively deprived banks of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees by shunning them in its $26.5 billion New York Stock Exchange float on April 3. 
Banks can charge companies as much as 7 percent of the amount raised in a U.S. listing and fund managers in London, another of the main centers for initial public offerings (IPOs), say Spotify's success means underwriters will now have to show more clearly what value they bring to companies and their backers.
""Besides saving the right type of company a lot of money, the real positive demonstrated by this kind of listing is the level playing field it creates,"" Trevor Green, head of institutional equities at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, told Reuters.
Banks have been richly rewarded for co-ordinating IPOs and ensuring companies raise the money, pocketing annual fees of $33.6 billion in the U.S. and $14.4 billion in Europe over the last decade, Thomson Reuters data shows. (https://tmsnrt.rs/2GRVTV2)
And although tussles between investment banks and asset managers over these fees are not new, evolving technology, more freely available capital for privately-held companies and regulatory pressures mean changes could now be on the cards. 
But while critics claim that high costs have discouraged some firms from joining the stock market, crimping their prospects and hindering the growth of the economy, bankers say few are likely to be able to replicate Spotify's direct listing.
This was only possible because a large number of founding shareholders wanted to sell and it was not raising a large sum of capital, meaning that for now, the route may only be open to well-known, highly valued internet firms like Spotify.
""It's a one-off,"" Suneel Hargunani, Head of EMEA Equity Syndicate at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), said on Wednesday of Spotify's listing.
""There's not a lot of companies that would tick all those boxes, hence why we don't think it's going to become too common,"" he told a Thomson Reuters/IFR briefing.
OLD SCHOOL TIES
The problem facing fund managers is that while they would like to see the companies they invest in pay less to be publicly listed, they are bound by long-standing ties to bankers who vet potential new fundraisers, influence the allocation of new stock and manage access to company executives.
And many are cautious about speaking out publicly for fear of being frozen out of highly competitive new issues. 
Banks help to make trading in newly listed shares less volatile by hand-picking institutional investors who are likely to hold them over the medium to long term, and by limiting the volume of stock sold to day traders keen to make a quick buck.
Early indications from Spotify's post listing performance are mixed, with its shares are down 8 percent from its $166 opening price and trading volumes down to a trickle, while the stock is vulnerable to bouts of volatility.
While this may not be a problem for Spotify, bankers argue that where underwriters often show their value is in helping lesser known companies through their earliest days as a publicly quoted firm.
""I would rather pay the banks their fees, accept a little dilution and have the benefit of a tried-and-tested ecosystem with a network of sponsors that will be there to help,"" another investment manager, who declined to be named, said.
But concerns about transparency and competition have led the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to call last year for a review by regulators of signs of parallel pricing which it said were said were ""akin to tacit collusion"".
Others say companies under club the longer term relationship value they could offer banks when negotiating IPO fees, with further paydays for credit facilities, buybacks, debt issues and even merger and acquisition activity later on.
Green said he expected banks to fight harder for the big paydays offered by blue chip names and do more to convince investors of the value they offer in a typical listing process.
""The reason why the Ubers and Airbnbs of this world have been able to stay unlisted is because there is so much private money available to finance their growth right now,"" he said. 
""Many of these types of well-known firms could easily go public without the support of the banks, and losing those fees would certainly sting.""
Spotify's success would at the very least prompt other high profile companies to reconsider their options before rushing into costly bank-led IPOs, the second investment manager said, adding that other alternative models were also evolving.
""Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) point to another possible route in the future to raise money with less bank sponsorship.""
In an ICO, a company attracts funding by offering investors virtual currency known as tokens. If the cash raised does not meet the minimum funds as set out in its prospectus, the money is returned and the ICO is deemed to be unsuccessful. 
""It is healthy for people to try different things; that is progress,"" Steven Magill, head of European Value at UBS Global Asset Management told Reuters. 

""If we see more situations like this, they will enable us to gain a better perspective on the advantages and disadvantages.""

1352,By Business Insider,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 09:42AM ET</span>",BANK OF AMERICA: A wildly successful stock-trading strategy is no longer working — and it signals that a bubble has burst,"For much of the nine-year bull market, the stock-trading strategy known as ""buy the dip"" was basically synonymous with ""free money.""
That's because, following any period of sharp weakness, traders could simply scoop up shares at bargain prices, and the market would recover.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch went as far as to crunch the numbers, and the results are astounding. Dating back to 2012, buying any 5% dip in S&P 500 futures — and holding until either the move retraced or 20 days passed — would have been successful 82% of the time, the firm's data found. Further, since 2014, BAML says, such a strategy has consistently outperformed the benchmark.
Sounds great, right? Well hopefully you enjoyed it while it lasted, because BAML says the buy-the-dip well has run dry in 2018.
And while it may be your immediate instinct to move on to the next foolproof strategy, the implications of the strategy's collapse are wide-reaching and could reshape the market as we know it.
At the core of buy-the-dip's failure is the Federal Reserve, which BAML says indirectly ingrained the practice into the minds of traders through monetary accommodation and a slow pace of tightening. The firm says that lulled investors into a sense of security, which explains the near-record-low stock-market volatility seen in 2017.
""The moral hazard injected by central banks in recent years teaching investors to buy-the-dip (or sell the vol spike) helped create the least volatile markets in 100+ years, and a low-vol bubble,"" Benjamin Bowler, BAML's head of global equity derivatives research, wrote in a client note. ""This led to complacency among investors that risk was not real, resulting in an unsustainable 'low vol bubble.'""
It's that last part in particular that should catch the eyes of traders. BAML is saying the historically minimal price swings that characterized so much of 2017 are a bygone relic of the past. The firm argues that volatility is now elevated as recent headlines are ""injecting fear back into the markets,"" and all bets are off.
The volatility complex has also rid itself of two controversial exchange-traded products that imploded in early February, erasing nearly $3 billion in mere minutes. The popular practice of shorting those ETPs was long blamed for stifling price swings and inflating the low-volatility bubble. And then, when it all came crashing down, they were blamed for exacerbating price losses in the broader market amid forced position covering.
But what about earnings season? Shouldn't it have a stabilizing effect? Not quite, says BAML, which thinks even a strong batch of corporate reports will be futile to stop the new high-volatility regime.
""Even if US equities do end up recovering to set new highs in 2018, perhaps on the back of a strong earnings season, simply breaking the trend of rapid recoveries (and the Pavlov buy-the-dip mentality), should prevent a return to the 2017 bubble lows in volatility,"" Bowler said.
""While that should create a new higher floor for vol in 2018, we also see today's current level of S&P volatility as unlikely to last unless equities sell off further, resulting in broader contagion across markets."""
1353,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Sanctions-hit Russian tycoons may have lost $7.5 billion,"By Andrey Ostroukh, Polina Devitt and Ritvik Carvalho
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Three Russian tycoons targeted by a new list of U.S. sanctions may have lost a combined $7.5 billion since the list was announced, according to Reuters calculations based on price moves in the listed companies the three co-own.
The U.S. Treasury on April 6 announced sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world.
The news hit Russian markets, denting the rouble and sending shares in four publicly listed companies with links to those sanctioned plummeting both in Russia and elsewhere: Rusal (HK:0486), EN+ Group (L:ENPLq), GAZ group (MM:GAZA) and Polyus (MM:PLZL).
Of the seven oligarchs, three have links to publicly listed companies: Oleg Deripaska, Viktor Vekselberg and Suleiman Kerimov.
In U.S. dollar terms, Deripaska may have lost $4.56 billion in four trading days, Vekselberg could have lost $1.32 billion, and Kerimov appeared to have lost $1.58 billion, Reuters' calculations showed.
Reuters calculated the change in capitalization of the four publicly traded companies they are linked to from just before the sanctions announcement up to the close of trade on Wednesday. It then adjusted the figures based on the stakes the three own in the firms and used the central bank's exchange rate set for April 11.
The numbers do not include possible losses related to companies sanctioned by Washington but which have no market listings.
Rusal and En+, controlled by Deripaska, declined to comment. Polyus's majority shareholder PGIL, through which the Kerimov family controls the company, also declined to comment. Vekselberg's Renova has not replied to a request for comment.
STINGING SANCTIONS
The latest sanctions have increased overall risk-aversion towards Russian assets, while hitting the companies named on the list especially hard.
The main reason for steep drops in the companies' prices is that the sanctions require investors subject to U.S. jurisdiction to ditch the stocks by May 7.
Shares in Hong Kong-listed aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486) had plunged 55.6 percent by Wednesday's close in Hong Kong compared with Friday's close in Hong Kong before the U.S. sanctions were announced.
Shares in EN+ Group (L:ENPLq), Deripaska's company listed in London late last year, had fallen 50.8 percent by Wednesday's close compared with late last Thursday on the eve of the sanctions.
Deripaska owns a 76.6 percent stake in EN+, while EN+ owns a 48 percent stake in Rusal.
Russian billionaire Vekselberg and his partners also own a 26.5 percent stake in Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer.
Shares in Russia's GAZ group (MM:GAZA), a manufacturer of light commercial vehicles in which Deripaska owns a 65 percent stake, had shed 9 percent by Wednesday evening from last Thursday's close on the Moscow Exchange.
Shares in Polyus (MM:PLZL), Russia's largest gold producer, in which the family of sanctioned tycoon Kerimov owns an 82 percent stake, dropped 20.3 percent by Wednesday's close on the Moscow Exchange compared with Thursday's close a week ago.
Polyus itself was not included in the sanctions list.
The $7.5 billion figure is a gross loss not including one-off moves to minimize the sanctions impact such as Vekselberg's reduction of his stake in Swiss pumpmaker Sulzer (S:SUN), news of which lifted Sulzer shares 15 percent on Thursday.

As part of what could be the biggest shake-up at Volkswagen in a decade, Chief Executive Matthias Mueller is due to be replaced by Herbert Diess, head of VW's core autos brand, who has repeatedly clashed with unions over cost cuts.
Volkswagen announced the CEO change on Tuesday in a short and cryptic statement, abruptly ending the reign of Mueller who took over at VW a week after it was plunged into its biggest-ever corporate scandal.
Other changes before the board include a public stock market listing of VW's truck and bus division, a management board seat for a labor representative and a reorganization of its 12 brands into four categories, sources said.
Volkswagen's efforts to reform have often been stifled by powerful labor unions who command half of the seats on the board of directors, and the German state of Lower Saxony, which controls a 20 percent voting stake.
Volkswagen shares were up 2.5 percent ahead of the board meeting due to start at 1400 GMT on Thursday at the carmaker's Wolfsburg base, and were one of the top gainers on the German blue-chip DAX (GDAXI).
""Nobody knew anything,"" a source at one of VW's brands told Reuters. ""What's going on there is plain folly.""
""The way in which changes of such a magnitude were communicated internally is more than questionable,"" a source close to VW's supervisory board said. 
Sources close to VW said the controlling Porsche-Piech families and Lower Saxony had decided they could not afford to wait because of the risk of the changes being leaked.
They had brought Thursday's board meeting forward from Friday afternoon for the same reason, the sources said.
German business daily Handelsblatt reported that Finance Chief Frank Witter was enraged about how the supervisory board had piloted the changes and that there was a risk that he could step down, citing unnamed sources at VW.
Witter did not want to comment, a VW spokesman said, while the carmaker's headquarters and works council declined comment.

The management reshuffle could affect other senior VW executives, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.

BlackRock said its iShares family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added $34.65 billion in new money in the quarter, down from $64.48 billion a year earlier.
The new assets helped BlackRock boost its revenue from managing money and lending out the stocks in its funds faster than its expenses on sales and compensation, bulking profits.
The market swung wildly during the quarter, with enthusiasm over the effect of U.S. corporate tax cuts enacted last year blunted by concerns about inflation, a global trade war and U.S. central bank policy.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said in a statement the company's institutional clients reacted dramatically, for instance by stocking away cash in the bond market, selling investments to fund investments, share buybacks or acquisitions.
""In a challenging environment, BlackRock continued to perform well,"" Fink said.
Total revenue rose 15.9 percent to $3.6 billion from the same quarter in 2017, while expenses rose just 9.8 percent to $2.2 billion. Assets under management were $6.32 trillion on March 31.
BlackRock shares climbed 2.4 percent in premarket trading.
Overall, the New York-based company's net income rose to $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $859 million, or $5.21 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, BlackRock earned $6.70 per share, which the company said was partly driven by a lower tax rate. Analysts on an average expected BlackRock to report $6.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Barington Capital Group LP has launched a fight for two board seats at machine industry company Xerium Technologies Inc., according to a regulatory filing made on Thursday.
The New York-based hedge fund, which owns 5.05 percent of Xerium, nominated two directors to sit on the company's eight member board. It named Jared Landaw, the firm's chief operating officer, and Michelle Applebaum, a former steel market industry analyst, on March 13.
On March 19, six days after Barington nominated its candidates, the company said it would explore strategic alternatives. One day after making that announcement, Xerium's chairman, James Wilson, met with Barington representatives.
The company did not return requests to comment.
On Thursday, the share price climbed 2 percent to $6.57. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 51 percent.
Barington is urging the company, which makes products used primarily in the production of paper, to consider selling itself or to find a way to refinance its $480 million of 9.5 percent senior notes.
The hedge fund currently has representatives on the boards of three industrial companies; A. Schulman, Inc., OMNOVA Solutions, Inc. and The Eastern Company.
In February, LyondellBassell Industries NV agreed to buy Schulman in a deal valued at $2.25 billion. 
James Mitarotonda, who runs Barington, tends to invest in industrial companies or retail companies. Barington, along with Shah Capital and NuOrion Partners, reached an agreement with  Avon Products  Inc (NYSE:AVP). last month to put Mitarotonda on the board.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's takeover regulator said Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) must offer to buy all of Sky if it acquires Twenty-First Century Fox's 39 percent stake and if Rupert Murdoch's Fox is prevented from purchasing all of the European pay-TV company itself.
Fox (O:FOXA) agreed an offer to buy all of Sky (L:SKYB) 17 months ago but is still waiting regulatory approval, while Disney has agreed to buy Fox assets, including its stake in Sky, in a separate deal subject to its own regulatory clearance.
The ruling means that if Fox's bid to buy Sky is blocked by the government in June because of Murdoch's media influence, Disney will have to step in to make the same offer to shareholders if and when it becomes the owner of Fox's assets.
Disney had said it should not be required to make a bid for the whole of Sky in line with Fox's existing offer if it bought the Fox assets, but Britain's Takeover Panel ruled on Thursday that it must match Fox's 10.75 pounds-a-share price.
Analysts had said Disney wanted a special dispensation to give it more flexibility on whether or when it would bid for the rest of Sky if it only bought the 39 percent stake from Fox. 
The Takeover Panel, however, said it considered that securing control of Sky might reasonably be considered to be a significant purpose of Disney's acquiring control of Fox, and it must make an offer within 28 days of buying the Fox assets.
FOX COMMITTED
The Panel's ruling will not stand if Fox has acquired 100 percent of Sky by the time Disney buys the Fox assets, or if Comcast Corp or any other third party has acquired a stake of more than 50 percent in Sky. 
U.S. cable company Comcast (O:CMCSA) said on Feb. 27 that it was considering making an offer for Sky.
Sky said it noted the Takeover Panel's ruling, and it advised shareholders to take no further action at this time.
Twenty-First Century Fox said that under the ruling, any mandatory offer by Disney would only be required after Disney's acquisition of Fox is completed, which Fox currently expects to occur after completion of Fox's offer for Sky. 
""21CF (Fox) remains committed to its recommended cash offer for Sky announced on 15th December 2016,"" it said. 

The offer was supported by revised remedies it had offered to Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, it added.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",'Urban mining' in South Korea pulls rare battery materials from recycled tech,"By Jane Chung and Ju-min Park
GUNSAN, South Korea (Reuters) - Workers at a rural South Korean factory are busy extracting some of the world's most coveted metals, used in the batteries that power electric cars.
But they're not digging in the ground or refining ore. Instead, they are sorting through a pile of lithium-ion batteries from old mobile phones and laptops.
As China’s aggressive hunt for overseas cobalt and lithium for electric vehicles pushes up prices and causes a global shortage of the key metals, South Korea is increasingly turning to such ""urban mining"" to recover cobalt, lithium and other scarce metals from electronic waste.
In 2016, the most recent year from which data is available, 19.6 trillion won ($18.38 billion) worth of metals were extracted from recycled materials, meeting roughly 22 percent of the country's total metal demand, according to a report by the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. 
SungEel HiTech is South Korea's largest battery recycler. A decade ago, the company was at a crossroads as plasma TV panels, from which it extracted gold and silver, began to phase out. 
Now it is part of a supply chain for some of the world's major battery makers, including Samsung (KS:005930) SDI (KS:006400) and LG Chem (KS:051910). 
For graphic click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2qvJoED
Yi Kang-myung, SungEel HiTech's president, said the shortage of mined metals had led his company to boost capacity by threefold this year. It plans to list in 2020.
""We are receiving phone calls from many who are showing interest,"" Yi said in an interview at the plant.
""Major automobile companies are interested in our products,: he said, without naming the automakers. He added that battery companies and POSCO, a South Korean steelmaker, are interested in getting into the recycling business themselves.
The scarcity is unlikely to abate anytime soon, as China, the world's biggest user of metals, snaps up mineral resources in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chile.
JUMPING DEMAND
SungEel HiTech, based in the southwestern city of Gunsan, can process about 8,000 tonnes per year of spent lithium-ion batteries and metal scraps.
From that, it can produce about 830 tonnes of lithium phosphate, 1,000 tonnes of cobalt metal equivalent and 600 tonnes of nickel. 
POSCO (KS:005490) processes lithium phosphate from SungEel to produce lithium carbonate for rechargeable battery makers LG and Samsung, according to SungEel and POSCO. 
The battery recycler plans to increase its processing capacity to 24,000 tonnes by 2019 and expand further in 2021, including growing its overseas operations, Yi said.
The company, however, is smaller than foreign competitors such as China's Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium (SZ:002460) and GEM Co (SZ:002340), and Belgium's  Umicore  SA (BR:UMI). 
Over the past three years, South Korea's imports of key metals for lithium-ion batteries have jumped, according to data from state-run Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources. In 2017, South Korea imported 3.5 million tonnes of nickel, up 2 percent from 2016. Cobalt imports rose 3.4 percent to 13,972 tonnes from a year ago.
Cobalt prices  jumped to average $87,615 a tonne in March, about a four-fold increase from January 2016.
That has led to more long-term supply contracts and investments in developing mines, as well as recycling efforts.  Samsung SDI  may start its own recycling business, a company spokesman said. 
Park Jai-koo, an urban mining expert at Hanyang University in Seoul, said electronic waste recycling can help mitigate high prices and limit reliance on outside sources for rare metals. 
""South Korea needs to secure resources but mostly all of them are imported,"" Park said. ""Urban mining is more likely to become a way to go.""
DIFFERENCE MAKER
About 150 small-and-medium sized companies do urban mining, according to the Korea Urban Mining Association.
At SungEel HiTech, the process is not complex or highly automated. After workers pull batteries from recycled devices, the units are drained of power and then ground into a powder from which individual metals can be separated.
Most of the products that are recycled - 60 to 70 percent - come from the United States and Europe, with the remainder from South Korea.
The recycling companies mainly focus on extracting precious metals like gold and silver. But four, including SungEel HiTech, can directly recover cobalt or produce powders from which rare metals can be extracted.
South Korea's environment ministry changed regulations in January to promote recycling by charging higher prices for waste disposal.
Yum Un-joo, chairman of the Korea Urban Mining Association, said recycled resources, if developed correctly, could be a difference maker for the industry and for his country. 
""For South Korea, we don't have an option but if we have recycled resources, that could be our strength,"" Yum said.

The report said the group, which includes investors from the United States, Saudi Arabia and China, were discussing proposals to expand the Club World Cup along with the creation of a new league competition for national teams.
The Club World Cup is an annual competition that sees seven clubs, usually winners of their continental tournaments, compete in a knock-out event. Spain's Real Madrid have won three of the last four editions.
The report said FIFA would have a 51 percent stake in the venture.
SoftBank declined to comment on the report.

The New York Times reported this week that FIFA President Gianni Infantino told his top board last month that a fund of investors from the Middle East and Asia wanted to pay about $25 billion to buy an expanded version of the Club World Cup as well as the rights to a proposed global league for national teams.

MILAN (Reuters) - Fresh dealmaking activity helped support European shares on Thursday, although investors remained cautious on worries over the prospect of U.S. military action in Syria.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.1 percent at 0821 GMT, having lost 0.6 percent on Wednesday. The FTSE (FTSE) was flat and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) lost 0.1 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia this week of an imminent military action in Syria over a suspected gas attack, declaring that missiles ""will be coming"" and lambasting Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
""We may well see a military response by the end of the week, as the situation in Syria ramps up further, and this may well temper investor enthusiasm to buy back into the market ahead of the weekend,"" said CMC market analyst Michael Hewson.
However, investors found some comfort in some merger and acquisition developments. 
 Shire  (L:SHP) rose 2.2 percent after sources told Reuters Takeda (T:4502) had sounded out creditors for loans to help finance a possible bid for the British rare disease specialist.
 Firstgroup  (L:FGP) spiked 9 percent after news it rejected a takeover approach from Apollo, while Playtech (L:PTEC) rose 8.2 percent after it agreed to buy Italian betting firm Snaitech (MI:SNAI) in a $1 billion deal. Snaitech was up 14.8 percent.
The tensions over Syria kept crude oil prices near 4 year highs, helping energy stocks advance 0.5 percent. [O/R]
In earnings some disappointing updates weighed. 
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR) fell 5 percent following weak quarterly sales, while German drugs-packaging maker Gerresheimer (DE:GXIG) also fell weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings.
Sulzer (S:SUN) rallied 15 percent after the Swiss pumpmaker said it freed itself of U.S. sanctions after authorities approved its buyback of shares that has reduced to less than 50 percent the stake of Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of holding company Renova.
The relief bounce however made up for only part of the 22 percent share price drop Sulzer suffered since the sanctions were announced last week, as some investors remained cautious.
""The fact that renewed sanctions could be imposed at a future point in time cannot be ruled out,"" Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Armin Rechberger said in a note.
""Renova could strive for reducing its respective equity interest in Sulzer (now 48.8 percent), Oerlikon (43 percent), Schmolz & Bickenbach (42 percent) and Zueblin (43 percent), which would lead to sell-off pressure,"" he added.

Shares in Oerlikon (S:OERL) rose 4.6 percent, Schmolz & Bickenbach (S:STLN) added 1.6 percent.

""I expect this to continue to be a process and not an event,"" the Financial Times on Thursday cited Ritchie as saying. Ritchie wants cuts that outsiders ""probably won't notice"" because they will happen in businesses where Deutsche is not very strong. 

The appointment on Sunday of Christian Sewing as chief executive and the abrupt departure of his predecessor John Cryan fueled market speculation of radical change at Germany's flagship lender, particularly at its investment bank, as the bank has been slower than rivals to reform after the financial crash.

The two truck makers said they will consider cooperating in areas such as diesel and gasoline-electric hybrid engines, connectivity and self-driving technologies, adding their combined output could offer economies of scale in research and development (R&D) as well as procurement.
""We can join forces and spend R&D money only once instead of twice or three times,"" Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH Chief Executive Officer Andreas Renschler told reporters at an event in Tokyo to announce the agreement.
""We see potential to save on our budgets and also to combine our resources to be faster at bringing products to market than we would be alone.""
Both companies said the partnership would not change their respective relationships with parent companies - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) owns the majority of Hino, whereas Volkswagen Truck & Bus is a division of Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
The announcement comes as Volkswagen AG aims to list its trucks and buses operations in the first quarter of next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, as the German automaker considers a broader structural overhaul to boost efficiency.
Hino sells roughly 70 percent of its commercial trucks in Japan and the rest of Asia, where it dominates the large commercial vehicle market. It has been growing operations in Africa and North America.

Volkswagen Truck & Bus's operations include the MAN Truck and Bus Company, which supplies commercial vehicles in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, as well as Sweden's Scania, which produces long-haul trucks and busses primarily for the European market but which has been growing its presence in Asia.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 04:04AM ET</span>",Takeda sounds out banks for loans as it moves towards Shire bid: sources,"By Taro Fuse
TOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) has sounded out its major creditors for loans, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, as it moves closer to a bid for London-listed rare disease specialist  Shire  (L:SHP) that could hit $50 billion. 
Expectations that Japan's largest drugmaker by sales will bid for Shire before an April 25 deadline have mounted since its chief executive Christophe Weber discussed the strategic case for the deal at a briefing with analysts last week.
Buying Shire would be transformational for Takeda but would be a huge financial stretch, since the company is worth around $10 billion more than the Japanese group.
Weber said at the briefing, which was closed to the media, that Takeda was weighing a deal for all of Shire and there was scope to increase debt, according to analysts. 
Takeda has sounded out creditors including its main bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, the two sources said on Thursday, declining to be identified as the matter was confidential. 
Japan's Kyodo News reported earlier that Takeda was looking for loans of several trillion yen (tens of billions of dollars) in total from multiple banks. 
Shares in Shire rose another 2 percent on Thursday. They have now gained 19 percent - valuing the company at more than $47 billion - since the Japanese firm said on March 28 that it was considering an offer.
Takeda shares ended down 1.2 percent in Tokyo on Thursday, valuing it at around $37 billion.
A successful bid for Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, helmed by Frenchman Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers. 
Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid. 
Representatives for Takeda, Shire and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, the core banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316), were not immediately available for comment. 
Takeda's shares have fallen more than 9 percent since it was first reported it was considering bidding.
Takeda investors have been skeptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.
Weber told analysts at last week's briefing that size was no obstacle for any ""mindful"" acquisition and Shire could accelerate his company's transformation.
The drugs industry has seen a surge in deal-making this year as large players look for promising assets to improve their pipelines, but a Takeda-Shire transaction would be by far the biggest yet.
Well priced and high-margin treatments for rare diseases have been a particular focus for several multi-billion-dollar acquisitions.
On Monday, Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) agreed to acquire gene therapy specialist AveXis (O:AVXS) for $8.7 billion, following similar purchases by the likes of France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) and U.S.-based Celgene (O:CELG).

1385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>",China Aiming for a Stock-Trading Link With London This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- China is aiming to start a stock trading tie-up between Shanghai and London this year, according to a top official, creating a system that would give investors in the world’s most populous country direct access to shares listed in the U.K.
The timing was announced by People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang at a panel discussion during the Boao Forum for Asia on Wednesday, unveiled as part of a broader package of policies that will further open up the nation’s financial sector. The program with  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc would be the third system to give foreigners access to the mainland equity market, the world’s second biggest by value. A link between Shanghai and Hong Kong started in November 2014, and a connect between the former British colony and Shenzhen’s bourse opened in December 2016.
An agreement for some sort of connection between London and Shanghai exchanges has been in the works since at least September 2015, when plans were disclosed during a visit to China by then-U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. In November 2016, LSE and the Shanghai bourse agreed to “develop rules and implementation arrangements.”
The link’s importance is symbolic, as U.K. investors already have access to mainland shares through the Hong Kong links and Chinese traders can use offshore subsidiaries of domestic brokerages to buy stocks in London, said Huang Dongsheng, Shanghai-based head of research at Weifang Fund, which manages more than 4 billion yuan ($637 million). But, he said, “the program signifies that China’s deepening its opening-up effort and its push to make the yuan a global currency.”
The new link will allow global investors to access China A-shares from outside Greater China for the first time and through international trading and settlement practices, said Nikhil Rathi, who runs London Stock Exchange Plc.
Linking the mainland’s capital markets with London is good news for the U.K., China and the wider global economy, said Rathi. “U.K. listed companies will be able to access Chinese investors directly, while Chinese investors will be able to truly access international stocks from China,” he said.
Quota Increases
Yi also said China would raise the daily limit for net buying to Hong Kong using the stock connects to 42 billion yuan from 10.5 billion yuan on May 1. The daily northbound quota will be raised to 52 billion yuan from 13 billion yuan, he said. Investors are expecting increased use of the links when Chinese-listed stocks are added to MSCI Inc.’s global emerging markets index in June. The system has seen the daily limit hit just three times: northbound on Nov. 17, 2014, the day the Shanghai program started, and southbound on April 8 and April 9, 2015.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which administers the southern end of the connects, rose 3.1 percent in morning trading, its biggest gain since Feb. 26. Chief Executive Officer Charles Li welcomed the quota increase. “We appreciate that the regulators have been responsive to evolving market needs,” he said in a statement.
“I’m surprised to see China expanding the daily quotas so soon and by that much,” said Banny Lam, head of research at CEB International Investment Corp. “This sends a signal from the officials: We are really opening up the market and proceeding quickly.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Wednesday the U.S. economy still looked ""pretty good"" and that there was no law that says growth cannot continue.
But there will be a downturn at some point, Dimon told the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at Harvard University. Asked to assess the chances the U.S. economy would dip into a recession, he said that was a certainty. But he could not say when that might happen.
He said growth for now looked robust as more jobs were being created, wages were rising, consumer credit was strong and the rest of the world was performing relatively well. ""I think it should be OK through 2018 and part of 2019,"" Dimon said, adding the economy looked ""pretty good.""
Speaking at a forum about revitalizing Detroit, Dimon added that good public policies, including streamlining certain regulations, were critical to keeping the economic engine running.
""If you have an idea to build a bridge, it takes 10 years to get the permits ... it is a disgrace and it needs to be fixed,"" Dimon said.
Speaking just across the river from Boston, Dimon said the bank planned to open branches there. ""I said it, we are coming to Boston,"" Dimon said.
JPMorgan has already laid out plans to increase its branch network by roughly 8 percent and open about 400 new locations. Besides Boston, Dimon said the bank was eyeing Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
Dimon said those branches would have fewer tellers but more financial advisers to help solve customers' problems. He said technology would certainly change the face of banking but that people still needed loans and financial advice. ""You use technology to do a better job for clients. I am not afraid at all about technology,"" he said.
As head of the biggest U.S. bank, Dimon is often seen as the face of Wall Street. Lately, he has turned more of his attention to advocating for public policies to boost the economy, including infrastructure and job skills training.

JPMorgan has committed $150 million to help revitalize Detroit and Dimon has thrown his weight behind the city's mayor, Mike Duggan, who also spoke at the forum. The bank's investment is primarily focused on Detroit's neighborhoods rather than its downtown.

After more than a decade of recalls, lawsuits and a criminal investigation which drove Takata to bankruptcy, the deal ensures the Japanese company will be able to continue producing replacement inflators before winding itself down, which may take years. 
The combined companies would be renamed Joyson Safety Systems, after a consortium led by KSS's Chinese parent company, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, provided funding to acquire most of Takata's operations, Joyson Safety Systems said in a statement. The new company will be based in Michigan.
The acquisition will provide Joyson Safety Systems with additional manufacturing capability to compete with auto safety industry leaders Autoliv Inc and ZF TRW. 
The agreement on Wednesday marks the denouement in the drawn-out demise of family-run Takata. Founded in 1933 as a textiles company specializing in parachute manufacturing, Takata at its peak was the world's No. 3 air-bag maker and produced one-third of all seatbelts used in vehicles sold globally.
Most Takata air-bag inflators contain a chemical compound which could explode with excessive force, spraying shrapnel into vehicle compartments, which have been linked to numerous deaths and injuries, mainly in the United States.
The company has struggled to churn out replacement parts after a global recall of tens of millions of inflators. In 2017 it pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing over its inflators, including submitting false inflator test results to automaker clients to induce them to buy its defective products. 
PRESIDENT RESIGNS
The acquisition excludes Takata's liabilities related to its faulty inflators, and leaves the Japanese company, restructured as part of U.S. and Japanese bankruptcy proceedings, responsible for those operations.
As part of its bankruptcy, Takata has been broken down into three parts: one holding its good assets, including operations for seat belts and other safety systems which were acquired by KSS; operations to manufacture replacement inflators until the global recall is complete; and an entity which will oversee claim payments and be wound down eventually.
In a statement, Takata President and Chairman Shigehisa Takada, grandson of the company's founder who had been widely criticized for keeping a low profile even as the air-bag crisis escalated, said he had resigned as head of the company.
A U.S. court in February approved Takata's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, under which the company's U.S. subsidiary agreed to set up a victims compensation fund and repay automaker creditors, which have been footing the bill for years of recalls, only a tiny portion of their unsecured claims totaling roughly $38.6 billion, U.S. court filings show.
Court documents related to the parent company's Japanese bankruptcy proceedings seen earlier this year by Reuters show that the car makers are likely to also forgo the vast majority of their unsecured claims against the company, which totaled around $16.8 billion. 

Automakers will also receive payments from a $850 million fund set up as part of a $1 billion settlement reached by Takata and U.S. authorities in 2017 over its criminal investigation, although most remain liable to legal action by victims, and may face further recall costs down the line.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2018 04:55AM ET</span>",Simmering Middle East tensions keep stocks under pressure,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks edged down further on Thursday as anxious investors stayed wary of risky assets, seeking protection against a threatened clash between Western powers and Russia in Syria. 
The ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions over an alleged chemical attack by Syrian government forces weighed on equities and kept bond yields low, while oil prices eased back slightly, having surged to 2014 highs as a result of the tensions in the Middle East.
MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) fell for the second day, while European shares (STOXX) declined 0.1 percent in early deals. 
Aside from the political developments, European investors also awaited a European Central Bank meeting later in the day, hoping for greater clarity on the bank's timing for the unwinding of quantitative easing.
Losses were limited by strong oil and gas stocks (SXEP), boosted by this week's jump in crude prices. 
U.S. President Trump declared that missiles ""will be coming"" in Syria, taunting Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after the suspected chemical attack in Douma. Damascus and Moscow have denied any responsibility.
His comments raised the prospect of direct conflict over Syria for the first time between the two world powers backing opposing sides in the seven-year-old civil war.
Heightened geopolitical tensions have piled pressure on investors already rattled by a trade spat between the U.S. and China and a generally more volatile market environment. 
""We are seeing this regime shift take place in terms of drivers to volatility,"" said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer of private banking at UBP in Zurich. 
Villamin expects the VIX (VIX) gauge of S&P 500 volatility to stay around the 20 mark - roughly twice its average level last year.
""If your portfolio today looks like it did last year, then you probably haven't done enough to adapt your exposure,"" he said.
Crude prices eased back slightly after three sessions of strong gains took them to the highest levels since late 2014.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) last traded down 0.3 percent at $66.66 a barrel, having risen 7.4 percent so far this week. They traded as high as $67.45 on Wednesday.
Brent (LCOc1) declined 0.4 percent to $71.77 a barrel, having touched a high of $73.09 on Wednesday.
European government bond yields remained low as caution dominated ahead of the ECB meeting. Germany's 10-year Bund yield slipped to 0.493 in early trades. 
""Investors are really torn on bonds right now because they know the economy is strong and inflation is coming up,"" said Villamin. 
He started adding to government bonds last month for the first time since 2016, hoping to benefit from bonds' relatively low volatility. 
Safe-haven gold edged down slightly after minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday raised expectations the U.S. could raise rates at a faster pace.
Gold  eased 0.3 percent to trade at $1,348.75 per ounce, having hit an 11-week high at $1,365.30 on Wednesday. 
Currency markets drifted after some strong risk-averse moves.
The dollar index (DXY) inched higher, though it was still 0.5 percent down on the week. The safe-haven yen  edged lower, having been bid up strongly on Wednesday.
The euro (EUR=) was little moved, at $1.2369 ahead of the ECB meeting.
Russia's rouble edged up for a second day after heavy selling due to new punitive sanctions by the United States.
It traded around 62.29 to the dollar (RUB=), still down more than 7 percent this week.
The Turkish lira , which has been highly sensitive to developments in neighboring Syria, traded at 4.1345 per dollar after hitting a record low of 4.1920 on Wednesday. 
The lira is down 2.5 percent so far this week, also hit by concern about inflation and the central bank's reluctance to tighten its policy.
Concerns on the Middle East have overshadowed budding optimism that Washington and Beijing will work out a compromise to avert a trade war following Chinese President Xi Jinping's speech on Tuesday.
""Underneath the saber-rattling, there's negotiations, so maybe that is a bit of a buying opportunity,"" said Gill Lakin, chief investment officer at Brompton Asset Management.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",Ford to ramp up Lincoln rollout in China in bid to catch rivals: sources,"By Paul Lienert and Norihiko Shirouzu
DETROIT/BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's (N:F) premium Lincoln brand plans to build as many as five new vehicles in China by 2022, according to two U.S. sources, in a move to expand sales in the world's largest vehicle market that would also blunt the impact of trade U.S-China trade spats.
Ford has said it plans to build an all-new sport utility vehicle in China by the end of 2019, however the company has not detailed future production plans for the Lincoln brand in China beyond that.
""Our localization plans to support the China market are on track and will serve to further drive Lincoln’s growth in China,"" Lincoln spokeswoman Angie Kozleski said. ""Beyond that, it would be premature to discuss our future product and production plans or timing.""
Sources familiar with Ford's production plans told Reuters the automaker now expects to begin building the new Lincoln Aviator in China in late 2019 or early 2020, along with replacements for the MKC compact crossover and the MKZ midsize sedan, followed in 2021 by the all-new Nautilus, which replaces the Lincoln MKX crossover.
A fifth model, a small coupe-like crossover, is tentatively slated for production in China in 2022, the sources said.
Ford has much to lose if the war of words over trade between China and U.S. President Donald Trump escalates into a full-blown tariff war. Last year, it shipped about 80,000 vehicles to China from North America, more than half of them Lincolns to support the brand's growth. 
All Lincoln vehicles that Ford now sells in China are brought in from North America. 
Even if China does reduce its 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles - as Chinese President Xi Jinping promised on Tuesday - it is not clear that would mean a big, long-term increase in Fords and Lincolns made in U.S. factories heading to Chinese showrooms.
Ford is pursuing long-range plans to build more vehicles in China to serve a market that is now roughly 60 percent larger than the U.S. market, and projected to keep growing. 
But it is playing catch up to hometown rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and German luxury brands including Audi (DE:NSUG), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Mercedes-Benz (DE:DAIGn), which have invested heavily in Chinese production in recent years as a form of insurance against trade, political and currency gyrations and to lower price points for their premium cars. 
Chinese vehicle imports from all markets last year climbed to 1.2 million, but still represent less than 5 percent of total vehicle sales in the country, according to figures from the China Automobile Dealers Association. Less than a quarter of the imported vehicles sold in China - 267,473, according to Statista - came from U.S. auto plants. 
The current 25-percent tariff rate makes it tough for Ford's American premium brand to compete with GM's Cadillac and the Germans, which avoid the import tariff on their locally built vehicles.
“As long as Lincolns are not manufactured in China, the brand’s sales will no doubt suffer continuously,” Zhu Kongyuan, Secretary General of the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce (CADCC), told Reuters.
SLOWER START IN CHINA
The Lincoln brand launched in China four years ago, and local production of the first Lincoln-brand vehicles will not start for another 18-24 months, people familiar with the company's plans said. 
The entire localization process could take Ford as long as four years.
All five Lincoln models are expected to offer hybrid gasoline-electric variants, to help Ford meet China's tough new quotas for electrified vehicles, the sources said.
While it sold 54,124 vehicles in China last year - a record for the brand - Lincoln continues to trail Cadillac and the German luxury brands by a wide margin in that market. 
Cadillac - which GM launched in China in 2004 - builds in China virtually all of the vehicles it sells there and thus avoids the steep import duty. Cadillac outsold Lincoln by more than three-to-one in China last year, selling a total of 175,489 vehicles though a network of roughly 180 retail stores. China is Cadillac’s largest market.

If Beijing follows through on its threat to double import tariffs before Lincoln can ramp up local production, the resulting price hikes on its imported models could persuade many people to buy a Cadillac or a Lexus instead, said CADCC's Zhu.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",EDP bullish on U.S. renewable power despite Trump's support for coal,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - EDP-Energias de Portugal is optimistic about renewable power investments in the United States, despite President Donald Trump's push to support coal and nuclear power plants and a tariff his administration slapped on imported solar panels, its chief executive said in an interview.
""U.S. renewables represent the growth engine of our company,"" António Mexia, who since 2006 has run the power utility EDP (LS:EDP), one of Portugal's biggest companies, said in an interview on Tuesday. 
U.S. wind and solar power projects represented 65 percent of new investments last year at EDP's renewables arm EDPR (LS:EDPR), and are expected to continue at that rate in 2018 and in 2019, Mexia said. EDPR operates renewable projects in 11 other countries in Europe and the Americas.
This month, EDPR and four other companies joined with a Northern California power provider to develop an offshore wind farm with advanced floating turbines, expected to have the capacity to generate between 100 to 150 megawatts (MW). The group is talking with fishing industry and Department of Defense representatives about locations for the wind farm.
Mexia said floating technology needs to be proven commercially, but tests for the last five years off the coast of Portugal have shown the floating turbines, which use technology similar to floating oil rigs, have survived waves up to 56 feet (17 m) high.
""Traditional offshore (wind power) surprised everybody and I am sure floating offshore will do the same,"" Mexia said. The advantage of floating platforms, to be placed about 20 miles (32 km) offshore in deep water, is their increased efficiency, which he expects will reach between 50 and 60 percent of rated peak capacity. That's up from about 37 percent efficiency, which the U.S. Energy Information Administration said was the wind power industry's average in 2017. 
EDPR also invests in U.S. solar power, but its latest project is carefully planned to begin operations after the phase out of a tariff on imported solar panels that Trump signed into law on Jan. 23. The 30 percent tariff on the panels drops to 15 percent a few years later before being phased out entirely.
EDPR has secured a 200 MW power purchase agreement on the solar project with Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative in Indiana, with the start of operations expected in 2022.
Mexia, who was in Washington for a summit of leaders of the global electric power industry, said he is confident wind power will thrive in the United States because there are nearly 1,000 U.S. plants and companies that make parts or source parts for turbines, ensuring the renewables sector has broad support nationwide.
Coal will have a role in the near future, he said, but eventually he expects it is an ""industry that will disappear"" despite efforts by the Trump administration to slash regulations on coal and to use subsidies to support struggling power plants that burn the fossil fuel. 
Coal was an important resource domestically for EDP last year. EDP posted a weaker-than-expected 2017 profit after its revenue fell 6 percent as a severe drought in Portugal and Spain sapped its reservoirs for hydropower and forced it to resort to more expensive power generation including coal and combined cycle plants, the company said in March. 
Despite the Trump administration's policies to support coal and nuclear plants, Mexia sees the United States a preferable place to invest in renewables than many countries in Europe. 
And Mexia is hopeful that Trump's policies will not spark a U.S. trade war with China, that could affect EDP. The company's biggest shareholder is China Three Gorges, a Chinese state-owned power company, which owns a nearly 24 percent stake. 

""It's a game where nobody wins,"" Mexia said of trade wars.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 06:32PM ET</span>",U.S. bank regulators propose easing capital curb on leverage,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators on Wednesday proposed easing a key capital rule designed to restrict bank leverage, a move that would free up $400 million of capital across the largest U.S. banks. 
The proposal from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would reduce the ""enhanced supplementary leverage ratio"" (eSLR) and more closely tie the overall capital charge to a bank's business model.
The announcement is the second this week from the Fed seeking to sharpen capital requirements to make them more sensitive to banks' own business models. 
Together, they mark the first major step by the Fed to revise bank regulations introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis under the Republican administration of Donald Trump. 
Currently, the eight largest U.S. banks are required to hold additional capital to reflect risks they pose to the broader system. 
The eSLR is intended to serve as a backstop, aimed at ensuring the nation's largest banks are holding a minimum level of capital and not over-extending themselves on leverage.
Banks have long complained that the rule is too blunt, forcing them to tie up capital that could be put to use elsewhere. They have pushed regulators to rethink how the eSLR is calculated.
Currently, the eight largest U.S. banks must hold a fixed extra layer of capital measured as the ratio of a firm’s tier 1 capital to its total leverage exposure. The ratio is currently at least 3 percent plus an extra layer of 2 percent.
The new proposal reduces the fixed ratio for U.S. bank holding companies to 3 percent, with the extra charge instead directly tied to the bank's risk profile.
""The resulting leverage standard would be more closely tailored to each firm,"" the regulators said in a statement.
Changes to the eSLR have been in train for some time and the proposal comes after regulators agreed globally at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December to set a new minimum leverage standard. 
That minimum is lower than that set by U.S. regulators, giving new officials appointed by Trump room to ease the ratio as part of their mission to boost lending and economic growth.
The change was voted for on Tuesday by Fed Chairman Jay Powell and Vice Chair Randal Quarles, but in an unusual move Governor Lael Brainard voted against the proposal.

The changes are subject to a 30-day comment period.

1399,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 04:49PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Geopolitical Tensions, Jobless Claims, Kashakri Speech on Tap
While geopolitical tensions are expected to remain front and centre on Thursday, U.S. economic data could provide a much needed distraction with jobless claims, trade data and a speech by Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on tap. 
The Labor Department releases its weekly count of the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended April 6, expected to show jobless claims rose to 231,000 from 242,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are forecast to rise to 1.848 million from 1.808m the prior week.
Economists’ forecast the export price index growth remained unchanged at 0.2% in March, while import price index growth is expected to decline to 0.1%.
On the monetary policy front, investors will look to a speech by Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari at 5.00 p.m. ET.
The Minneapolis Federal Reserve bank’s president speech is due as investors digested somewhat hawkish Federal Reserve minutes released Wednesday.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve March meeting did little to knock confidence of further rate hikes as Fed Committee members remained confident of continued economic growth and appeared more optimistic on inflation hitting the Fed’s 2% target.
While the Fed minutes helped the dollar to pare some of its losses against its rivals, sentiment on the greenback remained negative amid rising geopolitical tensions.
2. OPEC Monthly Report to Upstage Geopolitical Fuelled Oil Rally?
Investors will look a monthly OPEC monthly report to assess whether the oil-cartel stuck to agreed production curbs. Revision to oil demand growth and supply is also expected to garner attention after OPEC warned of rising non-OPEC production, led by the United States.
In its most recent report released in March, OPEC said non-OPEC producers would boost supply by 1.66 million barrels per day in 2018.
Crude futures rose 2% to settle at $66.82 a barrel as concerns over a massive build in crude stockpiles were offset by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and expectations of U.S. military intervention in Syria.
3. Investors Take Bearish Turn on Tesla Despite Model Y News
There’s a dark cloud looming over shares of Tesla as Goldman Sachs cut its price target on stock to $195 from $205, MarketWatch reported, citing a research note.
The bank said Tesla would likely raise capital this year, and questioned whether the electric carmaker would be able to meet its production targets.
Tesla's ""sustainable production rate at present is likely below 2,000 Model 3s,"" around 1,400 a week, the Goldman Sachs said in the note, according to MarketWatch.
That is well below Tesla's second-quarter forecast to produce 5,000 Model 3s a week.
Also adding to bearish sentiment on Tesla was a Factset report, noting that more than 25% of Tesla’s available stock was sold short. The dollar amount of shares shorted on Tesla rose 28% in the last month to $10.7 billion, CNBC said, citing an update from S3 Partners.
The downbeat note on Tesla comes amid a Reuters report that the company is targeting November 2019 as the start of production for its Model Y sport utility vehicle, with production in China to begin two years later.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 07:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon stops accepting Lockheed F-35 jets over repair cost dispute,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense has stopped accepting most deliveries of F-35 jets from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) because of a dispute over who will cover costs for fixing a production error, three people familiar with the matter said.
Lockheed confirmed on Wednesday that the Pentagon had halted deliveries of the jet over a contractual issue, but did not give further details. 
Last year, the Pentagon stopped accepting F-35s for 30 days after discovering corrosion where panels were fastened to the airframe, an issue that affected more than 200 of the stealthy jets. Once a fix had been devised, the deliveries resumed, and Lockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017.
But deliveries were paused again over a dispute as to who will pay for what will likely be a complex logistical fix that could require technicians to travel widely to mend aircraft based around the world, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
When the Pentagon stops taking delivery of F-35s, foreign customers can also be affected. So far at least two foreign governments have stopped accepting F-35s as a result of this issue, two of the sources said.
A Lockheed spokeswoman said on Wednesday: ""Production on the F-35 program continues and we are confident we will meet our delivery target of 91 aircraft for 2018. While all work in our factories remains active, the F-35 Joint Program Office has temporarily suspended accepting aircraft until we reach an agreement on a contractual issue and we expect this to be resolved soon.""
It was not clear when the suspension of deliveries began.
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The fastening issue on the F-35 fleet was not affecting flights, nor was it a safety concern, the Pentagon said last year.
The delivery pause is the latest of several production issues that have arisen in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, and comes at a time when the administration of President Donald Trump has criticized the cost of the fighter.
In 2016, a fix for insulation problems in the fuel tanks and lines of the jets caused a slowdown in deliveries.
Shares of Lockheed erased a 2.7 percent gain on the day after Reuters reported the suspension. They closed flat at $339.44.
GOVERNMENT INSPECTION 
At the heart of the dispute is the government's inspection of the planes during Lockheed's production, which failed to discover problems with the fastenings, the sources said. Because neither party caught the issue at the time each is pointing the finger at the other to pay for the fix.
Two jets were received by the Pentagon despite the suspension because of specific needs in the field, one of the people said.
During routine maintenance at Hill Air Force Base in Utah last year, the Air Force detected ""corrosion exceeding technical limits,"" where the carbon fiber exterior panel is fastened to the aluminum airframe.
A lack of protective coating at the fastening point that would have prevented corrosion was identified as the primary problem, the Pentagon said at the time.

The F-35 business accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed's total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed's aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35 and highlighting the program's importance to Lockheed's profitability.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department called an economist on Wednesday to testify that allowing AT&T (N:T) to purchase movie and TV production company  Time Warner  (N:TWX) would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars, as the government wrapped up efforts to convince a federal judge to halt the proposed deal.
Carl Shapiro, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said the planned $85.4 billion merger would give AT&T, which owns satellite and streaming television provider DirecTV, leverage to charge more for Time Warner's Turner family of channels, which includes sports content and CNN.
It would also give AT&T the opportunity to coordinate with Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA), which owns NBCU, to starve cheaper online video companies of content, he said.
Shapiro is expected to be the government's last witness as it seeks to show that the proposed merger is illegal under antitrust law because it would raise pay TV costs to consumers. The government filed a lawsuit in November and is asking U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon to block the deal.
Following Shapiro, AT&T's lawyers are expected to call their own economist, Dennis Carlton of the University of Chicago.
Shapiro testified that AT&T's ownership of DirecTV means that it will likely raise rates for content when it negotiates contracts with other cable and satellite companies, and will be more willing to let contracts lapse so DirecTV could win over irritated subscribers when the rival ""goes dark.""
Blackouts mattered, he said. ""Even though they don't happen very much, that's the key to leverage,"" he said.
Leon noted that a Comcast executive said in testimony that when its content subsidiary NBCU negotiates with rivals that it does not consider a blackout of a rival a way for Comcast to win new subscribers. 
""That's what they say. Is that correct? Do you have a different understanding?"" he asked.
Shapiro noted that companies tend to function as one entity rather than parts. NBCU's strategy of steering clear of a blackout ""would not be in the combined interest of the company. They would be leaving money on the table,"" he said.
On cross examination, Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for AT&T and Time Warner, pressed Shapiro on why he did not factor into his model an arbitration offer made by AT&T that would prevent blackout. 
He also questioned other aspects of the government expert's report.

The trial, which began in mid-March in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 02:57PM ET</span>",India's PNB says internal probe into $2 billion fraud ongoing; more heads could roll,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's state-run  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) is conducting an internal investigation into an alleged $2 billion fraud and more heads could roll, its chief executive said in an interview on Wednesday.
The country's second-biggest state lender disclosed in February that companies owned by two jewelers defrauded it by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks, using illegal guarantees issued by rogue staff at a Mumbai PNB branch over several years.
Indian authorities have arrested 20 people, and a court has issued non-bailable warrants against jewelers Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. The duo have denied the allegations against them, and authorities say they both left the country before the fraud was uncovered. 
""We are examining every aspect of it, and if we find others involved we will not spare them,"" said PNB CEO Sunil Mehta, in his first interview with a foreign news outlet since the fraud was uncovered.
PNB has so far suspended 21 officials and Mehta said the bank was carrying out an investigation to find out how the fraud - the biggest in Indian banking history - went unnoticed for more than half a decade. 
Several experts have also questioned the failure of external auditors approved by India's central bank - known as statutory auditors - to detect the illegalities. These firms often only do top line reviews, not in-depth inspections.
""I don't blame them. They come only for a short period of time and they go and basically see data only on the CBS,"" said Mehta, referring to PNB's core banking software.
PNB has said the rogue bankers hid the fraud by issuing the guarantees via the SWIFT interbank messaging system, while not entering corresponding entries in the CBS. 
The bank will soon finish integrating its CBS with SWIFT so this cannot happen again, Mehta said.
The banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, which has directed all banks to ensure this fix is implemented before the end of April, has not done any specific audit of PNB since the incident, Mehta said.
TIGHTER RULES
Mehta, who took over as PNB CEO last May, said the bank was adding more checks to prevent a handful of employees from carrying out a similar fraud. That would also mean centralizing some tasks and cutting branches' powers to approve credit.
""Earlier we were dependent mainly on physical inspection of the branches. Now we're going to create an offline monitoring cell. Besides the physical inspection we will also monitor all exceptional transactions,"" he said, flanked by a team of media advisers in his spacious office.
PNB will route all its foreign exchange transactions through its back office at its New Delhi headquarters. Branches on their own will not be allowed to both receive and approve credit requests.
Reuters reported last month that PNB had stepped up controls on the use of SWIFT, allowing only senior staff to use the platform, and taking away the authority of clerks to do so.
Mehta said PNB grew its domestic deposits by 6.2 percent in the year ended March 31. Domestic credit grew by 10 percent, a figure he expects the bank will be able to replicate in the current fiscal year.
He declined to reveal any other financial figures for the January-March quarter, which could take a hit due to a hefty provision. The central bank has allowed PNB to spread the losses over four quarters, Mehta said.
In March, PNB agreed to pay 65 billion rupees ($996 million) to counterparty banks. It added it would assume any subsequent liability from the fraud, to prevent disruptions in the banking sector.

""We have the capacity and the capability to bear the loss."" he said, adding that privatization of public sector banks was not the answer to the current crisis.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Once one of Germany's chief power brokers in finance,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Chairman Paul Achleitner's switch of chief executive has triggered criticism that it was rushed through, casting a cloud over his own future. 
Earlier this week, Achleitner forced out CEO John Cryan after a row that centered on what some describe as Cryan's 'indecisiveness' in cutting jobs and costs, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Pressure had built as the group's share price tumbled in recent months, with problems further compounded by heavy losses. 
Achleitner now hopes the appointment of Christian Sewing, who is expected to outline his plans in the coming weeks, will give fresh impetus to management albeit without any big change in strategy, those people said.
Cryan's departure, orchestrated by Achleitner, who broke off a family Easter holiday in Peru to travel to New York and London to forewarn some investors, took many other major shareholders by surprise, the sources said.
The rushed nature of the replacement, sealed at a hastily convened Sunday meeting of non-executive directors, has prompted criticism of Achleitner and his role at a bank that was once the flagship of Europe's top economy but is now floundering.
It is the second change of CEO under his watch.
""Achleitner ignored things for too long. He should have given the bank direction,"" said Hendrik Leber, a fund manager at one of the bank's shareholders, Acatis Fondsmanager.
A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Achleitner had discreetly prepared for the change over many months, the people who spoke to Reuters said. 
But for those outside the small circle of managers involved, the announcement came unexpectedly, prompting some to question why Cryan had to go as the bank continues a delicate turnaround.
""Why was it necessary to appoint a new CEO at this point?"" said Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes EOS, which represents pension funds and other investors, adding that Achleitner had ""overseen a number of strategic U-turns"" and multiple management changes.
'NICE GUY'
Some of the group's largest shareholders also have similar misgivings about the decision to appoint Sewing, a manager who joined the bank from school and who had a low profile before being appointed as chief executive.
One person with knowledge of the meeting where directors were told of the CEO switch said Achleitner presented the change as a done deal, offering no alternative candidate and leaving them with little choice but to reluctantly agree.
Achleitner, the person said, appeared ""irritated"" by the discord during what was a tense three-and-a-half hour gathering, where directors, including those representing large shareholders, dialed in from around the globe.
Translation of the conversation into different languages further drew out the discussion, as Sewing waited in a room nearby in case he should be asked to join. 
Achleitner has defended his action. ""There was lack of speed by the management board in making decisions and executing them,"" he told a German newspaper this week. 
Others echo this view. ""John Cryan is nice, a really lovely guy,"" said one former colleague, who worked with him at Deutsche. 
""If you tell him there are risks associated with making cuts, he wants to analyze those risks to death before going ahead. Real cost-cutters say: 'I need 100 heads to roll in this division'."" Cryan, a British former UBS banker, could not be reached for comment.
But dissatisfaction over the manner of his replacement may have repercussions for the Austrian financier - Achleitner had preferred to discreetly exercise his influence but now finds himself center stage.
Achleitner is already facing a backlash at the bank's annual shareholder meeting on May 24.
One investor, Ralf Kugelstadt, filed a motion to that meeting urging investors to vote against ratifying the supervisory board's actions for the past year. Such a move is equivalent to calling a vote of no confidence.
""It is time for all of this fiddling around without a vision to stop. Lead Deutsche Bank into the future and not into irrelevance,"" Kugelstadt wrote in his proposal posted on April 9. 
CONUNDRUM
Whatever the protest, Achleitner, whose term as chairman continues until 2020, does not intend to resign.
He is a seasoned executive, who has survived corporate storms in the past, such as when he helped mastermind insurer Allianz's (DE:ALVG) 24-billion-euro takeover of Dresdner Bank, a business that later racked up heavy losses before being sold on.
Achleitner remains influential in German business and sits on the supervisory board of car giant Daimler and Bayer (DE:BAYGN). He shares an office in Munich with Joachim Faber, the chairman of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), the country's stock exchange operator.
His wife, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, is an academic who also sits as a non-executive director on the supervisory boards of Deutsche Boerse and reinsurer Munich Re (DE:MUVGn).
Achleitner has sought to distance himself from Deutsche's strategic blunders.
But Wolfgang Gerke of the Bavarian Financial Centre, a research institute, said he bore responsibility, alongside executives. Asked whether he should resign, he said: ""His wife is a friend of mine, but the truth is, yes.""
It now falls to Sewing to take up where Cryan left off. The years-old conundrum of whether or not to focus on international investment banking or build a steady if unexciting German retail business remains.
For three decades, the bank's primary focus was building up its investment bank into a global powerhouse. That rapid growth landed the bank in hot water, and since then, the bank has flip-flopped as it tries to define its mission.
The bank is conducting a global review of its investment unit and is expected to present early results in weeks. 
""I can imagine that we make adjustments in the investment bank, also in some regions,"" Sewing said on national television on his first day in the job.
But patience is running out.
""Deutsche Bank doesn't just need a change of people, it needs a sustainable strategy to steer it into calmer waters,"" said Gerhard Schick, a German lawmaker with the Green party.

""In this respect, Achleitner, in what he has done, has not really been convincing.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has been hit with a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court accusing it of charging surprise fees when it stopped letting customers buy cryptocurrency with credit cards in late January and began treating the purchases as cash advances. 
Filed on Tuesday on behalf of a proposed nationwide class, the lawsuit said Chase (N:JPM) charged both extra fees and substantially higher interest rates on the cash advances than on the credit cards and refused to refund the charges when customers complained.
Chase spokeswoman Mary Jane Rogers declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the bank stopped processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrency on Feb. 3 because of the credit risk involved. Customers can use their Chase debit cards to buy cryptocurrency from their checking accounts without incurring cash advance charges, she said. 
Several banks in Britain and the United States, including Lloyds Banking Group Plc (L:LLOY), Virgin Money (L:VM) and  Citigroup  (N:C), banned the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies earlier this year after a dramatic fall in the value of bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency.
Bitcoin has fallen in value by more than half from a peak of almost $20,000 in December amid concerns about regulatory crackdown. 
The named plaintiff in the lawsuit, Idaho resident Brady Tucker, was hit with $143.30 in fees and $20.61 in surprise interest charges by Chase for five cryptocurrency transactions between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2, his lawsuit said. Hundreds or possibly thousands of other Chase customers were hit with the charges, Tucker said.
Tucker called Chase's customer service line to dispute the charges but the bank refused to remove them, according to the lawsuit. 
With no advance warning, Chase ""stuck the plaintiff with the bill, after the fact of his transactions, and insisted that he pay it,"" the lawsuit said. A lawyer for Tucker could not be reached for comment.
The lawsuit accuses Chase of violating the U.S. Truth in Lending Act, which requires credit card issuers to notify customers in writing of any significant change in charges or terms. The lawsuit is asking for actual damages and statutory damages of $1 million.

The case is Brady Tucker et al v Chase Bank USA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No 18-3155

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 04:47PM ET</span>","Family of Tesla crash driver hires law firm, questions autopilot","By Munsif Vengattil and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The family of a driver killed in a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) car crash has hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, the law firm said on Wednesday, adding that the Autopilot feature in the electric carmaker's vehicle probably caused his death.
Walter Huang died in a crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, last month, prompting investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agencies are also investigating the battery fire that followed the crash.
Tesla later said the car had activated Autopilot, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings to put his hands on the wheel.
The NTSB confirmed on Wednesday that it has two other pending investigations of other Tesla crashes, including a probe of an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, that occurred after an owner lost control and ran into his garage. That fire probe had not previously been reported.
""We're really more looking at the fire aspects,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters, saying that the battery continued to ignite even after it was loaded onto a truck.
Tesla did not immediately comment on the August incident.
The NTSB previously said it also is probing an incident in which a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode struck a fire truck in California in January.
The law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot feature was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system.
""(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,"" Minami said.
While sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang, saying he was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless engaged Autopilot.
Tesla said the system always reminds drivers to be alert and have hands on the wheel and had warned Huang several times on the day of the crash to do so. 

""The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,"" a Tesla spokesperson told Reuters.

Toys 'R' Us, once the largest U.S. toy retailer, abandoned last month a plan to emerge from U.S. Chapter 11 as a slimmer, reorganized company after a dismal holiday sales season.
The company has said it will try to maintain more profitable locations in Europe and Asia as an on-going business while it liquidates its U.S. and U.K. operations.
Speaking at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing in Richmond, Virginia, Sussberg said the company was in advanced discussions with a buyer for its Central European business.
In the United States, liquidation sales and real estate auctions were going better than expected, Sussberg said, creating additional money to repay creditors. 
Toys 'R' Us suppliers have expressed concern in court papers over payments on hundreds of millions of dollars of toys that had been shipped before the company announced its liquidation plans. Industry executives and specialists have warned that many small vendors could go bankrupt themselves due to the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us in the United States.

The retailer, with nearly 1,600 stores when it filed for bankruptcy protection in September, was the largest dedicated showcase for toys ranging from popular classics like Lego to innovative trends by small companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Wall Street's biggest banks report first-quarter earnings in the days ahead, investors should see a welcome resurgence in trading revenue growth thanks to the biggest jump in market volatility since President Donald Trump's election.
Aggregate trading revenue at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) could hit a three-year high and reverse three straight quarters of year-on-year declines, some estimates show. 
Volatility roared into global markets in February after a prolonged calm in 2017, roiling stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, and remained elevated through the end of March. 
In some markets, like bonds, the increase was the largest since the 2016 U.S. election, and in others, like stocks, volatility leapt by the most in 2-1/2 years.
(For a graphic on 'Financial market volatility picks up' click https://reut.rs/2qtVSN1)
Volatility is typically no friend to investors because it is associated with broad price declines, as in the first quarter. But it can be a boon for Wall Street dealers because it begets trading volume and creates opportunity to profit quickly on outsized price swings.
The S&P 500 (SPX) moved 1 percent or more on 23 trading days in the first three months of 2018, three times the number registered in all of 2017. 
Equity market volumes in early February hit their highest levels since August 2015 and the quarter's daily average was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2016.
Trading in bonds, currencies and commodities also boomed. The broad surge in activity could translate into a 5 percent to 6 percent boost to trading revenue at the top five U.S. investment banks, analysts said. 
That would mark the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2017, when trading revenue at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup rose by 15 percent, according to Sandler O' Neill analyst Jeffery Harte in Chicago. 
""Despite the fact that Q1 2017 was a particularly strong quarter for trading on the heels of the U.S. Presidential election, we do think we'll see year-over-year growth in trading revenue,"" said Barclays' bank analyst Jason Goldberg.
Overall profit at the big five is expected to rise around 30 percent, with trading contributing alongside other factors such as the 2017 U.S. corporate tax cut and net interest margin growth.
Still, an improvement will be a welcome change after trading revenue for those banks fell by 20 percent in the fourth quarter, 15 percent in the third quarter and 10 percent in the second quarter, according to Sandler O'Neill's Harte.

Recent volatility may be particularly reassuring to investors in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which derive between 35 percent and 40 percent of their total revenue from trading, according to research from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
Trading makes up 15 percent to 20 percent of revenue at JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup, according to the Credit Suisse data.
Sandler O'Neill's Harte estimates a year-over-year increase of 6 percent for the five banks' total trading revenue to $22.71 billion, up from $14.47 billion in the fourth quarter and $21.33 billion in the first quarter last year. 
Equity trading could jump 11 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier for the five banks, Harte said.
Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup should report fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading revenue that is flat to up 5 percent compared with a 24 percent jump in FICC revenue a year ago, according to Harte. 
Goldman's FICC revenue should jump about 30 percent from the year-ago quarter, when it reported a 2 percent drop in total trading revenue, according to Harte's estimates.
Shares of all but Citigroup have modestly outperformed the wider market so far this year. 
The S&P 500 is down 0.75 percent while Goldman is down 0.6 percent; Morgan Stanley is up 1.3 percent; Bank of America is up 1.8 percent; and JPMorgan is up 4.1 percent. Citigroup is down 5.8 percent.

Citigroup and JPMorgan, due to release their earnings on Friday, will be the first of the five to report.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Every actor dreams of extreme success, but there is also a downside: That you will forever be known as the character you played.
That is the challenge facing Michael Imperioli, who to every fan of famed HBO series “The Sopranos,” is Christopher Moltisanti – a loyal member of Tony Soprano’s mob crew.
But Imperioli is a complex guy, and more than just that one character. He currently stars in a new ABC show “Alex Inc.,” has just released his first novel, “The Perfume Burned His Eyes."" 
For the latest in Reuters’ “Life Lessons” series, Imperioli talked about the wild ride that took him to ""Sopranos"" superstardom.
Q: What were your early jobs like?
A: I did a lot of odd jobs, like moving furniture, hanging lights, being a messenger, doing market research on the phone. Mostly I worked in the restaurant business, everything from busboy to waiter to cook to bartender.
At one point, I got to work as an assistant for Martin Scorsese: He wanted to know about all the films coming out, so I would make clippings and put it all in a big scrapbook for him. I was also in charge of his video library – it was like a little video store, and his friends and colleagues would come and borrow films.
Q: What is the money situation like for budding actors?
A: It is very complicated, because you have little bits of income from a lot of different sources, like residuals. It’s hard to track. One of my early money mistakes was getting fired from the first acting job I ever had. I was cast in a play as the lead, and I got fired three nights after the open. They were probably right, though.
Q: What was it like when success hit?
A: It happened very gradually. I didn’t start making a real living until eight or nine years in. Even after “Goodfellas” came out, I was still working as a waiter, and people would recognize me – that was an odd experience. But when “The Sopranos” hit, that was like an exponential leap.
Q: You eventually started a theater with your wife, so what lessons did you take away from that experience?
A: We built Studio Dante in NYC in 2003, and we were artistic directors together. It was dedicated to new plays, and she actually built and designed the sets and costumes. When the recession hit, though, that really destroyed us. We lost half our funding overnight. When that fell out, it became impossible to continue.
Q: Where do you devote your philanthropic dollars?
A: Charities that are close to our hearts, like the Jazz Foundation, which supports older blues musicians who can’t pay their rent. Also, since my wife and I are Buddhist, causes like the Tibet Fund and the Pureland Project – funding and building schools in remote areas of Tibet, often where kids have never even been to school before.
Q: Did your ""Sopranos"" co-star James Gandolfini pass along life lessons to you, before he passed away?
A: He was our leader on the show, and he was the perfect guy to be in that position. He was very generous, always looked out for his co-workers, and put cast and crew first. He was always deeply concerned about everybody’s welfare. He was a good dude.
Q: You have three kids, so what do you try to teach them?
A: I’m just trying to get them to be good human beings, and to have compassion and kindness and respect for people. In this world there really is a law of cause and effect: You reap what you sow. Then energy you put out really does come back to you.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",Monsanto loses Indian legal battle over GM cotton patents,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A court ruled on Wednesday that  Monsanto  (N:MON) cannot claim patents on its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds in India, the Indian company that brought the case said.
Citing an Indian law that excludes seeds from being patented, Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL) argued that the U.S. seeds company was not eligible to claim patents and charge royalties from Indian seed companies.
On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court agreed with NSL, ruling that India's Patent Act does not allow Monsanto any patent cover for its GM cotton seeds, said Narne Murali Krishna, a company secretary for NSL.
A Monsanto India spokesman said the company was ""very disappointed"" with the court order.
""Today’s order will have wide-ranging, negative implications for biotech-based innovation across many sectors within India, and is inconsistent with other international markets where agricultural innovation has flourished,"" the spokesman said in a statement.
Monsanto’s ""false claim has got exposed today,"" Kalyan Goswami, director general of the National Seed Association of India, said in a statement. 
Late last year, NSL said it would not settle a long-standing intellectual property dispute with Monsanto over genetically modified cotton, despite some other Indian companies doing so.
Monsanto has been involved in a long-running battle in India over royalties paid by local seed companies for its GM cotton.
In 2016, the Indian farm ministry cut Monsanto's royalties by more than 70 percent, triggering a long-running feud that drew in the Indian and U.S. governments.
In March, India cut the royalties paid to Monsanto for its GM cotton for the second time in two years, potentially fuelling another row with the U.S. company that threatened to leave India in 2016.

More than 90 percent of India's cotton crop is genetically modified.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Folger Hill to merge with Schonfeld,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Folger Hill Asset Management, a hedge fund run by former SAC Capital Advisors LP executive Sol Kumin, will merge with Schonfeld Strategic Advisors after a period of sluggish returns.
""It became clear that the best path forward for the Folger Hill team was to combine forces,"" Kumin wrote in a letter to investors dated April 10 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. 
Schonfeld has been a key investor in Folger Hill's Asia fund, and the move will let ""the majority of our staff and investment teams prosper,"" Kumin wrote.
Kumin said he will become chief strategic officer at Leucadia Asset Management, which backed Folger Hill. Leucadia will also make an investment in Schonfeld's fundamental equities fund. Schonfeld has been managing money since 1988 and invests roughly $20 billion.
Kumin's decision to merge his fund into Schonfeld illustrates the pressure on managers as equity markets have boomed for years and investors' patience with high costs and middling returns has worn thin.
""If you charge a lot of fees and promise alpha, you'd better deliver because investors won't give you a lot of time,"" said Greg Dowling, chief investment officer and head of research at Fund Evaluation Group.
Hedge Fund Research data show that more funds closed their doors than opened in 2017.
Folger Hill was started in 2014 after Kumin left billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen's SAC, where he had been chief operating officer. He quickly raised more than $1 billion in assets for the firm, which sought to mimic SAC, where teams of stock pickers vied for a central pool of money to invest and the firm delivered average annual returns of 30 percent.
Performance at Folger Hill, however, never mirrored SAC's legendary returns. While it picked up in 2017 with gains of roughly 2.7 percent in the U.S. and Asia funds, a 17.5 percent loss in 2016 in the U.S. fund still weighed heavily.
By late 2017, Kumin had reunited with Angus Wai, who had run Asia Pacific for SAC, and the budding business in Asia had helped offset some stumbles in the U.S.-focused business where redemptions followed on the heels of the losses.
The Asia fund will continue to operate and all 45 employees will transition to Schonfeld.
The U.S. fund is being liquidated, the letter said, but many U.S.-based employees, who work in offices in Boston and New York, are expected to move to Schonfeld.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 03:38PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Paulson & Co takes stake in Viacom,"By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Paulson & Co, the hedge fund firm led by billionaire investor John Paulson, has taken a stake in Viacom Inc as the U.S. media company has started to turn around its business, Paulson told Reuters in an interview.
Over the past few months, Paulson has bought 3.7 million nonvoting shares of Viacom, which he said on Tuesday has begun to show positive results under a plan overseen by Chief Executive Bob Bakish after years of declining advertising and viewership.
""We are very impressed with the turnaround,"" Paulson said. ""It is starting to look attractive.""
Paulson & Co surged to fame a decade ago when a winning bet against the overheated housing market helped the New York-based firm pull in billions in new money to manage roughly $38 billion at its peak. The firm's assets have since shrunk to around $9 billion. 
Paulson said he began buying shares of Viacom before the company began re-exploring a merger with CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS), whose shares he does not own. 
CBS and Viacom, both of which are controlled by media moguls Shari and Sumner Redstone, began exploring a merger in February. The companies are negotiating the price of a deal, which is expected to be all-stock, and who will run the combined company, sources have told Reuters.
A merger of CBS, which owns its broadcast network and premier channel Showtime, and Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and such networks as Comedy Central and MTV, would give the company scale at a time when many competitors are merging, Paulson said. 
Paulson said he has been impressed with Bakish's focus on deals with online streaming services and mobile deals.
Viacom recently announced a deal with Telefónica SA in Latin America to give its mobile subscribers access to Viacom's networks and shows.
Paulson also noted improvements at Paramount Pictures under its new head, Jim Gianopulos. The studio's horror movie ""The Quiet Place,"" which opened last weekend, was No. 1 at the box office, garnering $50 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. 
Paulson estimated that a combined CBS/Viacom could realize more than $1 billion in synergies, adding that he hoped the two companies can agree on a management structure that includes CBS CEO Leslie Moonves and Bakish.
Despite Bakish's efforts, Viacom's shares are down 12 percent since he took over. The Dow Jones U.S. Media Index is down around 1 percent for the same period.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Emirates [EMIRA.UL] will commit to purchasing options for 16 Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 jets from a previously announced $16 billion order that handed a lifeline to the slow-selling jet, the airline's president said on Wednesday.
The Middle East airline placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos in January, which it has since finalised, with an option for 16 more.
""We will exercise them sooner rather than later,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Hamburg.
The January order secured the future for world's biggest passenger jets for at least another decade, saving it from being scrapped. 
Emirates is the A380s biggest backer, ordering far more than any other customer and making it the flagship of a fleet that has helped transform Dubai into a major international air hub.
The airline is still evaluating which engines it will use to power its new A380s, which are due to be delivered from 2020, Clark said.
The  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX) Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L:RR) on the latest deliveries.
""There's nothing wrong with Rolls-Royce, but having Engine Alliance come back in again could make life interesting,"" he said. 
The airline is short about 100 to 150 pilots, forcing it to reduce the frequency of some routes to Florida in the United States this summer, Clark said. Chinese carriers in particular were offering extremly competitive packages for pilots, he said.
He said the shortage was a short-term situation, adding that Emirates has 170 pilots going through its cadetship programme.
Clark said the past financial year had been better than the previous one in terms of profit. ""The first half was good and we sustained that through the second half so we'll be considerably better than we were last year,"" he said, adding that fuel prices would be a challenge for the current year. 
Emirates is ""looking at all sorts of areas"" to work with Etihad Airways after the signing of a security agreement between the two rivals in January, he added without elaborating.
Emirates is owned by Dubai and Etihad is owned by Abu Dhabi, both of which are part of the United Arab Emirates.

Abu Dhabi and Dubai companies have recently started to collaborate after traditionally operating independently and sometimes in competition.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Bombardier delivered five CSeries in first quarter as delays ease: sources,"By Allison Lampert and Victoria Bryan
MONTREAL/BERLIN (Reuters) - Canadian planemaker Bombardier delivered five CSeries jets in the first quarter and is making progress in tackling delays separate from previously disclosed engine hold-ups in producing its flagship CSeries jets, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The delivery data and comments from executives on progress come as Bombardier nears regulatory approval for its planned sale of the delayed CSeries program to Europe's Airbus.
But the Montreal-based company could still face snags in coming months after delivering 17 CSeries in 2017, down from an initial target of 30 - a delay the plane-and-train maker has previously attributed to delays at engine supplier Pratt & Whitney.
Bombardier has not publicly discussed separate delays stemming from general challenges as workers learn to make the 110-to-130 seat jet more efficiently.
These include ""quality issues"" at French interiors and seat maker Zodiac Aerospace, three sources familiar with the matter said, echoing similar problems affecting other planemakers.
It is not clear when Bombardier experienced these delays, but it delivered four planes in March, up from one during the first two months of the first quarter, one of the sources said. Another said there had been no new Zodiac delays.
All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of commercial sensitivities.
""It is well known across the industry that Zodiac is currently experiencing some production delays,"" Rob Dewar, vice president of Bombardier's CSeries program, told Reuters in a statement.
""We are collaborating closely with their team, and we are making great progress, as reflected in our production rate of four aircraft last month,"" he added.
Zodiac, recently acquired by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, is emerging from a three-year manufacturing crisis that drew criticism from planemakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
""We are very happy with the CSeries that are already flying with Swiss,"" Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Germany's Lufthansa Group, the parent company of CSeries launch customer Swiss International Air Lines. ""What we are not so happy about are the continuing delays to deliveries. The reason is not the engines but other difficulties at Bombardier,"" Spohr told Reuters.
He declined to specify the reasons. 
Bombardier has not changed its target to deliver 40 CSeries in 2018. It is expected to make first-quarter delivery data public in May. Investors closely watch figures on aircraft orders and deliveries to help them accurately estimate revenues since airlines make the bulk of payments when planes are delivered. Investors in Europe are also monitoring Zodiac's recovery as France's Safran prepares to dive into its operations after repeated profit warnings by the seat maker.
Safran, which recently completed its Zodiac purchase, declined to comment on whether Bombardier had suffered delays.
The CSeries is itself at a crossroads as Airbus is poised to take a majority stake in the jetliner program, likely ahead of the aviation industry's flagship Farnborough Airshow in July.

Bombardier executives are counting on Airbus to cut CSeries supply chain costs and boost production volumes through higher sales by using its procurement and marketing muscle.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 11:29AM ET</span>","Traders gamed financial system to rip off others, London court told","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - Five traders from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) gamed the financial system to rip off counterparties in a four- year plot to rig benchmark interest rates, prosecutors alleged on Wednesday.
James Waddington, a lawyer for the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), told London's Southwark Crown Court that the defendants fixed the odds ""in a zero sum game"" as he opened the prosecution case in a trial expected to last until the end of July.
The highest profile figure among those charged in the case -- former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar -- pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud last month.
Waddington told the jury they now had to decide whether the remaining five defendants, one of whom is being tried in absentia, were part of the same conspiracy.
""They were involved in effectively gaming the financial system to rip off a lot of people they did business with,"" he told the court.
It is the fifth SFO prosecution of traders on conspiracy to defraud charges relating to benchmark rate manipulation in a six-year investigation. 
Some of the world's most powerful financial institutions have paid around $9 billion to settle allegations of rate rigging. Deutsche Bank paid $2.5 billion in 2015 while Barclays paid $453 million in 2012.
Former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef, who was absent, Briton Colin Bermingham, Sisse Bohart, a Dane, Anglo Italian Carlo Palombo and Deutsche Bank's Achim Kraemer, a German, each deny a charge of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating the Brussels-based Euribor between 2005 and 2009.
The group, aged between 39 and 61, is the first to be charged in relation to Euribor, the Euro counterpart of the London interbank borrowing rate (Libor) - a crucial benchmark for around $450 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide.
The jury was told that Moryoussef, a French former trader, is now living in France and has no intention of returning to Britain to take part in his trial. He has also waived his right to be legally represented.
His absence, however, did not mean he was guilty and did not add any support to the prosecution case, the jury was told.
Waddington said that the prosecution case revolved partly around the behaviour of Bittar and Moryoussef, who were ""old friends"" and said evidence would include telephone recordings and messages in which they and others discussed their plans and congratulated themselves on their success.
The traders were all successful, and all driven by the desire to make even more money by trying to nudge rates to levels that would increase profits or reduce losses, Waddington said, although Bittar stood out as the highest earner.

Bittar, a Frenchman who worked at the German bank's offices in London, saw his annual 130,000 pound base salary pushed up to a commission-based package of between three and 47 million pounds. He earned so much that Deutsche Bank struck a deal with him to reduce his package, Waddington said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday as possible U.S. military action against Syria stoked investor concerns about geopolitical risk to the American economy and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee sparked worries about a more hawkish view on interest-rate increases.
The decline followed two days of gains, driven by easing concerns about trade tensions between the United States and China.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria, declaring missiles ""will be coming.""
The rising tensions sent oil prices surging, boosting energy stocks (SPNY) 1 percent. But the risk-off sentiment weighed on Treasury yields (US10YT=RR), pushing financial stocks (SPSY) down 1.3 percent.
""There's general nervousness about what might happen with any strikes and the potential escalation of tensions with Russia,"" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Boston.
The major Wall Street indexes edged even lower after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee showed concern among a few of its members that rising inflation might require a faster pace of interest rate hikes than anticipated.
Members of the Federal Reserve voted unanimously to raise borrowing costs by a quarter percentage point and expressed confidence that the economy would strengthen and inflation would rise in coming months.
""The minutes were modestly negative,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""People had been speculating that due to all the turbulence in the market because of geopolitical uncertainties that the Fed might consider pausing or slowing down the interest rate increases.""

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 10:52AM ET</span>",Bayer to sell digital farming business to clear way for Monsanto deal,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn) plans to sell its digital farming business to BASF (DE:BASFn) as part of changes to concessions it has offered to win over antitrust regulators for its proposed takeover of  Monsanto  (N:MON).
Bayer, which had previously only agreed to grant a license to competitors, said on Wednesday that as part of the changes agreed with the European Commission it would retain a license to certain digital farming applications. 
Digital farming, which combines sensors, software and precision machines, is still in its infancy but all the large players in the seeds and pesticides industry are developing digital offerings.
The changes stem from an agreement in principle with the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ) over an antitrust approval, with only a few remaining details to be hammered out, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Wall Street Journal reported late on Monday that an outline deal with the DoJ had been reached.
Bayer, which has already secured conditional European approval, declined to comment on Wednesday which regulator had prompted it to make the changes.
It added that BASF was the intended purchaser of all the assets it was selling.
In a separate statement, the European Commission said it had approved Bayer' modifications to the commitments it made to get approval for the Monsanto purchase. 
The competition watchdog said it was still assessing whether BASF was a suitable buyer for the units under an April 30 deadline.
The head of Bayer's Crop Science unit, Liam Condon, told Reuters in September that Bayer's approach in digital farming had been to control plant pests while Monsanto's focus in digital farming was on improving yields.
The changes to the antitrust remedies were made ""in response to corresponding indications from regulators"", Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday.
In addition, certain Bayer seed treatment products will be offered for sale instead of Monsanto's NemaStrike seed treatment brand.
The changes do not affect Monsanto's digital farming offering, which Bayer will keep after the deal.
Bayer reiterated on Wednesday that it would seek to wrap up the deal in the second quarter.

The German company has already pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to BASF, as well as its vegetable seeds business.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) and the China Banking Association (CBA) have joined forces to challenge proposed European Union regulations aimed at policing possible market risk posed by foreign lenders doing business in the bloc.
In a letter to the European Commission seen by Reuters, the JBA and CBA - which represent hundreds of lenders from both Asian economic powerhouses - said a draft proposal to compel foreign banks to bring EU operations under a single holding company threatened the commercial viability of their activities in the region.
The trade bodies, whose members include Japan's largest lender MUFG Bank (T:8306) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (SS:601398), said that the so-called intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) could trigger ""multi million one-off reorganisation costs"" and significant ongoing charges. 
""...the IPU requirement potentially makes our business model in the EU unsustainable, and could affect our fundamental capabilities to provide financial services to EU clients,"" the letter said.
""In short, the IPU proposal makes the EU a less attractive place for us to deploy our capital and do business.""
News of the challenge is the latest headache for the EU as it seeks to step up vigilance of non-European lenders operating within the bloc, as part of efforts to safeguard the region's economy from another banking crisis.
In February, Reuters reported that Bulgaria, which currently holds the EU presidency, had called for a softening of the proposed rules, saying that the requirement to set up a single holding company should only kick in when a foreign bank has total assets of at least 40 billion euros in the EU.
The initial 2016 proposal established a 30 billion euro ($37.1 billion) threshold and the automatic inclusion of globally systemic banks, which would force 19 large foreign lenders to adapt to the stricter rules.
Besides offering greater insight into the activities of large foreign lenders on European soil, the requirement to set up a single holding company will also align Europe's regulatory treatment of foreign lenders with that of the United States, which already requires non-U.S. banks to form holding companies.
But while some of its members did have globally systemic bank status, the CBA and JBA argued that none had ""significant systemic relevance"" to the future security of the EU financial system, and should be subject to a threshold of 50 billion euros instead.
""We suggest the IPU proposal to be amended to apply the requirement in a proportionate manner, i.e. applied only to banks that ...could pose a material threat to the EU in a crisis situation.""
The trade bodies also urged the European Commission to exclude UK assets from the threshold calculation, citing the UK's planned exit from the EU from March 2019.
The Commission was not immediately available for comment.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 09:16AM ET</span>",How Russian tycoon Deripaska might try to navigate sanctions,"By Polina Devitt, Anastasia Lyrchikova and Oksana Kobzeva
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Businesses controlled by Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska are scrambling to find ways to keep trading after they were added to a U.S. sanctions blacklist.
The sanctions - imposed by Washington in response to what it called ""malign activities"" by Russia - will in effect choke off access for Deripaska's businesses to the international financial system, forcing them to make major re-adjustments.
Among individuals and entities named on Friday's sanctions list was Deripaska and a number of his companies, including Rusal and En+ Group, which manages his assets and owns his 48 percent stake in Rusal.
The biggest asset in Deripaska's portfolio is Rusal, one of the world's biggest aluminum producers. It will likely feel the impact of the sanctions in two main areas: its sales on world markets, and its borrowing.
Rusal and En+ declined to comment. Rusal has said that the sanctions may result in technical defaults in relation to some of its credit obligations but it intends to continue to fulfill its existing commitments in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.
Here is a look at what is at stake and what some of the options Deripaska has to mitigate the sanctions impact.
SALES
What's at stake? 
Rusal is the world's second-largest aluminum producer after China's Hongqiao, accounting for 5.8 percent of world production of the metal last year, according to the Russian company. 
The United States was Rusal's third biggest foreign customer last year by revenues, bringing in $1.4 billion, the company's financial report showed.
Large scale end-customers of Rusal include  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), Alcoa's Samara Metallurgical Plant in Russia, Toyota, Mechem SA and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Alcan, the company said in a bond prospectus earlier this year.
What effect are the sanctions having?
While some customers have said they are looking at what steps to take, it is too early to determine what the full impact of sanctions will be.
The sanctions on dealing in goods with Rusal do not come fully into force until just after midnight eastern daylight time on June 5. https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_gl12.pdf
Once they do take effect, U.S. customers will be prohibited from buying aluminum from Rusal because the sanctions prohibit U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with a sanctioned entity.
Non-U.S. customers could also have difficulties buying the aluminum. Their lawyers may advise them they risk being targeted for so-called ""secondary sanctions"" for helping a sanctioned entity.
Also, the transaction is likely to be in dollars, which means passing through correspondent accounts in the United States, and U.S. banks could refuse to handle the transaction because the beneficiary is under sanctions.
Swiss-based mining company Glencore, which is both a customer of and a stake owner in Rusal, has said it is committed to complying with sanctions and is taking steps ""to mitigate any risks"" to its business. It added that includes the risks from secondary sanctions, which could be imposed on firms if they are deemed to be facilitating Rusal's business.
""Glencore is still evaluating the position under its contracts with Rusal, but notes that these contracts are not financially material to Glencore,"" it said in a statement.
What might Deripaska do?
Rusal will likely divert a greater proportion of its sales to Asia, according to traders and metals market analysts. 
""Supplies will be re-directed to other markets,"" said Maxim Khudalov, an analyst with Russian ratings agency AKRA. ""The re-focusing will be mostly to Asia and China.""
Rusal has already planned for such a scenario. When the U.S. government earlier this year raised the prospect of tariffs on some metal imports, En+ told investors Rusal had other options. In light of a ""global aluminum market deficit,"" Rusal ""would be able to redirect volumes to other regions as may be required,"" En+ said in a March presentation.
However, sending cargos to Asia would likely mean that Rusal's margins are squeezed, according to analysts.
Rusal has activated a contingency plan asking customers to pay in euros instead of dollars to try to skirt U.S. sanctions, a source close to the matter said.
The plan follows the example of Iran, which a few years ago opted to use gold, oil and the Japanese yen to pay for goods that would typically be priced in dollars.
Another route Rusal might take is to try to enlist the Russian state as a customer. Rusal has in the past proposed the creation of a state stockpile of aluminum, which would buy the output Rusal cannot sell to the market. 
Its proposal was that it would sell 1 million tonnes of aluminum to the state, stockpile the metal at its warehouses and buy it back in seven years. 
But the idea was opposed by deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich who said back in 2014 that the country's budget did not have the money. Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank, or VEB, said at the time it was considering participating in the proposed project.
The government has not replied to Reuters request for comment. Rusal declined to comment on how it might mitigate impact on sales and potential help from the government.
DEBT
What's at stake?
At the end of 2017, Rusal's net debt was $7.6 billion and total debt was $8.5 billion. Almost all of it was U.S. dollar-denominated borrowing. Russian top state lender Sberbank and VTB, another Russian state bank, are the biggest lenders.
Rusal has three outstanding Eurobond issues, TOTALING $1.6 billion, with the first maturing in February 2022.
Rusal also has two yuan-denominated issues outstanding, worth 1.5 billion yuan ($238 million). The first of these matures in March 2020.
Rusal needs to repay $600 million annually in its debt in the 2018-2020 period.
What effect are the sanctions having?
Rusal's bonds are being cut off from the infra-structure that makes bond markets function -- the indices that list the prices, the ""clearing"" services that handle payments. That is because the companies that provide those services do not want to expose themselves to sanctions risk by association with Rusal.
MarketAxess, one of the world's biggest multi-dealer trading systems, said it had removed Rusal debt from its platform. Investment bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) has suspended Rusal ratings and estimates because of the sanctions, according to a research note sent on Friday.
Much of the sanctions risk stems from the fact that the bonds are dollar-denominated, which makes related transactions difficult because the sanctions effectively cut off the company's access to the U.S. banking system and correspondent banks and creditors.
The issue will come to a head on May 3, when the next Eurobond coupon payment by Rusal is due. Rusal is unlikely to be able to make the payment, which is in dollars, because American banks would be expected to block that payment, investors and analysts said.
Raising new debt via Eurobond issues will also be de facto impossible for Rusal and the other sanctioned companies in Deripaska's empire as long as the sanctions are in place.
What might Deripaska do?
One option is for the Rusal bonds to be paid off ahead of schedule, according to two Russian financial market sources. 
Rusal itself cannot do that because the bond-holder that takes the money would themselves come under sanctions risk. But a third party could do it, possibly a Russian state bank, said one of the sources, who did not want to be identified.
It might work for the bond repayment, but the appetite from the Russian banks to help Rusal with other operations, including potential debt refinancing, would be limited by risks of sanctions toughening against creditors. 
To reduce the cost of the operation, the redemption could be limited to foreign bond-holders, while domestic holders of the debt will have their bonds converted into domestic paper, the source said.
The Kremlin has already said it will help the sanctioned tycoons and analysts said it could prevail on a state bank to step in.
Russian banks have accumulated a large reservoir of foreign currency that they could use for the operation. In November last year, the central bank said the big Russian banks between them had $39.7 billion in available foreign currency.

VTB and Sberbank did not respond to Reuters questions about how much forex liquidity they hold.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>",EU plans more powers for consumers to sue companies,"By Alissa de Carbonnel
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union plans more powers for consumers to sue firms such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) after the Dieselgate scandal showed the limits of consumer protection authorities to curb corporate cheating.
Wednesday's proposal by the EU executive would allow some groups to launch collective action and consumer protection authorities higher sanctions for rule breakers.
Amid frustration in Brussels with rule-flouting by the powerful tech and auto industries, fines will increase to up to four percent of annual turnover for companies deemed to have trampled on the rights of a large group of consumers.
""Consumer authorities will finally get teeth to punish the cheaters,"" Europe's Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said. ""It cannot be cheap to cheat.""
Along with a separate plan to improve transparency over how science shapes policy, officials couched the moves as the EU becoming more responsive to citizens' worries such as the potential cancer risk of products such as glyphosate, used in Monsanto's Roundup. 
EU regulators say that, after VW was caught using software to cheat emissions test by U.S. authorities, they lacked the tools to ensure EU car owners received the same kind of compensation offered to U.S. clients.
Jourova said only two national consumer protection authorities imposed fines on VW, amounting to 5.5 million euros. ""This is nothing in comparison to what Volkswagen paid in the United States,"" she said. 
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said the move was long overdue but cautioned that judges and national authorities would still hold sway over what may be a laboriously lengthy process.
Business groups said the plan, which still need approval from national governments and the European Parliament, could lead to a proliferation of lawsuits, saying EU citizens already enjoy some of the world's strongest consumer protection rules.
Defending the draft rules, Jourova said they would not allow U.S.-style, profit-seeking class action suits. Law firms would not be allowed to sue firms - only citizens' rights groups - a legal recourse only now available in a handful of member states.
'NEW DEAL FOR CONSUMERS'
In a bid to deliver Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's promise of a ""new deal for consumers"", the plan also tackles concerns online rights and food brands being sold with inferior ingredients in different parts of Europe.
Adding pressure on firms like Facebook (O:FB) and Google's Gmail (O:GOOGL), it would extend EU consumer law to ""free"" digital services for which consumers provide personal data, such as cloud storage services, social media and email accounts.
Consumers would also get more information on contracts and the right to cancel them within 14 days.

In a separate plan, the Commission wants to make more of the evidence used to decide policy on food safety publicly availably and allow the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to conduct its own studies.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 07:49PM ET</span>","Facebook's Zuckerberg unscathed by congressional grilling, stock rises","By Dustin Volz and David Ingram
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from nearly 100 U.S. lawmakers and emerged largely unscathed and considerably richer. 
He parried questions of how much control people have over their data on the world's largest social media network without a major gaffe, while avoiding being cornered into supporting new government regulation. 
The hearings that ended on Wednesday revealed no consensus among U.S. lawmakers about what kind of privacy legislation they might want to pursue, if any, and no timeline for action. As he did on Tuesday before a Senate hearing, Zuckerberg refused during a House of Representatives committee hearing to make any promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business.
""It is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation"" of internet firms, Zuckerberg said, but he avoided any specifics.
(Full text of Zuckerberg's prepared testimony: https:// 
Although Zuckerberg, 33, had never testified at a congressional hearing before, he succeeded in deflecting questions like a Washington veteran. Forty times the internet mogul told lawmakers he had no answers at hand and would get back to them later. About one in three lawmakers got that response over the two days.
Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell expressed frustration with Zuckerberg's frequent promises to get back to lawmakers later in writing. ""Some things are striking during this conversation,"" she said. ""As CEO, you didn't know some key facts."" 
On one point, Zuckerberg undercut his consistent message that Facebook users have control of their data. He said he was among the nearly 87 million people whose personal information was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. He gave no further details.
His admission that even the company's tech-savvy founder was unable to protect his own data underscored the problem Facebook has in persuading skeptical lawmakers that users can easily safeguard their own information and that further legislation governing Facebook is unnecessary. 
The Cambridge Analytica issue was the reason Zuckerberg was on Capitol Hill, answering questions about how that company - which has counted U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign among its clients - got hold of data about Facebook users.
""How can consumers have control over their data when Facebook does not have control over the data?"" asked Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, at the beginning of Wednesday's hearing.
Zuckerberg said it would take ""many months"" to complete an audit of other apps that might also have improperly gathered or shared users' data.
""I do imagine that we will find some apps that were either doing something suspicious or misusing people's data,"" he said.
INEVITABLE REGULATION? 
Zuckerberg was unable to answer Dingell, the Michigan congresswoman, when she asked how frequently Facebook used computer code embedded in websites to gather dossiers on virtually everyone online.
In a series of questions on how people can remove data from Facebook, Zuckerberg said the company does ""collect data on people who are not signed up for Facebook, for security purposes."" He had no response when asked how a non-Facebook member could remove information without signing up for the service.
He also said he was not familiar with what various media reports call ""shadow profiles,"" collections of data assembled on Facebook users that they have no knowledge of or control over. 
Wearing a dark suit and tie and politely prefacing almost every remark with ""Congressman"" or ""Congresswoman,"" Zuckerberg appeared even more controlled than he did on Tuesday when he testified before senators. He refrained from cracking jokes and flashed few smiles.
The performance had favorable results. Facebook shares closed up 0.78 percent on Wednesday after rising 4.5 percent Tuesday. Over the two days, the value of Zuckerberg's stake in the company grew about $3 billion.
(GRAPHIC: Facebook share-price status: It's complicated - https://reut.rs/2qpcbcX)
Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden, told reporters he would talk with committee members about holding similar hearings with other technology chief executives. He did not name specific companies.
""This is a wake-up call to Silicon Valley and the tech community that if you let these things get out of hand, having grown up in a very lightly regulated environment, you could end up with a lot more regulation than you seek,"" he said after the hearing.
Many Democrats disagreed, saying their Republican colleagues held no genuine interest in having a meaningful debate that could lead to a regulatory overhaul of how technology firms handle data.
What remained as the dust settled on Wednesday was an inability to translate bipartisan concern into regulation due to the complexity of regulating technology issues and the powerful lobbying forces assembled against any effort to do so. 

""If you think it is hard to pass a bill that affects a lobbyist's favorite client,"" said Alvaro Bedoya, a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken, ""try passing a bill that affects all of them.""

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Airbus CEO warns Britain over Brexit uncertainty,"LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) wants Britain to provide more clarity over the country's future relationship with the European Union, or risk losing investment, the European planemaker's CEO said.
""We must have more clarity on the UK's long-term relationships, not just for the next 20 months,"" CEO Tom Enders said in an opinion piece in the Financial Times on Wednesday. 
""Britain must recognize that future investments are not a given.""
His comments come less than a month after Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a transition deal with European leaders to keep existing trade ties unchanged for 21 months after Brexit, a move seen by politicians as a way of providing businesses with certainty. 
But Enders said Britain needed to go further. He called for Britain to remain part of the EU aviation safety certification agency, EASA, to allow Airbus's planes to gain the necessary approvals to let them fly, and said that its business depended on aircraft parts and people being able to move freely between its sites across the UK and Europe.
Airbus employs 15,000 in Britain where it makes all the wings for its commercial aircraft. 
Enders also said that there needed to be an agreement covering security, defense and space programs between Britain and the EU, calling for deals to ""cement this co-operation"". 
""It is no good making the right noises. We need a plan that comes from the UK but is also accepted by the EU27,"" Enders said. ""Within these negotiations, the EU will need to offer some flexibility but the UK must also be realistic in its demands; pragmatism must trump pride."" 
The transition deal, secured by May in March, pushed back the risk of disruption for companies until the end of 2020. But London and Brussels must first agree on their long-term trade ties for the period after 2020 for the transition agreement to become effective.
Airbus, which has its headquarters in France, has 25 sites in Britain and spends more than 5 billion pounds ($7.10 billion) with suppliers in the country. It said that its activities in Britain support 117,000 jobs.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell slightly on Wednesday in a broad-based pullback as escalating tensions in Syria added to market worries, although solid results from  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and strength among telecoms stocks helped limit losses.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index fell 0.3 percent by 0815 GMT. This follows gains on Tuesday when the mood was buoyed by a speech from Chinese President Xi Jinping which soothed worries over a possible trade war with the United States.
Russia and the U.S tangled on Tuesday at the United Nations over the use of chemical weapons in Syria as Washington and its allies considered whether to strike at President Bashar al-Assad's forces over a suspected poison gas attack last weekend.
""Market sentiment has turned sour again... as investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility of a military response by the United States to the suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma (Syria) last weekend,"" said UniCredit in a note.
Europe's air traffic control agency warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours.
In spite of the growing geopolitical worries investors found comfort in some good earning updates and merger and acquisition activity.
Tesco was the top STOXX gainer after the British supermarket beat guidance with a 28 percent rise in full-year profit, helped by a strong end to the year in its home market, underlining the recovery under CEO Dave Lewis.
Its shares rose 5.2 percent.
Jefferies affirmed its buy rating on the stock, highlighting Tesco's strong outlook. The company, which competes with Sainsbury's, Walmart's Asda and Morrisons, said it was firmly on track to deliver its medium-term targets. 
""The visibility of strong earnings delivery appears well supported by an improving UK backdrop and Booker synergies,"" Jefferies said. 
Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) rose 4.1 percent after reports that Sprint (N:S) had restarted talks to merge with the German group's U.S. unit T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS).
""Clearly positive trigger for battered Deutsche Telekom shares. A chance to strike a deal revives the fantasy for huge synergies,"" a Frankfurt-based trader said.
Its gains lifted the telecoms index (SXKP) up 0.9 percent, making it the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe. 
A solid update lifted Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut (S:BARN) by 1 percent, while CHR Hansen (CO:CHRH) fell 5 percent after it missed second-quarter profit forecasts. 

Overall, STOXX 600 earnings are expected to rise 3.4 percent in the first quarter on sales up 1.1 percent with growth mainly driven by energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters data. First-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 in the U.S. are seen up 18.5 percent.

One of the sources said that Blessing will be replaced by Gunnar Kilian, a general secretary at VW's works council who worked directly under labor boss Bernd Osterloh. German magazine Der Spiegel was first to report that Kilian could replace Blessing who joined VW in January 2016.

Blessing's removal will be part of a broader reshuffle that could affect other senior executives, the source said.

The industrial action by Air France pilots, cabin crew and ground staff has so far cost the airline 170 million euros ($210 million) and contributed to travel disruption in the country at a time rail workers are also protesting against planned reforms.
A pilots union official said talks were slated for Thursday and that a notice for future strikes could be withdrawn if a suitable pay offer was forthcoming.
Air France raised its 2018 pay offer to the unions late on Tuesday to 2 percent - double its previous offer but still well below unions' demands for a 6 percent increase.
Air France said it expected to run 70 percent of its scheduled flights on Wednesday, the seventh day company staff have walked out.
The head of the overall Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) group had earlier denounced the unions' demands for a 6 percent pay increase as unrealistic.
""The offer made by the management of Air France is both strong and reasonable,"" Air France KLM's chairman and chief executive Jean-Marc Janaillac told Europe 1 radio on Wednesday.
""It would be irresponsible if the trade unions did not enter into talks, now that the management has held out its hand to them,"" said Janaillac, who also reiterated that the unions' demands for a 6 percent rise were ""unrealistic.""

The major Middle East airline is pursuing a company-wide review and has cut several other routes already as it seeks to restore profitability.
Etihad is stopping flights to Edinburgh and Perth, Australia, as part ""of several adjustments that we are making to our network in 2018 in order to improve system profitability"", said an Etihad spokesman in a statement on Wednesday.
State-owned Etihad launched the strategy review in 2016, the financial year when it suffered a $1.87 billion loss that it largely blamed on aircraft impairments and investments in troubled European airlines.
Few details about the review have been made public.
The Gulf airline continues to fly to London, Heathrow and Manchester in the United Kingdom, and Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne in Australia.
The airline, along with Emirates and Qatar Airways which make up the three major Middle East airlines, has relied on building a diverse, global network to carry millions of passengers a year.
Most of their passengers do not start or end their journey at their respective hubs in the Gulf.
Britain's top defense buyer Tony Douglas joined Etihad as its new group chief executive this year, replacing long-serving CEO James Hogan, who departed in 2017.

Broadcaster SBS has reported that a prosecution investigation into the corruption scandal that led to the downfall of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye had uncovered e-mails linking the tech giant to efforts to secure votes for Pyeongchang's third bid to host the Games.
SBS said it had obtained copies of e-mails between Samsung officials and Papa Massata Diack, who has been accused by France's financial prosecutor of being part of a corruption racket involved in determining the Olympic host cities.
Diack is the son of the former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Lamine Diack, who is under investigation for alleged corruption in France.
Samsung sponsored the IAAF's Diamond League circuit between 2010 and 2012. 
As a member of the IOC's TOP sponsorship program, Samsung is not allowed to lobby for a candidate host city. 
In a statement posted on its internal newsroom website on Tuesday, Samsung denied it had lobbied illegally for Pyeongchang and said there was nothing wrong with its financial backing of the IAAF.
""The company has reviewed everything and found that, just like all the other general sponsorship contracts, its sponsorship with the federation was legal,"" it said. 
In 2009, former Korean President Lee Myung-bak pardoned then-Samsung chief and International Olympic Committee member Lee Kun-hee after he had been convicted of tax evasion and handed a three-year suspended jail sentence a year earlier.
Samsung's Lee was instrumental in bringing the Games to Pyeongchang, which easily beat out Munich and France's Annecy in the first round of voting at the IOC session in Durban in 2011. 

Pyeongchang hosted the Winter Games in February.

1500,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Redstone weighs CBS-Viacom merger with or without Moonves,"By Jessica Toonkel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As she seeks to combine CBS Corp (N:CBS) and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) into a single company, media mogul Shari Redstone risks losing her most talented executive, whose leadership could be critical to ensuring the proposed merger succeeds.
Such is the difficulty facing Redstone. Her longtime friend and business ally, powerful CBS Chief Executive Les Moonves, has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to a potential CBS-Viacom tie-up, according to people familiar with the matter. Concerns are that his objections could either doom the transaction or that he might not lead the new entity, the people said. 
Moonves is chafing at Redstone's insistence on installing Viacom's CEO as his second-in-command and likely successor of a merged company, the people say. CBS and Viacom announced in February that they were exploring a potential deal and in recent weeks have begun negotiations.
At stake is the future of Redstone's media empire, which is facing pressure to scale up at a time when competitors are gobbling rivals to stay relevant. Her family's company, National Amusements Inc, controls both CBS and Viacom. Redstone favors merging the two to gain size and leverage in negotiating better programming prices from traditional cable and satellite customers, and to better compete with emerging players such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the people said.
But she may have to decide if she is willing to do it without her top captain to steer the ship. 
Redstone wants Moonves to run the combined company, according to the people familiar with the situation, all of whom wished to remain anonymous because discussions are confidential. But she is contemplating moving forward without him at the helm if no agreement can be reached to keep him aboard, said one of the people close to the situation. 
With over 25 years at CBS and more than a decade as CEO, Moonves has proven adept at navigating a difficult media landscape. Under his leadership, CBS has been a top performer in its sector with some of the most popular shows on television. CBS stock is up over 116 percent on his watch. At 68, Moonves is an industry legend and still at the top of his game.
Still, Redstone is concerned about succession planning, the people said. She wants 54-year-old Bob Bakish, whom she chose two years ago to lead a turnaround at Viacom, to be president and chief operating officer of the combined company; Bakish would report to Moonves, with the expectation of succeeding him, the people said.
""Shari values Les, but we are now in a world of: 'What happens after Les?'"" said one of the people close to the situation. 
Redstone, Moonves and Bakish declined to comment through representatives. Viacom declined to comment. 
""The industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves' record and we think it speaks for itself,"" CBS said in a statement.
Moonves, meanwhile, wants his longtime lieutenant, CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello, to take the No. 2 spot at the combined company, according to people familiar with his thinking. 
The men have forged a successful working relationship that could prove key to melding two very different entities. Moonves and Viacom's Bakish, in contrast, have met just a handful of times, according to people familiar with the situation.
""Les is saying 'I want to make this successful ... but let me have my team,'"" one of the people said.
OLD HAND, NEW BLOOD
Despite recent tensions, Redstone has long been close to Moonves, who was selected by her father, Sumner Redstone, to be CEO of CBS when it was spun off from Viacom in 2006.
She and Moonves have gone to football games and movie premiers together. And she has said that Moonves was one of her staunchest supporters amid highly public legal battles, including a feud with Viacom's former CEO, Philippe Dauman, and clashes with former girlfriends of her elderly father seeking a share of his riches.
""I have a great relationship with Les,"" Redstone, 63, told a Recode conference last year.
Redstone has also taken a shine to Bakish since plucking him from Viacom's international division in 2016 and installing him as the firm's chief executive. As CEO, Bakish engineered a turnaround plan for the company's struggling movie studio and TV networks and boosted badly sagging staff morale, keeping Redstone in the loop through it all, people familiar with the situation said. 
That is a big change considering that Redstone for years was unwelcome at Viacom under former CEO Dauman, the people said. A bid by the Redstones to reassert control culminated in Dauman's departure in 2016. 
The media heiress is now a familiar face in the hallways of Viacom's New York offices. She has attended employee town halls and company events, including the relaunch of the MTV show ""Total Request Live.""
Bakish and Redstone talk at least weekly, and he includes her in all major decisions, according to people familiar with the situation. 
""He brought her in and solicits her thoughts, and in some ways that was the way to her heart,"" said one person close to Redstone and Viacom.
Redstone believes Bakish should succeed Moonves because he has executed on his turnaround plan and has a vision for the combined company that he is excited about, the people familiar with the situation said. 
NOT A DONE DEAL
There are other issues that could scuttle the merger. 
The special board committees that CBS and Viacom have formed to negotiate a deal currently disagree about how many CBS shares Viacom shareholders should receive. 
CBS has offered 0.55 of its shares for every Viacom Class B share, according to the sources. Viacom countered last week that it wanted 0.68 CBS shares for every Viacom Class B share, the sources said.
What is clear is that Moonves is seen as a major asset to the combined company. Many analysts expect CBS' stock to take a hit if he is not part of any new leadership team.
If the current standoff continues, Redstone may have to decide whether losing Moonves is worth going to the mat for Bakish, the up-and-comer.

""They are both stars,"" Redstone said of CBS and Viacom at the Recode conference last year. ""And I love them both.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Loomis Sayles vice chairman Dan Fuss says the 10-year Treasury yield could go ""north of 4 percent"" within two years, but geopolitical risks and economic deterioration could keep yields lower.
Fuss, known as Wall Street's Warren Buffett of Bonds, said on Tuesday at Loomis Sayles' annual media luncheon ""the pattern of (Treasury) yields"" drifting higher should stay intact if there are no major geopolitical and domestic disruptions. ""These are huge 'ifs',"" said Fuss, who helps manage more than $268 billion.

Overnight, The Dow advanced 1.8%, the S&P 500 rose 1.7% and the Nasdaq added 2.1%. Xi’s speech on Tuesday at the Boao forum continued to be cited as tailwind for equities as it helped ease fears over a trade war between China and the U.S.
Xi promised on Tuesday to further open up its economy and cut import tariffs. In response, U.S. president Trump praised his speech and said he looked forward to making “great progress” with China.
“Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers,” Trump said on Twitter. “Also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!”
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was in focus as its stocks gained 4.5% after CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions from U.S. senators on how the company might be regulated more closely.
""I’ll have my team follow up with you so that way we can have this discussion across the different categories where I think this discussion needs to happen,"" said Zuckerberg on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, The U.S. dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was unchanged at 89.32 as an uptick in risk appetite weakened demand for the Japanese yen.

WASHINGTON/YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar civil society groups welcomed a commitment by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to tackle hate speech within 24 hours as the social media giant fights messages inciting violence, but urged it to deploy more resources in the country. 
Zuckerberg said on Tuesday his company would step up efforts to block hate messages in Myanmar as he faced questioning by the U.S. Congress about electoral interference and hate speech on the platform.
Facebook has been accused by human rights advocates of not doing enough to weed out hate messages on its social-media network in Myanmar, where it has become a near-ubiquitous communications tool following the opening up of the economy.
In an email, the representatives of several civil society groups in Myanmar hailed the 24-hour timeline as ""historic"", but said Facebook had failed to set up an effective mechanism in the country for swifter detection and removal of threatening posts.
""This is a historic commitment from Facebook to a 24-hour review time, and one we have been begging for,"" Yangon-based social media analyst Victoire Rio said on Wednesday. 
""It is still unclear how they intend to demonstrate that they are meeting these targets...We will continue to monitor them,"" said Rio, who was involved in an email exchange between Zuckerberg and civil society groups in Myanmar regarding Facebook's effectiveness in detecting and curbing hate speech.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state and crossed into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown last August, the United Nations and aid agencies have said.
The United Nations and the United States described the situation as ethnic cleansing, an accusation Myanmar denies. 
""What's happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more,"" Zuckerberg said during a 5-hour joint hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.
United Nations officials investigating a possible genocide in Myanmar said last month that Facebook had been a source of anti-Rohingya propaganda.
Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, said in March that social media had played a ""determining role"" in Myanmar.
""It has ... substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict ... within the public,"" he said. 
Zuckerberg said Facebook was hiring dozens more Burmese-language speakers to remove threatening content.
""It's hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically,"" he said, adding that Facebook was also asking civil society groups to help identify figures the network needed to ban.
He said a Facebook team would make undisclosed product changes in Myanmar and other countries battling ethnic violence.
But Jes Petersen, chief executive of Yangon-based Phandeeyar, which helped Facebook translate its Burmese-language community standards, said Zuckerberg's commitment would be too little for a country with nearly 30 million users. 

""It is not even close. It will be interesting to see how Facebook meet their 24-hour commitment here - but a mammoth expansion of Burmese-speaking staff is going to be needed.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets remained fragile on Wednesday as heightened tensions over Syria and U.S. sanctions drove Russia's rouble to a two-year low and nagging worries about a U.S.-China trade war boosted traditional safety plays at the expense of the dollar.
Many of Europe and Asia's stock markets were back in the red after two days of gains, gold  was up for a fourth session, though it was the hammering of Russia's and also Turkey's currencies that drew most attention.
The rouble slumped as much as 2.3 percent against the dollar  and almost as much versus the euro, while Turkey's lira  tumbled to a record low to cement its record as one of the world's worst performers this year. [RU/RUB][.IS] 
The fallout from biting new U.S. sanctions on Moscow continued to rattle investors and fears of military action were stoked again after one of Russia's ambassadors reiterated it would shoot down any U.S. missiles fired at Syria.
Pan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol had warned airlines on Tuesday to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours.
""We are more neutral today (in terms of risk asset allocation) than we have been at any time over the last two years,"" NN Investments Chief Investment Officier Valentijn van Niewenhuijzen said.
""For now we are mainly focusing on lowering exposure in Russia and having a more cautious stance from a tactical perspective overall on asset allocation.""
The dollar languished near two-week lows as the trade war worries and domestic scandals swirling around U.S. President Donald Trump lingered.
Markets were also awaiting U.S. inflation data due later that will feed the debate on when the Federal Reserve next raises U.S. interest rates.
The dollar index versus a basket of six major peers was down 0.1 percent at 89.472 <.DOXY> and within sight of a low of 89.251 set on March 28. Government bonds meanwhile made gains, with European and U.S. yields around the 0.50 and 2.80 percent marks. [GVD/EUR]
Any full-blown trade battle would hit the world economy and upset the plans of major central banks to tighten policy - fuelling demand for government bonds.
However, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump had both struck conciliatory tones on Tuesday, boosting hopes the door to trade negotiations might open. But one report said early talks had already broken down.
""The risk of a full-blown trade war ... poses the most serious risk to continued strong global momentum,"" Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said. He said he doubted there would be a major further escalation at this point.
EURO 
Wall Street also looked set for a softer start later with S&P mini futures (ESc1) down 0.5 percent.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was last down 0.3 percent, while in Asia overnight Japan's Nikkei (N225) and Australian stocks (AXJO) both lost 0.4 percent, South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) dipped 0.2 percent though China did end higher. (SS)
Asian shares had fared better after China's central bank set out the clearest timetable yet for opening the financial services sector to foreign investors. 
It will allow offshore firms to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance sectors by the end of this year.
China watchers said the announcement may further ease trade tensions. But they remained cautious, noting that action had yet to be taken and pointing out that foreign companies still face unofficial barriers in sectors ostensibly already opened up.
Back among the major currencies, the yen and euro were both a shade higher at 107 yen  and $1.2365 (EUR=) respectively. [/FRX]
It was the common currency's fourth session of gains and it stayed close to two-week high of $1.2378 it had scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters it could get rate hikes rolling once its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying program ends this year.
The euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalize monetary policy and hike interest rates.
""We anticipate further, gradual euro appreciation versus the dollar over the course of 2018,"" ANZ's head of global economics Brian Martin wrote.
Oil prices slipped meanwhile following the previous day's sharp rally, although losses were limited as the commodity markets eyed an escalation of Middle East tensions. [O/R]
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were down 0.3 percent at $65.32 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday on the back of the surge in risk appetite in the broader markets.
Brent (LCOc1) lost 0.45 percent to $70.73 a barrel after jumping 3.5 percent on Tuesday, when it rose to $71.34, highest since December 2014.

Traditional safe haven gold  touched a one-week high of $1,342.64 an ounce on geopolitical tensions. [GOL/]

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP said on Tuesday it plans to seek four board seats at consumer products group Newell Brands (N:NWL), arguing more work is needed to repair the company even after rival activist Carl Icahn was handed board seats.
""We are seeking your support for the election of our four (4) nominees at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to be held on Tuesday, May 15, 2018,"" Starboard's chief executive officer Jeffrey Smith wrote in a filing.
The New York-based hedge fund, which owns 3.8 percent of the Rubbermaid container maker, earlier this year planned to oust the entire board. It scaled back its ambitions and now seeks to replace four incumbent directors with its own people, including two women. It is urging investors to elect Pauline Brown, Gerardo Lopez, Bridget Ryan Berman and Robert Steele.
Starboard has argued that even with Icahn's nominees to the board more change is needed to salvage the company and boost its lagging share price. ""Poor execution and a series of operational missteps have resulted in severe share price underperformance compared to both industry peers and the broader market,"" Smith wrote, adding ""the current situation is unacceptable.""
Newell's share price has lost roughly 17 percent since January. The stock was up 1.2 percent to $25.83 on Tuesday.
Three weeks ago Icahn reached a settlement with Newell that immediately gave him four board seats in a deal that was seen undercutting Starboard's campaign.
Starboard had planned to oust Newell CEO Michael Polk and wanted to slow the pace of planned asset sales. It had stocked its slate with a group of former Newell directors who had resigned from the board earlier in the year after disagreements over strategy.

The company is in discussions with a few manufacturers who make military-style firearms for civilians, Bank of America's vice chairman, Anne Finucane, told the news agency in an interview. 
""It is not our intent to underwrite or finance military style firearms on a go-forward basis,"" she said. 
A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on the report.
Last month,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) added restrictions on firearm sales for new retail sector clients, requiring them to sell firearms only to customers who passed a background check, restricting sales for buyers under 21, and not sell so-called bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.
The second-deadliest shooting at a U.S. public school re-ignited the long-running national debate over gun rights, pitting many of the students who survived the Feb. 14 high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, against powerful gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 09:53PM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler, U.S. Justice Department in diesel emissions settlement talks","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is in advanced settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department and California Air Resources Board over accusations that the company illegally used software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014, a court-appointed adviser said at a hearing on Tuesday.
The adviser, Ken Feinberg, disclosed at a federal court hearing in San Francisco that government lawyers and Fiat Chrysler had exchanged and ""redlined"" documents after lengthy talks that were moving ""at a rather swift pace.""
A lawyer for Fiat Chrysler, Robert Giuffra, said the company and government lawyers were exchanging drafts of settlement documents. He said he expected a settlement would be reached ""probably sometime during the summer.""
The Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler lawyers a Jan. 27 settlement offer that would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions, Reuters reported in February. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties.
Lawyers in court did not disclose the potential amount of any fine state and federal governments would want Fiat Chrysler to pay as part of any settlement or if the sides had agreed on that issue. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols on Monday declined to discuss the amount of any potential civil penalty.
The sides have engaged in lengthy settlement talks and have three more rounds of talks planned for later in April and May. Lawyers said a settlement could be reached this summer.
Fiat Chrysler and the Justice Department have discussed some consumer-related provisions that could be part of a settlement including warranty and recall provisions.
Last July, Fiat Chrysler won approval from federal and California regulators to sell 2017 model year diesel vehicles after it was sued by the Justice Department in May 2017 for excess emissions.
To resolve the pollution issue, the company is confident it can use updated emissions software in the 2017 vehicles as the basis of a fix to address agencies' concerns over 2014-2016 diesel vehicles. The company hopes to complete testing the proposed fix by the end of June.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. 
The company has denied any wrongdoing, saying there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. The Justice Department has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the excess emissions.

U.S. Judge Edward Chen set a June 1 hearing to get another update on the talks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a Federal Communications Commission investigation over proper tower registration and environmental and historic impact reviews prior to building wireless infrastructure facilities, the regulator said on Tuesday.
""The law was clear and it is vital that carriers and infrastructure companies alike never duck their responsibilities,” Christopher Killion, acting deputy chief of the FCC's Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement.
""Companies must abide by the law as it stands whenever they are building infrastructure, operating wireless facilities, or taking other actions under FCC jurisdiction.""
Sprint takes “compliance obligations seriously and will ensure that facilities are constructed only after appropriate permitting and review are completed,” the company said in a statement.
The FCC also settled with privately held Mobilitie LLC, a telecommunications infrastructure company, for $1.6 million.
Sprint, a mobile voice and data service provider, contracted with Mobilitie to deploy wireless network equipment, the FCC said.
In 2017, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau began investigating whether the two companies met requirements before constructing wireless infrastructure facilities.
Under the rules then in effect, deploying wireless infrastructure facilities, such as communications
towers and structures for small cell systems, required environmental and historic preservation reviews prior to construction.
The rules required some facilities to register with the FCC prior to construction.
Both companies agreed to improve their environmental and historic preservation review compliance procedures.
Christos Karmis, chief executive of Mobilitie, noted that the settlement came after the FCC streamlined and eliminated many of the rules for small cell deployment.
""Mobilitie has been, and always will be, dedicated to regulatory compliance. Our agreement with the FCC demonstrates our continuing commitment to regulatory compliance,"" Karmis said in a statement.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Puerto Rico to get $18.5 billion to rebuild shattered housing market,"By Luis J. Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico will receive $18.5 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help rebuild its battered housing stock and infrastructure after September's Hurricane Maria, the island's governor and HUD officials said on Tuesday.
The funding for the U.S. territory was the largest grant in the history of the HUD, said HUD undersecretary Pamela Patenaude.
But the award was significantly less than the $46 billion requested by Governor Ricardo Rossello in November.
HUD is awarding a total of roughly $28 billion to nine states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico that have been recently affected by major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.
The funds are part of a $90 billion disaster aid package signed by Trump in February. The Virgin Islands is set to receive $1.6 billion in HUD disaster recovery funds, a department media advisory said on Tuesday.
Rossello said at a news conference that he expected to adjust Puerto Rico's fiscal turnaround plan to reflect the full grant. The most recent version of the plan pegged at $13 billion the amount of funds from HUD that the commonwealth expected to receive.
Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, and the plan is meant to establish economic projections that will serve as a basis for forthcoming restructuring talks with creditors owed $120 billion in bond and pension debt.
Rossello and Patenaude made the announcement in Villa Hugo, a shantytown in Canovanas, which sustained severe damage when Maria hit the island on Sept. 20.
Villa Hugo's 6,000 residents are squatters on government land. Most built their homes informally, and do not own title to their properties.
""Informal"" construction - which can also refer to property owners who illegally subdivide their land - is thought to comprise between one-fourth and one-half of Puerto Rico's 1.2 million homes. 
The prevalence of informal housing, which often does not comply with building codes, was thought to compound damage to Puerto Rico's housing stock when the storm hit.
The HUD funds can be used for housing, economic development and infrastructure, and could be used to help repair the island's crippled power grid. While local authorities determine where funds will be used, HUD provides technical assistance and guidelines, Patenaude said.
Maria was a vicious blow to an already struggling island that has been in recession for more than a decade, with a poverty rate near 50 percent.

Puerto Rico now projects to receive roughly $50 billion during the next six years in federal disaster relief assistance, mostly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the government's latest fiscal turnaround plan.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 09:53PM ET</span>",U.S. companies found ways to avoid taxes before tax bill: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifteen U.S. corporations including online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), power company  Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) and insurer  Prudential  Financial Inc (N:PRU) avoided U.S. tax on nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year, a tax watchdog group said on Tuesday.
A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, said data showed how profitable Fortune 500 companies have routinely lowered their tax bills long before the Republican tax overhaul signed into law by President Donald Trump in December.
The 15 corporations had profits of $24.5 billion in 2017 but managed to obtain nearly $1.4 billion in rebates from the U.S. Treasury for a combined tax rate of minus 5.6 percent, according to the ITEP report, which examined corporate income tax disclosures. 
The nonpartisan group said the new U.S. tax regime, which slashed the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in January, will likely allow corporations avoid even more tax.
ITEP said while ""disclosures made by these companies are too vague to allow a complete diagnosis of how they are avoiding income taxes"" they used a variety of tax breaks to cut their tax bills.
Amazon (O:AMZN) received a $137 million federal rebate on $5.4 billion in U.S. profits, resulting an effective tax rate of negative 2.5 percent, by using a tax break that allows companies to write off the value of executive stock options, according to ITEP.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy obtained a $247 million rebate on $4.2 billion in U.S. profits by using accelerated depreciation on capital investments and renewable energy production tax credits to lower its federal tax rate to a minus 5.9 percent, the report said.
Officials at Amazon.com were not immediately available for comment.
A spokesman for Duke Energy called the report ""deeply flawed and misleading.""
The bonus depreciation tax policy was introduced during the recession ""to encourage companies to invest and create jobs to spur economic growth,"" spokesman Neil Nissan said in a statement. 
Last year's tax legislation dramatically expanded the depreciation tax break used by Fortune 500 corporations, the group said. 
Prudential Financial (N:PRU), which has operations in investment management and other financial services in addition to insurance, reduced its effective federal tax rate to negative 1.9 percent on $2.5 billion in U.S. profits partly through low-income housing credits, ITEP said.

Officials at Prudential (LON:PRU) also were not immediately available for comment.

Wirth, who has worked at Chevron for more than 35 years and was previously the company's vice chairman, is also elgible for stock awards and other compansation this year potentially worth more than $15 million.
The pay raise came after Wirth's compensation as vice chairman was boosted last year by more than 25 percent, according to regulatory filings. 
Wirth earned compensation last year of $11.7 million, up from $6.5 million in 2016. Chevron paid roughly $350,000 last year to bolster security at Wirth's home and about $16,000 for a medical checkup and related costs for its incoming CEO.
It is not uncommon for companies to insist on tighter security for incoming CEOs. Chevron, like many peers, also has its CEOs travel on company-owned aircraft, even for personal matters.
Chevron awarded outgoing CEO John Watson $24.8 million in compensation for 2017, roughly 1 percent higher than the prior year, as the company swung to an annual profit of $9.2 billion. 
Watson's compensation in 2017 was 180 times larger than the median compensation of $137,849 for Chevron's 52,953 employees.
Chevron will hold its annual shareholder meeting on May 30 at its headquarters in San Ramon, Calif.

Shareholders will consider proposals on climate change and executive compensation, though those votes will be nonbinding.

Sports broadcasting is a huge business in Europe, with networks spending billions of pounds to secure exclusive rights to show games in top-flight leagues to attract viewers. 
The Commission said it had carried out unannounced inspections in several member states at companies that distribute ""media rights and related rights pertaining to various sports events and/or their broadcasting"".
Fox Networks Group (FNG), an operating unit of Murdoch's 21st Century Fox which distributes TV and cable channels around the world, said it was cooperating with the EC inspection after officials raided its offices in London. 
""The Commission has concerns that the companies involved may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices,"" it said in a statement. 
""Unannounced inspections are a preliminary step into suspected anticompetitive practices. (It) ... does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behavior nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself.""
The Commission did not name any of the companies affected, but Murdoch's FNG confirmed its involvement after it was first reported by the Telegraph newspaper.
The news of the raid comes at a difficult time for Fox which is engaged in string of deals that are facing regulatory approval. 
It is battling Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and British regulators for the right to buy Europe's biggest pay-TV company Sky for around $15 billion while it has also agreed to sell a string of assets to Walt Disney Co for around $52 billion.

The Commission said there was no legal deadline to complete inquiries into anti-competitive conduct and EC investigations can be lengthy.

1. U.S. Consumer Inflation, FOMC Minutes on Tap
Following the return of investor appetite for risker assets in the wake of easing trade-war fears, investors look to a report on consumer inflation and the release of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting minutes to guide expectations for future monetary policy action.
Economists expect March core consumer price index (CPI), a measure of inflation, to remain unchanged at 0.2%, while core year-on-year CPI is expected show a rise of 2.1% from 1.8% in February.
Following PPI data that topped economists’ forecasts Tuesday, Bank of Montreal said it would await Wednesday's CPI print to determine if rising input costs were passed onto consumers or whether the costs were mostly absorbed by producer margins.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will publish Wednesday the minutes of its March meeting at which the central bank voted to raise rates by 0.25% and left its forecast for three total rate hikes in 2017 unchanged.
The dollar remained subdued against a basket of major currencies amid sharp losses suffered against both the Canadian and Aussie dollar.
2. EIA Inventory Data in Focus 
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show a modest decline in U.S. stockpiles.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 189,000 barrels in the week ended April 6.
U.S crude output will also be closely watched after the EIA in its monthly energy outlook report revealed Tuesday that U.S. output rose to an averaged 10.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in March, up 260,000 b/d from the February level.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday at $65.51 a barrel, up 3.3%, as the prospect of U.S.-led military action in Syria stoked investor expectations of supply disruptions in the Middle East.
3. Zuckerberg: One More Round to Go
Shares of Facebook rose sharply Tuesday after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologised to lawmakers for failing to take correct measures to protect user data but reaffirmed Facebook’s value to society.
Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook failed to notify the FTC about the Cambridge Analytica situation when it occurred because it believed the firm had deleted the data but insisted that the social media company would “welcome the right regulation.”
""We considered it a closed case. In retrospect that was clearly a mistake. We shouldn't have taken their word for it,"" Zuckerberg said Tuesday.
Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.
In prepared remarks to members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce released earlier this week, Zuckerberg said that he personally takes the blame for the problems that appear on the social media platform such as fake news and hate speech.
""We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,"" Zuckerberg said. ""It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.""
Plans to protect the integrity and security of the Facebook platform would include restricting developers’ access to the level of information that had previously been made available, Zuckerberg said.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Investors back Kinder Morgan Canada's Trans Mountain move,"By Ahmed Farhatha and John Benny
BENGALURU (Reuters) -  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Canada shareholders on Tuesday backed the pipeline operator's decision to pause most work on its Trans Mountain expansion as a way to force the Canadian government to give final approval for the project.
The company said on Sunday it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia's coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31.
The project was approved by the federal government in 2016, but that approval is being challenged in court by First Nation groups and local municipalities, and British Columbia is eyeing whether it has jurisdiction to block increased oil shipments through its territory.
The Trans Mountain expansion, backed by Canadian oil producers, had an operational date of December 2019, but in October the company pushed that to September 2020 because of what it said was the difficulty in obtaining permits.
A survey of four analysts and investors showed Kinder Morgan Canada's fair value without the project to be around C$13.50, or 20 percent lower than the stock's closing price of C$16.71 on Tuesday. Yet, Kinder Morgan's move found support among shareholders.
""They are trying to get something resolved over the next several weeks, protecting shareholders money,"" said Paul Bloom, chief investment officer at Bloom Investments Counsel Inc. His firm owns a 0.3 percent stake in Kinder Morgan Canada.
""If it doesn't go through, Kinder Morgan has other assets. The stock will go down, but it's not worthless,"" Bloom said. He pegs the real value without the expansion at C$14.00.
Kinder Morgan Canada Chief Executive Steven Kean told analysts on Monday the company had growth prospects and the potential to participate in mergers and acquisitions if the Trans Mountain project did not go ahead, and it would consider returning excess cash to shareholders.
GOVERNMENT BACKING?
British Columbia, the province where the proposed expansion would run through a conservation area, is gunning to block increased oil shipments through its territory. Both Canadian federal government and the provincial government in Alberta have backed the project with Alberta's Premier Rachel Notley saying the province was prepared to be an investor in the pipeline.
""If they put money or provide loan guarantees to the project, that could be a very big win for the shareholders because they will have to put in less risk to receive the end result of a built pipeline,"" said Bloom.
According to Thomson Reuters data, intrinsic value for Kinder Morgan Canada's stock is C$16.93 and it trades at about 27.3 times their 12-month forward earnings compared with the energy sector average of 21.8 times.
""The company would have a very strong balance sheet and other potential options to deploy capital, so it wouldn't be a disaster for them, or us as investors,"" said Jim Hall, chairman of Mawer Investment Management. Mawer holds more than 1 percent in Kinder Morgan Canada and expects the stock to be valued at C$14.00-$15.00 without the expansion.
Moreover, reduced spending on the expansion project should improve parent Kinder Morgan's ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.

""The company has done the right thing, drawing a line in the sand, making it crystal clear where the company stands,"" Bloom added.

Opposition leaders in Venezuela, which is suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation, at the time accused Goldman of giving President Nicolas Maduro a financial lifeline through the $2.8 billion deal.
They added that the operation, which provided Goldman a yield of around 50 percent, would fuel hunger in Venezuela by depriving the government of foreign exchange to import food - leading the securities to be dubbed ""hunger bonds."" 
PDVSA completed the payment in recent days, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified. PDVSA in December said it had initiated the payment.
PDVSA and Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
News of payment on the PDVSA 2022  was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. 
Maduro's government has halted almost all foreign debt payments, leaving Venezuela and PDVSA in default on around $40 billion in bonds, according to Thomson Reuters data.
The U.S. government has barred its citizens from buying newly issued Venezuelan debt, which has effectively locked the country out of financial markets.

Leftist Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition with the help of United States.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 09:40PM ET</span>","Your Money: Get insurance for your dog's bite, as well as its bark","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A cute Maltipoo puppy could never harm anyone, right?
But looks can be deceiving. Dogs of any size or breed could inflict serious damage, leading to large insurance claims.
Over the past 14 years, canine-related injuries - from bites to accidents caused by dog frights - have caused claims to jump 90 percent, according to an annual survey by the Insurance Information Institute (III) and State Farm, the largest U.S. home insurer. Each claim averages $37,051, up from $19,162 in 2003.
Dog bites fall under the liability section of homeowners or renters insurance policies, which typically provide about $100,000 in coverage.
But only about 37 percent of tenants take out a renters insurance policy, which costs about $20 per month. Many more incidents go unreported to insurance companies. 
Inadequate coverage can invite lawsuits. Attorneys like Ken Phillips, who specializes in dog-related cases, runs a website for plaintiffs and other lawyers (http://dogbitelaw.com). He also sues landlords for tenants without renters insurance.
COSTS OF CARE
Even a simple scare injury can rack up big charges.
State Farm public affairs specialist Heather Paul's dog ran out through her open gate and scared an elderly neighbor, who fell off the curb and broke her ankle. The lady filed an insurance claim with Paul's carrier, but the standard liability coverage of $100,000 was not enough for her bone reconstruction.
Luckily, Paul had an additional umbrella policy, which kicked in and covered the rest.
Janet Ruiz, the California representative for the III trade group, estimated that 50 to 75 percent of people have umbrella policies, with coverage of $1 million to over $10 million including auto accident liability. High-net worth families favor such policies, with up to 79 percent reporting they had coverage in a 2012, according to the latest white paper on the matter from insurer ACE Private Risk Services.
Umbrella insurance usually costs less than $50 a month and can be as little as $15, depending on your coverage.
When a dog owner has insurance, especially an umbrella policy, an injured client tends to settle for the amount covered, Phillips said.
Cases can end up in court when a bigger payout is demanded. Some may involve death, severe mauling and loss of body parts.
A California woman went through a two-year lawsuit after her dog got loose and knocked over a postal worker. The dog did not bite anyone, but the worker claimed damages greater than the homeowner's policy covered.
The dog owner, whose pet's mugshot has been posted on a website, fears that neighbors might target her for more lawsuits if she is identified. And if the pup gets in any more trouble, it could be seized and possibly euthanized. 
This owner said she had no umbrella policy, and now she cannot get one. Her homeowner's premium has skyrocketed.
The dog is not insurable for any future liability incidents, so she took out an outside policy to cover the dog, which cost $1,500 a year - more than her homeowners and earthquake insurance.
""We can be the most responsible dog owners, but accidents happen,"" said Paul. ""You just never know.""

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 03:42PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Rusal triggers Iran-style defense after U.S. sanctions - source,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Russian aluminum giant Rusal has activated a contingency plan asking customers to pay in euros instead of dollars to try to skirt round U.S. sanctions, a source close to the matter said.
The plan follows the example of Iran, which a few years ago opted to use gold, oil and the Japanese yen to pay for goods that would typically be priced in dollars.
""Rusal has triggered an Iran-like defense plan,"" a top executive at one of Rusal's shareholders said, declining to name the banks that would process the transactions.
Rusal declined to comment.
Last week, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, saying they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world. 
This included Oleg Deripaska and his Hong Kong-listed company Rusal, which CRU analysts say accounts for 14 percent of aluminum supplies outside of top producer China.
The sanctions explicitly bar U.S. entities from doing business with the named individuals and companies, making it difficult for them to conduct business in dollars. 
""There are a number of banks in Europe that can deal with payment in euros. Some of Rusal's customers have begun switching payments, but it is taking time,"" the top executive said.
Shares in Rusal, the world's second-biggest aluminum producer, were 1 percent higher in Moscow after losing more than 34 percent of their value in two trading days.
A source with a major U.S. bank which used to deal with Rusal said all payments were currently going to an escrow account, complicating the completion of payments between buyers and sellers.
Financial sanctions imposed on Iran in 2012 to punish the country over its nuclear program played havoc with its ability to import key food items, forcing Tehran to find alternative ways to pay for its needs.
Banks involved in metals are likely to be extremely cautious after French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in 2015 paid $8.9 billion to settle claims it violated U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.
European banks are technically not banned from processing Iranian oil transactions in euros, but they too have been wary, worried they could be hit with so-called ""secondary sanctions"" by the United States for aiding a blacklisted entity. 
Iran resorted to buying grains using gold and oil as payment and used the Japanese yen to pay for a large volume of wheat.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) said on Tuesday it would temporarily suspend Rusal's aluminum from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling LME contracts with sanctioned companies.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",German minister rejects joint fund with industry to refit diesel cars,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer denied the government was considering setting up a joint fund with carmakers to pay for exhaust systems to make diesel cars cleaner, citing legal and technical concerns about retrofitting older cars.
Der Spiegel magazine reported last week the government could ask carmakers to contribute 5 billion euros ($6 billion) to such a fund, which would also include government payments.
Scheuer told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper on Tuesday there had not yet been any discussion about funding, and he remained committed to meeting emissions targets using measures already being implemented and without costly hardware retrofits.
""The discussion about hardware retrofits is not appropriate at this point, and definitely not with the participation of taxpayers,"" he told the newspaper in an interview.
The issue is being closely watched by major German carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler and BMW.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her cabinet are due to discuss vehicle emissions and how to avert driving bans during their cabinet retreat this week after Germany's top administrative court ruled in February that local authorities could bar heavily polluting diesel cars.
There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VW) admitted in September 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has spread across the industry and boosted investment in electric vehicles.
Of the 15 million diesel cars in Germany, only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 emissions technology.
Scheuer said there was ""no reason to panic,"" noting a combination of incentives and specific measures could help lower emissions in cities now exceeding permitted levels.
He said software updates of some 5.3 million diesel cars to be completed by the auto industry by the end of the year would reduce emissions by up to 30 percent.
He said he had already released the first 20 million euros of 175 million euros in government subsidies to fund the acquisition of electric vehicles for public infrastructure agencies. The initial funds would pay for 2,000 such vehicles, he said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. unit of China's oil major Sinopec Corp (HK:0386) is procuring copper to send to its equipment suppliers in China, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, a rare move by a Chinese oil company.
Sinopec USA is seeking to buy around 300,000 tonnes of copper and copper concentrates per year to then sell on to its suppliers of copper rods and cables in mainland China, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential.
The suppliers would then sell the equipment to Sinopec and other firms, the sources said on the sidelines of the CRU/CESCO annual mining conference that is taking place this week in Chile.
The move would allow Sinopec to profit by selling copper to Chinese suppliers that struggle to clinch big international trade deals, one of the sources said, adding that many such companies in China face high prices and a limited supply of copper. 
""For some there are three middlemen,"" between the miner and the supplier, he said. 
Sinopec has pledged to raise spending on energy infrastructure after a bumper earnings season last year, betting on robust growth demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
Sinopec began to buy copper last year, the people said. It may look to expand into procurement of other metals as required.
In a statement, Sinopec confirmed that two of its representatives attended the conference for the first time to seek copper supplies for customers on an e-commerce platform. It added that the intent was only for such procurement and that no contracts had been signed.
Sinopec representatives were seeking meetings with a number of mining companies that have Latin American copper operations, including Brazil's Vale (SA:VALE3), three sources said. 
Two of the sources said Sinopec was also reaching out to Canada's Teck (TO:TECKb), Arizona-based Southern Copper (N:SCCO) , which is controlled by Grupo Mexico (MX:GMEXICOB), as well as Chilean miners Codelco [COBRE.UL] and  Antofagasta  (L:ANTO). 
Vale and Teck declined to comment while Southern Copper and Codelco did not respond to requests for comment. Antofagasta said it had no knowledge of the matter. 
China, the world's biggest copper user, imported 352,000 tonnes of unwrought copper and 1.45 million tonnes of copper concentrate in February.
Companies such as car makers that use commodities like aluminum, cobalt and copper in bulk often lock in supplies in long-term deals to protect against big swings in prices and secure raw materials amid occasional shortages. 
Sinopec last month pledged to raise spending by around 18 percent this year after posting its best annual earnings since 2013 on the back of a rally in oil prices. 

The energy firm said some of the funds would go toward building more shale gas production capacity in southwest China and that it planned to more than double its LNG receiving capacity in the next six years.

Canada's Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences exchange-traded fund (ETF) has slumped 45 percent since its January peak. The U.S.-listed ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which began trading on Dec. 26, is down 32 percent from its high, just a hair above a record low on April 4.
The Toronto stock benchmark is down about 6 percent this year.
Liberal government officials have said legalization is unlikely by July as initially expected, with a Senate vote on the draft legislation planned only for June 7.
Last month, Canada's health regulator set out strict requirements for the packaging and labeling of recreational marijuana, downplaying the brand name. Populous provinces, including Ontario and Quebec, plan a limited number of government-controlled stores that will sell only cannabis flower and oil.
""Licensed producer power won't be quite the same in the post-medical (marijuana) world,"" said Alan Brochstein, founder of cannabis-sector information provider 420 Investor. ""They'll be the suppliers, but they won't capture the whole retail margin. And the packaging is ... kind of a retardant to the growth of the market."" 
Jason Zandberg, a research analyst at PI Financial, predicted 2019 sales may be lower than expected, in part due to initial shortages and slow consumer conversion from the illegal market.
However, he said he expects an oversupply in three to five years, when more production comes online. He estimated 1.5 million kg (3.3 million lbs) of supply by 2023, versus 900,000 kg of demand in a Feb. 15 note. 
Broader positive sentiment did help lift pot stocks on Tuesday. The Horizons and Alternative Harvest ETFs both rose 1.5 percent.
Both Zandberg and Brochstein said they expect marijuana stocks to rebound this year. Brochstein predicted a bottom between now and the Senate vote on June 7, with sentiment improving as implementation of legal sales approaches. But expecting prices to rebound to January's peak in the next year or two would be ""aggressive,"" he added.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>",Sprint in new talks to merge with T-Mobile: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Sprint Corp (N:S) has restarted talks to merge with T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS), people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, the latest effort to bring together the fourth and third largest U.S. wireless carriers.
The combined company would have more than 127 million customers and could create more formidable competition for the No. 1 and No. 2 wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T), amid a race to expand offerings in 5G, the next generation of wireless technology.
T-Mobile's and Sprint's previous round of negotiations ended in November over valuation disagreements. Since then, Sprint's shares have lost more than a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion. 
Sprint's majority owner, SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), has been looking to trim its debt, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year.
Sprint and T-Mobile decided to restart talks partly because they want to share the financial burden of investing in their networks, the sources said. The negotiations are at an early stage, the sources added.
A key consideration in the talks is Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG's (DE:DTEGn) ability to consolidate T-Mobile's earnings, one of the sources said. Deutsche Telekom owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, which has emerged as one of its more prized assets. Deutsche Telekom would likely have to put in new money toward a merger for its stake to remain above 50 percent.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Sprint declined to comment, while T-Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares of Sprint closed off their intraday high but still up more than 17 percent at $6.02, giving the company a market capitalization of $25 billion, after the Wall Street Journal first reported on the new talks. 
Shares of T-Mobile gained 5.67 percent to $63.13, giving it a market capitalization of $54 billion.
Failure to clinch an agreement last November left SoftBank Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint.
""SoftBank has to change the way they approach this,"" Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner said. ""Unless they have changed their minds, (and admitted) that they are indeed the junior partner, nothing has changed.""
Even though Sprint's customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by heavy discounting. Analysts have said that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market.
""It is impossible for Sprint to sustain on its own, and the same problems still exists with SoftBank and Sprint not comfortable with a minority stake,"" MoffettNathanson LLC analyst Craig Moffett said. ""But ultimately you have to believe that these two companies will end up together even if the path to get there is torturous."" 
T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. 
T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans.
REGULATORY CONCERNS
Another roadblock to the deal could be regulatory hurdles. Sprint's and T-Mobile's first round of merger talks ended in 2014 after the Obama administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal. The big four wireless providers have been heavily discounting their cellphone plans in a battle for consumers, and consumer advocates fret that a merger of T-Mobile and Sprint could reverse that trend.
It was not immediately clear how the Trump administration would view the combination. AT&T agreed to acquire U.S. media company  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) in October 2016 for $85 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice has sued to block the deal over concerns about the companies' pricing power in the media market. AT&T and Time Warner are currently defending their deal in court.
Caroline Holland, a veteran of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division who is now a Mozilla tech policy fellow, said that Sprint and T-Mobile would likely argue that their combination would mean more effective competition for Verizon and AT&T.
""They are probably betting that they can make a competent and convincing argument that it's more important to have a stronger No. 3. They'll make a case that Sprint hasn't been a strong competitor,"" she said. 
""I have a very healthy skepticism. I think four competitors has benefited consumers.""

Analysts have in the past said a combined company would cut costs by reducing cell-tower sites; shares of operators American Tower (N:AMT), Crown Castle International (N:CCI) and SBA Communications (O:SBAC) fell on the news.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Uber launches new app for drivers,"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] on Tuesday unveiled a new app for its drivers that includes a real-time earnings tracker, the latest effort by the ride-hailing service to improve an often contentious relationship.
The move follows Uber's '180 days of change' program that was launched last June to make changes requested by drivers, such as tipping and compensation for the time spent waiting for passengers.
""While 180 Days was about correcting missteps of the past, we also needed to think longer term, and the obvious place to start was the Driver app,"" Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.
The new app will also introduce a new status bar to help drivers decide their next location based on a spike in requests, along with a notification feature that allows drivers to see messages about upcoming earnings opportunities and feedback from riders among other things.
The rollout follows a Beta version developed with the drivers, Uber said.
Uber last year outlined a series of improvements for drivers, including a new navigation system and fairer approach to review performance, in response to years of complaints by drivers about their pay and treatment. 
Uber drivers are independent contractors, not employees, and lack paid sick leave and vacation, and must pay for car maintenance and other costs. 

The company, which is preparing for a potential initial public offering in 2019, lost $4.5 billion last year and is facing fierce competition at home in the United States and across Asia, as well as a regulatory crackdown in Europe.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 12:39PM ET</span>",Icahn to sell Federal-Mogul to Tenneco for $5.4 billion,"By Arunima Banerjee
(Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he was selling auto parts maker Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Inc (N:TEN) in a $5.4 billion deal, unloading an investment he has held for nearly two decades and picking up a new stake in Tenneco.
Tenneco plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies - one focusing on powertrain products and the other on auto parts such as suspensions and axle dampers - after the deal closes.
The new bulked up powertrain technology company will likely benefit from the fact that internal combustion engine parts and tailpipe exhaust scrubbing technology will be needed by automakers for a long time to come, before they can be replaced by newer technologies such as fully electric cars.
The aftermarket parts company would provide a potentially steady cash flow.
This is the latest in a series of corporate restructurings or spinoffs in the auto supplier industry, as investors press for more focused companies. See Breakingviews: 
B. Riley analyst Christopher Van Horn said the Federal-Mogul deal could drive expectations of more consolidation in the sector.
Tenneco's shares rose 5.8 percent to $58.78, while Icahn Enterprises' (O:IEP) shares were up 2.7 percent at $61.29.
""Going to market with well-recognized brands, more product categories, greater coverage and expanded distribution capabilities is a strong formula for capturing growth, particularly in China,"" Tenneco Executive Chairman Gregg Sherrill said on the call.
 Icahn Enterprises  will get $800 million cash and 29.5 million of Tenneco common shares in the deal.
The equity value of the deal is $2.4 billion. Federal-Mogul, which makes powertrain parts including pistons, ignition coils and spark plugs, had gross debt of $3.1 billion.
It was not clear if Icahn would hold stakes in the separate companies.
He first bought convertible bonds in Federal-Mogul in 2001 for $1.1 billion, and finally took it private last year after buying the remaining 18 percent he did not already own.
Icahn's firm Icahn Enterprises (O:IEP) typically buys undervalued assets, improves their operations, and ultimately sells them at a profit.
""We expect to be meaningful stockholders of Tenneco going forward,"" Icahn said in a statement.
The deal is expected to generate $200 million in annual earnings and $250 million in working capital.
Lake Forest, Illinois-based Tenneco, whose customers include  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), would now also get  Cummins Inc  (N:CMI) and luxury carmaker Jaguar as clients.

 Barclays  (LON:BARC) was the lead financial adviser to Tenneco, while J.P.Morgan was the M&A adviser.

1577,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>",U.S. Sanctions Inflict Pain on Putin as Russia Pulls Bond Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- The trail of destruction left by American sanctions against Russia’s most influential oligarchs spread to President Vladimir Putin’s government as surging borrowing costs forced the Finance Ministry to pull a planned bond sale.
It’s the first debt auction that Russia is abandoning since cancellations in 2014 and 2015, when Putin’s annexation of Crimea soured relations with the U.S. and European Union. As panic spreads over how far America will go at blacklisting wealthy Russian businessmen, the ruble and bonds are tumbling.
“It’s finally sinking in that the U.S. Treasury actions are a major game changer in terms of how one should view Russian market risks,"" said Timothy Ash, a senior emerging-market strategist at BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London. ""The U.S. administration made it clear that no Russian oligarch can now escape.""
The latest penalties are notably worse than earlier ones because they bar any trading of securities in two Russian companies instead of just limiting new equity and debt sales. Targets include billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who runs one of the world’s biggest aluminum companies, United Co. Rusal -- which lost half of its market value in Hong Kong on Monday alone.
Global companies are rushing to distance themselves from the blacklisted oligarch.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, the world’s largest commodities trader, said on Tuesday it’s scrapping a plan to swap its stake in Rusal for shares in another one of Deripaska’s companies, London-listed En+ Group Plc. Its chief executive officer, Ivan Glasenberg, also resigned from Rusal’s board.
The impact of Friday’s sanctions were felt through the commodities industry. Aluminum extended its biggest two-day gain in more than six years on concern production from Rusal will be prevented from reaching global markets.
Russia ‘Outgunned’
The ruble depreciated 3.5 percent to 62.75 versus the dollar, taking its decline this week to 7.2 percent. Russian stocks rose 3.5 percent, only partly reversing an 8.3 percent slide on Monday, mostly because other non-sanctioned exporters benefit from the weaker currency since their earnings are in dollars and costs are in rubles.
""My sense, is that economically at least, Russia is outgunned and they will seek to save face and not exacerbate the situation,"" said Julian Rimmer, a London-based emerging-markets trader at Investec Bank Plc. ""My advice to clients, therefore, is to buy shares into this weakness, especially Sberbank, and hold onto your shapka.""
So far, Russian officials aren’t panicking, saying the sanctions pose no threat to financial stability and don’t require any response from the authorities. The ruble’s floating exchange rate helps the economy adapt to shocks and the central bank can use interest rates to offset any increase in inflation caused by currency weakness, central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said at a conference in Moscow.
In December 2014 when the ruble went into free fall, she did just that -- hoisting borrowing costs by 650 basis points overnight in a move that eventually calmed market panic. On Tuesday, the Bank of Russia said it won’t hesitate to sell dollars if needed.
There was little reprieve on the bond market, especially since it’s not just sanctions that Russia is up against. Escalating tensions between Russia and the U.S. over the conflict in Syria are also giving traders cause for concern.
President Donald Trump said the U.S. will respond “forcefully” to a suspected chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime over the weekend, after suggesting earlier that Putin may share responsibility.
Yields on government ruble-denominated debt due in January 2028 surged 22 basis points to 7.54 percent. Russia’s Finance Ministry cited unfavorable market conditions in its first decision to scrap a debt sale since August 2015. The cost of insuring Russian dollar debt against default surged to the most since August.
""The message to Western institutional investors is now clear -- you hold Russian securities at your own risk. You have been warned,"" said Ash.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus suspends A320 revamp study amid output problems,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has shelved advanced studies aimed at improving its A320neo jet family, designed in part to fend off a mid-market plane that Boeing hopes to build, two people familiar with the matter said.
The surprise decision to back away from the proposed ""A320neo-plus"" and ""A321neo-plus,"" which would lengthen and modernize both models, comes as Airbus (PA:AIR) continues to face problems in increasing output for the current versions.
""The ramp-up is not going as well as hoped,"" a person with knowledge of the supply chain said. Another said Airbus had declared industrial matters top priority amid engine shortages, calling off plans to show the A320neo-plus design to airlines.
""We do not comment on product policy,"" an Airbus spokesman said, asked about a decision to halt work on the A320neo-plus.
The 30-year-old A320 family is Airbus's most-sold model and competes with Boeing's 737 for the bulk of airline business. 
Demand for both workhorse series is strong, but Airbus has won the order race since both sides carried out engine upgrades earlier this decade, particularly with the big-selling A321neo.
It faces uncertainty, however, as Boeing (N:BA) ponders a new jet in the middle of the market, overlapping narrowbody jets and the wide-body sector where its position is strongest.
In an effort to pre-empt that move, Airbus had been looking at stretching the A320neo and A321neo to add seats from 2022, two years before the earliest date for Boeing's proposed jet. 
Suppliers say this A320neo-plus would also save fuel through better aerodynamics and that the cockpit could get a facelift.
The development proposal was one of the items awaiting new planemaking chief Guillaume Faury when he replaced Fabrice Bregier in February, alongside engine supply problems that have forced the company to suspend deliveries of some A320neo jets.
Sources say Airbus has been building large tents outside its main factory to help accommodate undelivered jets.
CAUTIOUS STANCE
In that climate, and with a new planemaking management still finding its feet, Airbus is adopting a more cautious attitude to risks and focusing on ramping up production as smoothly as possible to defend its main source of profits, the people said.
An internal appeal begins this week to boost recruitment of the company's best talent for the A320-family ramp-up.
Although the A320neo-plus had not been launched, work on internal studies was advanced and was expected soon to pass the stage where the aircraft could be presented to airlines.
A second and more costly study, code-named ""A320neo-plus-plus,"" envisaged new wings, but not until a few years later.
The decision to back off the A320neo-plus raises a second question mark over Airbus's response to the potential new Boeing jet after it lost key sales contests for the A330neo, which sits at the top end of the middle-market between 200 and 270 seats.
Airbus said it was in no hurry to adjust the A321neo, implying it is content to let Boeing show its cards first.
""The A321neo is an aircraft with lots of potential. It enjoys a market share of some 80 percent,"" the spokesman said, adding ""we are under no pressure.""
Some sources, however, said Airbus was taking an unexpected gamble by failing to keep investing in the strongest part of its portfolio, with sales momentum and technology both at stake.
For its part, Boeing has not found it simple to close the business case for its new jet, due partly to production costs. 

Analysts say its perceived ability to divert business from the A321neo at the lower end of the market may weigh in any Boeing decision to launch the jet, which could come this year.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 02:57PM ET</span>",Volkswagen to replace CEO with VW brand chief: sources,"By Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz
BERLIN/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is poised to replace Chief Executive Matthias Mueller with the head of its core VW brand, Herbert Diess, two people familiar with the matter said, as it looks to give fresh impetus to its recovery from an emissions scandal.
The German carmaker said on Tuesday it was considering a change in leadership as part of a broader management overhaul, but gave few details. The 64-year-old Mueller's contract is due to run until 2020.
The move comes after Europe's largest automaker has been hampered by infighting among its powerful stakeholders, which include the  Porsche  and Piech families, the German state of Lower Saxony, and labor leaders.
Shares in Volkswagen jumped on the news, and closed up 4.5 percent at 171.58 euros.
Mueller, a company veteran, was installed at short notice in 2015, a week after the company admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emission tests, prompting criticism from some investors who said that only an outsider could rebuild trust in the business. 
He launched an ambitious reform plan, including investing billions of euros in electric vehicles, but has struggled to push through changes aimed at creating a more efficient and focused company. Amid opposition from labor leaders, Mueller failed to sell motorbike maker Ducati last year.
It is unclear how soon Diess, a former BMW (DE:BMWG) executive who joined VW in July 2015 and has clashed with the company's labor leaders, might replace Mueller. Unions and Lower Saxony together have the power to block his appointment. 
Volkswagen is due to discuss a stock market listing for its trucks and bus division at a supervisory board meeting on Friday, two people close to the carmaker said - another move aimed at creating a more focused business.
That plan comes as rivals including  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) consider spin offs or legally separate divisions to boost their share prices and raise cash to fund development of electric and self-driving cars.
FRUSTRATION
Despite facing billions in fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits relating to its ""dieselgate"" scandal, Volkswagen's operating results have been robust under Mueller's watch, with sales and profit hitting record highs last year.
But the persistent tug of war between its controlling families, unions and other stakeholders have made it difficult to drive through structural changes that investors have said are key to the company fulfilling its potential. 
Mueller has expressed frustration with the pace of Volkswagen's transformation and more recently about his ability to turn around the brand's image following revelations the company had tested toxic fumes on monkeys.
Volkswagen's shares have outperformed the European autos sector index (SXAP) by 10 percent over the past three years, and recovered to pre-dieselgate levels last year.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday Mueller had expressed his general willingness to participate in a management overhaul, and it was still to be determined whether efforts to develop a new leadership structure would leave him in place.
Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch is currently in talks about changing the structure with fellow supervisory board members and members of the management board, Volkswagen said.
Mueller's possible replacement will likely face similar challenges to get Volkswagen's stakeholders to unite.
Diess, 59, has focused his reforms at the VW brand on procurement and process management to bring its cost structure and efficiency closer to that of rival Toyota (T:7203), but stopped short of making sweeping job cuts.
Diess and Mueller instead agreed to guarantee VW's German jobs until 2025 to get labor approval for a plan to turn the carmaker into a mass producer of electric cars.
German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday reported that Volkswagen's board member for human resources, Karlheinz Blessing, may be replaced by Gunnar Kilian, who worked directly under VW's labor chief Bernd Osterloh.
The move would be a major concession by management to worker representatives, potentially handing labor leaders insight into management plans for investments and cost cutting plans.
Previous executives who attempted deeper cuts in VW's homeland, including Bernd Pischetsrieder and Wolfgang Bernhard, were forced out of office or stifled in their reform efforts. 
'BETTER APPOINTMENT'
Mueller's likely departure comes two days after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), another pillar of corporate Germany, dismissed its chief executive, John Cryan, in pursuit of a more rapid turnaround following years of losses.
""If Diess is confirmed as the successor, VW shares will extend their gains,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, who has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.
""We see no better alternative to Matthias Mueller to make the company fit for the future.""
German newspaper Handelsblatt first reported that Diess would replace Mueller. Other potential CEO candidates include Volkswagen's trucks chief and Daimler veteran Andreas Renschler.
The debate about Volkswagen's future structure comes a month after its largest shareholder, Porsche Automobil Holding (DE:PSHG_p), picked three new representatives of the Porsche and Piech families to help oversee Volkswagen.

Volkswagen declined to comment on whether the board was poised to name Diess as new CEO. The works council, whose members occupy half the seats on the supervisory board, also declined comment.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 01:03PM ET</span>","Russia vows to curb U.S. sanctions fallout, shrugs off steep rouble fall","By Andrew Osborn and Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian government pledged to minimise the fallout from U.S. sanctions on Tuesday and dismissed steep falls in the rouble and financial markets as short-term volatility, saying Russia needed time to adjust to the new curbs.
The rouble fell sharply for a second day, shedding over 3 percent of its value against the dollar despite rising prices of oil, the country's main export, as investors continued an asset sell-off fuelled by fears that the United States could impose more sanctions and a realisation that Russian credit and market risks have substantially increased. 
Some rich Russians were dismissive about their losses, with one consoling himself with the thought he had once lost $1 billion in a single day.
""Being on the Russian stock market is like living on a volcano,"" he said. 
The sanctions, announced on Friday, target officials and businesspeople around President Vladimir Putin in an aggressive response to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. 
Analysts are struggling to understand how some of the businessmen targeted were chosen however, adding to swirling uncertainty.
The Russian market is under additional pressure from a proposal by two U.S. congressmen to impose further sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain - allegations Moscow denies.
The financial shock poses a potential political problem for President Vladimir Putin, who was re-elected last month and has promised to raise living standards and invest big in infrastructure, education and health.
The fragile economic recovery is now at risk and the government may have to spend money earmarked for fulfilling his pledges to bail out sanctioned Russian firms. Sharp falls in the rouble's value are also likely to make imports costlier, rattle the elite, and hit travel-minded Russians.
Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he thought the slump in asset values would be short-lived.
""There have indeed been strong negative trends on the market,"" Peskov told a conference call with reporters. ""Partly that is to do with market trends, partly it's to do with the emotional fallout (from the sanctions). There will subsequently be a correction.""
For Russian politicians and businessmen, the financial shock evoked painful memories of 2014 when Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea triggered precipitous falls, albeit much steeper, in Russian asset values. 
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, told reporters at an annual Moscow Exchange forum to keep things in perspective.
""We think it is an absolutely short-lived market reaction, which in large part is driven by speculators,” said Dmitriev. 
After losing $250 million on Monday, Oleg Tinkov, founder and chairman of Tinkoff Bank, said he was unfazed.
“There were worse days,"" Tinkov told the same event. ""I remember losing $1 billion in one day so it was actually a very positive day yesterday ... Being on the Russian stock market is like living on a volcano.""
'NO RISKS TO FINANCIAL STABILITY' 
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said authorities would do everything they could to minimise the impact of the U.S. sanctions for business and financial markets. 
Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the central bank, said the bank had a wide range of tools to act if risks to financial stability emerged. But she said she did not see such risks at the moment. 
Nabiullina said she and her colleagues were closely watching the market correcting after Friday's U.S. sanctions, but expected things to settle down in time.
""As happens with such situations, in the first days afterwards there is heightened volatility because there's a lot of uncertainty and the consequences are not completely understandable for investors and market participants,"" Nabiullina told the Moscow Exchange event.
"" ... But in our view some time is needed for the economy's financial sphere to adapt to the changed external conditions and I'm sure that the economy and the financial sphere will adapt.""
Sergei Shvetsov, the central bank's first deputy governor, said it might resume foreign currency repo operations if there was demand for such tools and they were deemed necessary for financial stability. 
The Russian finance ministry cancelled a regular weekly auction of OFZ treasury bonds on Wednesday for the first time since 2015, citing ""unfavourable market conditions."" Yields for the rouble-denominated bonds, popular among foreign investors, have sky-rocketed on news of the new U.S. sanctions.
Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said the floating rouble rate was helping to offset a possible negative effect on the Russian economy. The economy is projected to grow by 2 percent this year after a 1.5 percent increase in 2017.
Putin discussed the state of the economy in 2017 with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday in what the Kremlin billed as a routine meeting.
Medvedev, who has spoken of possible retaliatory steps against the United States, told Putin that based on data for 2017 the economy was in general ""absolutely stable"" and that macro-economic indicators were at the right level. Neither man made reference to U.S. sanctions or the market turmoil. 
Medvedev has ordered his government to prepare measures to support sanctioned Russian entities with aluminium producer Rusal, which saw its shares more than halve on Monday, expected to be among those helped.
Rusal's own problems deepened on Tuesday after Swiss-based trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) suspended a plan to swap its shares in Rusal for Global Depository Receipts in EN+, tycoon Oleg Deripaska's holding company.

Glencore also said that Ivan Glasenberg, its chief executive, had resigned from his position as a director of Rusal.

1586,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>",American Aluminum Emerging as Winner From U.S. Ban on Rusal,"(Bloomberg) -- The American aluminum industry is getting a double benefit from Donald Trump’s harder stance on trade and Russian oligarchs.
 Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp. and Century Aluminum Co. appear to be two of the main U.S. beneficiaries of Treasury Department sanctions on Rusal and seven other firms linked to Oleg Deripaska. The U.S.’s proposed tariffs on aluminum imports also stand to give local producers an edge over the competition.
Shares in the two U.S. companies have rallied more than 10 percent since March 29 along with surging aluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange.
“If the U.S. uses all of its capacity that’s not being used right now, we can cover our imports,” Jorge Vazquez, managing director at Harbor Intelligence, said in a telephone interview. “But every smelter would have to restart and every potline would need to restart.”
That would be a reversal for an industry decimated by smelter shutdowns in states such as South Carolina and Kentucky at a time Chinese production of the lightweight metal surged, pushing down global prices.
Alcoa produced about 360,000 metric tons of aluminum in the U.S. in 2017, which will grow to about 520,000 as it restarts the Warrick smelter in Indiana, according to Justin Bergner, a research analyst at Gabelli & Co. The company also produces about 650,000 tons of aluminum in Canada, two-thirds of which will end up in the U.S.
‘Every Potline’
Century is looking to bring back 150,000 tons of annual production. It will start bringing online one of three idled pot-lines at its Hawesville, Kentucky, smelter, with all three back up and running fully about nine months after that.
Rusal sends about 700,000 tons of aluminum to the U.S annually that would have to be made up somehow, according to Harbor Intelligence. The U.S. researcher estimated that if the U.S. restarted all of its idled capacity, it could produce an additional 753,000 tons -- though it would take at least a year to get there.
Alcoa declined to comment ahead of its first-quarter earnings release next week. Century didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Friday, Washington sanctioned Rusal and other entities and individuals for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and for their country’s actions in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria. On Monday, the biggest aluminum producer outside China lost half its value in one day.
The U.S. aluminum premium, or the amount added to the LME price to ship metal to the U.S. Midwest, rose to 19.5 cents a pound, up from 18.4 cents. Aluminum for delivery going out to December of 2019 surged, which future months ranging from 18.5 cents to 19.8 cents a pound.
For Alcoa, every 2-cent per pound increase in the premium adds about $50 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) estimates.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>",Vietnam activists question Facebook on suppressing dissent,"By Mai Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese human rights activists and independent media groups have written to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's chief executive, questioning whether the social media platform was helping suppress dissent in the communist country.
The letter, released on Tuesday by U.S.-based human rights group Viet Tan and signed by nearly 50 other groups, said Facebook's system of automatically pulling content if enough people complained could ""silence human rights activists and citizen journalists in Vietnam"".
Despite sweeping economic reform in Vietnam, and increasing openness toward social change, including gay, lesbian and transgender rights, the ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.Vietnam last year unveiled a 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit, named Force 47, to counter ""wrong"" views on the internet.
The open letter to Zuckerberg called Force 47 ""state-sponsored trolls"" whom it accused of exploiting Facebook's community policies and disseminating fake news about the activists.
""Our community standards, which outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook, seek to encourage expression and create a safe community on the platform,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in response.
""We will remove content that violates these standards when we're made aware of it,"" the spokeswoman added, in an email statement which said the company's policy in Vietnam was in line with that elsewhere.
""There are also times when we may have to remove or restrict access to content because it violates a law in a particular country, even though it doesn't violate our community standards,"" it added.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not offer any immediate comment on the letter.
Vietnam previously said Facebook had committed to work with the government to prevent illegal content from appearing on its platform and would also remove fake accounts and fake content about senior government officials.
Activists said the frequency of takedowns had risen and Facebook had been unhelpful in restoring accounts and content, after its Head of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert met Vietnam Information Minister Truong Minh Tuan in 2017.
Vietnam's government cited Facebook as having said at the time of the meeting that it would set up a separate channel to directly coordinate with the communication and information ministry on reports of illegal content.
Facebook's process and policies for government requests did not change as a result of the meeting, the firm said on Tuesday.
""We appreciate Facebook's efforts in addressing safety and misinformation concerns online in Vietnam and around the world,"" the activists said.
""Yet it would appear that after this high-profile agreement to coordinate with a government that is known for suppressing expression online and jailing activists, the problem of account suspension and content takedown has only grown more acute.""
Vietnam this month jailed human rights lawyer and activist Nguyen Van Dai for 15 years on the charge that he ""aimed at overthrowing the people's administration"", with six more activists jailed for seven to 13 years.
Their sentences prompted responses from representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and the European delegations and rights groups.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said, ""There is no such thing as people being arrested for freely expressing opinion"" in Vietnam, however.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 11:17PM ET</span>","China's Ant ups fundraising target, valuation could hit $150 billion: sources","By Julie Zhu and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's Ant Financial Services Group is in talks with investors to boost its fundraising target to at least $8 billion, which could see its valuation jumping to about $150 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said.
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings is likely to be the lead investor in the latest round of equity raising by the company, controlled by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma, three people said.
Reuters reported in February that Ant, owner of China's top online payment platform Alipay, was planning to raise up to $5 billion, which could value the firm at more than $100 billion.
The fundraising plan comes ahead of an expected stock market flotation, though Ant has neither set a timetable for the initial public offering nor has it chosen any location for the same.
One of the people said Ant could end up raising between $8 billion and $10 billion as a result of strong investor demand.
All the people spoke to Reuters on the condition that they not be named as the fundraising details were confidential. Ant and Temasek declined to comment. Alibaba did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A pre-IPO round is an increasingly common move by sought-after Chinese companies to establish valuations and widen their investor base ahead of going public.
A $150 billion valuation would make Ant one of the biggest public flotations ever, dwarfing this year's launch of Spotify and Dropbox. It would compare to the $104 billion float of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) six years ago or Alibaba's own $168 billion valuation in 2014.
Ant's last fundraising in April 2016 valued the company, seen by some analysts as one of the most valuable Alibaba assets due to its unique position in Chinese e-commerce, at about $60 billion.
Shares in e-commerce giant Alibaba rose 4.3 percent in New York on Tuesday.
Alibaba said in February it was taking a 33 percent stake in Ant, replacing the previous system where it received 37.5 percent of Ant's pre-tax profit, in what was viewed as an important step ahead of any IPO.
""Part of the increase in valuation might be because the new investors have received extra features,"" said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida.
""But part of the increase is because the company is continuing to live up to expectations, and is becoming an even more important player in China's mobile payment space.""
DUAL LISTING?
Temasek has expanded its tech investments in the last few years and recent deals include Chinese facial recognition technology developer SenseTime Group and Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Ant was planning to raise $9 billion in its planned round of funding, potentially valuing the company at $150 billion.
The WSJ said it was expected to list on both domestic and overseas exchanges, in line with speculation that it would list in both Hong Kong and New York.
Appetite among U.S. investors has been strong this year for tech sector debuts by Dropbox, Spotify and Zscaler, easing concerns raised by the fall in Snap Inc's shares last year.
Alibaba set up Alipay in 2004, modeling the business on PayPal, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and in 2011 controversially spun it off and rebranded the payment processor into Ant Financial three years later. 
After becoming a dominant payments company in China, Ant Financial focused on international markets by buying a stake in Indian payment firm Paytm and Thai financial technology firm Ascend Money. 
Its attempt to buy U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International was, however, blocked at the start of this year by U.S. officials on national security grounds, a blow to Ma who had promised President Donald Trump that he would create 1 million U.S. jobs.

Current shareholders in Ant include large state-owned institutions such as China Life Insurance and China Post Group, parent of Postal Savings Bank of China.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's government will investigate the country's taxation body after former staffers of the revenue-raising institution told local media it unscrupulously targeted individuals and small businesses to meet budgetary targets - allegations the tax office denies.
Citing two whistle-blowers, the Australian Broadcasting Corp and Fairfax Media Ltd (AX:FXJ) on Monday reported instances of abuse of power by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) including claims of unethical tactics used to raise revenue at the expense of fairness.
""The Minister has requested a thorough investigation of all allegations raised,"" a spokesman for the financial services minister told Reuters in an emailed statement. ""The Government will be responding once it has had an opportunity to consider that in detail.""
The claims were primarily made by Richard Boyle and Ron Shamir, former employees of the ATO, which collected A$360 billion ($278.14 billion) in revenue last year.
Among the claims were instances where Boyle and his tax collection colleagues were instructed by superiors to seize funds from the bank accounts of individuals assessed to owe money, regardless of their particular circumstances.
The reports also quoted Inspector-General of Taxation Ali Noroozi, ATO's key supervisory figure, in an interview estimating the tax office would get about one in 20 cases wrong.
""There is absolutely no evidence that in roughly 5 per cent of cases the Tax Office gets it wrong,"" the ATO said in a statement on its website Tuesday. The feedback it receives from ""credible sources"" is ""consistently positive ... about how we listen and respond to their needs,"" it said.
""The media have taken a handful of isolated cases, presented only one side of the story, and then extrapolated these to suggest systemic issues with our administration,"" the ATO said.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","Travel industry eyes blockchain potential for fees, delays, lost bags","By Victoria Bryan
BERLIN (Reuters) - Blockchain technology has the potential to shake up the travel industry by giving airlines and hotels a way to bypass controlling intermediaries like  Expedia  (O:EXPE) or  Amadeus  (MC:AMA) and gain better access to customer data.
Major players including Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and citizenM hotels are partnering with startups and talking to large corporate clients about whether they can do group bookings via blockchain instead of using middlemen, who charge up to 25 percent of ticket or room prices in fees.
Blockchain, which functions as an online record-keeping system maintained by a group of peers rather than a central agency or authority, also offers new business opportunities in tracking bags and flight delays.
Because transaction data is openly available and not controlled by any one party, blockchain offers an opportunity to build new platforms that can connect travel providers and customers more directly and replace decades-old technology.
""We see a lot of business potential from the very nature of blockchain being decentralized by construction, removing the middleman by design. That looks very fruitful potentially,"" Xavier Lagardere, head of distribution at Lufthansa Group Hub Airlines told Reuters. 
The travel industry joins financial, mining, energy trading firms and others in looking at the potential for blockchain technology when it comes to simplifying processes, cutting out middlemen or tracking goods.
One travel blockchain company that has partnered with major players including Lufthansa, Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) and Netherlands-based citizenM hotels, is Swiss non-profit Winding Tree, whose distribution platform is so far targeting companies rather than consumers.
It allows airlines and hotels to publish available inventory to customers without needing systems that aggregate data on flights and rooms, and could therefore allow them to avoid the fees they currently pay for the use of such systems. 
Currently such systems are provided by intermediaries like global distribution systems (GDS) providers Sabre (O:SABR), Amadeus, and Travelport (N:TVPT), whose real-time inventory technology is used by travel agents or corporate travel bookers, or consumer-facing online travel agencies (OTA) like Booking Holdings (O:BKNG) and Expedia Group. 
Reducing commission fees, which can reach up to 25 percent of the price of a hotel room for example, is an ongoing battle, as is access to customer data, with some airlines complaining that they don't get passenger contact details from third parties, crucial when delays occur. 
Hotels group Marriott (O:MAR) this month said it was looking to lower the commission it pays to online travel agencies, starting with Expedia.
Lufthansa in 2015 introduced a fee for bookings made via GDS companies, of 16 euros, and its rivals IAG (L:ICAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) have also renegotiated contracts.
Winding Tree CEO Maksim Izmaylov said the travel intermediaries may have to adjust their business models as a result of the new technology, mainly by rethinking their fees.
""Those big companies don't have to go away but the rules of the game are changing,"" Izmaylov said, adding Winding Tree wanted to collaborate with the intermediaries too. 
He said OTAs could be forced to drop their fees to around 5 percent from levels of around 20 to 25 percent currently. 
GDS companies, the first of which were created by the airline industry in the 1960s, have put on a brave face, saying they offer more services and real-time pricing for distribution that blockchain technology couldn't provide. 
""There will always be a need for someone to aggregate offers and enable multi-sourced shopping. I don't think blockchain resolves that,"" Philip Likens, director of Sabre Labs, told Reuters. His comments were echoed by representatives of Amadeus, Travelport and technology company SITA.
Tony Hird, VP Enterprise Business Architecture at Travelport, also said transactions using blockchain were not as fast as traditional methods. 
""You can't have a real-time environment if you have to wait 10 minutes for the transaction to be committed,"" he said. 
Ctrip (O:CTRP), China's biggest online travel company, is looking into blockchain itself, though, like others, said the computing power is lacking at the moment. 
""Right now, retrieving blockchain codes takes a long time, so the efficiency needs to be increased and the cost needs to go down,"" Ctrip CEO Jane Jie Sun said. 
Booking.com CEO Gillian Tans said blockchain could make it easier for the company to connect to properties and attractions. 
""Eventually customers will benefit from that as well,"" she told Reuters. 
TRACKING BAGS, DELAYS AND PEOPLE
Meanwhile, travel technology companies are exploring how they can use blockchain themselves to provide new services to their customers, although they are being careful of the hype. 
""We want to be diligent to find the best applications for this technology. It can become a problem that blockchain is the new fancy hammer and we're looking for a nail,"" Sabre Labs' Likens said. 
Air transport technology specialist SITA has worked with Heathrow Airport and British Airways owner IAG to test whether blockchain could be used for sharing of flight data and to keep passengers updated. 
Kevin O'Sullivan, lead engineer at SITA Lab, said it was hard to nail down what the status of a flight was when you have two airports and one airline involved in any individual flight, each with its own operating database. 
""If you have the top 50 to 100 airlines and airports putting data on blockchain, then you have a masterset for the industry that's consistent and managed by industry governance rules for flight status. That would solve a genuine problem,"" he said. 
""Because it's blockchain we know there's a single version of the data shared with all the parties and crucially everyone knows they're looking at the same data set."" 
Sara Pavan, head of Amadeus Innovation Partnership, said baggage tracking, loyalty programs, passenger identification and cross-border payments were all areas where blockchain could prove useful. 

Airlines association IATA is testing blockchain for payments via its billing system that connects airlines and ticket agents, and says it could be cheaper than payment solutions offered by PayPal (O:PYPL), for example.

KitKat became the first consumer brand to market the new chocolate variety developed by Barry Callebaut (S:BARN).
The move is part of a wider effort by Nestle, the world's largest packaged food company, to push its confectionery creations upmarket with special innovations.
The four finger KitKat made with ruby chocolate will be available exclusively at  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) stores in Britain from April 16 for 85 pence ($1.20) a pack, Nestle said. 
""Following the UK launch, the product will be introduced to consumers across Europe and the Americas,"" it said. 
Germany will be the next European market to get the product in early May, a spokeswoman said. She gave no other details on the rollout timetable. 
Swiss cocoa and chocolate specialist Barry Callebaut unveiled the ruby variety in September, creating a fourth kind of chocolate in addition to dark, milk and white. After more than 10 years of development, it is the first new kind of chocolate in decades.
Ruby chocolate is made from the ruby cocoa bean. No berries, berry flavor or color are added.
Chocolate companies, under pressure by consumers' increasing health consciousness, are looking for ways to make their products more interesting.
Alexander von Maillot, Nestle's global head of confectionery, said the company was very pleased with the ruby product's launch in Japan and Korea. 
""The products were sold out in our KitKat Chocolatory stores within 30 minutes every day for the first week after it was launched in January. To date, many consumers are also still visiting our stores to taste and purchase the new product,"" he said.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>",Uber loses EU court case in fight against French criminal charges,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - France is entitled to bring criminal proceedings against local managers of ride-hailing app Uber [UBER.UL] for running an illegal taxi service, the EU top court ruled on Tuesday, dealing the Silicon Valley start-up another legal setback.
Uber's loss follows an earlier one last year where the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) classified the company as a transport service rather than a digital one, which stripped it of protections against undue national regulation that digital services enjoy under EU law.
The latest case concerned Uber's use of unlicensed drivers as part of its UberPOP service in France, which has since been suspended there and in several other cities. Uber still uses its service with professional licensed drivers in France, which is not affected by the ruling.
""Member states may prohibit and punish, as a matter of criminal law, the illegal exercise of transport activities in the context of the UberPOP service, without notifying the Commission in advance of the draft legislation,"" the ECJ said in a statement.
Uber had argued that France should have sought the European Commission's approval for a new taxi law, which contained measures on taxis and mobility apps, including one that said only official taxis could use geolocation technology to show available cars.
As France did not seek the Commission's approval Uber argued that criminal charges brought against two of the company's French managers were not valid.
""This case is about whether a French law from 2014 should have been pre-notified to the European Commission and related to peer-to-peer services which we stopped in 2015,"" a spokeswoman for Uber said. ""As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe.""
Uber, which allows users to summon a ride through an app on their smartphones, has roiled the traditional taxi industry since it launched in Europe in 2011, triggering protests and clashes with local authorities.
It recently adopted a more conciliatory approach, voluntarily suspending its services in some cities to comply with local legislation.
It has also been forced to quit countries such as Denmark and Hungary.
Under EU law, national legislation affecting digital services needs to be pre-notified to Brussels to ensure it is not distorting the single market.
The ECJ said that since Uber was offering a transport service under EU law the obligation to notify the Commission in advance did not apply.
Last year, London deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service and stripped it of its license to operate. Uber is appealing against the decision.
The Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) - which represents major technology companies, including Uber - said the importance of the case went beyond the ride-hailing app.
""It is about the Commission’s effective oversight powers, and we regret to see those being curtailed after today’s judgment,"" said Jakob Kucharczyk, Vice President, Competition & EU Regulatory Policy at CCIA.

""Unfortunately, the Court has given member states more room to thwart the Digital Single Market through restrictive, disproportionate and unjustified measures at national level.”

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday, led higher by gains among automakers after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised a considerable reduction in auto import tariffs this year.
More broadly Xi's speech helped calm investor jitters over an escalating U.S.-China trade row that roiled markets last week, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark up 0.5 percent by 0756 GMT.
The auto index (SXAP) was among the strongest, up as much as 2.1 percent with Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) leading the way.
Xi promised to open China's economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars in a speech seen as conciliatory amid rising trade tensions with Washington.
""We would see this as a major step towards opening the Chinese economy and to easing the very tense trade atmosphere... The primary beneficiaries would be German carmakers and the German economy as a whole,"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote.
According to their estimates this could lead to earnings tailwinds of up to 4.5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) for German carmakers. BMW is expected to benefit most, followed by Daimler and VW. 
Xi also said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the auto sector ""as soon as possible"" and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector.
Elsewhere mergers and acquisitions activity and earnings dominated trade. 
Bayer (DE:BAYGn) rose 4.9 percent after the WSJ reported that the U.S. Justice Department will allow the German drugs and pesticides group to acquire  Monsanto  (N:MON) in a $62.5 billion deal, after the companies agreed to sell more assets to win antitrust approval.
If confirmed the approval would remove the last major obstacle to the deal, which Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said would be highly accretive for the German group.
""If the Monsanto deal takes place, the implied portfolio change together with a potential agrochemical cycle recovery might lead to a re-rating,"" Mayer said.
LVMH (PA:LVMH) rose 4.9 percent to record highs after the Louis Vuitton owner posted better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter, helped by thriving Chinese appetite for luxury goods. Its solid update boosted shares in other luxury companies such as  Kering  (PA:PRTP), up 3.7 percent.
Higher-than-expected quarterly revenues lifted TGS Nopec (OL:TGS) up 12.9 percent to lead STOXX gainers.
Givaudan was a weak spot after the fragrance and flavor maker reported a weaker-than-expected sales increase during its first quarter despite a boost from new contract wins and acquisitions.
According to Thomson Reuters data, STOXX 600 earnings are estimated to rise 3.4 percent in the first quarter, with sales seen up 1.1 percent. Energy companies are expected to be the main drivers of growth. 
That compares to 18.5 percent earnings growth expected for the U.S.'s S&P 500 (SPX) index.

The basic resources index (SXDP) was one of the strongest sectoral gainers, up 1.8 percent, as it recovered from large losses on Monday when stocks with exposure to Russia were hit after the United States unveiled fresh sanctions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top six accounting firms will come under increased scrutiny from the audit watchdog, including checks on their top hires, after corporate scandals raised questions about the quality of book-keeping.
The Financial Reporting Council, whose effectiveness as a supervisor has also been questioned by some lawmakers, said it was introducing a ""new approach"" to supervising the ""Big Four"" - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - and the next two down, BDO and Grant Thornton.
The FRC samples their audits each year and from June will also report on checks to see how firms avoid ""systematic deficiencies"" within their networks of accountants, disruption in mandatory audits, and instability in the financial sector.
It will also look at hirings.
""We will discuss with firms how well candidates for key leadership and governance roles such as independent non-executives, heads of audit and ethics partners meet our expectations in terms of experience, skills and attributes,"" said Melanie McLaren, executive director of audit and actuarial regulation at the FRC.
Where the regulator does not have specific powers to take action, it will look for the firm's cooperation, she added.
Lawmakers have questioned the effectiveness of the FRC in holding the Big Four to account.
The FRC admitted last November that it was too slow to investigate why KPMG gave the green light to HBOS accounts just seven months before the lender had to be rescued by a competitor during the global financial crisis. Britain's business ministry is due soon to announce a review of the watchdog's powers.
Improving audit quality is a priority for the FRC as Britain prepares to leave the European Union next year, increasing the need for London to remain a global center for company listings as it faces more competition from continental financial hubs.
The FRC on Monday warned the Big Four it could fine them 10 million pounds or more for serious breaches, double its record fine to date.
The sector is waiting to see what action, if any the watchdog will take against the auditors of department store BHS, Co-operative bank, and technology firm Autonomy.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>","As sukuk disputes simmer, Islamic scholars ponder legal risks","By Bernardo Vizcaino
(Reuters) - Senior scholars in Islamic finance are exploring ways to prevent legal disputes that have roiled the industry, with new rules aiming to clarify responsibilities, while others raise the prospect of penalties for their peers.
The discussions are part of the annual sharia conference of the Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), one of the industry's top standard-setting bodies.
Sharia scholars are considered the gatekeepers of Islamic finance, vetting products and services to ensure they comply with religious principles such as bans on interest and gambling.
However, their profession is under scrutiny after a series of disputes surrounding Islamic bonds, or sukuk.
These disputes could dent the growth prospects of the sukuk market, as potential issuers could shy away from their perceived legal complexity in favor of conventional debt.
One case relates to sukuk issued by Dana Gas, which is being fought in courts in the UAE and Britain after the oil and gas firm claimed the instruments were no longer sharia-compliant.
Dana Gas is a big concern for sukuk and while scholars might not be able to stop all cases they should work their level best on preventive measures, said AAOIFI Deputy Secretary General Omar Mustafa Ansari.
""We believe that we need to serve the industry in a manner that these sort of instances can be at least prevented.""
AAOIFI has developed a comprehensive sharia standard for sukuk that is being finalised, with work underway on three accounting standards and a governance standard, said Ansari.
In the meantime, jurists are debating how to define their duties better, including whether they should be limited when an issuer of sukuk does not have an in-house sharia board.
Another concern is whether it is permissible for scholars to validate sukuk whose terms allow future amendments without proper adherence to sharia rulings.
Such issues mirror the case of Dana Gas, a firm that does not have an internal sharia board, and which last year declared unilaterally that $700 million worth of sukuk were unlawful.
A further concern is whether it is permissible to validate contracts which stipulate that a court will not refer to sharia principles in the settlement of disputes.
Dana Gas and other cases highlight the potential need to legislate work of scholars and penalties for breaches, according to a paper presented by Said Bouheraoua, director of research at the Malaysia-based International Sharia Research Academy for Islamic finance.
At present, only the central bank of Malaysia has stipulated such fines, although this requires proving breaches occurred in 'bad faith' making penalties difficult to apply, Bouheraoua added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysia Airlines has launched a fresh tender process for 20-30 widebody jets that could supersede a deal with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) agreed during a high-profile U.S. visit by the country's prime minister last year, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
Its non-binding memorandum of understanding with Boeing to buy eight long-range 787 jets, valued at $2.25 billion at list prices, had come as a surprise given that the national carrier already had an all-Airbus SE (PA:AIR) widebody fleet.
While the Boeing 787 is included in the airline's latest request for information, it has also listed the Airbus A330neo and A350 for consideration, the source with knowledge of the new widebody tender process told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
The carrier already has A330s and A350s in its fleet. 
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment.
A Malaysia Airlines spokeswoman said it was ""premature"" to comment on whether it planned to firm up the Boeing deal.
""As an airline, we constantly engage with our partners to review scenarios and options with respect to our network and fleet as a matter of course,"" she said. ""Malaysia Airlines will update once something material develops."" 
Boeing Senior Vice President Asia-Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar last month told media it was up to the government and the airline to take the lead on firming up the 787 deal. 
A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment further.
The provisional Boeing deal was announced during Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's U.S. visit in September. 
The visit, ahead of elections in Malaysia in 2018, was important for Najib as a way to show he was welcome at the White House despite a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department into a fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad that he founded.
U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Malaysia's Boeing deal but steered clear of the 1MDB probe.
Malaysia's election commission on Tuesday set May 9 as the poll date. Najib announced the dissolution of parliament on Friday, paving the way for a tough campaign where he faces off against rival Mahathir Mohamad, who last year questioned the merits of the Boeing deal in a blog post.
Malaysia Airlines has been trying to transform its operations and return to profitability as it recovers from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
The carrier's new CEO, Izham Ismail, last month said the company had issued a request for information for new generation widebody planes, without specifying the number or model type, with a request for proposal expected to follow.
The 787 deal was signed by the previous CEO Peter Bellew.
""They have flexibility to not convert the 787 MOU to a firm order if they decide it makes sense to go with Airbus for the full requirement,"" CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. 

""It's best if they limit their number of widebody types as their fleet is not that big to begin with and having just six or eight aircraft of a particular type is subscale.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Quirks in the new U.S. tax code are sowing doubts over how much big banks can boost dividends and stock buybacks this year, threatening to take the shine off what are likely to be strong quarterly profits. 
Changes in how companies can measure and apply past losses to tax bills, coupled with more extreme scenarios in the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress tests, could make it harder for lenders to secure approval in June to increase payouts. 
""The strength of first quarter results could be overshadowed by disappointing talk about capital returns,"" said analyst Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet.
Analysts expect JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) and  Citigroup  Inc, (N:C) the first, third and fourth-ranked U.S. banks by assets, to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday.
Eight years of U.S. economic growth have been a tailwind for banks, but the Fed has since 2013 made its stress test scenarios more challenging each year. The tests are meant to ensure banks have enough capital in sharp downturns to meet regulatory requirements. 
Meanwhile, the new tax law could deliver a one-two punch to capital measured in the stress tests.
After first writing down deferred tax assets to account for a lower corporate rate, banks now face being prevented from carrying back losses in stress testing to past profitable quarters to benefit from tax rebates.
Analysts are likely to push executives for details on the complex tax issues and already opaque stress tests. Lenders submitted their balance sheets for testing last week.
First-quarter net income for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup likely rose 34 percent, 5 percent and 12 percent, respectively, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
They see banks boosted by higher interest rates, stronger lending and underwriting and the 14 percentage point cut in the federal corporate tax rate.

Banks will likely see bigger reductions in projected capital levels in this year's exam, a banking industry economist said.
Chubak and the economist said they cannot estimate the extent of the capital hit without more information from the banks.
In a March 2 supervisory letter https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/files/model-change-letter-20180302.pdf, the Fed cited elimination of carrybacks as one reason the tax law could have ""material"" negative effects on some banks in this year's stress test.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in January that a key measure of capital shrank by 0.7 percentage points to 10.7 percent at Dec. 31 because of one-time tax charges, which included marking down deferred tax assets, such as credits against future taxes known as loss carryforwards.
In stress tests before the tax law change, carrybacks from losses could support capital levels and improve the odds of bigger approved buybacks. Now, more potential losses would eat into capital.
 Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) in December cited the elimination of carrybacks for reduction in its buyback plans.
To be sure, executives could flag offsets to those effects. Goldman, like other banks with profits kept overseas, picked up deferred tax liabilities for so-called repatriation taxes it booked in the fourth quarter but had not yet paid. 
Still, under changes to factors in the Fed's ""severely adverse"" economic and financial scenarios, banks could be tested against the most extreme change in conditions since the reviews began in 2009. 
In this year's test the most extreme hypothetical unemployment rate surges almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent.
The March letter also said changes to several scoring models are likely to reduce capital, with ""material effects"" in some cases.

For example, the Fed will calculate the probability of default on U.S. credit cards differently. JPMorgan and Citigroup are two big card issuers but have not discussed their outlook for payouts in light of the letter.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police said it had raided three properties as part of an alleged ""multi-million dollar corporate fraud"" involving a former supplier for the country's fourth-biggest lender, National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB).
NAB Chief Executive Officer Andrew Thorburn confirmed the raids involved a former supplier of the lender.
""This matter has been investigated by us and was reported quickly to police, and we will continue to fully cooperate with them,"" Thorburn said in a statement on the bank's website.
Thorburn added that the people being investigated ""no longer work with the bank, or are involved with us"" and that no customers were involved or affected.
The raids were conducted at two offices and a home. There were no reports of criminal charges.
While the police and NAB did not give details regarding the supplier, local media reported it was an executive projects and events consultant called Human Group and that the home belonged to its CEO Helen Rosamond.
Human Group did not respond to a Reuters telephone call, while an email to an address on its website bounced back. 
""Investigators seized large amounts of documents and electronic storage devices, which will be examined by the squad's forensic accountants,"" New South Wales police said.
Police said the raids in Sydney were in connection with a suspected scheme whereby a person would allegedly receive illicit commissions to ""authorize payments by a financial institution of invoices for a contractor, which were in excess of the agreed value of the contract"".
Human Group's website shows the company was formed in 2002 and provides ""a holistic approach to creating and managing specialized executive projects & events"".
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page and a Twitter account apparently linked to the group have been inactive since 2012 and 2015, respectively.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 02:47PM ET</span>",Facebook's Zuckerberg faces Senate hearing but little hope for action,"By Dustin Volz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's No. 1 mission during his appearance before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday will be to defend against calls to regulate internet-based companies.
The prospect of new laws that restrict Facebook and other internet companies, however, is extremely unlikely not only because of a lack of political will and the effective lobbying of technology companies but because few lawmakers want to grapple with the sheer complexity of the technical issues involved.
Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees. 
He is confronting combined outrage over how Russia used Facebook to spread divisive political propaganda during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how Facebook seemed unaware that a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested personal data of about 87 million Facebook users, most of them Americans.
Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said on Monday that while he believed new regulation was needed in the face of Facebook's twin scandals, he did not expect anything substantive to happen. 
He attributed that in part to the format for Tuesday's joint hearing before the Senate's Commerce and Judiciary committees that will give Zuckerberg an advantage, saying it would favor spectacle over thoughtful dialogue. 
""How in the world can you have 44 senators do a hearing that has a lot of substance when each senator only has four minutes?"" Nelson asked reporters on Monday. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters after speaking with 33-year-old Zuckerberg, that he ""was a very nice young man"" who ""obviously knows what he's doing and has a very pleasant personality.""
PRIVACY ADVOCATES OUTNUMBERED 
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders declined to say on Monday if new regulations were needed. “I don't have a specific policy announcement on that front, but I think we're all looking forward to that testimony.”
Republicans are generally against more corporate regulation and they are not persuaded that tech companies need more of it.  “I don’t want to hurt Facebook. I don’t want to regulate them half to death,” said Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, a member of the Judiciary Committee “But we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.” 
Companies that have been victimized by computer hacks have been accused by lawmakers of failing to take adequate security measures to protect their customers' personal information. 
Senior executives from a host of companies including  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL), United Airlines [UALCO.UL] and Equifax (N:EFX), have testified before Congress on a variety of issues including network security and walked away with little more than a scolding and a temporary dip in stock price.
Powerful lobbying forces assemble against any effort to convert public and political outrage into regulation, privacy advocates have said. Facebook spent $1.35 million on lobbying in 2011 and six years later spent $11.5 million, according to data maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics.
""People have this idea that we are going to pass omnibus privacy legislation and it is going to be a silver bullet,"" said Alvaro Bedoya, a former congressional aide who worked on privacy issues for former Senator Al Franken. ""The reality is lobbyists outnumber consumer privacy advocates in Washington 20 to 1 or 30 to 1."" 
Instead of major regulatory changes, lawmakers in Congress have offered narrowly focused legislation. 
The Honest Ads Act, for instance, aims to address concerns about foreign nationals covertly purchasing ads on social media to influence American politics. It would require political ads on the internet to reveal who paid for them, much the same as ads on television and radio. It legislation has been stalled since its introduction last October, although Facebook endorsed it on Friday.
Congress did pass legislation last month that chipped away at the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which for decades has guarded internet-based companies from liability for what users post on their platforms.
The legislation, which is expected to be signed into law this week by U.S. President Donald Trump, was aimed at penalizing operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. Internet companies have expressed worry that it could be the first step toward dismantling decades of a hands-off regulatory approach by Washington.
Technology industry officials said they also expected Zuckerberg's testimony to be long on political point scoring and short on legislative ideas.
""They don't understand ad targeting and they will probably ask him a bunch of unrelated questions that play to their respective political bases,"" said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition on anonymity because his company had not authorized him to speak on the matter for the record.

""So Democrats will ask about monopolies and Republicans will ask about anti-conservative bias in Silicon Valley.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung (KS:005930) Securities Co Ltd's (KS:016360) woes deepened on Tuesday as South Korea's biggest pension fund stopped using the broker to trade stocks in the wake of a 'fat finger' error that has prompted a huge public outcry and calls for change in the industry.
Anger over the accidental issuance of 2.8 billion shares to employees - more than 30 times the number of its outstanding shares and theoretically worth some $100 billion, has only gained momentum after it was discovered that 16 workers quickly sold off shares.
Authorities have launched an investigation into  Samsung Securities , the country's fourth biggest broker by market value, as well as into the stock trading across the sector.
""Samsung should quickly recognize this situation as a crisis. This is not just a problem of 16 employees, it is a company and industry wide issue,"" said Kim Tae-gi, an economics professor at Dankook University.
The company issued the shares in error on Friday when it was supposed to pay dividends worth 2.8 billion won to employees under a stock ownership plan, with a worker entering 'shares' instead of 'won' into a computer.
It took the firm 37 minutes to realize the error and halt trading by its employees. During that time, some employees sold off the stocks mistakenly given, ignoring warnings from the company, the Financial Supervisory Service said.
Since then, Samsung Securities stock has lost 10 percent, wiping about $330 million from its market value.
An official with the National Pension Service, the world's third-biggest pension fund, declined to disclose the volume of the fund's stock trading done through Samsung. It had 136 trillion won ($127 billion) of its assets invested in the local stock market as of January.
The fund will continue to outsource fund management to Samsung until regulators announce results of the ongoing investigation, the official added.
Financial Supervisory Service Governor Kim Ki-sik urged domestic brokerages on Tuesday to strengthen their internal control systems and work to rebuild investor trust, saying the error was a massive shock but also an opportunity to build a solid trading environment.
Over the last three days, more than a 200,000 people have signed a petition on the presidential Blue House's website, calling for employees who sold off the shares to be severely punished.

1627,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Noble Restructuring in Doubt as Elman Said to Want New Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Richard Elman, the founder and largest shareholder of Noble Group Ltd., is pushing the embattled commodities trader’s creditors for a new restructuring deal, according to people familiar with the matter, casting fresh doubt on the survival of the company.
Noble needs the support of at least half of the shareholders that vote in a special meeting for a $3.5 billion debt-for-equity restructuring plan that will all but wipe out existing equity investors. If shareholders reject the deal, the company plans to file for insolvency in London.
Elman, who resigned from the board last month due to “differences of opinion” with the firm’s directors and creditors over its future, is pushing to increase the stake that current shareholders get in Noble immediately after the restructuring to 15 percent to 20 percent, from 10 percent under the current deal, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private conversations.
The 77-year-old British executive also wants a say in the company’s future, potentially including a seat on the board, one of the people said.
Elman is pushing for a better deal for himself and others days after the Singapore’s stock market regulator criticized the restructuring plan and asked creditors to reconsider some of its proposals.
‘In Discussions’
Noble said on Monday that it’s “in discussions with shareholders and the SGX on the restructuring.” The company declined to elaborate further. It’s unclear whether Elman is talking to creditors via the company or directly.
Noble had been planning to seek irrevocable undertakings from shareholders to support the deal in mid to late March, according to a presentation published March 14. It has yet to announce any irrevocable shareholder undertakings.
The company has long said it would prefer to secure shareholder approval for the deal rather than complete the restructuring via an insolvency and administration process in the U.K. that could damage its commercial relations. As such, shareholders may have some leverage to convince management and the creditors to re-open the deal.
However, changing the share allocation under the restructuring deal may require the company to reopen discussions with its senior creditors, of which 70 percent have already agreed to the current deal, according to a company announcement on Monday.
Elman last month trimmed his stake in Noble from 18.07 percent to 17.94 percent. The sale was small but symbolic: Elman, who started Noble with $100,000 of his savings in 1986 in Hong Kong and grew it to a $10 billion giant at one point, sold shares only once previously in the company’s history, he testified in a court case last year.
The two representatives of China Investment Corp. on Noble’s board have also stepped down, suggesting that Beijing has misgivings about the restructuring plan. The sovereign wealth fund is the second-largest shareholder in Noble, with a 9.5 percent stake worth only $6 million at current prices. CIC paid $850 million for its initial investment in Noble in 2009.
The third-largest shareholder in Noble -- is already opposed to the restructuring plan. Goldilocks Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi-based fund, controls 8.1 percent of Noble. Together, the top five shareholders in Noble, which besides Elman, CIC and Goldilocks include Orbis Allan Gray Ltd and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc, control 48.5 percent of the shares.
On Tuesday, Goldilocks renewed its call for Noble Group’s shareholders to oppose the current restructuring plan, describing it as “highly prejudicial,” according to a statement. The fund said “it welcomes Mr. Elman’s position in opposition to the inequitable” restructuring support agreement.
(Updates to add comment from Goldilocks in final paragraph.)

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>","NTSB chairman, Tesla CEO talk after fatal 'Autopilot' crash","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk had a ""constructive conversation"" on the agency's probe into a fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle that was operating in semi-autonomous Autopilot mode, the agency said on Monday.
The NTSB on April 1 had said it was ""unhappy"" that luxury electric car maker Tesla (O:TSLA) had made public information about the crash of a Model X vehicle that killed the car's driver. 
NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt ""had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,"" agency spokesman Peter Knudson said. ""They discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla’s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year.""
A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.
The crash has put a sharp focus on Tesla's Autopilot technology, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free.
Tesla said a week after the accident that vehicle logs showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.
The driver, who was 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The mishap involved two other vehicles.
“The NTSB is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver’s previous concerns about the Autopilot,” Christopher O’Neil, another NTSB spokesman, said on April 1.
Last month, the company said that a search of its service records did not “find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot. There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot’s performance is unrelated to navigation.”
On March 30, Tesla disclosed that shortly before the crash, the vehicle’s “Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum.”
Sumwalt last year said that “operational limitations” in the Tesla Model S played a “major role” in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using Autopilot.
“System safeguards were lacking,” Sumwalt said in September. “Tesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.”

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating last month's crash. The two agencies are also probing a January crash of a Tesla that may have been in Autopilot mode and a fire truck.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied and the Japanese yen fell on Tuesday as Chinese President Xi Jinping's promise to cut import tariffs eased investor concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade row.
Russian assets extended Monday's slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting Russian tycoons. The Russian rouble plunged more than 4 percent against the dollar to its lowest since late-2016.
Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, Xi vowed to open China's economy, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticized isolationism in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration erupted.
Xi's comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will explode into a full-scale trade war in a blow to global growth.
European markets followed their Asian counterparts at the open with solid gains. Germany's DAX rose 1 percent, France's CAC 40 0.57 percent and Britain FTSE 100 0.41 percent. 
The U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures gained 0.93 percent.
The MSCI World Index rose 0.25 percent.
""In the current environment markets are grabbing at the slightest hint. Today's message from Xi contained nothing really new but it seemed like a conciliatory tone and so the market is just grabbing at that,"" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.
""It goes back to the fact that there is still uncertainty on trade wars and even if we get a slight indication that it won’t be the worst case scenario, the market reacts positively,"" he said, predicting ongoing trade tensions throughout 2018.
Oil markets rose by more than 1 percent on hopes that the trade dispute between the world's two-largest economies may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. Brent crude futures climbed more 1.38 percent to $69.59.
The Japanese yen, which traditionally rises in times of market stress, fell versus the dollar and euro.
The dollar rose to as high as 107.245 before giving up some of those gains and trading up 0.2 percent at 106.94.
Safe haven bond prices dropped as risk appetite recovered.
U.S. 10-year Treasuries fell, pushing their yields up 1.5 basis points to 2.8027 percent. Gold rose 0.3 percent but later gave up those gains.
The Australian dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks because of the Australian economy's exposure to global trade flows, gained against the dollar and set a three-week high versus the yen.
""President Xi has ignited a rally in risk assets that might have some legs if the U.S. can keep a lid on the protectionist rhetoric for a while,"" said Sean Callow, FX strategist for Westpac in Sydney.
RUSSIAN FALLS
Russian financial markets sold-off sharply. 
The rouble tumbled 4.2 percent, bringing its losses against the dollar since last Friday to around 10 percent. 
Rouble-denominated shares rose 0.8 percent, bouncing off multi-month lows hit on Monday when the Moscow bourse dropped 8.3 percent The shares of Rusal, the aluminum giant, which, with its boss Oleg Deripaska, was highlighted prominently in the sanctions, fell a further 7.5 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday. 
Its dollar bonds maturing 2022 were trading at record lows around 52 cents, having lost half their value since the sanctions were announced.
""It is very serious, it's very rare that you see a country literally force a company from another country towards bankruptcy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped a probe into whether former Puerto Rican officials misled investors when they sold $3.5 billion of general obligation bonds in March 2014, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Ex-Puerto Rican leaders who had been interviewed as part of the SEC's investigation received letters last week from the agency, saying the SEC would not recommend enforcement actions, said the sources.
The issuance came during the administration of ex-Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla and then-Puerto Rico Treasury Secretary Melba Acosta, as the U.S. territory slid precipitously toward bankruptcy. 
Prices on the bonds began to fall shortly after they were sold, leading the SEC to look into whether issuers painted too rosy a picture of Puerto Rico's finances. 
The probe targeted Puerto Rican officials and underwriters at  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC). 
In June, the SEC made preliminary recommendations to file enforcement actions against brokers at Barclays and Morgan Stanley, but the underwriters are now off the hook as well, the sources said. 
A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment, while a representative for Morgan Stanley could not be immediately reached on Monday night. 
The bonds, now held largely by hedge funds and mutual funds, were the last big debt issuance from Puerto Rico, which declared the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. government history in May. 
As the island was trying to restructure some $120 billion in bond and pension debt, Hurricane Maria devastated its infrastructure in September, cutting power to the entire island and causing tens of billions of dollars in damage.
Puerto Rico's GO bonds, which had traded at roughly 60 cents on the dollar, plummeted to about 20 cents after the storm. They have rebounded somewhat over the last two months, trading at just over 40 cents on Monday, according to Thomson Reuters data.
GO holders are locked in a legal battle with creditors who hold so-called COFINA debt, which is backed by the island's sales tax revenue. 
Both sides claim an ironclad right to Puerto Rico's sales tax, and a hearing on the matter is scheduled for Tuesday in New York, before U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Major Chinese real estate companies are renting more of the apartments they develop as they respond to President Xi Jinping's demand that China should produce homes to live in not to speculate on.
But currying favor with authorities who want to provide affordable housing to maintain stability in the property sector comes at a cost as the developers will make little, if any, initial return from renting. 
The net yields on rental properties for the biggest developers are only 5-6 percent, and for smaller firms with higher costs they may even be negative, according to the developers and real estate analysts. 
By contrast, the profit margins on properties that are sold have usually been clear for all to see - averaging in the 20-30 percent range in recent years. 
It isn’t just Xi and the central government that has been piling the pressure on the real estate developers.
Many cities started imposing restrictions on land sales last year, forcing developers to build some homes to rent rather than sell, making the properties much less lucrative and higher risk for companies. Not only are the companies looking at lower returns on the developments but they also have the balance sheet risks of continuing to own them. 
This is all, in turn, set to speed up market consolidation and joint bidding as companies share the costs.
Vanke, the country's No.2 developer by sales and one of the early comers to the rental market, plans to double the number of apartments it is renting out to 200,000 in 2018. 
Rental apartments ""are not supposed to make a lot of money in the first place,""  China Vanke  (HK:2202) (SZ:000002) Chairman Yu Liang said at an earnings conference late last month, adding that there has to be a balance between rental and sale markets.
He said that the rental market could be profitable in the longer term if the authorities put sufficient supportive policies in place. Local governments have recently been offering preferential lending rates and new fund-raising channels such as corporate bonds and securitization to help the rental business.
Clearly, though, the demand is there. L+Research Institute, the research unit of real estate agent Lianjia, estimated the number of tenants will reach 230 million in 2025, up from 160 million in 2015. It sees the total rental value of the Chinese market rising to 2.9 trillion yuan ($460 billion) in 2025 from 1 trillion yuan in 2015.
Lianjia also said the number of rental apartments in China grew 40 percent in 2017, compared to growth of less than 15 pct in 2015. 
China's largest developer by sales,  Country Garden  Holdings (HK:2007), which set up a rental business unit late last year and laid out an aggressive plan to own 1 million rental apartments in three years, told reporters that the business is ""tough"" for companies just getting started in the rental sector. 
Profitability from rental property is lower than from sales, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Bijun Wu said at a media lunch in February. ""But under government support, it will become a common business for the industry."" 
Not only does it take longer to collect cash from rental housing, targeting young professionals with limited incomes means landlords can't always charge the higher rents they would like, the developers and analysts say. 
Developers, such as Vanke, are mostly leasing or buying under-utilized assets such as hotels, offices and warehouses and redeveloping them into rental units as that way the returns are much higher than they would get if they bought land and built new developments.
Vanke told Reuters last year that the gross profit margin on the redevelopment work was in the 20-30 percent range, which is in line with its gross profit margin of 26.2 percent for its property development business in 2017. 
For rental apartments built from scratch, the average cost for Vanke is 300,000 yuan ($47,708.41) per unit, according to analysts, so with average rental income of 3,000 yuan a month it would take 8.3 years to pay back excluding any interest cost. 
The net yield for Vanke on the rental apartments is around 5 to 6 percent, but for developers with smaller scale it would be lower. 
""Initial yield for the business is around 4 percent, but in some bad cases it could just be breakeven"" said CLSA analyst Nicole Wong. ""If it reaches a big scale, developers can strike a good income, and also profit from a spin-off later on ... the leveraged return can then reach 8 to 9 percent."" 
The developers, though, are working on ways to pull in more investors. 
Country Garden obtained regulatory approval last month to launch 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) worth of quasi-Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), China's largest such issue so far, for its rental housing projects. 
Vanke said on Monday it plans to raise up to 8 billion yuan from the sale of rental housing bonds, while Beijing-based developer Longfor Properties (HK:0960) last month sold 3 billion yuan of such bonds, the first issue of its kind in China.
While not all developers' plans are as aggressive as these behemoths, they are still showing the kind of commitments needed to keep the authorities on side, property analysts say. 
""Some developers are doing it to show support for government policy; their project volume is not large in each city, but that small cashflow shortfall will help to get a good relationship with the city governments in the long run,"" RHB Research analyst Toni Ho said. 
Last month, state-owned China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd (HK:0688) said it will launch 3,000 to 5,000 rental units a year while Sino-Ocean Group (HK:3377) said it is targeting 100,000 rental units in 2020, up from 1,000 now. 
""It's only a start for us and not our major business yet, but we'll actively make efforts,"" Sino-Ocean chairman Li Ming said.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 06:34PM ET</span>",U.S. airline industry boasts overall improvements: study,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Despite a steady stream of headlines highlighting U.S. airlines' customer-service failures, carriers have actually improved in several key areas over the last year, including bumping fewer passengers and losing less baggage, according to a study released on Monday. 
The annual Airline Quality Rating (AQR), compiled by researchers at Wichita State and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical universities, found that U.S. carriers in 2017 recorded improvements in the number of passengers denied boarding, mishandled baggage and customer complaints, even as high-profile instances of customer-service failures continue to plague the industry. 
The study's findings showed that airlines improved their performance in everything but on-time arrivals, the most heavily weighted of the four components. In that category, there was a decline of 1.2 percent versus the previous year.
Airlines have sought to improve their public perception in the months following an April 2017 incident in which a 69-year-old United Airlines (N:UAL) passenger was dragged from his seat to make way for crew members.
""A year ago, everyone watched a video of a passenger being dragged off of a plane, and even in recent months, airlines have had to deal with negative publicity via traditional media and social media for everything from mishandled bags and extended delays to fights onboard and cancellations,"" study researcher Brent Bowen said in a statement.
""But the results of the study show that they are making the effort – even if it may seem incremental to the traveling public.""
Based on data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the AQR rated Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) the top carrier, followed closely by Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) on the basis of on-time performance, denied boarding, mishandled baggage and customer complaints. 
Ranked lowest of the 12 reported airlines were ultra-low-cost and low-cost carriers Frontier Airlines in 11th place and  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) at the bottom of the heap.
""Spirit Airlines is committed to improving reliability, Guest service, and the in-flight experience,"" Spirit Airlines spokesman Derek Dombrowski said in a statement. 
""It’s also important to note the Airline Quality Report does not factor other things that Guests love about Spirit, including the lowest fares in the industry and newest fleet of planes in the U.S.""
Frontier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Colombia's Nutresa to open 50 new restaurants this year - CEO,"BOGOTA (Reuters) -  Nutresa  (CN:NCH), Colombia's largest producer of processed foods, will invest about $94 million in the opening of 50 restaurants and ice cream parlors this year, as well as in its distribution, the company's chief executive said on Monday.    Investment planned for this year exceeds 2017's by almost 10 percent and Nutresa will also look at possible acquisitions in the 14 countries where operates, Carlos Ignacio Gallego told Reuters in a telephone interview.    
Nutresa (CN:NCH) produces processed meats, biscuits, chocolates, coffee, pasta, ice cream and owns restaurants Hamburguesas El Corral, Beer Station, Lenos & Carbon and Taco Bell, Papa John's, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Krispy Kreme franchises. It has more than 46,500 employees.    ""The consumer food business has a good dynamic, with significant growth, it is a very dynamic business where we are going to continue managing openings (...) it has enormous potential,"" Gallego said.    
The new restaurants and ice cream stores will be opened in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Central America. Gallego did not say which brand the new restaurants will belong to, but Nutresa's restaurant and ice cream parlor interests represent 8 percent of the company.    Despite moderate 2017 total revenue growth of 2.5 percent, because of a slowdown in consumption in Colombia, Gallego said the company improved its leverage profile. Colombia represents 62 percent of total sales.    
""We will continue to be very active, trying to grow in what we already have, but also exploring possible acquisitions in areas of interest,"" Gallego said. ""Since we now have a renewed purchasing capacity due to the improvement of debt indicators, it is a possibility (purchasing capacity) will increase.""    
Gallego said acquisition opportunities could include not only the purchase of entire companies but also lines of business or brands that complement the presence Nutresa already has in Chile, Peru, Central America, some regions of the United States and in Southeast Asia.    
Gallego said that although he has an ""open mind"" about raising funds from the market, he does not plan to issue any bonds in the short term.    
In 2013, Nutresa set a goal to double its total revenue to 11.9 trillion pesos ($4.2 billion) by 2020. 

""We remain firm in that goal, in 2017 we closed at 8.6 trillion pesos, there is still a gap but the goal is alive,"" he said.    ($1 = 2,791.88 Colombian pesos)

1653,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets
1. Producer Inflation to Revive Rate-Hike Expectations? 
A report on wholesale inflation will warrant close attention as it is due a day ahead of the consumer inflation report slated for Wednesday.
Inflation growth at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index is expected to have cooled to 0.1% in March from 0.2% in the prior month.
The report comes just days after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Friday continued to advocate for a gradual pace of Fed rate, citing expectations for inflation returning to target over time.
An above forecast reading could further cement expectations the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its June meeting and possibly add a fourth rate hike to its projections.
According to Investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, more than 80% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in June.
The dollar fell against a major basket of currencies weighed by a rise in the loonie amid signs of progress on North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) negotiations and an uptick in expectations that the Bank of Canada could raise rates again this year.
2. API Data, EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook Report on Tap
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) due Tuesday after data last week showed crude inventories fell sharply.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last Tuesday crude oil stockpiles fell by 3.280 million barrels.
Traders will also await the Energy Information Administration’s short-term energy outlook report Tuesday, a day ahead of its weekly supply totals data due Wednesday.
In the previous report the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that U.S. crude oil production averaged 10.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, up 230,000 bpd from the January level.
Crude oil futures made a positive start to the week settling more than 2% higher at $63.42 as easing trade-war fears, encouraged traders to pile into riskier assets.
3. Facebook’s Zuckerberg in Focus
Facebook will be closely watched on Tuesday as CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, gets his two-day Congressional hearing on the Cambridge Analytica scandal underway.
Facebook gave up some gains late Monday after Zuckerberg warned – in his prepared testimony to Congress – investment in security will have a significant impact on the social company’s profitability.
""I've directed our teams to invest so much in security – on top of the other investments we're making - that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward,” Zuckerberg said.
The ramp up in security investment comes as Facebook attempts to clean up its somewhat battered public image following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which is said to have affected as many as 87 million users.
Zuckerberg also said Monday in a Facebook blog post that the company will create an independent commission to study the effects of social media on elections.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) closed at $157.93, up just 0.46%, after hitting an intraday high of $160.53.
The broader market also pared gains on Monday following a New York Times report that the F.B.I. on Monday raided the office of President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, seizing records related to several topics including payments to a pornographic-film actress Stephanie Clifford, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump."

Trading volumes on the Czech bourse have fallen by a fifth since 2013 and stock buybacks have cut the free float of some of Prague's 13 main-market stocks, raising the risk of delistings.
PSE Chief Executive Petr Koblic said smaller exchanges like Prague have been hit by a shift toward investors trading via brokers rather than directly on the exchange since the European Union's MiFID market reform.
The exchange has also suffered from the enormous cash piles held by Czech private equity firms and from cash-rich private funds competing with investors for listed companies in recent years, he said.
Prague will launch the new START market on May 15 to attract firms valued at up to 80 million euros ($100 million) - a size that makes fundraising via IPOs costly in relation to fees but is too large for crowdfunding.
""There is this gap where companies don't have access to public markets,"" Koblic told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
""Some companies don't want to have private equity or venture capital as partners... Some companies want to stay independent, they want to grow but they need some equity.""
Prague has long sought to boost its capital markets in a country where firms have easy access to cheap bank loans. 
With market capitalization of 52.2 billion euros, the exchange is dominated by a handful of big stocks, like energy utility CEZ (PR:CEZP). 
QUARTERLY AUCTIONS
Trading will not be continuous on START but in auctions held four times a year. Four companies have already announced their intention to float and Koblic said up to 20 others are in talks. 
Unmanned aircraft maker Primoco will be one of the first to list on START and plans to build a new production facility and testing ground with the money it raises.
""We had expected to find a strategic financial investor at some point but it did not develop quickly,"" Primoco co-owner Ladislav Semetkovsky told Reuters. Traditional investors did not understand its business sector, he said. 
Other companies planning to list on START include boot maker Prabos, 3D printing material maker Fillamentum, and shared office provider Hub Ventures. 
With potential de-listings of betting group Fortuna Entertainment Group (PR:FORE) or refiner  Unipetrol  (PR:UNPE) from the main market, the new system can hardly make up for the lost trading.
Koblic said bigger companies were looking at IPOs on the main market, without giving any further details. 
In a traditional IPO, an investment bank typically underwrites the share issue, markets the new shares to investors and sets a price for the shares.
Firms taking the START route will have an adviser, typically a smaller corporate finance consultancy, but standards will be more relaxed than for the regulated market.
They will issue a simplified prospectus, which must be approved by the Czech central bank, and a law firm and an authorized analyst will conduct due diligence, but costs will be lower than in a traditional IPO.
""The advantage of START over other similar markets in Europe is minimal costs for the issuer,"" the Prague Stock Exchange said on its website.
Koblic also said some banks were not happy with START. 
""We disrupted the traditional situation,"" he said. ""But their traditional model doesn't work for a 20 million euro IPO ... So we are trying to find another model.. without the lead manager.""

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 04:52AM ET</span>",Bayer shares jump on report of U.S. antitrust deal on Monsanto,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGn) shares jumped nearly 5 percent on Tuesday following a media report that the U.S. Justice Department will allow the German drugs and pesticides group to acquire  Monsanto  (N:MON) in a $62.5 billion deal.
The Justice Department reached an agreement in principle with Bayer and Monsanto in recent days after the companies agreed to sell more assets, the Wall Street Journal said late on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
Under the deal, Bayer agreed to sell additional seed and treatment assets to BASF (DE:BASFn) and agreed to make concessions related to digital agriculture, it said.
Bayer shares rose 4.7 percent by 0800 GMT to reach a one-month high.
Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said he expects the concessions granted to the Justice Department probably did not go far beyond asset sales already agreed with the European Commission.
""The selling of these assets and the rights issue ... should start therefore soon and should be positive triggers for the stock,"" Mayer said, adding the rights issue should be smaller than initially expected.
Shares of Monsanto, the world's biggest seed company, approached a four-year high on the news in New York on Monday, before closing up 6.2 percent at $125.15.
The takeover, one of a trio of major deals in the agribusiness sector in recent years, would create a company with a share of more than a quarter of the world's seed and pesticides market. A souring global farm economy has spurred consolidation among the major players, triggering protests from environmental and farming groups worried about their market power.
The deal reduces competition for sales of seeds and chemicals to farmers struggling with low crop prices, raising the risk for price gouging, said Wenonah Hauter, executive director for Food & Water Watch, an advocacy group.
""The Justice Department's paltry divestment approach does little to address the extreme control the merged firm will have over farmers' data, genetics, biotechnology traits or the associated agrichemical industry,"" she said.
Bayer declined comment on the report, but said in a statement it still anticipated closing the Monsanto purchase in the second quarter.
BASF, Monsanto and the Justice Department declined to comment. 
Last week, Monsanto said in a quarterly earnings report that it was confident the U.S. and other needed regulatory approvals would be secured within the second quarter. Monsanto did not host its usual conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings because of the pending merger.
The Justice Department said last month that it was still reviewing the deal and noted that genetically modified seeds are largely prohibited in Europe but widely used throughout the United States. 
European Union antitrust regulators approved the deal in March after the companies agreed to sell a swathe of assets to BASF. China, Brazil and Australia have also approved the proposed merger.

The deal was preceded by a merger of Dow (N:DWDP) and Dupont and a tie-up of ChemChina [CNNCC.UL] and Syngenta.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial firms representing more than $1 trillion in assets under management have endorsed a U.S. regulator's plan to test limiting the rebates and other incentives that stock exchanges can pay to brokers, a practice critics say creates conflicts of interest.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a two-year pilot program in March that would force exchanges to lower their fees for matching aggressive buy and sell orders, as well as the rebates they pay to market makers for passive orders that add liquidity.
Southeastern Asset Management Inc, in a letter sent to the SEC and also signed by 21 other buy-side firms, laid out why it supported the program.
""The pilot will further the Commission's long-held goal of increasing market-enhancing competition among exchanges, with a focus on execution quality and service, as opposed to paying the highest rebate,"" Southeastern said in the letter to the SEC, dated April 6. 
Among the other firms signing the letter were Franklin Templeton Investments, Greenlight Capital, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP and Janus Henderson Investors.
Consumer advocates say the current pricing regime creates conflicts of interest by giving incentives for brokers to send customers' orders to the exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would obtain the best result for the end clients. 
The three main U.S. exchange operators - the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Cboe Global Markets Inc and Nasdaq Inc - had strongly opposed the plan, saying that limiting incentives to market makers would make stocks harder to trade. 
The bourses collectively pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, which they say compensate market makers for the risks of providing liquidity.
Currently, the fees exchanges can charge for trades they execute are capped at 30 cents per 100 shares. Rebates, which not all exchanges pay, are generally in line with the fee cap.

The SEC is currently seeking public comments on the ""access fee pilot,"" and will then decide whether to go ahead with the plan in its present form, as Southeastern has requested.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2018 04:23AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. watchdog seeks record fine against Wells Fargo for abuses - sources,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. watchdog for consumer finance is seeking a record fine against  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co that could exceed several hundred million dollars for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses, according to three sources with knowledge of the plans.
The penalty would be the first issued by Mick Mulvaney, whom President Donald Trump tapped in November to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
The fine would fulfill Trump's vow to come down hard on the country's third-largest lender, which has been grappling with a sales practices scandal since September 2016.
The CFPB is readying sanctions alongside the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo's day-to-day regulator. The agencies are ready to sanction Wells Fargo for layering extra insurance on drivers and collecting commissions on those policies, Reuters reported last month.
Both agencies have also been investigating the bank for wrongly levying fees on mortgage borrowers.
Mulvaney is eyeing a penalty that would settle both those matters and dwarf the $100 million the CFPB fined Wells Fargo in September 2016 to settle its phony accounts scandal, said the sources familiar with the talks. That 2016 fine had been the CFPB's largest ever. 
Settlement terms have not been finalized but Mulvaney is pushing for a figure as high as $1 billion, said three people with knowledge of the discussions. 
A stiff penalty against Wells Fargo could burnish Mulvaney's image as a tough regulator even as his agency has dropped cases against at least two payday lenders.
Mulvaney has said the CFPB has gone too far in policing industry in the past but that abuses do exist.
""I think you're being naïve if you think there aren't folks out there who are breaking consumer financial protection laws,"" Mulvaney told an industry meeting last month.
The OCC and Wells Fargo declined to comment. A spokesman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. 
Lawmakers will get a chance to question Mulvaney about the settlement talks at two separate hearings in Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Wells Fargo is due to report earnings on Friday and some officials hoped to have a deal by then.
Mulvaney was asked about the Wells Fargo matter at an industry event on Monday and declined to comment.
In the case of Wells Fargo and auto insurance, agency lawyers have raised concerns about how different customers received different treatment from the bank.
Drivers who financed a car through a dealer could be pushed into insurance if Wells Fargo suspected a policy had lapsed. Drivers who went directly to the bank for a loan were not subject to such ""force-place"" insurance after 2011, the bank has said.
The bank has also said it did not monitor insurance for borrowers with high credit scores. Borrowers with lower credit scores could get pushed into force-placed insurance.
Lawyers are debating whether the bank should pay a higher fine for the uneven treatment of customers, the sources said.

Trump had pledged tough penalties for Wells Fargo after Reuters reported in December that Mulvaney put the mortgage-lending abuse sanctions on ice.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank's new CEO takes sober look at 'ugly' investment bank,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) new chief executive faces the same strategic problem that has long preoccupied its top management - whether or not to override the rainmakers and big earners at its powerful investment bank to shrink that business.
Christian Sewing's appointment as chief executive on Sunday and the abrupt departure of his predecessor John Cryan holds out the prospect of radical change at Germany's flagship lender, which has been slower than rivals to reform after the financial crash. 
Sewing expects to complete an initial review of Deutsche's investment bank within weeks, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, but any overhaul he launches is likely to take much longer.
""They've had to come around and painfully admit their investment banking baby is quite ugly,"" said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy Opimas. ""That’s an emotional issue for them.""
The debate over the investment bank's future heated up over the past two weeks as  Deutsche Bank  Chairman Paul Achleitner intensified a search for a CEO to replace Cryan, the Briton he had installed less than three years ago to clean up the bank.
Deutsche is already in the middle of a global review of the investment bank, known internally as Project Colombo, to determine the way forward as revenues shrink and clients and staff leave. 
The appointment of Sewing - with a background in retail banking, auditing and risk - along with the resignation of one of Deutsche's top investment bankers, Marcus Schenck, suggests a shift away from the investment bank, analysts and investors say.
The 47-year-old CEO warned staff on Monday of tough decisions ahead. ""The time pressure is on and the expectations are high from all sides,"" Sewing wrote in a letter to staff.
But it will be hard to reverse the investment bank's drive to compete with Wall Street that dates back to the 1990s. Employees say it resulted in the creation of fiefdoms and rivalries that proved difficult for any CEO to control.
The investment bank debate is tricky for Sewing because he is not an investment banker. He joined Deutsche out of school at age 19 at a branch in Bielefeld in north-west of Germany. He was crowned CEO in a hastily arranged board call late on Sunday. 
The bank's major shareholders and top managers are also divided over how to proceed, with some favoring further investment in investment banking and others retrenchment.
Some analysts have said that even modest exits from specific business areas could erode revenues at the investment bank, which generates just over half the group's total.
The future of the investment bank is just one of many problems for Sewing, the third head of the bank in six years. He also has to tackle high costs, heavy losses and stiff competition in Germany's crowded banking market.
Peter Nerby, who analyses Deutsche for credit rating agency Moody's, pointed to tough competition among numerous international banks, asking ""whether there's enough food for everyone"".
That view was echoed elsewhere. Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, said Deutsche should focus on German companies overseas: ""Without the investment bank, Deutsche Bank would be much more reliable and profitable.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said in a research note that Deutsche Bank should shrink its U.S. investment banking business to create shareholder value.
Schenck, the investment bank co-head, had wanted to expand it, but Achleitner, in an interview with the the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Monday said: ""The bank didn't currently support that effort."" 
Sewing has hinted he is open to a smaller investment bank in his staff memo on Monday, saying ""we'll have to further adapt our revenue, cost and capital structure"".
Some in Germany would welcome a return to Deutche Bank's roots - it was founded during the Industrial Revolution to finance German firms' expansion overseas.
""He has a huge task ahead of him that has big significance for Germany and our export orientated industry,"" Carsten Schneider, a prominent lawmaker from Germany's governing Social Democrats, told Reuters.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>",WPP CEO Sorrell could learn his fate next week,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - WPP founder Martin Sorrell could find out as early as next week whether he can remain at the helm of the world's biggest advertising company but is likely to struggle to work with its board even if he is cleared of wrongdoing, sources said.
WPP (L:WPP) sent shockwaves through the industry last week when it said it was investigating alleged misconduct by Sorrell, raising the prospect that the 73-year-old could step down after more than 30 years in charge. Sorrell denies the allegations.
A source close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity said the result of the investigation by independent counsel was likely to come next week.
However a second source who is familiar with Sorrell's thinking questioned whether it would be business as usual if the CEO was exonerated because he is unhappy about how the situation has been handled.
""When there is a family bust up life is never the same again,"" the second source said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. ""Kissing and making up would seem to be a very challenging concept after this."" 
WPP declined to comment. 
The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into the world's biggest advertising group by three decades of relentless dealmaking and is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in Britain.
In his time the group has expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers and market-research and public relations groups such as Finsbury.
Present in 112 countries and employing more than 200,000 people, WPP provides services to clients including Ford,  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), P&G and a string of major corporations. 
BREAKING UP THE BUSINESS?
It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom (N:OMC), Publicis (PA:PUBP) and IPG (N:IPG) in the years that followed the financial crisis but it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in consumer spending from some of its biggest clients.
Its shares are down around 30 percent this year, with the growing migration of advertising online also adding to the challenges facing the industry. 
""It won't be this week, it could be as soon as next,"" the first person said on the timing of the investigation. 
The uncertainty about Sorrell's future has renewed speculation as to who would take over the top job if he left and whether the group would remain in its current form.
Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its data management arm which provides market research to clients. Analysts at Liberum have valued the asset at around 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion), compared with WPP's current market valuation of 14.6 billion pounds. 
In the past the WPP management has said that although the data management arm has recorded lower growth rates, it is attractive to clients who want to see the impact of their media spending, making it aligned with the rest of the group.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 07:07PM ET</span>",Canada explores options as Kinder Morgan halts pipeline work,"By Allison Lampert and John Benny
MONTREAL/BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Canadian government on Monday said it was considering all its options on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, including a possible investment of public funds to ensure construction goes ahead, after  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Canada halted most work on the project and set a May 31 deadline to scrap the plan.
Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, when asked whether the federal government would invest in the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: ""We are looking at all options -- that’s on the table. We’re not ruling anything out. We are doing an assessment of what might be necessary, working with the government of Alberta.""
Carr's comments follow Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's pledge on Sunday that the oil-rich province was prepared to invest in the pipeline to ensure the project moves ahead.
Kinder Morgan Canada said on Sunday that it would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of its existing Trans Mountain pipeline, which extends from Alberta to British Columbia's coast, unless various legal and jurisdictional challenges could be resolved by May 31.
The project was approved by the federal government in 2016, but that approval is being challenged in court by First Nation groups and local municipalities, and British Columbia is eyeing whether it has jurisdiction to block increased oil shipments through its territory.
To go ahead, the company needs more certainty, said Kinder Morgan's Chief Executive Steve Kean in a conference call on Monday, which could mean ""some kind of preemptive action"" to make clear Canada's jurisdiction over the project. 
If the project is ultimately canceled, then the company would evaluate any write-off in the second quarter, he added. 
Shares of Kinder Morgan Canada, spun off by its U.S. parent to raise funds for the project a year ago, fell as much as 19 percent to their lowest since its listing. The shares pared some losses but still ended down 12.58 percent at C$16.12. 
The 1,147-kilometer (712 mile) pipeline is considered crucial to Canadian oil producers, who are desperate to access new overseas markets. Canada sends the majority of its energy products to the United States. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, when asked by reporters on Monday in Montreal, reiterated that the pipeline would be built.
For a story on the Canada's options:
On Monday, Notley said she was still very hopeful a solution could be found, citing the risks of an imminent constitutional crisis.
CRUDE PRICES
Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said that not increasing pipeline capacity had the potential to knock C$10 billion ($7.9 billion) off wealth generation in Canada annually by adding to a sustained discount for the country's crude oil.
Canadian crude trades at a discount to the U.S. oil benchmark, with tight pipeline and rail capacity sending the Western Canadian Select differential sharply wider than normal earlier this year. It was trading at $16.25 on Monday, according to Shorcan Energy brokers.
The pipeline dispute spurred business lobby groups to ask the federal government to clear up the uncertainty.
""The Trans Mountain Expansion is in the national interest and if it fails to move forward, it will send a strong negative signal to investors at home and abroad that we, as a country, are not open for business,"" said Perrin Beatty, President and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

“There is a trend here we can’t ignore in my mind, so I don’t discount it,” Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive officer, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “People put more faith in a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto that no one has ever met than they do in the U.S. Fed,” he said, referring to the founder of bitcoin.
Dozens of small exchanges have mushroomed in recent years to capitalize on the growing popularity of trading crypto assets even as theft and regulatory scrutiny curb some of the initial enthusiasm. Traditional exchange operators have rolled out offerings for their own customers to capitalize on the price volatility.
In December, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) and Cboe Global Markets Inc. started futures contract on bitcoin, while Nasdaq Inc. is also considering introducing them.
“People are more comfortable in technology than the institutions of government and society that I grew up with,” Sprecher said.

Ma, speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in China's southern Hainan province, was asked about privacy issues that have dogged Facebook in recent weeks after it said the personal information of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
""The senior management should take responsibility, say, hey, from now we start to work on it,"" Ma said after initially refraining from weighing in on the issue.
""I will not make a comment about Facebook, but I will say, Facebook, 15 years ago, they never expected this thing to grow like that,"" he said.
""Right, it's like a social network, it's got two billion people using it! So all of the problems they did not realize came up! It is the time we fix it,"" he said.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Column: U.S. sanctions on Rusal threaten aluminum turmoil: Andy Home,"By Andy Home
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs on imports have already roiled the aluminum market.
U.S. sanctions on Oleg Deripaska and his companies are going to cause even more turmoil, given they encompass Rusal, which produces around 6 percent of the world's aluminum.
Deripaska was on the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions list, covering seven Russian oligarchs, 12 of their companies, 17 Russian government officials, a weapons trading company and a bank.
The aluminum market has already reacted. 
The London Metal Exchange price has jumped from a Friday low of $1,987 per tonne to a high on Monday morning of $2,144. 
U.S. physical premiums are surging again, with the CME May contract spiking to 18.0 cents/lb on Friday, exceeding the previous tariff-fuelled peak. 
This may just be the start as the market collectively tries to figure out what happens next to one of the biggest sources of trading liquidity in the global aluminum market.
SHARE PRICE HIT
The first casualties of Deripaska's inclusion on the U.S. Treasury's sanction list announced on Friday have been the share prices of EN+ and Rusal. 
EN+ Group, Deripaska's London-listed holding vehicle, has dropped 48 percent since its Friday opening. 
It holds a 48.13 percent stake in United Company Rusal, which has experienced a similar-sized collapse in its Hong Kong-listed share price. 
Both companies have warned of the sanctions that ""it is highly likely that the impact may be materially adverse to the business and prospects of the Group"".
Rusal has added the U.S. action ""may result in technical defaults in relation to certain credit obligations of the group"".
A BIG PHYSICAL SHORT?
If import tariffs started closing the door on the flow of Russian aluminum to the United States, sanctions have just slammed it shut. 
Russia was the second-largest supplier of unwrought aluminum to the U.S. market last year, accounting for almost 700,000 tonnes of the country's total imports of 5 million tonnes, according to the International Trade Centre. 
Russia has not made it onto the list of countries winning exemptions from the 10 percent import tariff, unsurprisingly since it was one of five countries identified as either benefiting from state subsidy or being a ""potentially unreliable"" partner. 
The Midwest U.S. aluminum premium has been a useful market barometer of tariff politics in the last few weeks and has shot higher again. 
Since, to quote the Treasury Department, ""U.S. citizens are generally prohibited from dealings with"" sanctioned entities, the local aluminum market would seem to be several hundred thousand tonnes physically short of units. 
The effects of these sanctions, however, extend far and beyond the United States. 
That's because, again to quote the Treasury Department, ""non-U.S. persons could face sanctions for knowingly facilitating significant transactions for or on behalf of the individuals or entities blocked today"".
That poses a specific question of resources giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), which is an 8.75 percent shareholder in Rusal and the market outlet for much of its commodity-grade metal. 
Indeed, Rusal's accounts state that last year sales of primary aluminum and alloys to Glencore were $2.431 billion out of total segment sales of $8.324 billion. 
How Glencore handles the sanctioning of one of its core suppliers is a key unknown in the current equation. 
The broader question is how many others in the supply chain will be happy to continue taking Rusal material. What is a ""significant transaction""? 
The question will take on extra sensitivity in those countries that are simultaneously lobbying the U.S. administration for exemptions to the new aluminum tariffs. 
In just about every other industrial metals market, the metal displaced from the United States and, possibly, other countries would most likely wash up on China's shores. 
It is, after all, the world's largest buyer of most things metallic. 
Just not aluminum, because China itself is the world's largest producer and indeed one of the targets of the U.S. import tariffs because of its exports of semi-manufactured products. 
SHIFTING LME SPREADS, SHIFTING OWNERSHIP?
Well, there's always the market of last resort, the London Metal Exchange (LME). 
Except that here too the ramifications of sanctions are making an impact. 
A significant part of the LME's aluminum stocks may be Rusal brand. 
As of the end of March 2017, the most recent annual update from the LME, metal from ""Eastern Europe"" accounted for 44 percent of total aluminum stocks. 
The percentage has probably gone down since then and the LME has said it has no immediate plans to change the listing. 
""It is for individual stakeholders on the LME to determine if particular brands are acceptable for their use given their legal or regulatory framework,"" the exchange said in a statement.
""Individual stakeholders"" may already have made their determinations, judging by some sharp shifts in time-spreads on Monday. 
""Tom-next"", the cost of rolling a position from Tuesday to Wednesday, whipped into a $4-per-tonne backwardation on Monday morning. 
The three-months-to-December-18 spread has tightened from a contango of $18.00 at Friday's close to a current $11.00 per tonne. 
Such time-spread action suggests some large positions are being shifted around. 
U.S. players are likely looking to offload any exposure to Russian aluminum, but, in the absence of a lack of legal clarity at this stage, there may be plenty of non-U.S. entities doing the same on a ""just in case"" basis. 
Meanwhile, bank compliance officers will no doubt be scrutinizing the Russian aluminum that is being stored in off-market warehouses. 
Will banks financing these deals now insist on the metal being re-warranted in LME warehouses for security? Should the market expect an influx of aluminum? 
Or will traders grab as much of the non-Rusal stock in the LME system and move this more marketable and valuable metal off market? 
Answers on a postcard at this stage. 
SHOCKWAVES
There's only one historical precedent for this in the aluminum market: the U.S. sanctions against Iranian producer Iralco imposed in 2012. 
But Iran was never as large a producer of aluminum as Rusal and the amount of stock in the LME system wasn't anywhere near as significant. 
At the very least these sanctions are going to cause major changes in physical aluminum flows around the world, which is why the Midwest U.S. premium is on a charge. 
But the way the more international LME contract is behaving suggests the shocks may be more global.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes rose on Monday as a softer stance by U.S. policymakers on China tariffs powered a rebound from last week's selloff, but stocks pared much of their gains late in the session after a report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the office of President Donald Trump's lawyer.
Technology and health stocks led the benchmark S&P 500's major sectors. Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK) was the biggest boost to the Dow, while gains in Apple (O:AAPL) shares led the Nasdaq index.
Stocks climbed after Trump's new economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC that the president may be open to forming an international coalition to grapple with trade issues involving China.
Investors will look for further signs of China's stance on trade relations when Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the Boao Forum economic conference on Tuesday.
But stocks began paring gains late in the afternoon, a downward trend that accelerated after a report that the FBI had raided the New York office of Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, upon a referral by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
""Even if it ultimately ends up being nothing, the initial reaction is almost always negative in the market,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) in Austin, Texas.
Investors are looking forward to the start of earnings season to provide a sustained lift to U.S. stocks, with big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), set to report first-quarter results on Friday.
Analysts expect quarterly profits for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, which would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 46.34 points, or 0.19 percent, to 23,979.10, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 8.69 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,613.16 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 35.23 points, or 0.51 percent, to 6,950.34.  AveXis Inc  (O:AVXS) rose 81.6 percent after Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (S:NOVN) offered to buy the gene therapy company for $8.7 billion.
Merck shares rose 5.2 percent after the drugmaker's blockbuster cancer drug, Keytruda, met the main study goal of helping previously untreated lung cancer patients live longer.
Shares of Leucadia National Corp (N:LUK) jumped 11.6 percent after the company said it would sell most of its non-financial assets to focus on investment banking and advisory services.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.13-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.28 billion shares, compared to the 7.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 10:34AM ET</span>",Merck's Keytruda helps lung cancer patients live longer in trial,"By Tamara Mathias
(Reuters) - Merck & Co's (N:MRK) blockbuster drug Keytruda helped previously untreated lung cancer patients live longer in a late-stage trial, potentially cementing its position as the dominant player in the lucrative lung cancer market.
Shares of the drugmaker were up 3.1 percent at $55.07.
Merck is already considered the frontrunner in the space and Keytruda is expected to earn peak sales of over $10 billion in 2023, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Keytruda is already approved in the U.S. to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior therapies and whose tumors show PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater.
If the company can show that the new data benefits patients whose PD-L1 expression is between 1 and 49 percent, it would expand Keytruda's market and raise the competitive benchmark for rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY) and AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN), BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said.
An independent data monitoring committee determined the trial, which tested Keytruda as a monotherapy to treat NSCLC, extended the lives of patients significantly compared to chemotherapy.
Additional data from Merck, as well as results from trials of competitors, could eventually determine which companies will snatch the largest slice of the pie for the lung cancer market.
""I think the market still believes that there could be other players in the lung cancer market, which would combat overall sales of Keytruda in this setting,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters. 
""Because we don't know the full data set we don't know the survival benefit here.""
Based on a recommendation from the committee, the trial will continue to evaluate a secondary goal on whether the treatment can delay the disease from progressing.
""While it is still unclear whether Keytruda and (Bristol-Myers') Opdivo are truly different in some way, it is crystal clear that Merck has done a much better job designing trials and developing their drug. This will solidify their lead,"" said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. 
Keytruda, which is approved to treat several other forms of cancer including skin and blood cancer, racked up $3.81 billion in revenue in 2017. 
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and is expected to kill over 154,000 people this year, the American Cancer Society says. NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of all lung cancer cases, Merck said. 

Shares of Bristol-Myers fell 2.3 percent to $59.43.

(Reuters) -  SandRidge Energy  Inc (N:SD) said on Monday it would evaluate any offer to buy the company from top shareholder Carl Icahn after the hedge fund manager said he could pay cash to buy the U.S. shale oil producer.
One of the best known of the hedge fund world's aggressive activist players who seek major changes in company strategies, Icahn has been railing against the Oklahoma-based company's management for months.
In a statement on Monday, SandRidge said that it would look at alternatives to its current strategy and would also evaluate ""credible"" offers for the company, including any offer from Icahn Capital. 
""To date, Icahn Capital has rejected SandRidge's offer to participate in this process on the same fair basis as other interested parties,"" it said.
Icahn did not immediately return a request for comment.
SandRidge shares rose about 3.7 percent in midday Monday trading. They have fallen nearly 15 percent since Icahn reported his stake on Nov. 21.
Last week Icahn said he planned to nominate directors who would push for a sale of SandRidge and said he was willing to make an all-cash offer to buy the company in a formal process seeking a buyer.
SandRidge said it had offered Icahn the opportunity to submit qualified, independent candidates for the board's consideration ""on more than one occasion"" adding that none had been put forth. 
The deadline for shareholders to propose board nominees is April 16.
SandRidge has made changes in recent months after some prodding by Icahn. In February, it ousted both its chief executive and finance chief. Icahn, who holds a 13.5 percent stake, also persuaded SandRidge to back out of a $746 million deal to acquire  Bonanza Creek Energy Inc  (N:BCEI) last year. 
SandRidge came out of bankruptcy in late 2016, overcoming opposition from shareholders who had accused the oil and gas producer of misrepresenting its value.
SandRidge had previously rejected Icahn's demand to replace two directors and the removal of a ""poison pill"" measure preventing individual shareholders from amassing more than a 10 percent stake in the company's stock.

Icahn last month persuaded Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL) to appoint four directors to its board, and before that opposed Xerox Corp's (N:XRX) plan to sell itself to Fujifilm Holdings (T:4901).

The aluminum producer is investigating the consequences of the sanctions and doesn’t waive its right to the payments, according to a copy of a letter dated April 6 and signed by Rusal’s Head of Marketing Steve Hodgson. His division handles international sales, which account for about 80 percent of the company’s business.
“We request that you immediately withhold all payments and remittances to UC Rusal until further notice,” the company said in the letter. “We are working intensively to ensure continuity of our business.”
Rusal was among Russian companies included in a list that the U.S. hit with sanctions on Friday that were intended to punish the country for actions in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria, and attempting to subvert Western democracies.
U.S. operations of sanctioned companies are now frozen and Americans mostly barred from dealing with them, while others outside the U.S. will be punished for carrying out significant transactions with the businesses.
Rusal (HK:0486) shares fell 50 percent to HK$2.32 on Monday, according to pricing from the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. website. Aluminum prices jumped the most since 2015, climbing 4.4 percent to $2,131 a metric ton as of 1:24 p.m. in London."

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>","HSBC to expand further in China, cut red tape under new management team","LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) will seek to cut internal bureaucracy and expand investment in China's southern region to the rest of the country, executives at the bank said on Monday, in the first hints of the strategy to be pursued by its new leadership duo.
Mark Tucker, the bank's first externally appointed chairman, told analysts and investors at a meeting in Hong Kong that trimming the bank's bloated governance structure was one of his top priorities.
Tucker, who took over as chairman last October, has already cut the lender's board from over 20 people down to 14 and plans to slash more committees and processes, according to analysts present at the meeting.
The presentation, meanwhile, offered the first sign for investors that the bank's new Chief Executive John Flint will double down on HSBC's 'pivot' to Asia and China in particular, despite some setbacks in the plan launched in June 2015. 
HSBC said at that time it would hire 4,000 new staff and invest billions to make the Pearl River Delta its gateway to China, a retail and corporate banking push that bet on a tech boom, infrastructure spending and a growing middle class.
But the presentation to investors on Monday showed the bank's profits in mainland China retail banking in 2017 fell by 7 percent compared with a year earlier.
Chinese regulations that stipulate customers must visit a branch to open an account have slowed HSBC's technology-based push, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said, since the lender only has 227 outlets in China versus local banks that have thousands each.
The presentation gives the clearest indication yet that HSBC's new management team will intensify its focus on China, betting on the country's economic growth to bolster profits that have sagged in recent years amid low global interest rates, restructuring costs and ever-tighter regulation.

Tucker said investors would get a fuller picture of CEO Flint's new strategy before the bank announces its first-half results in July, analysts at the meeting reported.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) will be among the biggest winners from the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian aluminum giant United Company Rusal as the penalties further shake up the global metals trade and boost costs for U.S. consumers, industry sources said on Monday.
The United States on Friday imposed the sanctions against businessmen, companies and government officials that are considered associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities.
Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, and its former President Oleg Deripaska were included on the list. Rusal said the sanctions ""may be materially adverse to the business and prospects of the group."" Shares plunged 50 percent in Hong Kong on Monday.
Traders and analysts said the sanctions would accelerate a rerouting of global aluminum shipments that began last month after the U.S. imposed a 10 percent duty on aluminum imports under the so-called ""Section 232"" of U.S. trade laws.
""It probably reroutes a lot of the trade flows,"" said analyst Daniel Morgan at UBS in Sydney. ""It is beneficial if you are a producer that is (compliant with the section 232 tariffs) because you’ve got an ability to sell into the U.S. and other markets.""
After U.S. President Donald Trump announced the tariffs, he later exempted the European Union and other trading partners including Canada and Australia until May.
The new sanctions on Rusal would disrupt unwrought Russian aluminum imports, which in 2017 were 695,778 tonnes out of a total of about 5 million tonnes, according to the International Trade Centre (ITC).
Rio Tinto would be well placed to replace that metal with any unsold metal if the sanctions stuck, Paul Adkins, managing director of consultancy AZ China said. Rio Tinto declined to comment.
The company produced 3.6 million tonnes of aluminum last year from its operations including in Canada and Australia, which are exempted from the section 232 tariffs.
""All this does is make things more expensive for Americans,"" said one aluminum trader in Singapore. ""Everyone who has a duty free exemption is laughing.""
U.S. aluminum premiums traded at 18.4 cents per pound, or about $405 per tonne on top of futures prices. Those premiums are expected to climb.
""Overall, it should be near-term bullish for the premium and price,"" said another physical metal trader in Singapore.
Rising premiums could draw more Chinese aluminum to the U.S. since the additional cost of the section 232 tariff is less than the U.S. premium, said AZ China's Adkins.
A source at a Japanese aluminum fabricator said his company does not plan to change its supply contract with Rusal since it buys not only refined aluminum but also semi-customized products and can not find easy substitutes.
However, if their customers, such as automakers, decide to follow the U.S. sanctions, then the company may have to think twice about buying metal from Rusal, he said.
