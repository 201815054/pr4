Verizon last week said that Armstrong was in talks to leave Oath.
Gowrappan, currently Oath's chief operating officer, will be taking the top job on Oct. 1, Verizon said.
Gowrappan joined Oath from  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) early this year.
Armstrong came to Verizon in 2015 following its takeover of AOL and headed Oath, which was created last year after the No.1 U.S. telecom company acquired the core business of Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and merged it with AOL.

Oath owns more than 50 brands, including HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr, but has failed to make an impact in the space occupied by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","BDCs can hold risk without violating Dodd-Frank rules, SEC says","By Kristen Haunss
NEW YORK (LPC) - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that Business Development Companies (BDCs) will be able to hold a portion of a Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) without violating rules governing closed-end funds.
BDCs, which typically lend to privately-owned US mid-sized companies, previously used CLOs as a financing mechanism, often a cheaper option than raising a loan. But risk-retention rules that took effect in December 2016 threw that method into question as regulations governing these funds prohibit advisers from selling securities to the BDC.
The decision, offered September 7 in the form of a no-action letter in response to law firm Dechert on behalf of Golub Capital, opens the door for an increase in issuance by seamlessly allowing managers to transition loans from their BDC into a CLO and passing the retention though the adviser and back into the BDC.
“This is a major development,” said Deborah Festa, head of law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy’s West Coast securitization and investment management practices. “The results should be a significant increase in middle market CLO activity by BDCs that are able to originate all of the loans acquired by their CLOs.”
Last year, LPC reported that participants in the US$560bn US CLO market had reached out to the SEC for guidance on the issue. 
David Golub, chief executive officer of Golub Capital BDC, and an SEC spokesperson both declined to comment.
CLO RETENTION LAWSUIT
Dodd-Frank, a sweeping package of rules signed into law in 2010 in response to the credit crisis, includes risk-retention rules that force managers to hold 5% of their funds. 
The US loan trade association, the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA), won a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve and SEC arguing the risk-retention rules were not applicable because managers of CLOs that own broadly syndicated loans do not transfer assets.
Regulators did not appeal the decision.

Broadly syndicated CLOs sell tranches of varying risk to investors backed by a pool of loans made to large US companies, including American Airlines and retailer Party City.

London-based Sky has been at the center of a bidding war, which points to a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Comcast, the world's biggest entertainment group, had countered Rupert Murdoch-controlled Fox's raised offer for Sky in July - within just a few hours - with an offer that valued London-listed Sky at $34 billion.
Nasdaq-listed Comcast said on Wednesday that Sky shareholders now have until Oct. 6 to accept its offer and the valid acceptances rose slightly to 0.29 percent from 0.21 percent reported in August.
Shares in Sky, which is 39 percent owned by Fox, have roughly doubled to 15.45 pounds from the 7.81 pounds they were trading at when Fox offered to buy the rest of the company in December, 2016.
Comcast's current offer, higher than Fox's 14 pound-a-share bid, has been recommended to shareholders by Sky's independent directors. 

Fox currently has just ten days from now to trump Comcast's offer for Sky under British takeover rules.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 01:13PM ET</span>",Boeing 737 recovery plan 'taking hold' amid factory snarl: CEO,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co expects to deliver roughly as many 737 narrowbody jetliners in September as the company delivered in August as it works to bounce back from a manufacturing logjam triggered by supplier delays, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Boeing's August delivery of 48 narrowbody aircraft, announced on Tuesday, was an improvement over the 29 delivered in July, which was one of its lowest monthly tallies in years. 
""Our recovery actions are taking hold,"" Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told a conference in California. ""You'll probably see September deliveries will be roughly where August was, maybe a little bit better."" 
""As we get into the fourth quarter, you will see deliveries getting above the 52 per month production rate,"" Muilenburg added.
Boeing shares were up 2.6 percent to $354.43 in mid-day trading.
Boeing's hot-selling 737 and the Airbus A320 family of single-aisle jetliners are the cash cows of the two aircraft makers, the world's largest. 
The snarl at Boeing's Seattle-area narrowbody plant, fueled by shortages of engines and fuselages as Boeing sped production to record levels in June, is likely to hurt third-quarter results and threatens to hinder its efforts to boost build-rates again in 2019, some analysts said.
Boeing is committed to boosting production even further in 2019 to 57 planes per month despite parts shortages and delays, Muilenburg said, adding that ""every step of the way ... we are going to be bringing our supply chain along."" 
Muilenburg's comments come as Boeing's 787 widebody assembly plant in North Charleston, South Carolina remained shuttered for a second day due to the threat of Hurricane Florence. A Boeing spokeswoman said operations remained suspended on Wednesday with no guidance on when production would resume.
""We've seen a few normal supply chain pressures on 787,"" Muilenburg said, citing seats. ""We are very firm on our year-end guidance on 787.""
Boeing's CEO also said the company was on track to bring the 777X widebody into service in 2020 despite engine snags, and the company was making good progress building the business case for a possible new mid-market jet, one of its most significant decisions in years. 
Muilenburg said rising global trade tensions have not yet had a material impact on Boeing's business.
""While the trade rhetoric continues, the tariff rhetoric continues ... nothing here is going to create a sudden change in profile or deliveries or orders volume,"" Muilenburg said. ""It's more of a long-term issue.""

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell on Wednesday, weighed down by a drop in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on fears of further regulation, while a rise in energy stocks and a report of fresh U.S.-China trade talks helped keep the S&P afloat and boost Dow Industrials.
Six major web and internet service companies, including Apple, are to detail their consumer data privacy practices to a U.S. Senate panel on Sept. 26, raising the specter of the possibility of stricter regulation.
Apple was down 1 percent, weighing the most on the three major indexes. The stock was trading higher premarket, ahead of an event at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) where the company is expected to launch new iPhone models as well as upgrades of other products.
Twitter, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), among the six companies to testify, were trading between flat and down 4.2 percent.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), not among the companies to testify, was down 2 percent. The S&P technology sector fell 0.64 percent.
""Headlines like the Senate hearing does add this element of regulatory risk to Apple and Amazon which is what could be driving them lower right now,"" said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania.
The markets got a boost from a Wall Street Journal report that said Washington has proposed a new round of trade talks with Beijing before the Trump administration implements additional tariffs on Chinese imports.
Also helping was the energy sector, which jumped 0.70 percent as Brent crude price pushed above $80 a barrel due to growing concerns over global oil supply. [O/R]
At 12:41 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 91.95 points, or 0.35 percent, at 26,063.01, the S&P 500 was down 0.60 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,887.29 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.20 points, or 0.48 percent, at 7,934.28.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 1.8 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the latest brokerage to warn of lower prices for memory chips due to an oversupply of DRAM and NAND chips.
Micron slid 5 percent, the most on the S&P. Chip equipment makers were hit the hardest, falling in a range of Applied Materials' 2 percent drop and Entegris's 4.4 percent decline.
The consumer staples sector rose 1.20 percent as Altria (NYSE:MO) jumped 7.2 percent and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) gained 4 percent.
Traders said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's proposed ban on flavored e-cigarettes was less harsh than feared.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and others will be in focus on Sept. 24 when they are moved out of the tech and consumer discretionary sectors into a deepened pool of communication and media stocks. 
In the largest-ever shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), the telecommunication services sector will be renamed ""communication services"" and include 18 companies pulled from consumer discretionary and technology, including Netflix, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).
S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have maintained the widely used business classification system since 1999, and the rearrangement is meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved. 
Stocks being shifted account for about 8 percent of the S&P 500, and S&P subindexes will reflect the changes once trading starts on Sept. 24.
The communication services sector will include three out of the four so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet - even though investors widely consider them the leaders of the tech rally that powered the stock market higher in recent years.
Alphabet and Facebook will leave technology and Netflix will by moved out of consumer discretionary to join to the renamed sector. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.
Graphic: S&P 500 current sectors - https://reut.rs/2CHuALD 
The technology sector's weight in the S&P 500 will shrink to 20 percent from 26 percent. 
Its largest remaining constituents will be Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). After the shuffle removes the influence of some of the biggest companies from the sector's performance, chipmakers, cloud-computing sellers and other tech constituents may have more of a chance to shine.

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that passively track sector indexes have about $89 billion invested in technology, more than any other sector, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper. 
Trading could be volatile on Friday for stocks caught in the shakeup as some of those tech ETFs, along with index funds focused on consumer discretionary and telecoms, adjust their portfolios.
But some of the heavy lifting is already complete. 
Leading fund provider Vanguard Group started transitioning its sector ETFs in the June quarter, while State Street Global Advisors has already launched a new fund tracking communication services. 
The Communication Services Select Sector SPRD Fund has fallen 3 percent since its June debut, partly because Facebook, its second-largest holding, tumbled 16 percent on growing regulatory concerns.
Communication services will account for 11 percent of the S&P 500, up from less than 2 percent in its current configuration as the telecom sector.

Consumer discretionary will make up 11 percent of the S&P 500, down from 13 percent. Amazon's weight within consumer discretionary will rise to 34 percent from 27 percent, with  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) and McDonald's Corp the next largest components.

S&P 500 communication services companies will have an aggregate valuation of 18 times expected earnings after the shakeup, compared to 10 times for the current S&P 500 telecom constituents: AT&T Inc (NYSE:T),  CenturyLink  Inc (NYSE:CTL) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ).

16,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",U.S. mutual fund investors flee domestic stocks in latest week: ICI,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. mutual-fund investors sprinted out of domestic stocks at the fastest pace in nine weeks as trade talks seemed to deteriorate and social media executives were grilled by lawmakers, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday.
Mutual fund investors pulled $8.1 billion from domestic stock funds during the week ended Sept. 5, while exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the same market attracted $1.1 billion, the trade group said.
ETFs are heavily trafficked by quick-trading investors while mutual funds are more exclusively used by long-term retail investors.
During the latest week, Canada and the United States concluded trade talks without resolution, a report suggested that the United States could impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) executives defended their companies before skeptical U.S. lawmakers.
Despite record-high U.S. corporate earnings, investors remain skittish around domestic stocks.
Overall, including both mutual funds and ETFs, bond funds attracted $3.5 billion, marking their 29th straight week pulling in cash. Stock funds posted $5.5 billion in withdrawals, the lowest figure in nine weeks, according to the ICI.
Closely watched bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach on Tuesday said global economic growth is slowing, but stopped short of calling for a recession. He said he would avoid putting new money in the market into the S&P 500 despite its relatively strong performance versus international indexes.
Commodity funds, including those invested in gold, recorded $411 million in withdrawals. It is the sixth straight week of outflows for those products and comes as a rising dollar this year has hurt demand for gold, which is priced in dollars.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 12:24PM ET</span>",Australia's CBA rejected heart attack insurance claim using outdated model,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The insurance arm of Commonwealth Bank of Australia rejected a trauma payout to a customer using outdated criterion that found his heart attack was not severe enough, a powerful public inquiry into the financial sector heard on Wednesday.
The inquiry or the Royal Commission, which can recommend criminal prosecutions and tougher regulations, also heard that CBA's CommInsure withheld relevant medical information when the claims dispute was brought before a complaints tribunal. 
Details of the 2014 case started emerging in media reports in 2016, sparking concerns that the sector was relying on outdated medical definitions to avoid paying out claims.
Practices such as this, as well as the sector's high-pressure tactics to sell and retain policies, have come under intense scrutiny with the inquiry turning the spotlight on insurers in its latest round of hearings.
Insurers, such as AIA Group and the Australian unit of Allianz (DE:ALVG), have already told the inquiry they overcharged customers.
CommInsure's original rejection of the A$100,000 ($70,990) trauma claim was based on its in-house doctor's recommendation that the patient's troponin levels did not meet the ""specified severity"", the inquiry heard on Wednesday. Troponin are proteins released into the bloodstream after a heart attack. 
The unnamed patient recorded a troponin level of 1.9 micrograms per liter, just short of CommInsure's 2.0 microgram minimum, according to disclosures at the inquiry.
Under questioning, CommInsure's executive general manager, Helen Troup, said the insurer knew at the time its definition of heart attack ""didn't reflect the universal definition"".
CommInsure belatedly updated its definition, the inquiry heard, and eventually compensated the patient, but not before withholding information from the financial ombudsman.
CBA sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA Group for $3.1 billion last year, but the sale is still to be completed.
PRESSURE TACTICS
The revelations about the insurance sector are among the most explosive to emerge from the year-long inquiry into Australia's financial sector misconduct.
Shares of insurers came under pressure from the scrutiny at the inquiry, with Freedom Insurance Group closing down 20 percent on Wednesday and Clearview Wealth ending down 5 percent. 
The inquiry heard that 85 percent of Freedom customers who called to cancel policies ended up keeping the same or an amended policy. Freedom Chief Operating Officer Craig Orton told the inquiry the retention rate was ""too strong"" and that he was aware of representatives ""not taking no for an answer"".
""It is too difficult to cancel in some circumstances,"" said Orton, who conceded some customers had only signed up to take advantage of a period of free premiums. ""That's something that I won't allow to happen in the future.""
A lawyer assisting the inquiry, Rowena Orr, said some customers had complained that Freedom staff had ""just hung up"" when they attempted to cancel a policy. 
Orton, however, said he was not aware of that practice.
The Royal Commission is scheduled to hold a final set of hearings in November and provide a report to the federal government in February, which could include proposed regulatory changes to how insurers contact potential customers.
The inquiry has already unpicked the banking, lending and pension sectors. Among Australia's ""Big Four"" banks, CBA has taken the biggest reputational hit with the commission having exposed how it overcharged and misappropriated funds from customers, including extracting fees from deceased clients.

""Blackstone is in talks with Centerbridge about a joint offer for 3 billion euros and it looks like the bid will be submitted next week,"" one of the sources said. 
The potential offer was also reported on Wednesday by Bloomberg and earlier this week by Spanish website el confidencial.
Blackstone, Centerbridge and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) declined to comment.
A deal would extend Blackstone's presence in Spain, which is enjoying an economic rebound. The U.S. investor bought control of property worth 10 billion euros from Santander in August last year.
Santander's headquarters, which houses around 6,500 employees, is owned by Marme Inversiones, which in 2008 bought and leased back the property to Santander in a 40-year deal for 1.9 billion euros. 
Marme sought protection from creditors in 2014 after failing to pay the 1.56 billion euro senior loan it took out to purchase the property, according to Bloomberg.
A Spanish court in charge of liquidating Marme's assets announced in July that investors would be able to submit offers for Santander's headquarters to the court.

BTIG Research’s Rich Greenfield cut the stock to sell from neutral with a $5 price target, Barron’s reported. The stock closed at nearly $10 in the previous session.
“We are tired of Snapchat’s excuses for missing numbers and are no longer willing to give management ‘time’ to figure out monetization,” Greenfield said.

Another downgrade hurt memory chip makers, which pulled the S&P Information Technology sector index down about 0.5%.

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes in response to an ""epidemic"" of young people using e-cigarettes, the agency's leader said on Wednesday. 
In a speech at FDA headquarters, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency would also revisit its compliance policy that extended the dates for manufacturers of flavored e-cigarettes to submit applications for premarket authorization.
""We see clear signs that youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion,"" Gottlieb said. 
Gottlieb announced a number of steps the agency planned to take as part of a broader crackdown on the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes to kids. The agency issued 12 warning letters to companies that it says have deceptive marketing labels on e-liquids. ""We cannot allow a whole new generation to become addicted to nicotine,"" he said.
Shares of  British American Tobacco  (L:BATS) were up nearly 6 percent and shares of cigarette-maker Imperial Brands PLC (L:IMB) were up more than 3 percent. Shares of cigarette and e-cigarette maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) also rose more than 6 percent, while Philip Morris International (N:PM) shares were up 4 percent.
Traders said proposed FDA action was less harsh than feared. 
Manufacturers offer and market e-cigarette flavors that appeal to minors, including candy, bubble gum and fruit flavors. The FDA said more than 2 million middle school and high school students used e-cigarettes in 2017. 
The FDA is giving the five top-selling e-cigarette brands - Juul Labs Inc., Vuse, MarkTen XL, Blu and Logic - 60 days to provide plans for how they will mitigate sales to minors. 
Juul Labs said it would work with the FDA on its request and is committed to preventing underage use of its product. But it added that ""appropriate flavors play an important role in helping adult smokers switch,"" spokeswoman Victoria Davis said.
The owners of Vuse, MarkTen XL, Blu and Logic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""While we remain committed to advancing policies that promote the potential of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers move away from combustible cigarettes, that work can't come at the expense of kids,"" Gottlieb said. 

As part of its broader enforcement efforts, the FDA said it issued more than 1,300 warning letters and fines to retailers who illegally sold e-cigarette products to minors.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","VW ex-CEO, Bosch CEO won't testify in Stuttgart trial: judge","STUTTGART (Reuters) - Former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VW) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner are no longer expected to testify in a trial brought against VW's main shareholder Porsche SE by investors, according to a judge.
Most of the two dozen witnesses called in the case have invoked their right to refuse to give evidence, Judge Fabian Richter Reuschle said in the opening of the trial in a regional court in Stuttgart.
""We have to accept that we cannot force them to incriminate themselves,"" Richter Reuschle said, adding the trial dates set aside for witness testimony through mid-November had been canceled.
Shareholders represented by law firm TILP are seeking compensation from Porsche SE, alleging the company did not inform markets quickly enough about the scale of potential liabilities VW faced over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, disclosed in September 2015.
The start of proceedings in Stuttgart comes two days after a separate investor suit launched in the northern German city of Braunschweig, in which the plaintiffs are seeking billions of euros in damages from VW itself as well as from Porsche SE.
VW has admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests, but denies it failed to inform investors in a timely fashion. Bosch supplied key parts for VW's diesel engines, but says the integration of them was the responsibility of the manufacturer. 
Had investors known about VW’s unlawful activities in rigging emissions tests, they may have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue.
VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars.
A higher court in Stuttgart is due to rule on whether the suit against Porsche SE should be suspended to await the outcome of the Braunschweig trial, since the two cases are similar.
Porsche SE, the holding company of the Porsche and Piech families, owns about 52 percent of voting rights in VW. It is being sued by investors for a total of 865 million euros ($1 billion) in the two courts.
Porsche SE sees all of the suits as unfounded and in some cases without legal basis.
Like VW's management board, the board of Porsche SE had no knowledge of any cheating on diesel emissions tests before the matter became public in a ""notice of violation"" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Sept. 18, 2015, the company says.
Winterkorn was the CEO of both Volkswagen and Porsche SE at the time.

LONDON (Reuters) - A new Bank of England regulator said she had ""really terrible"" memories of her time at Switzerland's UBS during the financial crisis and would resist any attempt to loosen financial regulations brought in since.
Jill May joined the BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Committee (PRC), which regulates banks, in July and was a managing director at UBS between 2001 and 2012, during which it required three bailouts from the Swiss government.
""Having lived through the financial crisis -- and believe me it was a deeply shaming and searing experience -- I would always be in favor of ensuring the highest possible global financial standards,"" she told British legislators.
""I have really terrible memories,"" she added, saying she recalled Swiss pensioners who had lost money on UBS shares hurling eggs at the bank's staff.
More recently May served on a British government body which approves company takeovers. Her term at the BoE will last until July 2021.
She said she was relatively optimistic about the prospects for Britain's financial industry after Brexit and that most firms were well prepared, but the BoE would need to be prepared for all eventualities.
Also speaking to parliament's Treasury Committee was another new PRC appointee, London School of Economics law professor Julia Black, who starts her three-year term at the central bank on Nov. 30.
Black highlighted as potential concerns the rapid developments in consumer-facing financial technology and the extent to which detailed information provided to regulators genuinely reflected the risks faced by financial institutions.

""All financial services firms face risks arising from the highly febrile national and international political environment,"" she said in written evidence. ""This includes not only Brexit, but the growing disputes in global trade and the unpredictable nature of various countries' foreign policies.""

NIO's shares opened at $6 and dropped to a low of $5.35, giving the company a market capitalization of $5.52 billion.
The company, whose ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle is seen as a rival to Tesla's Model X, priced 160 million shares at $6.26 on Tuesday, just above the low end of its $6.25 to $8.25 target price range, raising $1 billion.
Tesla's struggles to meet its production targets and an abandoned attempt by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to take it private have weighed not just on its own stock, but also on peers looking to develop mass-market electric cars.
NIO, formerly known as NextEV and backed by Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd, is one of several largely Chinese-funded EV startups betting on the benefits of local production to compete with firms such as Tesla. 
The listing - the third-biggest in the United States by a Chinese firm this year - comes as Chinese EV makers seek fresh capital to develop new products and finance investments in areas including autonomous driving and battery technologies.
Having begun promoting EVs in 2009, China aims to become a dominant global producer as it bids to curb vehicle emissions, boost energy security and promote high-tech industries.
Several EV makers such as WM Motor Technology Co and Xpeng Motor have also raised funds from heavyweight investors including tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent.
NIO, founded by Chinese entrepreneur William Li in 2014, incurred a net loss of $502.6 million in the first six months of 2018 on $6.95 million in revenue. 
The company began customer deliveries of its ES8 in June and plans to launch a second, lower-priced electric sport-utility vehicle, the ES6, by the end of this year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the IPO. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and UBS were also part of the process.

41,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Amazon has quietly taken a big and fast-growing stake in a $7 trillion market,"Amazon is known as the leading online store for consumers, but it's quickly becoming a destination spot for businesses, too.
The amount of goods sold through Amazon Business, the company's business-to-business marketplace, has hit $10 billion on an annualized basis, Amazon  said in a blog post Tuesday. But by 2021, that amount, using ""conservative"" assumptions, should exceed $25 billion, according to a research note from Colin Sebastian, a financial analyst at Baird Equity Research.
""We believe Amazon [Business] over the very long-term has the potential to surpass the size of the core [consumer] segment, and remains an underappreciated opportunity by many investors,"" Sebastian said in his report.
Investors and analysts that are bullish on Amazon have largely concentrated on Amazon Web Services, which is its fast-growing cloud-computing segment, and  its booming advertising business. Few, by contrast, have focused on Amazon Business.
But it, too, is showing impressive growth — and lots of potential.
More than $11 billion in goods will likely be sold through the business marketplace this year, up from $1 billion in annualized sales just two years ago, Sebastian said. By contrast, Amazon's consumer business took seven years to grow that same amount, he said.
In  interview with Business Insider, Bill Burkland, who heads the UK operations of Amazon Business, noted that the company didn't even launch its business marketplace until April 2015. Although the marketplace offers a wide range of goods, its most popular products are those with widespread appeal across many different kinds of businesses, such as PCs and janitorial supplies, he said. 
To hit an annual run rate of $10 billion in sales through the marketplace in fewer than four years ""is certainly a reflection that this is a big and fast-growing business,"" Burkland said.
The products sold through Amazon Business are sold by both Amazon itself and by third-party vendors. Those vendors now account for more than half of the total value of goods sold through the marketplace, according to Amazon's blog post. Amazon gets subscription fees from the third-party vendors and takes a commission on their sales.
Amazon offers its business marketplace in eight countries, including the United States, Germany, and Japan. Earlier this year, the company opened it to customers in France, Spain, and Italy.
Although little attention is devoted to outside of industry publications, the business-to-business e-commerce market worldwide is huge, with some $7 trillion in sales last year, according to Sebastian, citing figures from Shopify. That's more than three times as big as the consumer e-commerce market, which tallied about $2.3 trillion in 2017 sales.
With its big investments in recent years in warehouses and delivery services, Amazon is poised to become a major player in business-to-business sales, Sebastian said. Already, Amazon Business is used by 55 of Fortune's top 100 US businesses, and 40% of the local governments in the 100 most populous US cities use the service, Amazon said. It's also used by 80% of the top 100 US educational institutions in terms of enrollment, hosts some 150,000 sellers in the US, and serves ""millions"" of business customers worldwide, according to the company.
""Amazon has indicated in the past that over the very long-term, [Amazon Business] should be larger than its consumer business,"" Sebastian said.
In his note, Sebastian reiterated his ""outperform"" rating on Amazon's stock and his $2,100 price target. Amazon's shares closed regular trading Tuesday up $48.14, or 2.5%, to $1,987.15."

43,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",S&P 500's Rally Is Strongest Ever During a Fed Tightening Cycle,"(Bloomberg) -- Longest bull market ever. Two trillion-dollar companies. Now you can add strongest rally ever during a tightening cycle to the list of milestones for U.S. stocks.
Since the first post-crisis Federal Reserve rate hike in December 2015, the S&P 500 Index has gained 41 percent. That puts this cycle’s rally in the top spot when compared with historical equity advances as the Fed hiked borrowing costs, according to Crescat Capital.
The downfall that has often followed these rallies in the past could be cause for concern. The second-strongest rally came before the crash of 1987, with the S&P 500 rising 33 percent between the first interest rate increase and the first cut. The Fed has raised seven times since 2015 and analysts predict it’s set to boost rates again when the central bank’s open market committee meets this month.
“This is the strongest rally ever during a Fed tightening period, and now we are at record valuations,” Otavio Costa, a global macro analyst at the Denver, Colorado-based firm, wrote on Twitter. “How long until all hell breaks loose?”
Klaus Baader, the global chief economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, says risks are growing as the global economic expansion ages. Factors include trade tensions, emerging-market fragility, and monetary policy tightening.
“As the cycle matures, so exceptional monetary accommodation is being wound back, lessening the tailwinds for the U.S. economy,” he wrote in a report titled “Storm Clouds Gathering.”
About 10 years of persistently low interest rates and quantitative easing may make this time around different. As for how much longer the stock market can run, that will be a function of the central bank’s policies, according to Joseph LaVorgna, the chief economist for the Americas at Natixis.
“What I tell people is, ‘The Fed no longer has your back,”’ LaVorgna said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “We’re exiting a period of extraordinary monetary easing and going to a period where monetary policy is less accommodative.”"

49,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Stocks struggle near three-week lows but no respite for emerging markets,"By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Fresh sparring between Washington and Beijing over trade kept up pressure on world markets on Wednesday, with equities struggling and emerging currencies mostly weaker, led by the Indian rupee hitting a record low.
A bruising session in Asia took MSCI's main Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index to a 10th straight day in the red, its longest losing streak since September 2000. 
Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo all closed lower, taking emerging equities to a new 15-month low. MSCI's all-country equity index inched up marginally, looking to extend two sessions of modest gains that had snapped six straight days of losses. 
""What the market needs is a signal of some relaxation in trade rhetoric, a bit of climbdown,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier. ""That should be enough as (economic) fundamentals are strong. But you do need a trigger point and so far we have not seen it.""
The months-long escalation in tensions between the world's two biggest economies shows no sign of letting up. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was taking a tough stance with China. That cemented expectations that new levies on Chinese exports will soon be announced.
Earlier China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States in retaliation for non-compliance with a ruling in an earlier trade dispute.
Equity markets also faced pressure from U.S. two-year bond yields which touched a decade peak on Tuesday, partly spurred by data that provided yet more evidence of the U.S. economy's strength. 
That data had pushed Wall Street to a strong close, led by tech and energy shares, and futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq benchmark were up 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The S&P500 and Dow Jones indexes looked set for flat openings, however. 
In Europe, a pan-European index rose 0.2 percent off recent five-month lows though it gave up earlier strong gains. 
Ahmed said another positive catalyst for markets could be signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could slow the pace of interest rate rises. But given the torrent of strong U.S. data, that looks unlikely - data this week showed U.S. small business optimism at the highest level on record.
""In 2015 when emerging markets got into a lot of trouble the Fed recognized the international spillover effect. This time that has not happened,"" he added.
UNDER PRESSURE
The trade rows and higher U.S interest rates have pushed an index of emerging currencies almost 7 percent lower this year. The yuan touched 2-1/2 week lows against the dollar, leading Asian peers lower and keeping the Australian dollar - heavily linked to Chinese trade - close to its lowest since February 2016.
The dollar inched down against a basket of currencies as hopes grew of concessions by Canada that would resolve disputes over reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But emerging currencies stayed under pressure. 
While the worst-hit Turkish lira and Argentine peso have steadied off record lows, the Indian rupee is continuing to plumb new troughs, taking year-to-date losses versus the dollar to more than 12 percent.
""The rupee ... is symptomatic of the overall situation in emerging markets, but it also embeds some idiosyncratic problems - with the fiscal deficit growing and the current account deficit widening on (the) back of rising commodity prices,"" said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities.
Markets will also keep an eye on U.S. bonds. Ten-year yields stand just off the one-month highs hit on Tuesday after data showing sustained strength in the jobs market and the Treasury started a record debt sale amounting to almost $150 billion. 
Political risk meanwhile returned to the radar of investors in Italy and Britain. Italian bond yields, which fell to six-week lows in recent days, rose after local media reported 5-Star, one of the parties in the ruling coalition, was demanding 10 billion euros in the budget to implement plans for a basic universal income. 
The British pound also slipped off five-week highs hit this week against the dollar, as cautious optimism over a Brexit trade deal with the European Union subsided. 

Oil prices extended Tuesday's $2 surge, with Brent futures close to $80 a barrel as Hurricane Florence advanced and U.S. sanctions started weighing on Iran's exports.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>",German consumer body to file VW class action suit over diesel tests,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) will face another class action lawsuit over its rigging of diesel emissions tests, this time at home when Germany introduces a new law in November.
State-financed consumer protection organization vzbv said on Wednesday it would undertake ""pioneering work"" with motorists' lobby group ADAC by filing for damages on behalf of car owners.
The class action was made possible after the German cabinet approved a draft law in May that will allow consumer protection organizations to litigate on behalf of the consumers they represent, avoiding the high legal costs that might otherwise put people off bringing legal action.
Vzbv said it would aim to show that owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars with so-called type EA 189 diesel engines had been intentionally harmed by the Volkswagen's use of software that was used to cheat emissions tests
Volkswagen said the possibility did not change its view that there was no legal basis for consumers to make claims in connection to the diesel issue in Germany.
Vzbv said it wanted to get compensation for some 2 million owners of diesel cars that were not as environmentally friendly as VW said they were at the time of purchase.
VW admitted in 2015 it had used illegal engine control devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests. 
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners.
VW had rejected criticism that the compensation for U.S. car owners was not extended to other jurisdictions.
Consumers have brought lawsuits in countries including Switzerland, Australia and Belgium. 

Information for motorists on how to join the German action is due to be posted on https://www.musterfeststellungsklagen.de.

Berlin was spooked by the takeover of robotics firm Kuka by China's Midea in 2016 and the surprise purchase earlier this year of a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler by Chinese carmaker Geely.
German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported that a move by German state development bank KfW to buy a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz, preventing China's State Grid from acquiring it, could serve as a model for similar interventions.
""There are no considerations or plans in the federal government to establish a 'sovereign wealth fund' with the aim of financing government stakes in companies,"" an Economy Ministry spokeswoman said when asked to comment on the report.
""Germany is open to foreign direct investment and supports the freedom of international capital flows,"" she said.
""Nevertheless, the federal government is committed to the protection of Germany's security interests ...,"" the spokeswoman said, pointing to government plans to tighten rules for foreign direct investment in certain sectors.
Economy Ministry sources said in August that Germany was considering tighter controls on foreign investments, enabling Berlin to intervene if a buyer from outside the European Union amasses a shareholding of at least 15 percent, compared with 25 percent now.
Without citing specific sources, FAZ reported that if the government rejected a foreign direct investment, a German sovereign wealth fund could step in as an alternate buyer to avert a possible decline in market value.
Germany's Economy and Finance Ministries had already discussed with each other the idea of a sovereign wealth fund, which would need to be endowed with federal funds for purchasing stakes, it added.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 06:47AM ET</span>",How tech jobs helped Rust Belt become house-flipping hotspot,"By David Randall
PITTSBURGH, Pa (Reuters) - In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, millions of amateur investors kept adding fuel to the overheating U.S. housing market by betting on quick profits in hotspots like Las Vegas or Miami. A decade later, house-flipping is making a comeback, but this time in some Rust Belt cities the last boom passed by.
Not only the scenery has changed. Today's house-flippers - those buying properties and selling them within 12 months - are mainly contractors and professional renovators who buy run-down properties in promising neighborhoods and fix them up, boosting the resale value.
In contrast, those who contributed to the speculative frenzy of the early 2000s would typically take out a mortgage to buy a home, perhaps give it a new coat of paint, wait for prices to rise enough to cash in and do it over again.
Today, old industrial cities such as Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Cleveland are among those offering the greatest returns. They have struggled to recover from the recession, but now are beginning to attract tech firms, such as Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
The influx of new workers is boosting demand for urban homes in areas that have some of the oldest housing stock in the nation and not much new construction, creating richer opportunities for flippers than in Las Vegas or Miami at the height of the housing boom more than a decade ago.
""Even at their peak in terms of home flipping profits, these two markets never came close to the potential returns available now in Pittsburgh,"" said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at real estate tracking firm ATTOM Data Solutions.
In Pittsburgh, home flippers made a gross profit of 162.7 percent on average during the second quarter of this year, while in Buffalo, the average gross return came in at 107.5 percent, according to ATTOM data. Nationally, the average house-flipper earned a 44.3 percent gross return on investment this year, compared with the 35.3 percent during the boom. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2NC6sOu) 
CASH DEALS
While house-flipping is more lucrative than before, stricter lending rules mean fewer would-be investors can afford to join the fray. Nearly 48,770 single family homes were flipped nationwide in the second quarter of this year, about half of the number during the peak of the house-flipping craze in 2005, according to ATTOM data. 
Market statistics do not distinguish between casual investors and pros, but the high share of cash deals in the top-performing markets suggests they are a domain of full-time house flippers such as Kris Bennett.
The former pro BMX racer opened his Pittsburgh firm that specializes in renovating and flipping houses in 2009 and now has a team of six and 18 projects under management.
In Pittsburgh, nearly 75 percent of flipped homes are paid for in cash while in Cleveland cash deals account for 80 percent of house flipping compared with 60 percent nationwide.
Real estate analysts say those numbers suggest there is little risk of a repeat of 2008. Back then investors who financed their speculative bets with mortgages were primarily responsible for the surge in defaults that fueled the crisis, according a National Bureau of Economic Research paper published last year. 
“We found that someone is much more likely to default on an investment property than a residential one because it’s a purely financial decision with no psychological costs,” said Stefania Albanesi, one of the study’s authors and University of Pittsburgh economics professor. 
Today's flippers not only rely far less on borrowing. They also help increase the supply of quality housing in some long- neglected markets, analysts say. 
""Pittsburgh's housing market was under-invested in for 40 or 50 years,"" said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at real estate listing firm Zillow. ""The housing stock in the urban core of these cities requires substantial investments to update these older homes and bring them up to modern living standards."" 
That, however, is fuelling concerns that long-time residents may get priced out from their neighborhoods that are now in demand. For example, in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville - now home to Uber's self-driving car division - the average home price jumped from $72,993 in 2007 to $236,951 in 2017, a gain of 224 percent, according to RealSTATS, a local real estate listing firm. 
Overall, prices are up 7.9 percent in the Pittsburgh metro are so far this year, just below the U.S. average, according to estimates from real estate listing firm Zillow.
In Buffalo, median home prices are up 14.9 percent over the last 12 months and are expected to rise another 12.2 percent in the year ahead, according to Zillow. In Cleveland, prices are up 18.6 percent over the past 12 months and are expected to rise another 7 percent over the next 12 months. In response to affordability concerns, the Pittsburgh authorities raised real estate transfer taxes this year to fund a Housing Opportunity Fund designed to spend $10 million annually on preserving and developing affordable housing in the city. 
With home prices still far below the national average, real estate professionals in Rust Belt cities expect the influx of workers from costlier locations and the pressure on the markets there to continue.
The median home in Pittsburgh, for example, is now worth $141,300, a third below the national average and about 85 percent less than the $953,600 median in tech-heavy San Francisco, according to Zillow. 
""Pittsburgh is becoming a whole different city,"" Bennett said. ""While locals might be surprised by the prices, almost all of the homes I'm selling are to people who are coming from places like D.C. or Boston who can't believe how affordable it is.""

59,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:42AM ET</span>","Ryanair pilots, cabin crew in Germany stage strike","BERLIN (Reuters) - Pilots and cabin crew at Ryanair (I:RYA) in Germany staged a full-day walkout on Wednesday and threatened further strikes to put pressure on management in labor talks with Europe's biggest low-cost carrier.
Ryanair had said on Tuesday it would cancel 150 out of a total 400 flights scheduled to fly to and from Germany on Wednesday due to the strike and warned that such ""wildcat"" strikes would lead to job cuts if they continued.
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has called on Ryanair to agree to mediation in its dispute over pay and terms, but there has been disagreement over who the mediator should be.
The union threatened that it could call further strikes if management does not make a better offer.
""As long as Ryanair does not make improved offers, there may have to be further strikes here,"" said VC negotiator Ingolf Schumacher.
Ryanair says its latest offer to VC addressed all of the union's demands and that the walkouts were unreasonable.
The Irish carrier has come under fire from unions, especially in Germany, for its practice of employing some pilots via third-party agencies, such as McGinley Aviation. The airline last year decided to recognize unions in an attempt to improve relations with its pilots and ease a staffing crunch.
German services union Verdi is seeking a substantial pay increase as well as local contracts for around 1,000 cabin crew at Ryanair. It said management had, however, offered local contracts only from 2022.
""If you buy a ticket which is cheaper than the taxi ride to the airport everyone should realize that something is wrong with the system, that these prices can't fund the company,"" Verdi spokesman Andreas Splanemann said at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport.
At Germany's biggest airport in Frankfurt, union members carried banners saying ""Ryanair stop squeezing your crew,"" through a terminal.
The carrier suffered its worst ever strikes this summer, but secured a breakthrough in August when it reached a deal with Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could secure deals in other markets soon.
Last week, however, seven trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened to hold a strike in late September unless the airline agrees to improve working conditions.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Chinese stock markets battered by trade war fears,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Chinese stocks have lost more than a fifth of their value in dollar terms this year on concerns that rising U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would hurt corporate earnings.
The world's two biggest economies have applied tariffs to $50 billion of each other's goods. 
As U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to impose further tariffs on all the roughly $500 billion of Chinese imports, which could spell further downside for mainland shares, here's a rundown of how much damage has been inflicted so far. 
China exports consumer goods such as cell phones, computers and televisions, and industrial goods including electric power equipment and machinery to the United States. 
The Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) has declined around 20 percent this year and is already the worst performer among the major stock indexes in the world, ranking alongside crisis-hit emerging markets such as Turkey, Venezuela and Argentina. China's other blue-chip index (CSI300) is also down about 20 percent.

61,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Florence to Batter U.S. Data But Harm to Economy Likely Small,"(Bloomberg) -- The economic impact of Hurricane Florence is unlikely to be large but could muddle U.S. data for months, judging from past experience.
Last year, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma constrained activity in the third quarter of 2017 and sparked rebuilding later in the year and well into 2018, making it hard to get an accurate and timely assessment of the impact on quarterly gross domestic product growth.
That will be a challenge again with Florence, forecast to be the worst storm to hit North Carolina in 64 years, and the storm season is far from over. Data on employment, consumer spending and manufacturing may also become trickier to analyze as economists gauge impacts of tax cuts and a trade war.
“The first place you’ll likely see it is in initial jobless claims,” Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in reference to Florence. At the same time, major storms’ effects on the broader economy tend to be “pretty small, on aggregate.”
When Harvey made landfall on Aug. 25 along the Gulf Coast in Texas last year, initial filings for unemployment benefits surged in the week ended Sept. 2 by the most since November 2012. Applications had similarly jumped following Superstorm Sandy’s hit to the Northeast in 2012. Any spike this time would be temporary, and unlikely to cause concern, as jobless claims are at the lowest level since December 1969.
Here are some other economic indicators to watch:
Retail Sales, Consumer Spending
Based on consumer purchases that won’t be made as a result of the storm -- such as canceled events and missed dinners out -- Florence may have a $700 million net negative impact on the U.S. economy, not counting insurance losses, according to weather-analytics company Planalytics’ initial estimate.
“If you’re a mom-and-pop and you happen to be in harm’s way, this could be devastating,” said Evan Gold, executive vice president at Planalytics. Florence is “going to be big, and it’s going to be notable, but I’m not sure it’s going to be as big as others” such as Sandy.
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts reckon retailers’ sales of food, water, home-preparation items and cleanup supplies will rise both ahead of and immediately following the storm, but purchases of more discretionary items, including restaurant visits, apparel and home decor, are likely to diminish.
Automobile sales may be worth keeping an eye on: They took a hit in August 2017, then rebounded to a 12-year high in September as Americans replaced damaged vehicles.
This year, the hurricane’s effects are already being felt in the stock market, with shares of home-improvement retailers Lowe’s Cos. and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). rising while insurance companies decline.
Jobs, Wages
Florence could affect millions of workers in the southeastern U.S., with North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia forecast to be hit the hardest. According to the Labor Department, flood-zone counties in the states have more than 42,000 establishments employing 682,179 workers with a quarterly payroll of $7.4 billion.
After hurricanes Harvey and Irma last year, the initial reading on U.S. payrolls showed a decline of 33,000 workers in September, the first pullback since 2010. The tally has since been revised to a gain of 14,000 jobs, and net hiring rebounded to 271,000 in October 2017.
About 1.5 million people were unable to work due to bad weather during September 2017, a 21-year high, and restaurants and bars, an industry where most workers only get paid if they show up to work, were particularly hit. Wages may show some impact too: Last year, the hurricanes boosted utility workers’ overtime pay and kept people away from work in low-wage industries such as leisure and hospitality.
Factories, Housing
Industrial production is another indicator to watch. It declined in September 2017 before surging in October as output at oil refineries and petrochemical plants returned to normal operations following Harvey-related flooding in the Houston area.
New-home construction also is sensitive to the weather. Residential starts were initially reported as a decline in September last year after Harvey and Irma."
62,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>","Trade war takes a heavy toll on Chinese stocks, and investors","By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - It's barely six months into a broadening Sino-U.S. trade war, and the fallout has already driven China's stock markets into the same league as debilitated emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina and Venezuela.
With around a 20 percent loss so far in 2018, Shanghai's stock market (SSEC) has joined the crisis-hit trio among the world's four worst performers. In stark contrast, the technology heavy U.S. Nasdaq index (IXIC) is one of the world's biggest gainers, up about 15.5 percent. 
While some analysts say the rest of the world remains complacent about how disruptive a trade war could get between the two biggest economies - with their deep and long production supply chain - the accusation could not be leveled at investors in Chinese markets, which have been hemorrhaging.
Besides the headline drop in share values, China's currency has fallen sharply and share transaction volumes have shrunk. Money managers are preferring cash over investments and investors have dashed into the safety of lower-yielding government bonds.
""I've seen hedge funds sitting on 10 billion dollars of cash or equivalent and waiting to get back into the market,"" said Chi Lo, Greater China economist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Investment Partners, adding the uncertainty and lack of confidence could drag on for a few months.
And the war may have only just begun. China and U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have so far only kicked off tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of each other's imports. Trump has said he is prepared to tax the entire roughly $500 billion of Chinese products that the United States imports annually.
Lo, at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, fears China's economic growth could slip next year to 6.2 percent, the slowest since 1990, as the full impact of the tariffs kicks in.
UBS Securities estimates a full-blown trade war would wipe out profit growth at major China-listed companies, and the blue-chip index (CSI300) could fall to 3,000 points in its worst-case scenario, which is around 7 percent below current levels.
HEADING FOR NASDAQ
While most economists polled by Reuters last month expected the trade war to also hurt the U.S. economy, some U.S. sectors, such as technology, are seen by investors as less exposed than many more export-focused Chinese companies, spurring Chinese buyers to shift funds into U.S. stocks.
Guotai Nasdaq 100 QDII-ETF (SS:513100), a Shanghai-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking Nasdaq, has seen assets under management (AUM) surge 160 percent over the past two months, while the Bosera S&P 500 ETF saw its assets jump by half.
""I plan to put more money into Nasdaq, which is home to the world's most innovative stocks, such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),"" said retail investor Ding Ou, who has reaped returns of more than 20 percent investing in the Nasdaq ETF, but suffered heavy losses buying domestic shares. ""If the trade war escalates further, Chinese stocks, and also yuan, could continue to fall.""
Nearly 1 trillion yuan gushed into Chinese money market funds in July, the fastest pace this year, boosting their assets by 12 percent.
Major exchange-traded Chinese money market funds, which trade like stocks and thus are more popular among stock investors, have also seen heavy inflows.
The top four money market ETFs <511990.SS> <511880.SS> <511660.SS> <511810.SS> registered asset growth of roughly 50 percent since end-June. 
Meanwhile, investors continue to shun Chinese stocks, even after the slump drove valuations to levels seen as cheap. Their aversion has partly to do with China's domestic campaign over the past couple of years to deleverage its economy.
The benchmark Shanghai index trades at a price to earnings ratio of 11.2, and trading volume has shrunk to near four-year lows, according to Reuters data. The S&P 500 index is twice as expensive at a ratio of 22.
Some fret that gap could widen further if the trade spat puts further strain on the outlook for Chinese firms' profits. 
""The valuation data you see is static, but corporate health is dynamic,"" said Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanghai-based Shanshan Finance. ""One major concern is that companies' earnings forecasts could be downgraded.""
UBS made such an adjustment last month, slashing earnings growth for the CSI300 companies over the next 12 months almost by half to 5 percent. 
In particular, analysts have trimmed profit estimates for major exporters in sectors being targeted by U.S. tariffs. Earnings estimates for 2018 have been reduced by 8 percent in the information technology sector since March, while the telecoms sector suffered a 3 percent fall in forecast earnings, according to Reuters data.
""The biggest uncertainty this year is geopolitical risk, and it's almost impossible to build that into your forecast models,"" said Xie Donghai, chairman at Shanghai-based hedge fund house Entropy Capital, which hasn't touched China stocks this year.

BOARDROOM ANXIETY 
According to data from Shenzhen Qianhai Simuwang Fund Distribution Co, hedge funds' stock holdings in their investment portfolios on average has dropped to a three-year low of 52.6 percent, down from this year's peak of 70.3 percent in January. 
A Reuters survey showed a similar trend in the mutual fund industry, where equity fund managers slashed suggested exposure to stocks to 66.9 percent in August, compared with 76.9 percent a year earlier, while recommended cash holdings rose to 23.1 percent from 13.1 percent. 
And the anxiety is not just limited to trading floors. The mid-year earnings season revealed the heavy pall of uncertainty in corporate boardrooms across China.
Aluminum makers Jilin Liyuan Precision Manufacturing Co Ltd (SZ:002501) and  Yinbang Clad Material  Co Ltd (SZ:300337) said their overseas sales have been reduced to zero. Tongrun Equipment Technology Co (SZ:002150), a Chinese maker of power transmission and control equipment, forecast its nine-month profit would be somewhere between ""-20 percent and 30 percent"", a wide and uncertain range spawned by the worries over tariffs.
Some companies are refusing to give out earnings guidance.

""If we paint a gloomy picture, investors would panic,"" said Liu Jieling, investor relations official at motor equipment exporter Zhongji Innolight Co (SZ:300308). ""If we express optimism, the reality could unfold otherwise.""

63,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","In Tesla's shadow, China's NIO raises $1 billion from IPO: sources","By Joshua Franklin and Julie Zhu
NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle start-up  NIO Inc  (N:NIO) priced its shares near the bottom of its targeted price range in its U.S. initial public offering, according to sources familiar with the matter, dragged down by investor concerns about the prospects of chief competitor Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
Tesla's struggle to meet its production targets and an abandoned attempt by chief executive Elon Musk to take it private have weighed not just on its own stock, but also on peers looking to develop mass-market electric cars.
Chinese electric carmakers are seeking capital to develop autonomous driving and battery technologies. Beijing wants to rapidly expand China's production to curb vehicle emissions, boost energy security and promote high-tech industries.
NIO priced its shares at $6.26, just above the low end of its $6.25 to $8.25 target price range, according to four sources familiar with the process. The deal will value the firm at $6.41 billion. It is due to begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""NIO"".
Earlier, one source told Reuters the deal would price at $6.25 a share.
A representative for NIO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
NIO, founded by Chinese entrepreneur William Li in 2014, sold $1 billion in shares in the IPO, making it the third-biggest U.S. listing by a Chinese firm this year. 
At the start of the IPO process, NIO had hoped for a valuation of as much as $20 billion, according to one person familiar with the company's plans.
The IPO comes as China-U.S. trade tensions involving tit-for-tat tariffs have knocked back global stock markets.
NIO, backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), plans to use the IPO proceeds for research and development of products and technology, marketing and developing manufacturing facilities. 
Its other backers include investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group, Sequoia Capital and a private equity fund established by Baidu Inc (O:BIDU).
NIO incurred a net loss of $502.6 million in the first six months of 2018 on $6.95 million in revenues. In June, it began customer deliveries of its ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle, which the company sees as a rival to Tesla's Model X. 
NIO said in its listing prospectus that as of the end of August, it had delivered about 1,600 ES8s and had another 15,778 unfulfilled reservations for the vehicle. 
It also plans to launch a second, lower-priced electric sport-utility vehicle, the ES6, by the end of this year.
Start-up electric carmakers such as WM Motor Technology Co and Xpeng Motors have also raised billions of dollars from heavyweight investors including  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Baidu and Tencent.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led NIO's IPO. Also involved were Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and UBS.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil and mining stocks led European shares higher on Wednesday as investors shrugged off a weaker session in Asia amid rising tensions between the United States and China. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) and eurozone STOXX (STOXXE) were both up 0.5 percent by 0845 GMT, despite declines by Asian stocks after President Donald Trump said the United States was taking a ""tough stance"" with China on trade.
Oil stocks (SXEP) rose 1.6 percent after a drop in U.S. crude inventories pushed crude prices higher. Mining shares (SXPP) climbed 1.5 percent.
""We think it is likely that the equity market sell-off, particularly in the European time zone, will slow down or even temporarily reverse,"" said RBC strategists. 
""While 'trade frictions' and a perception of slowing Asian markets as a result are easy culprits, there seems to be a lot of risk priced in at this stage too,"" they said. 
Dutch biotech firm  Galapagos  (AS:GLPG) soared 16.7 percent to the top of the STOXX after positive trial results for a drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis.

Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) topped Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) with a 5.2 percent rise. Traders cited rumors of a potential takeover. The family that controls the fashion group is not interested in selling its stake, a spokeswoman for the group said.
Hermes (PA:HRMS) shares rose 2 percent after the French handbag maker reported record first-half margins.
""Hermes delivered a solid set of results... Importantly, the company noted a positive contribution to profits from strong demand in China,"" Berenberg analysts wrote. 
British energy provider SSE (L:SSE) sank 8 percent after it warned first-half profit would halve compared with last year, calling its financial performance ""disappointing and regrettable"".
 Centrica  (L:CNA), another power company, fell 3.1 percent. 
Hexpol (ST:HPOLb) shares rose 5.4 percent after the Swedish chemicals company said it acquired U.S. rubber compounder Kirkhill Rubber.
Shares in payments processor  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) rose 5.6 percent after the recently listed Dutch company said it has selected data platform company Looker to help grow its business.
Broker research moved some stocks. German utility E.ON (DE:EONGn) fell 2.5 percent to the bottom of the DAX after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts cut their target price on the stock. 
Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut (S:BARN) gained 6.3 percent after UBS analysts upgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""sell"". 
""We undertook some supply chain checks and think Barry could sign new contracts soon, benefiting its volume growth in the next 12-18 months,"" UBS analysts wrote. 

Overall, however, analysts are lowering earnings outlooks for MSCI Europe companies, as the second-quarter earnings season ends and investor attention turns to political risk.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) granted its approval after the CK Consortium pledged to sell off all APA’s pipeline assets in Western Australia, as previously, the ACCC expressed concerns over the acquisition giving the CK Group monopoly power on gas transmission and storage facilities in the west.
The deal still has to go through the Australian government’s Foreign Investment Review Board.
ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said the watchdog ""concluded that, in the absence of the undertaking, the proposed acquisition was likely to substantially lessen competition.''
“The undertaking addresses these concerns and creates an opportunity for a new operator to acquire a valuable set of assets, together with the personnel needed to operate and manage the assets,” said Sims."

71,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Are Caught in the Longest Sell-off in 16 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s a losing streak investors haven’t seen since 2002.
The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell for a tenth consecutive day Wednesday, extending its recent decline to about 5 percent and bringing the loss in value to almost $700 billion this year.
And there’s a slew of reasons: trade, the U.S. dollar, emerging-market turmoil and the bear market in Chinese stocks to name but a few.
“Asian stocks have been caught in the middle of increasing trade tensions as well as the rising dollar and emerging market contagion, and certainly China weakness is also adding fuel to the fire,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.
Most individual Asian stock markets fell Wednesday, led by declines in Japan and Hong Kong. The Topix index fell 0.6 percent while the Hang Seng Index slumped another 0.5 percent after entering bear market territory yesterday. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite Index neared a four-year low as policy makers’ attempts to lift sentiment fail to gain traction.
Here’s what strategists are saying about the current state of play in Asian stocks:
Emerging Market Spillover
“There’s more contagion coming from Turkey and Argentina events to the more externally susceptible economies like Indonesia and Philippines,” said Ken Peng, strategist at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). Both Southeast Asian nations have “double deficits, they have inflation that is relatively high and rising. And their reserves are falling.”
Trade
The “clear concern” in the short term is trade tensions, said Michael McCarthy, Sydney-based chief market strategist at CMC Markets. While signs of a de-escalation would be positive, that seems unlikely in the current environment, he added.
“The biggest risk is trade,” Citi’s Peng said, citing that “people are very afraid of” the additional $200 billion in tariffs. He noted that the midterm elections on Nov. 6 is key and trade tensions may dissipate after that.
Greenback
The slump in Asian stocks is mainly due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against emerging-market currencies, Paul Kim, chief investment officer at Eastspring Investments said. He expects an outflow from emerging markets with the Federal Reserve still on course to increase interest rates.
Still Bearish
“We maintain a bearish stance on Asia and EM equities and expect further downgrades to consensus earnings estimates in coming months,” said Jonathan Garner, managing director at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), citing “a slowdown in China’s growth consequent upon credit tightening” and weaker demand in autos and technology hardware.
Premature
“Asia is certainly cheaper and oversold now than the start of the year, and in my view closer to the end of its falls than the beginning. But given the risk around U.S. equities and the fact that any falls in U.S. equities will lead to a broad global risk-off sentiment, I suggest, it maybe premature to go in yet,” AMP’s Naeimi said.
Some Optimism
“We see that light at the end of the tunnel, but we’re still kind of in the darkness ourselves,” Citi’s Peng said. Investors need more concrete catalysts before they step in to buy stocks. “So that’s the challenge for money mangers.”
“We are looking to be more constructive on Asian equities in the next quarter, if the current correction continues. Valuations will be more attractive and worth a look then,” said Jason Low, senior investment strategist at DBS Bank Holdings Ltd.
“The good news is that valuations are looking more attractive now and technicals are oversold, which suggest that Asian stocks could be poised for a rebound in the next few months,” Jasslyn Yeo global market strategist as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management."

The Shanghai Composite extended loss from the morning, down by 0.33% at 1:23AM ET (05: 23 GMT), while the SZSE Composite fell 0.49%. The Hang Seng Index slipped by 0.51%, going deeper into a bear market.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.44% and South Korea’s KOSPI also declined 0.3%, while down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.12%.
China is seeking the World Trade Organization’s permission to sanction against $7 billion worth of U.S. products due to the latter’s non-compliance of a dispute ruling that indicated the illegality of its dumping duties.
This came after Trump’s threat last Friday to slap 25% tariffs on a further $267 billion of Chinese products, which would mean all Chinese goods might be subject to levies. The White House stated on Tuesday that the U.S. is taking a tough stance with China.
The U.S.-China Business Council, which represents about 200 American companies that do business in China, said on Tuesday that China is putting off accepting license applications from American companies in financial services and other industries, until Washington comes to a settlement.
Beijing is likely to target operations of U.S. companies as it soon runs of American imports for retaliative penalties, given that Washington is considering imposing more tariffs on Chinese goods.
“China’s ability to respond is limited in tariffs, the government is using what they call ‘qualitative measures’. You can’t put a number on that, but it’s not an idle threat. They could really make it hard for U.S. companies to operate in China,” said ING Bank Head of Research and Chief Economist Robert Carnell.
China will release August industrial production and retail sales data on Friday while Australia is due to release employment data on Thursday."
74,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",Trump Tariffs Spark Industry Campaign to De-Escalate Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Trade associations representing farmers, retailers and manufacturers are joining forces in a new multi-million-dollar campaign to oppose President Donald Trump’s tariffs, in the latest attempt by U.S. business to stop an escalating trade war.
Groups lobbying for months to persuade the president that tariffs are the wrong approach have been largely ignored, as Trump slapped duties on billions of dollars of imports from steel to Chinese products. But a new coalition called Americans for Free Trade is joining Farmers for Free Trade to change the direction in Washington by highlighting stories of businesses, consumers and farmers in the heartland negatively affected by the duties.
The groups are launching a campaign of more than $3 million, involving town hall-style events in key congressional districts ahead of the midterm elections, digital advertising and other grassroots outreach to Congress and the administration. More than 80 coalition members are signing a letter to all members of Congress asking for support in fighting the duties and providing oversight on trade policy matters.
The idea is to amplify the stories of small businesses, consumers, and industries hurt by the duties to show the administration that the short-term U.S. economic pain from tariffs and retaliation from other countries is not worth any long-term deal Trump hopes to strike using tariffs as leverage, coalition members said.
Political Math
“The political calculus may lead the administration to think this is a winning hand,’’ said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). “But if we can change the realities on the ground, then the administration may recalibrate.’’
U.S. business groups have been trying traditional advocacy and even unusual lobbying approaches to oppose the tariffs, including airing ads on “Fox and Friends’’ that Trump is known to watch. But those efforts haven’t deterred the president from imposing duties on metal imports and $50 billion in Chinese products so far. The administration has a list of $200 billion in additional goods targeted for duties that could be imposed at any time, and Trump has threatened to hit virtually all products from China.
Trump has acknowledged the impact of the duties -- especially retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and other U.S. agricultural products -- by offering $12 billion in assistance to farmers, a key part of his political base who helped him carry rural states in 2016.
Consumer Squeeze
The new campaign will show how the tariffs are “squeezing the average American family and communities from every direction,’’ Brian Kuehl, executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, a non-profit supported by major agricultural groups, said in a statement.
The group is joining the new coalition, which formalizes an ad hoc group of organizations and companies the National Retail Federation has helped lead and includes other large trade associations. There are kick-off events planned starting next week in Chicago, Nashville, Pennsylvania and Ohio, with other events before the midterms “in key communities throughout the heartland,” the groups said.
“Our motto right now is, ‘Try everything,’’’ said Nicole Vasilaros, a senior vice president for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, a coalition member.
Economic Hook
The groups, which are calling the campaign the largest bipartisan advocacy effort against the duties, illustrates how broadly the impact of the trade war will be felt, said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation.
“It really demonstrates that this is the entire U.S. economy that’s on the hook here,’’ French said.
The groups plan to highlight the plight of companies such as Chicago-based Cedar Electronics, which invented the CB radio under the Cobra brand and supplies radar-detection systems and other automotive and consumer electronic products with about 190 employees.
The company would not have brought some of its manufacturing jobs from the Philippines to its facility in West Chester, Ohio, had it know needed components from China would be targeted for duties, President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Cowger said.
Cowger said the company may have no choice but to pass on higher costs from the duties to consumers and is forced to spend time, energy and money addressing the disruption caused by the tariffs instead of developing new products.
“I’m beyond frustrated,’’ Cowger said. “I should be spending my time on making this company great.’’"

Anwar said the government’s review is limited to specific “dubious” projects approved under the previous administration and shouldn’t be interpreted as a snub to China. He’s expected to replace 93-year-old Mahathir Mohamad as prime minister in a year or two.
“It’s confined to these companies,” Anwar said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Sophie Kamaruddin in Hong Kong, where he’s attending an investment forum. “Mahathir took the initiative, visiting China, assuring them that the bilateral relations, trade, investments with China must and will continue.”
Since his surprise election victory in May, Mahathir has cancelled or suspended several major projects backed by Chinese interests, including the East Coast Rail Link and three pipeline projects. He also delayed work on a proposed bullet train linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, which had also attracted interest from Chinese contractors, and questioned whether foreigners should be able to buy property in a $100 billion project backed by a Chinese company.
“Mahathir represents the sentiments in the country that firstly we cannot continue with these mammoth projects at a time when the economy is struggling,” Anwar said. He added that the government is focusing on transparency and debt reduction, and overall “the economic fundamentals are strong.”
“Yes it is weak compared to the position that we had in the last two years, but it’s in no way close to being a weak, fragile economy,” he said.
Anwar, 71, is the official leader of the four-party Pakatan Harapan ruling coalition that backs Mahathir. Jailed for a sodomy conviction widely seen as political, Anwar was granted a full pardon following an election that ended the six-decade rule of Najib Razak’s United Malays National Organisation.
Mahathir has launched investigations to recover potentially $4.5 billion lost due to the mismanagement of state fund 1MDB by Najib, who denies wrongdoing. Anwar said Malaysia can’t recoup all the losses, but believed they could get “most” of the money back.
Mahathir, once a bitter rival of Anwar, had pledged during the election campaign to stand aside for him once he was pardoned. The timeframe for the transition remains unclear, with reports suggesting rivals within the party were positioning to outmaneuver Anwar.
Anwar plans to soon contest a special election for a seat in parliament, and work on reforms in the legislative body to give Mahathir space to run the government. Anwar said Mahathir was more suited to being prime minister than him at present as he was better at making tough decisions.
“This sort of teamwork will be very essential for him to continue getting the latitude and space without any encumbrances, and for me to assume the position much later,” Anwar said.
“We’ve accepted the fact that the country must be saved, that the country takes precedence,” Anwar said of Mahathir. “Credit given to him: He’s doing what he promised prior to the elections, and he’s doing it remarkably well.”"
76,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Emerging Value in Asia Stocks Not Enough to Win Investors,"(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks are trading at a two-year low versus the rest of the world. But most of the region’s emerging markets are still failing to attract investors.
That’s partly because that corner of the market remains too expensive. The valuation for most developing-nation shares in Asia is higher than for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
The MSCI EM Asia Index has slumped 12 percent this year, sending its valuation to about 11 times estimated earnings, below its 10-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While some strategists say opportunities are starting to emerge, they’re also warning it may be too soon to invest due to the U.S.-China trade tension and potential contagion from weaker markets.
“Asia EM valuations are below their historic 10-year average but can get cheaper,” said Paul Kitney, the chief strategist at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. “They are still some way above the post-global financial crisis low levels.”
The trading of late shows the risks: the Shanghai Composite Index has completely wiped out its rebound from the second half of August, closing at its lowest level since January 2016 on Tuesday. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index failed to maintain its gain, taking its year-to-date loss to 12 percent, the region’s worst after China.
While risks may peak ahead of the U.S. mid-term election, the tariffs rhetoric is likely to “get worse before it gets better,” Kitney said. Asian shares excluding Japan could face losses of up to 15 percent before any good news lifts the market, according to a Daiwa report published on Sept. 7 noting a 75 percent likelihood that the world’s biggest economies will reach a trade deal before November.
Frank Benzimra, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, says opportunities exist at the moment, but only in some specific areas. He sees value mainly in Chinese banks and sectors related to domestic consumption because investors have discounted bad news too excessively. For countries like Indonesia, it’s still “a little bit premature” to start to accumulating shares as the risk of contagion from weaker emerging markets remains.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) will provide $500 million over five years to promote economic opportunities in selected cities, including some outside the United States, the bank said Wednesday.
The program builds on urban renewal strategies that the bank funded in Detroit with $150 million starting in 2014. It has since taken the approaches to Chicago with $40 million and to Washington, D.C., with $25 million.
Half of the $500 million will be in philanthropic grants. The other half will provide low-cost, long-term development capital. The money will be used to teach job skills, finance small businesses of women and minority entrepreneurs, rebuild neighborhoods and to help families with their finances.
The funding comes as JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 62, has turned more of his attention to public policy and economic issues as chairman of the Business Roundtable.
""Businesses can and must step up to help change the status quo by creating a better future for all, no matter where they live,"" Dimon said in a statement. ""It is in our best interest and the right thing to do.""
JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion.
The new program will make ""large-scale investments"" in targeted cities where the bank believes ""conditions are right for success and broader, deeper investments are needed to drive inclusive growth,"" the bank said.
By the end of the year, the bank plans to name a ""global city"" for its first targeted urban investment outside of the United States.
JPMorgan wants to do more business abroad and already spends some of its corporate social responsibility funds outside of the United States.
In the new program, the bank is also challenging cities to submit bids for financing that would ""seed innovative solutions that help drive inclusive growth."" Previously, the bank did not have a formal process to evaluate requests from cities for money.
The bank looks for evidence of collaboration between public and private interests on renewal schemes in cities it supports.
Based on experience in other cities, the bank said it expects its $500 million will be matched by $1 billion of outside capital.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 11:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: TV ratings provider Nielsen expands review to include company sale,"By Joshua Franklin and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Nielsen Holdings Plc will expand a review of strategic alternatives to include a sale of the entire TV ratings company, the firm told Reuters on Tuesday, after coming under pressure to do so from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp.
Nielsen, best known for providing audience figures that are used to determine advertising rates for TV commercials, has been seeking to adapt to the media industry's shift to digital advertising and video consumption on mobile devices.
Nielsen said in a statement it was working with investment banks JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Guggenheim Securities LLC, as well as law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, on an ""expanded"" review of strategic alternatives.
The company had said previously it was only exploring a sale of its ""buy"" segment, which provides marketing data on what customers purchase, and not its ""watch"" segment, which offers viewership and listenership data and analytics across television, radio, online and mobile devices.
The expanded review includes an assessment of a broad range of options, including continuing to operate as a public, independent company, a separation of either Nielsen's buy or watch segment, or a sale of the company, Nielsen said, cautioning that no deal is certain. 
Elliott unveiled a stake in Nielsen last month and called on the company to explore a sale in its entirety. The hedge fund declined to comment on Tuesday.
Nielsen faces competition from start-ups using automated content recognition (ACR) to track viewing habits via mobile devices and smart TVs. It acquired Gracenote in 2017 in a bid to bolster its ACR capabilities. 
As viewer habits change, Nielsen has also made a move to cover shows watched on online streaming services, via platforms such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or via games consoles.
Nielsen is heavily indebted, the legacy of a leveraged buyout in 2006 by six private equity firms;  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) LP, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP, KKR & Co Inc, Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, AlpInvest Partners and Hellman & Friedman LLC. 
They took Nielsen public in 2011, and the company now has a market capitalization of $9.4 billion and total debt of $8.66 billion.
Nielsen has received some interest from private equity firms for a new leveraged buyout of the entire company, according to people familiar with the approaches who requested anonymity to discuss them.
However, such a deal would represent one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of recent years, and it is unclear whether such a transaction can be put together.
James Attwood, executive chairman of Nielsen's board, is leading the review, the company said.
Attwood is a managing director at Carlyle and the former head of its global telecommunications, media, and technology group, according to the company's website.
Nielsen said in July that is CEO Mitch Barns will step down at the end of the year. Attwood has been leading the search for Barns' successor.

Many measures this year have spurred temporary rebounds, but they’ve failed to really instill confidence in one of the world’s worst-performing markets. Just three weeks ago, state-backed funds purchased stocks in a move that helped trigger a two-day bounce after the benchmark first dipped below its 2016 closing low.
Hong Kong’s equity markets aren’t doing much better -- the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell into a bear market yesterday and was down 0.3 percent Wednesday.
The steps pale in comparison to policies and restrictions that the government imposed after the 2015 bubble burst, though those backfired as investors considered the moves too heavy-handed. This year’s rout is now nearing $2 trillion, which would be the nation’s biggest wipeout of wealth in any calendar year since the global financial crisis, according to Bloomberg data.
Stocks came under pressure from the government’s deleveraging drive, which triggered higher default rates and tighter liquidity, and then faced further challenges as the yuan weakened and a trade dispute blew up with the U.S. That means the reasons to sell far outweigh the valuation argument. Concern that China’s economy will slow is once again dominating sentiment, just as it did when the Shanghai Composite closed at the 2,655.661 level in January 2016.
It may take more that low multiples for the market to bottom this time round.

80,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>","The Aussie Is Increasingly Tied to China Risks, BNY Mellon Says","(Bloomberg) -- The link between Australia’s dollar and China’s stock market is now the tightest in more than a decade, illustrating the risks for the exchange rate as China decides how to respond to U.S. trade threats, according to Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp.
The Aussie became increasingly correlated with the markets of Australia’s biggest trading partner in 2015, when China hard-landing fears contributed to a collapse in that country’s stocks and its officials devalued the yuan. The correlation has been on the rise again since April, when U.S.-China trade tensions deteriorated, BNY Mellon analysis shows.
“The key question therefore when considering the AUD is how Chinese markets along with the CNY might react should a fresh announcement be made,” Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon wrote in a note to clients this week, using the currency tickers for the Aussie and the yuan. “This could prove a critical few weeks for the AUD.”
Australia’s dollar is particularly sensitive to any escalation of a trade dispute between the world’s two-largest economies as China buys more than a third of the nation’s exports. The Australian dollar is the second-worst performing major currency against the greenback this year. It traded at 71.04 U.S. cents as of 11:01 a.m. in Sydney, near the 2 1/2-year low it hit Tuesday.
Also undermining the Australian dollar has been an historically large gap between Australian and U.S. interest rates, thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping its benchmark at a record low while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy.
“Yield support for the currency has continued to deteriorate over the summer to, in many cases, the weakest levels in 20 years,” Derrick said of the Aussie.
Both dynamics -- trade tensions and rising U.S. interest rates -- have taken their toll on emerging markets, which may explain why those are also correlated with the Aussie, as you can read about here.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimated that the trade battle with the U.S. will likely cost China 700,000 jobs, and even more if the trade war escalates further. JP Morgan's Haibin Zhu told Bloomberg that the job losses might take place if the U.S. decides to impose 25% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports and Beijing retaliates by devaluing RMB by 5% and adding to levies on U.S. goods. He also said if China doesn’t retaliate, 3 million people could become unemployed.
If Washington follows through on Trump’s threat last Friday to slap 25% tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products, which would mean virtually all Chinese goods would be subject to levies, the job losses could be as high as 5.5 million and GDP growth could take a 1.3% hit drop in GDP growth.
China is also seeking World Trade Organization’s permission to sanction certain U.S. goods - up to $7 billion - as the latter allegedly failed to comply with a dispute ruling that indicated some of its anti-dumping rules to be illegal, according to a Tuesday statement.
Chinese stock markets closed mixed on Tuesday. The Shanghai Composite ended down by 0.05%, while the SZSE Component edged up 0.12% and the Hang Seng Index dropped by 0.27%.
The three markets extended their losses and gain on Wednesday morning. The Shanghai Composite went up 0.07% at 10:28PM ET (01:25 GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.62%, while Hong Kong is still in a bearish market, with a 0.27% drop.
The boost in U.S. tech and energy stocks is expected to bring optimism in Asian stock market. The S&P 500 rose 0.37% and Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.6% on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also went up by 0.44%.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI slid 0.11% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 lowered by 0.39%. Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.16%.

WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Hurricane Florence, on track to become the first Category 4 storm to make a direct hit on North Carolina in six decades, howled closer to shore on Tuesday, threatening to unleash deadly pounding surf, days of torrential rain and severe flooding.
Fierce winds and massive waves are expected to lash the coasts of North and South Carolina and Virginia even before Florence makes landfall on Friday, and its rains will take a heavy toll for miles inland, the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned. 
Although Florence was still days from arrival, authorities took extraordinary measures to move people out of harm's way. More than 1 million residents have been ordered to evacuate from coastal areas of the three states, closing university campuses, schools and factories.
Packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 km per hour), the storm ranked as a Category 4 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and was expected to grow stronger and larger over the next few days, the NHC said. 
""This storm is a monster,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said. ""Even if you've ridden out storms before, this one is different. Don't bet your life on riding out a monster.""
He cited forecasts showing Florence was likely to stall over North Carolina, ""bringing days and days of rain.""
To hasten evacuations from coastal South Carolina, officials reversed the flow of traffic on some highways so all major roads led away from shore. Miles of traffic slowed to a crawl along the main highway along North Carolina's Outer Banks barrier islands.
(GRAPHIC: Hurricane Florence heads toward Carolinas - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5m1v)
Maps of Florence's trajectory showed the center of the storm most likely to strike the southern coast of North Carolina. The last Category 4 hurricane to plow directly into North Carolina was Hazel in 1954, a devastating storm that killed 19 people and destroyed some 15,000 homes.
But NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen stressed the effects of Florence would be widely felt. Tropical storm-force winds would extend nearly 300 miles across three states. A hurricane warning was posted for most of the Carolina coast north to the Virginia border.
In addition to flooding the coast with wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet (4 m), Florence could dump 15 to 25 inches (38 to 64 cm) of rain, with up to 35 inches (89 cm) in some spots, forecasters said.
LONG-TERM POWER OUTAGES POSSIBLE
Communities in Florence's path could be without electricity for weeks due to downed power lines and flooded equipment, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long said.
Utility companies deployed crews and gear in advance, according to trade group, the Edison Electric Institute. Workers from at least 15 states were en route to the region to assist with what could be a lengthy power restoration effort. 
Crews also prepared 16 nuclear reactors in the three-state region for the storm. One power station,  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) Corp's Brunswick plant, the closest to the area where landfall is forecast, faced a likely shutdown as a precaution. Shutdowns also were possible at two more plants in the path of predicted hurricane-force winds.
The American Red Cross said more than 700 workers were headed to the target area while shelters were set up to take in those who could not evacuate. A hospital in Hampton, Virginia, was transferring patients to safer places.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed declarations of emergency for North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, freeing up federal resources for storm response. 
""We are sparing no expense. We are totally prepared,"" Trump said at the White House.
Trump faced severe criticism for his administration's response to Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico. Some 3,000 people died in the aftermath of that storm.
COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
Days before its arrival, Florence was already disrupting commercial operations.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co suspended work on Tuesday at the South Carolina plant where it assembles 787 widebody jetliners, and a Volvo automobile plant in South Carolina's evacuation zone was also closed, company officials said.
Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] said it would shut down the world's largest hog-slaughtering facility in Tar Heel, North Carolina, on Thursday and Friday due to the hurricane.
Residents prepared by boarding up their homes and stocking up on food, water and other essentials, stripping many grocery store shelves of merchandise. Some gasoline stations also ran low on fuel. 
Not everyone was in a hurry to leave. Charles Mullen, 81, a longtime resident of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, said he had ridden out many storms and that most locals were planning to stay unless Florence took aim at Hatteras. 

""If it decides to come here, we're gone,"" he said.

83,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 09:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Carlyle Group in talks to buy Sedgwick Claims - sources,"By David French and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Private equity firm  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) is in talks to acquire Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc, the largest U.S. insurance claims service provider, for more than $6 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Private equity firms have been prolific investors in businesses that help companies cut costs by outsourcing large parts of their administrative functions, since such operations can generate strong cash flows. A few years after they invest, they seek to sell ownership of those assets at a big profit.
Carlyle has made a higher offer for Sedgwick than buyout firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, a former owner of the company that is also competing to acquire it, the sources said, cautioning that the outcome had not been finalized and no deal is certain.
Sedwick's owners, buyout firm KKR & Co LP (N:KKR), Stone Point Capital and Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), are hoping they can clinch a deal as early as this week, the sources said. In an unusual move that limited the participation of investment banks in the deal, KKR's capital market arm is underwriting a large chuck of the financing for the potential buyer, one of the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Sedgwick and Carlyle declined to comment, while KKR, Hellman & Friedman, Stone Point and CDPQ did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Founded in 1969, Memphis-based Sedgwick has traditionally focused on claims management, but has been expanding into other areas of risk and benefits solutions in recent years. It now processes claims for a wide range of insurance product lines, including workers' compensation, general liability and disability.
Since KKR took over Sedgwick in 2014 in a $2.4 billion deal, Sedgwick has been expanding its operations beyond North America. Its acquisition of loss adjuster Cunningham Lindsey earlier this year expanded its footprint into more than 60 countries.

Carlyle has carried out several investments in the insurance sector, most recently agreeing in August to buy nearly 20 percent of reinsurance business DSA Re from American International Group Inc (N:AIG).

Leigh Day said in a statement https://www.leighday.co.uk/News/News-2018/September-2018/Morrisons-facing-equal-pay-claim-worth-over-1-bill that Morrisons has around 80,000 store staff eligible to claim, which could result in a bill for back pay of over 1 billion pounds if the retailer's action are found unlawful. 
The law firm, which is already working on claims on behalf of 30,000 workers in Asda, Sainsbury's and  Tesco  (LON:TSCO) Plc said in February that Tesco was facing a potential bill of up to 4 billion pounds in an equal pay claim involving women workers at its British stores.
""We believe that Morrisons, as with the other major supermarkets, has underpaid those working in its stores for a number of years,"" Emma Satyamurti, a partner in Leigh Day, said in the statement. ""The big four supermarkets in the UK make vast amounts each year in profits – it is time that they faced up to their legal obligations under Equal Pay legislation."" 
Morrisons was asked by the law firm if it carried out an equal pay audit, Leigh Day said.
A spokesperson for Morrisons said: “We are not aware of any court proceedings issued by a third party. We have received a letter asking us a number of questions about our pay policies. Our aim is to pay our colleagues fairly and equally for the job that they do, irrespective of their gender.”
Leigh Day also said it believed employees working in male-dominated distribution centers were paid considerably more than largely female-staffed stores.

(The story corrects third paragraph to show that 4 billion pound claim is for Tesco alone.)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Chicago fund manager cannot pursue a lawsuit against a  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) unit over claims the bank cost the fund manager millions by forcing it to sell its holdings during a February market rout, a judge ruled on Tuesday.
LJM Partners Ltd, run by Anthony Caine, returned investors' money after its complex trades failed spectacularly in the Feb. 5 reversal of fortune in U.S. stocks and related markets that some investors called ""vol-mageddon."" Funds run by LJM and an affiliate saw losses of 80 percent or more.
The fund would not have suffered such extreme losses had Wells Fargo Securities LLC (WFS) not directed it to sell its holdings immediately after initial losses and at depressed prices, LJM said in response to a March lawsuit by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo disputed that it had forced the liquidation.
Wells Fargo said it had been required to cover the company's margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. LJM denied those claims and countersued in May.
But United States District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said contracts between Wells Fargo and LJM provided ""broad authority"" for the bank to tell the fund to trade when the market is stressed.
""The agreement provides broad authority for WFS to terminate the agreement and direct LJM to liquidate its open positions - even through specific trades,"" Forrest wrote.
A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo and lawyers for LJM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Wells Fargo's lawsuit against LJM is ongoing. Investors are suing Caine and Anish Parvataneni, a portfolio manager at the company who previously worked for well-known fund investor Ken Griffin's Citadel, over what they said were inadequate disclosures about the risks of LJM's approach.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 07:15PM ET</span>","HSBC to bolster Asia private banking headcount, double client assets","By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) aims to increase its Asia private banking headcount by two-thirds in five years and double client assets in eight as it eyes a bigger share of the business in the world's fastest-growing wealth market, top executives said.
The lender's private banking expansion plan in Asia, which accounted for 75 percent of group-level profit last year, comes as the unit that caters to the rich is focusing once more on growth after years of painful restructuring.
""Asia is the key driver for future profitability in the private bank ... it's been the driver for growth even through the difficult times and it's always remained profitable,"" Peter Boyles, CEO of HSBC's global private banking business, told Reuters.
HSBC's Asia private bank will add 700 people by 2022 from a headcount of 1,100 at the end of 2017. The increase will add staff in various roles including relationship managers, product specialists and family wealth planners, said Siew Meng Tan, Asia Pacific head of private banking.
HSBC's global private banking business manages $330 billion worth of clients assets, and Asia accounts for 39 percent of the total, making it the single largest market for the bank.
It also aims to double Asia-based client assets by 2025, in-line with consultant Capgemini's overall wealth growth forecast in the region over the same period, as it expands its presence in the banking hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore and also vies for a bigger share of offshore Chinese wealth, Tan said. 
Asia has emerged as the main battleground for global wealth managers, with higher economic growth, rapidly rising wages and a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem producing rich clients at a pace faster than the western world.
Asia Pacific accounts for 34 percent of the world population of high networth individuals, or those having investable assets of $1 million or more, and 31 percent of their wealth - ahead of North America, as per Capgemini's 2018 wealth report.
GROWTH MODE 
Clients with more than $5 million of investable assets are served by the bank's private banking unit, while those with less than that threshold are taken up by HSBC's retail banking and wealth management division. 
HSBC's private banking business had a torrid time following embarrassing data leaks in 2008 allegedly showing tax evasion by clients, prompting probes into the tax affairs of some of its Swiss account holders in a number of European countries.
The bank in 2015 admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss private bank in the period up to 2007. It has since then taken significant steps to implement global standards and tax transparency initiatives.
The private banking unit, which brought in just over 3 percent of the bank's adjusted global revenues in 2017, shrunk its footprint and exited some clients in the last few years as it sharpened its focus on compliance and profitability.
""We have done the repositioning work and we are now seeing net growth coming through because the drag effect from business exits has now diminished,"" said Boyles, who took over his current role in 2012 and spearheaded the restructuring.

""We actually had a first year of growth for many years, both in assets under management and in net profit, in 2017. And moving into 2018 we have seen continued progress,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Complaints about British payday lender CashEuroNet UK shot up by more than 200 percent in the first half of this year - more than double the rate that drove rival Wonga into administration, data published on Wednesday showed. 
Wonga, Britain's most well-known lender offering short-term, high interest loans, often to troubled borrowers, collapsed in August after being hit with a deluge of compensation claims from customers.
But the data, from the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which adjudicates on disputes between consumers and financial services firms, shows that in the six months to June CashEuroNet UK, owned by U.S. lender Enova International (N:ENVA), received more complaints than Wonga for the first time in recent years. 
Its brands QuickQuid and Pound to Pocket together racked up 4,561 customer complaints, up from 1,447 in the previous six months and more than the 4,513 the FOS received against Wonga. 
The data reflects how others in the industry, already struggling after the imposition of tighter regulation, could be vulnerable as firms that help consumers make claims turn their attention toward payday loans.
""Given the role that claims management companies had in putting Wonga under, it is likely that they will now be circling on the other payday lenders,"" said Colin Jackson, financials analyst at Goodbody. 
In its most recent results filing, Enova International warned that it had incurred significant costs as a result of the increase in complaints, adding that the FOS had been strict in its interpretation of the rules. 
""If the FOS continues to issue findings in this manner, and we are required to continue making significant payments to resolve complaints, such findings could again have a material adverse effect on our business,"" the filing said.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
CashEuroNet UK's UK managing director Nick Drew said it was committed to good lending practices and treating customers fairly. 
""Our business is profitable and growing, and we remain excited about the opportunities, especially in light of the diminished competition in the market,"" he said in an emailed statement. 
However, the firm's net income fell from 18.3 million pounds in 2015 to 11.2 million pounds in 2016, according to its most recent accounts. 
Across the industry, profits have fallen in recent years after the Financial Conduct Authority capped the level of interest they could charge following pressure from critical lawmakers and campaigners. 
Complaints are also costly. The FOS charges financial services firms 550 pounds every time it investigates a case. 
When a complaint is successful, firms are usually asked to refund the interest, fees and charges to the consumer, an ombudsman spokesman said, although in some circumstances businesses will also be asked to write off the debt. 
He added that the number of complaints upheld against payday lenders was consistently high, averaging at around 60 percent and rising as high as 75 percent for some firms. 
The risk a spike in complaints poses to payday lenders is further evidence of the fact they are ""heavily dependent on an accommodating regulator"", Jackson said.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. regulators reject Wells Fargo's plan to repay customers - sources,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have rejected  Wells Fargo  & Co's (N:WFC) plan to repay customers who were pushed into unnecessary auto insurance, telling the bank it must do more to ensure it has found and compensated every affected driver, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Wells Fargo gave regulators the plan in June, as required by a $1 billion settlement the bank reached with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April.
After reviewing the plan - which could involve contacting some 600,000 drivers - the OCC told Wells Fargo it needed more assurances that the bank would find and repay everyone who was overcharged, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the rejection.
The rejection is the latest wrinkle in Wells Fargo's long-running sales scandal, which began in September 2016 with revelations that the bank had opened perhaps millions of accounts in customers' names without permission to hit aggressive sales targets.
Since then, Wells has disclosed more customer abuses in businesses including mortgage lending, wealth management and the auto loans at issue here. 
Representatives for Wells Fargo, the OCC and the CFPB declined to comment.
Drivers who bought a car through Wells Fargo and let their insurance lapse could be charged for ""forced-place"" policies. Wells enrolled about 2 million drivers into such policies and more than a quarter of those were not needed, officials have said.
Customers who were charged for unneeded insurance could face overdraft fees, damaged credit or vehicle repossession. As part of its settlement agreement, Wells Fargo had to review several years' worth of bank and insurance paperwork for those customers.
Although Wells Fargo gave regulators details on the number of customers harmed, what financial consequences they suffered and how the bank planned to compensate them, the OCC wants to see work behind the calculations before it will approve the plan, the sources said. The regulator also wants an explanation of how workers are performing day-to-day remediation tasks, they said.
The OCC does not have a deadline for when it must approve the plan, but Wells Fargo cannot finish its work without that all-clear from regulators.
It is not unusual for banks and regulators to haggle over the fine print of a settlement, and large banks tend to satisfy regulator demands quickly after a large penalty, said the sources and former officials.

Last year, Wells Fargo estimated that it would need $64 million to pay back customers but lawyers representing drivers say that estimate is way too low.

1. Wholesale Inflation Expected to Climb
The economy will remain in focus tomorrow, with the earnings calendar pretty barren.
The government will report the latest figures on wholesale inflation at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
The producer price index (PPI) is forecast to have risen 0.2% in August and 3.2% year on year. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is predicted to have risen 0.2% as well, with a year-on-year gain of 2.7%.
Wholesale inflation is a leading indicator, as price gains on the supplier level later move down to the cash register. A bigger-than-expected rise in the PPI could boost the odds for the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, in addition to the September hike expected.
2. Beige Book and Fed Speakers on Calendar
Later in the day there will be more insight into the Fed’s thinking.
The Fed’s Beige Book assessment of economic conditions in each of the central bank’s districts comes out at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
Ahead of that, at 9:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will speak on the economy and monetary policy at the CFA Society in Chicago.
And Fed Governor Lael Brainard will address the Detroit Economic Club at 12:45 PM ET (16:45 GMT).
There is currently more than an 83% that the Fed will also raise rates in December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Apple's Event Building Tech Excitement

Apple rose about 2.5% Tuesday in anticipation of what it might unveil tomorrow at 10:00 AM PT (17:00 GMT).
The highlight of the Apple event will be the trio of new smartphones the tech giant will launch including the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and the lower priced LCD iPhone, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note to clients.
Apple has found itself in the crosshairs of the U.S.-China trade dispute, with President Donald Trump saying the company would be wise to make its components in the United States to avoid tariffs.

Tech stocks have made a strong start to the week after suffering heavy losses last week, amid concerns over increased regulation on social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Energy, meanwhile, also pushed the broader averages higher as oil prices rose, led by strong gains in gas prices as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the U.S. East Coast gasoline markets.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for October delivery rose 2.5% to settle at $69.25 a barrel.
President Donald Trump said he expects that Hurricane Florence will be one of the worst storms in decades and urged everybody to ""get out"" if they are in the path of the storm.
Still, gains in stocks were limited on investor worries over trade tensions, as China's pledge to retaliate against U.S. tariffs served as a reminder that the U.S-China trade war, which threatens global growth, is far from over.
China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) Tuesday it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States, citing Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties, Reuters reported.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), viewed as a trade bellwether given its large international exposure, managed to sidestep trade tensions as the aircraft maker reported a rise in airplane deliveries in August compared with the previous month, owing to robust demand for its popular 737 model.
Investor appetite for risker assets like stocks, meanwhile, was helped by ongoing signs of U.S. labor market strength as job openings surged to the highest level since 2000.
The U.S. Labor Department's latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in August improved to about 6.939 million, beating expectations of 6.646 million.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares gave up some of the gains from Monday as Nomura delivered its most bearish view yet on the automaker's stock, which it claimed was no longer ""investable,"" citing CEO Elon Musk's ""erratic"" behavior.
In corporate earnings news, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO), maker of high-end sound systems, struggled to escape a wave of selling pressure after it delivered a mixed fiscal third-quarter performance. Revenues arrrived in line with estimates, while losses were steeper than anticipated.

Its plunge at the open dragged down an index that tracks currencies across developing nations.
The real and Brazil’s benchmark stock index were the worst performers among emerging market peers after a poll showed left-wing candidates gaining support, while backing for those favored by investors stalled less than a month before the vote. MSCI Inc’s index of currencies fell as much as 0.2 percent, while stocks retreated as much as 1.1 percent.
With about four weeks left before the first-round vote in Brazil’s election, the outlook for the race remains uncertain. The political drama, which has included the stabbing of one candidate and an appeal against the jail sentence of another, has exacerbated the negative sentiment toward risky assets against a backdrop of a rising dollar, the rollback of stimulus packages and escalating trade tensions.
Emerging markets, which were the darlings of 2017, have also been hit by a raft of idiosyncratic risks including Argentina’s fiscal woes and Turkey’s twin deficits.
Turkey’s central bank signaled last week that higher rates are in the offing, while Russia’s Governor Elvira Nabiullina surprised markets by saying the first rate hike since 2014 could be discussed when policy makers next meet. The new head of the monetary-policy department at the Russian central bank, Alexey Zabotkin, subsequently offered a less hawkish message.
“Investors are waiting for monetary policy meetings, with the largest focus this week being Turkey’s,” said Toru Nishihama, a Tokyo-based emerging-market economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. “The EM sell-off is probably not over yet. We’ve still got the Fed’s rate hike in the horizon after this week as well.”

100,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","On NAFTA, Nissan U.S. chief says: 'We're heavily American'","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (T:7201) North American division chief said on Tuesday that the Japanese automaker is awaiting details of the U.S.-Mexican trade agreement but is confident it can comply with its rules because it assembles around 1 million vehicles annually in the United States.
""We are not just importing cars from abroad... we are very, very, very heavily American,"" Denis Le Vot told Reuters during a visit to Detroit. ""We have all the basics here; we're producing locally with local steel and local content.""
Nissan makes a range of vehicles at plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, including its popular Rogue crossover, Titan pickup trucks and the Altima midsize sedan. Nissan also builds a number of vehicles in Mexico, including the Sentra and Versa sedans.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he is prepared to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, last month struck a bilateral trade deal with Mexico. 
Talks are ongoing between the U.S. and Canadian governments to salvage NAFTA.
The deal with Mexico would require 75 percent of auto content to be made in the NAFTA region, up from the current level of 62.5 percent, and would require 40 percent to 45 percent of auto content to be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour.
Precise details on how those benchmarks would be calculated have not yet been published.
""We're working actively with the U.S. government and Mexican government to get all the details,"" Le Vot said. ""Only when we get them can we say 'OK, this is what we have to do.'""
""We can only hope it's going to be good for business, good for suppliers and dealers, good for our employees and more importantly for the customer and the market,"" he added.
Le Vot said after a difficult transition last year to its new-year model vehicles, Nissan has reduced inventories and is poised to grow its retail market share in the second half of the year.
Nissan's inventory is currently around 230,000 vehicles, down from 300,000 vehicles a year ago. The company has also been reducing low-margin fleet sales and Le Vot said new vehicles like its small Kicks crossover and a revamped Altima should help boost sales.
""This is a very good opportunity to grow the retail market share,"" Le Vot said.

The automaker's U.S. sales rose 4.4 percent in August versus the same month in 2017, but are down 4.8 percent year to date.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",German ministry seeks data on quicker fighter jet deliveries,"By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German military has asked potential bidders in a high-stakes competition to replace its aging Tornado fighter jets about accelerating deliveries of new warplanes before an initial target date of 2025, sources familiar with the matter said.
The defense ministry posed the question in early August in a follow-up to its initial request for information from Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) and Boeing (N:BA), both from the United States, the sources said.
The ministry had no comment on the latest twist in a tender that could be worth billions of euros. One of the sources said the request signaled concerns about the growing cost of servicing the current fleet of 85 operational Tornado jets.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen says she favors a European solution - the Eurofighter Typhoon built by Airbus, Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo SpA (MI:LDOF) - but Lockheed and Boeing still hope for a chance to bid for the work.
Airbus and the U.S. government submitted data this spring about the four fighter jet models under consideration - the Eurofighter, Lockheed's F-35, and the Boeing F/A-18E/F or F-15E.
Germany is studying a number of options, including buying one type of jet to replace the Tornado jets, a split buy of two aircraft types, and a service life extension of the Tornado jets, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.
Germany has also asked Washington for information about the possibility of leasing Boeing F-15 fighter jets, two sources said, although that is seen as an unlikely outcome.
Von der Leyen in July said she expected a preliminary decision on the next steps by the end of the year.
POSSIBLE SPLIT BUY?
One proposal calls for Germany to buy 40-45 Lockheed F-35 jets to replace those Tornados that can carry nuclear bombs, and about 75 new Eurofighters to replace both the other Tornados and a first batch of Eurofighters delivered between 2003 and 2008.
Buying F-35s would allow Germany to keep a mixed fleet of fighter jets, a key requirement in its military strategy, while averting costly and time-consuming modifications to the process of certifying the Eurofighter to carry nuclear bombs.
Although not a nuclear power, Germany hosts some U.S. nuclear warheads under NATO's nuclear-sharing policy and operates a number of Tornado warplanes that can deliver them. 
The U.S. has told Germany it could take 12 to 18 months to study the Eurofighter certification issue.
German industry executives are pressing for quick answers, given that the already high cost of keeping the Tornado jets flying could rise once Britain and Italy phase out their fleets.
""The cost of spare parts and operations keeps going up,"" one industry executive said.

102,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 01:29PM ET</span>",U.S. to probe India's Mahindra over Fiat Chrysler Jeep complaint,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator said on Tuesday it would launch an investigation into an off-road utility vehicle produced by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd following a complaint by  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV that it infringed upon the intellectual property rights of its Jeep design.
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) said in a statement that it was launching a patent-related investigation into the India automaker's ROXOR vehicle.
The ITC said the complaint was related to the import and sale in the United States of certain motorized vehicles and components that Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA) had alleged infringed on its trademarks. The agency said it would aim to complete its probe within 45 days.
Representatives of Mahindra and Fiat Chrysler could not immediately be reached for comment.
Last month, Mahindra (NS:MAHN) said that Fiat Chrysler had filed a patent violation complaint with the ITC against the company and called the complaint without merit.
Mahindra said that it and its North American unit had filed a public interest statement with the ITC and had begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it had executed with Fiat Chrysler in 2009.
Mahindra was seeking an injunction against Fiat Chrysler from proceeding with the complaint, it added.

Fiat Chrysler had not made a monetary claim in the complaint but was seeking to block Mahindra Automotive from importing any parts or components into the United States that infringe upon Fiat Chrysler's intellectual property rights, it said.

103,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Low Rates Adding Risk to Global Financial System, CIBC CEO Says","(Bloomberg) -- Canada should boost immigration and competitiveness to shield itself from the rising risks of low interest rates, according to the head of the country’s fifth-largest lender.
“Interest rates have been very low for a very long time. Perhaps too long,"" Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig said Tuesday in a Toronto speech. “The same low-rate environment that helped the world recover from the crisis of 2008 is now infusing risk into the global financial system -- and could generate headwinds for us.""
Debt, productivity and competitiveness were the themes of a speech by Dodig, 53, in which he called on the federal government to do more to insulate Canada from potential economic headwinds a decade after the global financial crisis.
Global debt increased by $25 trillion between March 2017 and March this year -- lifting total personal, government and corporate debt to about $247 trillion globally, Dodig said. Emerging countries have borrowed in U.S. dollars to finance growth and development, drawn by low interest rates, Dodig noted.
“The U.S. dollar is strengthening and interest rates are going up,"" he said. “This has caused turmoil as equities in some emerging markets have fallen sharply as investors flee to less risky alternatives.""
Emerging Markets
He’s seeing some similarities today in Turkey, Argentina and Indonesia to 1998, when substantial foreign debt fueled currency depreciation that added to economic stress.
“Many did not and do not fully appreciate the implications of the foreign-denominated debt issue,"" Dodig said. “There has been tremendous growth in the debt market, and cracks are starting to appear in certain areas.""
Canada can insulate itself from the next economic slowdown by doing more to expand the economy and focusing on long-term competitiveness, the CEO said. Increasing immigration is a good place to start, he said.
Canada also needs to attract more foreign investment. A drop in foreign direct investment to the lowest level since 2010 is partly due to U.S. tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, as well as trade uncertainty, but Dodig also points to internal factors, including debate over Trans Mountain Pipeline.
“The ongoing conflict broadcast to the world, sends a message of uncertainty,"" he said.
Trade Barriers
Dodig said business leaders and clients around the world tell him the same thing about Canada: the regulatory burden is too high and lack of clarity on foreign investment rules are hampering their ability to invest.
He said Canada can do three things to improve competitiveness: the federal government should let companies expense capital investments with a one-year period, like the U.S.; remove interprovincial trade barriers; and invest in infrastructure.
“Today, the global economy is strong,” Dodig said. “Our national economy is doing well. But there are economic storm clouds ahead, which suggest for both caution and action."""
104,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>","Tech, energy stocks lift Wall Street","By Shreyashi Sanyal
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks powered higher on Tuesday, shaking off a subdued start, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led a jump in technology stocks and a rise in oil prices lifted energy companies.
Apple rose 2.4 percent, boosting the three major indexes, a day ahead of an highly anticipated event in which the company is expected to unveil new iPhone models.
The technology sector rose 0.82 percent, on pace for its biggest jump in two weeks, also boosted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which were up about 1.5 percent.
""Technology stocks are rallying with some positive catalysts like the Apple event coming up,"" said Cliff Hodge, director of investments at Cornerstone Wealth in Charlotte North Carolina.
""The sectors which have been the natural leaders, like tech, are catching a bid this morning, with some lift from energy stocks that will help buoy the markets.""
The energy index was up 1.27 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, as oil prices rose after U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports and tightened global supply. 
Still trade tensions continued to linger after China told the World Trade Organization it wanted to impose sanctions on the United States for its non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties.
President Donald Trump had on Friday threatened to slap tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports.
At 13:07 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 146.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 26,003.94, the S&P 500 was up 13.00 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,890.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 46.13 points, or 0.58 percent, at 7,970.29.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 12:39PM ET</span>","Boeing 737 deliveries rebound in August to 48, from July low","By Eric M. Johnson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Tuesday it delivered 48 of its best-selling 737 single-aisle aircraft in August, bouncing back from the 29 it delivered in July, the fewest in years.
Deliveries at the world's biggest planemaker have been delayed as unfinished aircraft pile up at its Renton, Washington plant as a result of production bottlenecks at its suppliers that have disrupted manufacturing.
Boeing's 737 and Airbus' (PA:AIR) A320 family of single-aisle jetliners are the cash cows of the two aircraft makers, the world's largest.
""Our team made good progress in August and we're focused on fully recovering the delivery schedule by the end of the year,"" Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said.
While monthly delivery figures can fluctuate, the numbers give a snapshot of how far behind Boeing is delivering planes against its production target of 52 narrowbodies per month. Deliveries are crucial to planemakers because that is when airlines pay most of what they owe for the aircraft.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Rajeev Lalwani said 737 deliveries were above his estimate of 30 to 35 units, and made him feel more confident about Boeing's ability to hit its 2018 targets.
The snarl in Renton, fueled by shortages of engines and fuselages as Boeing sped production to record levels in June, is likely to hurt third-quarter results and threatens to hinder its efforts to boost build rates again in 2019, some analysts said after meetings in the Seattle area last week.
Boeing largely attributes the logjam to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).
As it works to clear the backlog, Boeing has deployed about 600 employees from other facilities to the Renton site, and sent engineering teams to suppliers, the company said. 
Boeing has also started hiring back retired workers on a temporary basis, Reuters reported on Monday.
The retirees will get $500 monthly bonuses in addition to wages while also continuing to receive their pension payments, a union official said. 
Boeing executives said last week 2018 cash flow projections, a measure closely watched by investors, would remain unchanged, as would its goal to speed up production again in 2019, analysts said.
Monthly 737 deliveries totaled 48, down from 50 a year ago, Boeing said. Total plane deliveries were 64 in August, compared with 66 units a year earlier and 39 units in July.
Boeing said its total 2018 net orders were 581 aircraft through August, up from 487 planes toward the end of July.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Retired hedge fund boss Martin Taylor says he plans to get back in the game,"By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - British investor Martin Taylor, who closed his $1.5 billion hedge fund Nevsky Capital and retired at 46, plans to get back in the market with a fresh perspective and a new firm.
In December 2015, Taylor and co-founder Nick Barnes told investors it was not likely they could reproduce past gains and gave clients their money back.
It was a rare move in the industry and it came after a volatile year in financial markets with falls in oil, commodities and emerging markets.
In a colorful letter to investors, Taylor said Nevsky's future returns would be hampered by distorted macroeconomic data, the rise of highly unpredictable nationalist governments and algorithmic funds exacerbating volatility in stocks.
But, after nearly three years out, he is launching London-based global long-short equities hedge fund Crake Asset Management in October 2019 to bet on shares and trade underlying commodities.
The strategy mirrors that of Nevsky.
""I did retire and I did say I was never going to come back and I absolutely did mean it at the time, but obviously I've now changed my mind,"" said Taylor, 49, who has spent the past two years teaching and trading his own money.
""With hindsight, what I realized is I was exhausted. I'd been running a hedge fund manager for more than 15 years,"" he told Reuters. ""Now, I've had a two-and-a-half-year sabbatical, it's left me refreshed and I want to do this for another 15 years.""
Two investors who declined to be identified told Reuters they welcomed the move. 
The rise of algorithmic trading during his break meant that by the time he returns markets may be closer to a tipping point at which it will become easier for a fund like his to make money, he said.
""The increasing dominance of passive investors will eventually make underlying markets more inefficient because there will be fewer and fewer genuinely active managers in the market,"" he said.
""FIRST LOVE""
At his new firm, Taylor will be joined by co-founders Yuri Maslov, a former partner at Nevsky, and Richard Walker, who has previously worked at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), according to filings with Britain's Companies House.
Taylor will be the fund's chief investment officer and manager while Maslov will be head of research and Walker chief operating officer and co-manager.
Crake will also be adding four to five analysts over the next several months, and aims to have the team in place in April. It will begin accepting outside money from Oct. 1. 2019.
""Having had 2.5 years off, I’m very keen to get back to my first love but I want to do it properly. That is why it won’t be another year until I take money from clients,"" he said. ""I need to build and train my team first.""
Nevsky Fund Plc's assets peaked at $3.6 billion and it returned 18.4 percent annually net of fees over 15 years. Its average peer returned 2.5 percent over the same time period, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed.
Nevsky was launched in 2000 by Taylor, Barnes and Rory Landman, who left the business in 2005 and is now senior bursar at Trinity College, Cambridge.
Taylor is a fan of West Ham United soccer club and he opposed Britain's departure from the European Union. He donated around 745,000 pounds to Britain's Labour party between 2012 and 2017, according to Electoral Commission data.
""I'm absolutely going to remain in Britain regardless of what happens with Brexit,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) is seeing the impact of a global trade war in Asia, where geopolitical jitters are prompting investors to trade less, Wealth Management Co-President Martin Blessing told Reuters on Tuesday.
Growing trade tensions have especially weighed on business in China, where investor worries have seen Chinese equities fall this year, the Swiss-based co-head of the world's largest wealth manager said in an interview.
""The U.S. is still going very strong, while the Chinese stock market is quite down this year if you look at the Shanghai index,"" Blessing said. ""Investors in Asia see more negative impact of the trade debate and are more worried about it.""
Falling markets tend to lead to less trading as clients become more risk averse, and also reduce the net interest income and fees the bank is able to generate as investment volumes and deposits go down.
""When markets are going down people tend to trade less – not more,"" Blessing said. ""We are clearly closer to the end of the cycle than the beginning.""
The bank believes the trade war debates will extend beyond U.S. mid-term elections in November, Blessing warned, so tensions and the global economic impact may yet rise.
The bank, however, takes a mid- to long-term view in determining investment allocations, as opposed to reacting to rapidly shifting discussions which have a short-term impact.
Blessing took over UBS's international wealth management business, offering private banking to millionaires and billionaires outside North America, in January, the same month it announced it would merge its two regional divisions into one global team. 
He had led the global business jointly with his U.S.-based counterpart Tom Naratil since February.
Over the past three years, the bank's net new money growth of 2.1 to 2.2 percent has fallen at the lower end of the 2-4 percent target for 2018 to 2020 instated earlier this year. 
Its non-U.S. wealth management unit had previously targeted growth of 3-5 percent, while its Wealth Management Americas unit had targeted 2-4 percent growth.

It will provide an investor update in London on Oct. 25.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 11:27AM ET</span>",Former Volkswagen boss dragged feet in emissions scandal: judge,"By Jan Schwartz
BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) boss Martin Winterkorn was slow to address emissions test cheating that led to huge U.S. fines, a judge hearing a damages case brought by investors against the German carmaker said on Tuesday. 
The question of who knew what, and when, will be vital in determining the outcome of the suit in which investors are seeking 9.2 billion euros ($10.6 billion) in damages for share price losses suffered when the scandal became public.
Separately, a consumer rights group said it would file a class-action lawsuit on Wednesday against VW over the manipulation of emissions software, seeking compensation for up to 2 million owners of affected diesel models.
The plaintiffs in the first case say Volkswagen (VW) failed in its duty to inform them about the financial impact of the scandal, which broke when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a so-called notice of violation on Sept. 18, 2015.
Judge Christian Jaede said then-CEO Winterkorn had dragged his feet after a top-level management meeting two months earlier discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators who were threatening to ban VW because of excessive pollution levels. The plaintiffs say that from this moment, Winterkorn was aware of the cheating. 
""Anyone acting in good faith would have followed up on this information,"" Jaede said on the second day of hearings into the case at the Braunschweig higher regional court. ""This appears not to have happened.""
It was not clear, the judge added, why the company had not put out a statement after establishing that engine software had been manipulated to get around emissions tests.
The judge also said it was reasonable to take the view that Winterkorn knew about the emissions cheating far earlier.
However, Thomas Liebscher, a lawyer for VW, said it would be unfair to assume the chief executive knew how the company's engine management software worked.
Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than VW had officially admitted. His lawyer was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.
The 71-year old faces U.S. criminal charges, filed in May, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the 'dieselgate' scandal. VW has also said it may seek damages from him.
PUBLIC DUTY
The plaintiffs say VW failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines so far.
Had investors known about VW's cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue. VW shares lost up to 37 percent in value in the days after the scandal broke. 
The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities. 
Jaede said this would only have been legitimate if a settlement could have been reached quickly and VW had cooperated with the U.S. authorities to the best of its efforts. 
The judge told the opening day of the trial that VW's decision between 2005 and 2007 to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal, but it was not clear that the intent was to deceive investors.
Fund manager Deka Investment brought the case, known in German as a Musterklage, or specimen claim. The outcome of the case could apply to a further 1,670 similar shareholder claims.
It's possible that claims covering incidents prior to 2012 may not be valid under the statute of limitations, the judge said on Monday. The case is expected to continue into next year and may end up before a higher court.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","UK, EU aviation regulators should be allowed to start Brexit planning: trade body","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's aerospace trade body ADS has written to the European Commission for the second time in four months to urge it once again to allow British and European airline regulators to begin technical planning for Brexit. 
Aviation is one sector that could be most severely impacted by Brexit, as there is no default fallback option for the industry if there is no agreement on future relations after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.
ADS said in a letter that bilateral discussions between the UK Civil Aviation Agency and European Aviation Safety Agency EASA were needed to ensure passenger safety, amongst other things. It said technical bilateral talks had already been held between the CAA and regulators in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. 
""As long as the Commission blocks similar bilateral technical discussions between the CAA and EASA, it fosters uncertainty and risks legal liability, insurance and passenger safety issues for the global aviation and aerospace industry,"" ADS said in a letter addressed to the European Commission. 
""Allowing discussions now would significantly reduce potential for disruption to EU businesses and consumers,"" it added. 
Britain has said it wants to remain part of EASA after leaving the bloc on March 29, 2019 but it is not clear whether this will be possible.
Concerns are building within the aviation industry about a potential no-deal Brexit scenario which could result in flights being grounded and Britain needing to take over safety and regulatory processes currently handled by EASA. 
ADS first requested that British and European airline regulators be allowed to begin technical planning for Brexit in June, but that request was rejected the following month. The trade body says the British government has also made the same request.
Separately on Tuesday, Sky News reported that the CAA is making plans to reissue pilot licenses and other related documents if the UK is no longer part of EASA after Brexit.
The CAA could not immediately be reached for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - One of Brexit's most fervent supporters, the planemaker Britten-Norman, is now complaining about Britain's handling of its planned exit from the European Union and is considering moving some functions into the EU or to the United States.
The CEO of the privately owned firm, which builds the 10-seater Islander aircraft, a stalwart of Caribbean island hopping, said whatever happens the company will remain largely British-based. But lack of clarity over the future relationship with the EU has forced it into an uncomfortable position. 
""What we have is assurances from the UK government that nothing is going to change after March next year ... but in terms of trying to bank on that, I can't bank on that,"" William Hynett, who has run the London-headquartered company for 15 years, said in an interview. 
""There would be those there who are probably unkind enough to say, well, you wanted this outcome, so tough luck,"" he said.
The company did ask for it: a Britten-Norman plane flew around Britain towing a ""Vote Leave"" banner in the weeks before the June 2016 referendum.
One of its flights took it over a memorial service for Jo Cox, an anti-Brexit member of parliament murdered by a Brexit supporter. The company said it hadn't known about the service and apologized for flying over it.
But Hynett does not apologize for the stance it took. ""Our position on Brexit hasn't changed,"" he said.
He blames lack of planning and clarity from the government for forcing Britten-Norman to be ready to shift some of its functions away from the UK.
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. What sort of relationship the two will have after that has yet to be determined.
Most other aerospace companies have warned the uncertainty around Brexit threatens their businesses. Aerospace giant Airbus (PA:AIR), the European planemaker which makes the wings for all its passenger jets in Britain, has warned about the risk to jobs and investment.
Rolls-Royce (L:RR) has laid out contingency plans to move a design-approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany, and to stockpile parts.
But for smaller operator Britten-Norman -- Britain's only independent commercial planemaker, with 150 employees and 15 million pounds of annual turnover -- Hynett believes complying with costly EU regulations outweighs any benefits from being in a trading bloc where few of its customers are located. 
Britten-Norman, whose owners include Oman's Zawawi family as well as Hynett, has been making its Islander aircraft, a specialist at taking off and landing on unprepared surfaces, since 1965. Over 1,300 have been produced; current output is one Islander or Defender plane, its other model, per quarter, with some parts made by a sub-contractor in Romania.
Under consideration as part of the company's Brexit contingency plans is the possibility of shifting the ""type certificate"", a required airworthiness credential, from being certified by the European safety regulator EASA to the U.S. regulator, the Federal Aviation Agency.
Another is establishing the type certificate in a European country, should Britain be excluded from EASA after Brexit, and not have its own certifying procedure set up. 
""Whether we use European conduits or partial migration to America or anything else as part of our future strategy in order to mitigate some of these risks, absolutely, we'll do what we have to,"" he said. He declined to name the European country he had in mind.

James Katzman, who led the bank's West Coast mergers-and-acquisitions practice, had used the whistle-blower hotline in 2014 to report on the investment bank trying to hire a customer's child and colleagues' repeated attempts to obtain and then share confidential client information, the paper reported https://nyti.ms/2CJ9wEq.
The investigation was taken up by the bank's general counsel and Katzman was urged to move past his complaints by several senior investment banking executives, the newspaper reported, citing several people familiar with the interactions.
Katzman refused and left Goldman in 2015. He was required to sign a confidentiality agreement that he believed prevented him from sharing his concerns with board members or regulators, people close to Katzman told the newspaper.
""A few years ago, Katzman raised several issues through an appropriate outside channel. In accordance with our whistle-blower policy, his concerns were thoroughly investigated by our legal department and it was determined that no additional action was warranted,"" Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said in an email.
""After that, Katzman chose to leave the firm at his own initiative despite efforts to keep him.""
In May, the bank enlisted https://reut.rs/2CJZJOo its top management in a firm-wide initiative on conduct and culture issues.

Whenever a vehicle approaches, a pair scurries to take down the driver’s details and make sure there’s no scab laborer in disguise.
The ritual, witnessed on a rainy August morning, has become part of life at the aluminum plant since January, when the company locked out more than 1,000 employees represented by the United Steelworkers union. The entrance is also where tensions have flared as the conflict, which started over pensions and recruitment rules, turned into a deadlock.
For Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, the dispute has resulted in a production decline at the plant, adding to pressures resulting from U.S. aluminum tariffs that have hit its three smelters in Canada. The company is now seeking deeper changes -- including reduced payrolls -- to make the plant more competitive. For their part, workers say they’ve already made concessions and are fighting to retain seniority rights.
From the point of view of the mayor of the town on the St. Lawrence River, the situation looks like a battle of principles between Big Business and Big Labor which both feel they can’t afford to lose.
“It’s a clash of the titans,” says Jean-Guy Dubois, mayor of the town of 13,000 people two hours northeast of Montreal. “Becancour has become the stage where it happens, and we’re the victims.”
The on-and-off-again jostling has added to the turmoil in metal markets. In addition to placing quotas or tariffs on most U.S. aluminum imports, the Trump administration also has imposed sanctions on Russian producer United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest supplier outside China, as well as opening talks to rejig Nafta. As a result, premiums -- the amount added to aluminum prices to ship in the U.S. -- have more than doubled this year, and benchmark prices in London spiked in April.
The lockout at Becancour could curtail 280,000 metric tons this year from the global market, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Andrew Cosgrove estimates. While that’s less than 1 percent of global output, the stoppage is a “net negative” for Alcoa, which owns 75 percent of the plant (while  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group owns the remainder). The lower production could translate into about $430 million in lost revenue for Alcoa, or 3 percent of projected 2018 sales, Cosgrove says, though the company could make up part of that elsewhere.
Jorge Vazquez, a managing director at industry researcher Harbor Intelligence, said the company’s willingness to lose money at Becancour is sending a broader message to the aluminum workforce in Quebec.
“For future negotiations with other labor unions and smelters, I think this is a bigger statement than just ABI,” Vazquez said, referring to the Quebec plant by its formal name Aluminerie de Bécancour Incorporée. “They do mean what they say.”
Alcoa currently faces another labor conflict at its alumina operations in Western Australia, where workers are striking over a new labor deal they say doesn’t contain any job security provisions.
The United Steelworkers want to pick up the Quebec negotiations where they were left at last year. Clement Masse, the head of the union’s ABI chapter, said workers had agreed to overhaul pension funding -- a liability Alcoa has worked to sort out at other plants -- but that disagreements remained over rules to fill vacant jobs when ABI came up with a final offer in December. The workers rejected it in January, the company curtailed two of three smelting lines and managers took over the remaining operations.
Strains permeated negotiations when they resumed in June under the mediation of former Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard. Those talks hit a roadblock when ABI asked to reduce the payroll size by attrition -- 185 positions, according to the union.
A union delegation met with Alcoa executives in Pittsburgh last week, saying afterwards that the parties “discussed possible solutions that we could pursue to try to break the impasse.” Alcoa said the meeting “was constructive in terms of the steps needed to achieve a new collective agreement and position ABI for long-term success.”
According to the company, a third of the plant has been operated by just 115 managers with record efficiency, showing a reorganization is needed -- including a reduced headcount. It says the plant has lagged “many of its peers” in terms of productivity and profitability.
The managers “have restored stability and improved metal quality to standards not previously seen at the facility,” Alcoa spokesman Jim Beck said in an e-mail. “So we know improvements are possible.”
The union contends that ABI is using scabs to get to that result, an allegation that is denied by Alcoa and under examination by an administrative court. Masse said the current conditions wouldn’t be sustainable over a longer period.
The company also is in the midst of a wave of retirements and is seeking flexibility to staff the plant without having too many workers change jobs at once. According to the union, that means it wants to recruit externally, a break from past agreements that reserved the positions for current employees.
Locked-out workers don’t understand why the company has let the situation drag on.
“Tensions have been rising, from our side as well as from theirs,” says Claudia Tremblay, a technical assistant employed at the smelter since 2012. “There needs to be an ending.”
The tensions can be felt at the gates. Managers, who in the early days would drive in and stop for a chat, are now bused in. Workers have used camcorders to film unfamiliar faces behind the windows of incoming vehicles.
ABI has sought legal action to enforce a court order on picketing rules because access to and from the plant “has been slow, difficult and intimidating,” Alcoa’s Beck said.
Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey told analysts in July that he sees the talks as a chance to effect real change because the company wants to invest in ABI for the long term.
That’s also the hope of Mayor Dubois, who counts on the company for 20 percent of the town’s tax revenue. ABI workers get half of their former disposable income through a strike fund, and he says businesses have started to feel the pinch. For Dubois, a resolution can’t come fast enough.
“I will probably have my own little party on the day I hear it’s sorted,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) laid out details on Tuesday for the planned December listing of its new Dutch entity, which has sparked criticism from some UK shareholders and become swept up in the debate over Brexit. 
The maker of Dove soap, Lipton teas and Ben & Jerry's ice cream has said ending its dual Anglo-Dutch structure is a purely business move to improve corporate governance and make it more agile, particularly with regard to big mergers and acquisitions. 
But the decision in March to make Rotterdam its main headquarters caused controversy in Britain, where opponents of Brexit warned it was a sign of business losing faith in the country. Brexit supporters, meanwhile, pointed to Unilever's ongoing commitment to its UK staff and operations.
The decision, which is pending shareholder approval, also faces pushback from some UK investors. It will likely see Unilever drop out of Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index (FTSE), which could cause forced selling by UK funds mandated to track the index.
The move requires approval by 75 percent of UK shareholders and 50 percent of Dutch shareholders. The votes will take place on Oct. 25 in the Netherlands and Oct. 26 in London. Unilever has said it is ""very confident"" of securing the required votes. 
If approved, one share in the capital of New Unilever NV would be issued for each share in the existing Dutch (NV) and UK (PLC) entities, resulting in shareholders receiving shares in the capital of New Unilever NV that represent an equivalent economic interest.
The expected last day of trading in NV and PLC shares would be Friday, Dec. 21, Unilever said. The simplification process would then complete over the weekend, with dealings in New Unilever NV shares starting on Monday, Dec. 24.
""Overall, we consider the proposed changes as value-enhancing for Unilever,"" UBS analysts said in a research note.
Unilever launched a review of its dual structure in 2017 after fighting off a $143 billion takeover proposal from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC), triggering a battle between Britain and the Netherlands. 

In March, the group said a new holding company, New Unilever NV, incorporated in the Netherlands, would be listed in London, Amsterdam and, in the form of American depositary shares, in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks slipped back towards three-week lows on Tuesday, on ongoing concerns over the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing, while the pound hovered near a five-week high on hopes of a UK-EU deal over Brexit.
MSCI's index of global equities inched lower on the day, after European shares joined Asian bourses in the red as markets awaited action from U.S. President Donald Trump after the expiry of a deadline for public comment on additional tariffs on Chinese goods. 
European shares, having opened broadly higher, were down on the day, with a pan-European index of shares lower 0.3 percent. 
Hopes around a new Brexit deal kept the British pound near five-week highs however, helping lighten the mood a touch in Europe. The currency which rose 0.8 percent on Monday after the European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal was possible within weeks, hit a new five-week high of $1.3087.
It slightly slipped off those levels as the trade worries returned to lift the dollar off the day's lows.
However, it was the second time in less than a week that Barnier signaled his desire to push ahead on Brexit negotiations, less than seven months before the United Kingdom is slated to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019.
His comments have eased some of the anxiety that Britain would exit from the EU without any formal trading arrangement. 
""The Barnier headlines mean there's a lower hurdle for getting a separation deal done by the end of the year, when the discussion about the future relationship can begin,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. 
""Also, the fact that Trump still hasn't announced the tariffs yet as expected has prompted a bit of cautious optimism, but it's not a problem that's going to go away,"" he added. 
Meanwhile Italian bond yields - which move inversely to price - fell for the seventh straight day on Tuesday, making it the best run in over a year for the benchmark 10-year bond, as Italian politicians signaled that an upcoming budget would likely fall within European Union rules. 
The closely-watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread - seen as an indicator of euro zone sentiment - was at 231 basis points, as much as 60 bps tighter than last week's peaks. 
TRADE WORRIES WEIGH
Earlier in the session, Asian shares struggled to avoid a ninth straight session of losses as the specter of a further escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war haunted investors.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.05 percent, but held above lows last visited in July last year.
Shanghai blue chips dipped 0.2 percent while South Korea fell 0.2 percent.
Having warned last week that he was ready to levy additional taxes on practically all Chinese imports, U.S. President Donald Trump was uncharacteristically quiet on trade on Monday.
China will respond if the United States takes any new steps on trade, the foreign ministry said on Monday, after President Donald Trump warned he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States.
Separately, it emerged China will ask the World Trade Organization next week for permission to impose sanctions on the United States for Washington's non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties that China initiated in 2013, a meeting agenda showed on Tuesday. 
Emerging market currencies remained under pressure with a broad index down near 16-month lows and the Indian rupee near a record trough of 72.68 per dollar. 
""Weakness is set to remain a recurring theme amid global trade tensions, a broadly stronger dollar and prospects of higher U.S. interest rates,"" said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM.
""With turmoil in Turkey and Argentina triggering contagion fears, appetite for emerging market assets and currencies is likely to continue diminishing.""
In commodity markets, gold was stuck at $1,195.80 an ounce and continues to move in the opposite direction to the dollar.
Oil prices found support from looming U.S. sanctions against Iran's petroleum industry.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 06:56AM ET</span>",ING CFO steps down as backlash grows after $900 million money laundering fine,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ING Groep's (AS:INGA) Chief Financial Officer is to step down amid a public backlash after the Dutch bank admitted last week it had failed for years to prevent money laundering and agreed to a 775 million euro ($900 million) settlement with prosecutors.
The decision to remove CFO Koos Timmermans, 58, comes after criticism of the bank by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, and after shareholder interest group VEB called for a more thorough vetting of CEO Ralph Hamers' role in the affair.
ING's fine comes as European regulators consider whether to tighten controls on financial crime. Denmark's  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) has also admitted to flaws in anti-money laundering controls in Estonia, while Latvia closed one of its banks after it was accused by the United States of money laundering. 
In the settlement reached on Sept. 4, prosecutors concluded that responsibility for ING's failings was diffuse and agreed not to prosecute, saying chances of a conviction were slim.
ING said at the time it had taken disciplinary measures against 10 employees and its management board would forgo any bonuses for 2018, but on Tuesday it said external pressure had forced it to go further.
""Given the seriousness of the matter and the many reactions among stakeholders...we came to the conclusion it is appropriate that responsibility is taken at executive board level,"" said supervisory board chairman Hans Wijers, a former politician, in a statement.
Announcing Timmermans' departure, ING praised his contributions to the bank, and said he could remain in his job until a replacement takes over, which would likely be next April.
Timmermans was appointed CFO in 2017 having previously held key managerial positions between 2010 and 2016, the period investigated by prosecutors, notably at the company's banking operations in the Netherlands. 
His dismissal may reduce pressure on Hamers, who has led the bank since 2013 and is feted for its successful digital strategy.
CRITICISM GROWS 
Public criticism over the bank's failings has swelled in the days since news of the settlement emerged. 
PM Rutte voiced his displeasure, while Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra summoned Wijers to The Hague, saying the matter had ""shaken public faith in the banking sector yet again"".
Hoekstra called Timmermans' departure a ""fitting"" response by the bank. 
Opposition political parties have called for ING be stripped of its position as official banker to the government and VEB President Paul Koster said it was difficult not to think that Timmermans was a ""sacrificial victim"".
""For outsiders...this has the appearance of being about protecting Hamers,"" he said. 
ING was not immediately available to comment on Hamers' position but Wijers told local press agency ANP that Hamers has the ""full support"" of the board. 
ING said on Tuesday that it would continue to strengthen its compliance procedures, despite earlier saying that it had already reformed its customer vetting and monitoring processes. 
ING's delayed reaction mirrors a series of events in March when it announced a 50 percent pay rise for Hamers, retracting it 5 days later amid withering criticism.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Las Vegas is booming again, and bracing itself for next slump","By David Randall
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Diane Han is trying to leave the Las Vegas of her childhood behind.
Her mother is a blackjack dealer at Caesar's Palace, one of the mega-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, while her father works in housekeeping at another. Han, 25, grew up in Las Vegas, but went to college in the Bay Area for college and spent a year there working as a biochemist. 
Yet she returned to enroll as a member of the first class at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Medicine. The school opened last year to address a chronic shortage of doctors in Southern Nevada and broaden the city’s economic base.
Few cities were hit as hard as Las Vegas by the 2008 financial crisis and recession, which eroded consumer spending on the sort of fast thrills the city had to offer and left it with the highest foreclosure rate in the nation. Home prices plummeted 62 percent from their peak in 2006 to their bottom in 2012, according to data from ATTOM Data Solutions, a real estate tracking firm.
Now Han is part of a group of medical students whose decision to stay and practice in Las Vegas after graduation may give the city hope that it can reduce its reliance on casinos. 
“We are in an early stage of building what could be a start-up culture here,"" Han said. ""We’re trying to make it a real city, not just a transient one.” 
Nevada as a whole lost more jobs in relation to its workforce than any other state, with more than 70 percent of those losses in the Las Vegas region. There, unemployment rate hit 14.2 percent at the depth of the recession, well above the national peak of 10 percent and nearly triple where it was before the downturn began in 2007.
Though construction cranes once again rise above casinos along the Strip, Las Vegas is trying to prepare for the next downturn – whenever that may be - by trying to wean itself off the reliance on housing and hospitality and turning to industries ranging from professional sports to medical care.
""We are trying to build a world class city,"" says Mayor Carolyn Goodman, citing investments in infrastructure and efforts to woo new businesses.
Yet the question remains whether it will be enough. 
Other hard-hit Sun Belt cities, such as Orlando and Phoenix have outpaced Las Vegas in job growth since the crisis and have more diversified economies, said Steven Pedigo, a professor of economic development at New York University. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CIaReC)
""They were absolutely killed and I think it's fair to say that they are only starting to rebound now,"" Pedigo said about Las Vegas. ""If Las Vegas doesn't build some buffer around its economy it will always be a boom and bust town.""
BET ON HEALTHCARE
Over the last five years, businesses including Amazon-owned Zappos, data company Switch Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself have opened new headquarters or regional hubs in the Las Vegas metro area, bringing approximately 3,000 new jobs thanks in part to more than $15 million in tax incentives. But the University of Nevada's medical school is at the core of the city's vision of its future. 
By 2030, it is expected to add 8,000 jobs and contribute $1.2 billion annually to the metro area's $111 billion economy. Established with $27 million in state funding, the school now has 143 full-time faculty and employs over 1,000, said Dr. Barbara Atkinson, the school's founding dean.     
""The major impetus to start the medical school was the economic impact,"" she said. ""Each new physician that comes here usually hires between two and five other staff people, and they have more than enough patients.”
The city and state have also invested more than $36 million in infrastructure, such as street improvements, and marketing and has another $97 million planned to build out the Las Vegas Medical District. The city expects the cluster of medical office buildings and hospitals four miles (6.44 km) north of the Strip will add 16,000 jobs and contribute $2.4 billion to the local economy annually by 2030. 
The improvements are paid in part by bonds issued by a regional transportation agency that administers the Las Vegas region's first planning blueprint to handle what it expects to be a nearly 45 percent population growth by 2045.
Already, there are signs that the economy is shifting. Around 100,000 jobs are in health and education-related fields, an increase of more than 50 percent from 10 years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, construction employment is down 38 percent at about 65,000.
Yet tourism and hospitality, with its thousands of low-paying, entry-level jobs, still accounts for nearly a third of the region's workforce, three times the national average. Casinos MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment, Wynn Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands Corp together employ over 102,400 in the area, according to data from the Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance, a local development group. 
HOUSING HANGOVER EASING 
Professional sports and legal marijuana may also help broaden the city's economy. 
The Vegas Golden Knights hockey team reached the Stanley Cup Finals this year, giving the city its first major professional sports experience. At the south end of the Strip, a $1.8 billion domed stadium for the National Football League’s Raiders is under construction and could host the Super Bowl as early as 2023. Tax revenues from marijuana sales, which Nevada legalized in July 2017, surpassed the state’s 12-month estimate of $50 million within 10 months.
""We anticipate that recent, modest diversification in employment will provide some marginal resilience in a future recession,"" Moody's analyst Patrick Liberatore, wrote in a May report upgrading the city’s credit rating to Aa2, the third highest investment grade. Still, the area's reliance on tourism ""will always leave it exposed to economic downturns,” he wrote.
The influx of newcomers into Clark County, Nevada's most populous county with 2.25 million residents, has helped push housing prices up more than 15 percent this year so far, though average prices are still below pre-crisis peaks. Real-estate listing firm Zillow estimates prices will rise another 8 percent over the next 12 months, driven in part by continued arrivals of Californians priced out of their markets. 
Whether those gains will last, however, is a matter of debate, with Fitch Ratings recently describing the metro area as the most overpriced market in the country. 
“Las Vegans once thought we were recession-proof,” said Stephen Miller, a business professor at UNLV. “We learned our lesson and made some progress, but we need to make a lot more.”

143,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",McDonald's buns maker Aryzta strikes deal with banks ahead of capital hike,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - One of the world's largest bakery companies, Aryzta, has agreed an underwriting deal with five banks, setting the stage for raising 800 million euros ($928.48 million) in new capital to strengthen its balance sheet.
Shares in the maker of McDonald's burger buns to Otis Spunkmeyer cookies rose as much as 8 percent after the company named BofA Merrill Lynch and UBS as lead managers, and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), JP Morgan and HSBC Bank plc as joint global coordinators of its capital raising. 
The Swiss-Irish company has warned on its at least three times since 2017 due to rising distribution and labor costs in North America, problems with undocumented workers at a U.S. bakery, high butter prices and weak consumer spending in some European markets, particularly Britain following its vote to leave the European Union.
Aryzta, which said last month it needed a cash infusion following a net loss of more than 1 billion euros in 2017, also said on Tuesday it had won the consent of a majority of its lenders to amend an existing facilities agreement.
As part of the deal the company's net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) covenant will rise to 5.75 times, from 4.0 times for January 2019 and to 5.25 times for July 2019 from 3.5 times.
Analyst Andreas von Arx of Baader Helvea said the deal with banks and lenders ""shows Aryzta is making progress toward the capital increase"" and helped t reduce uncertainty. 
""The amended credit conditions should provide the flexibility to execute on the turnaround measures,"" von Arx wrote in a note to investors.
Even so, he is sticking with his ""hold"" rating, as Aryzta has failed repeatedly to deliver on priorities of selling assets or stabilizing results. ""For the time being there remain too many unknowns to credibly forecast a mid-term valuation,"" he said.
The shares are down more than 75 percent this year.
RAISING DOUGH
Chief Executive Officer Kevin Toland, whose company also makes Cuisine de France bread, is still hoping to unload at least 450 million euros in assets, including its France-based Picard frozen food unit acquired during an ill-fated buying spree.
Aryzta also named new independent board members -- former McDonald's USA president Michael Andres, Green Chile Foods Chairman Gregory Flack and Tim Lodge, a former chief financial officer at agribusiness company COFCO International -- to stand for election at its coming annual general meeting on Nov. 1.
""Each brings significant and diverse industry experience which will be invaluable... as we deliver on what is a multi-year turnaround,"" Aryzta Chairman Gary McGann said in a statement.

Director Charles Adair plans to retire.

144,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Emerging-Markets in Moment of Calm Before Central-Bank Meetings,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging markets are enjoying a tranquil interval, but with central banks soon to be in action across some of the hardest-hit countries, this reprieve is probably temporary.
Most developing-nation currencies rose, boosting an MSCI Inc. index that tracks the securities from the lowest level since April 2017. A similar measure for equities fell a second day, led by technology shares.
Argentina kicks off Tuesday with its monetary policy meeting, the first since an emergency rate hike to 60 percent last month, while Turkey and Russia will follow on Thursday and Friday. All that comes ahead of the Federal Reserve’s own meeting later this month, at which the U.S. central bank is expected to maintain its tightening path.
“Investors are waiting for monetary policy meetings, with the largest focus this week being Turkey’s, and until then, we may not see any one-way moves,” said Toru Nishihama, a Tokyo-based emerging-market economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. “The EM sell-off is probably not over yet. We’ve still got the Fed’s rate hike in the horizon after this week as well.”
Emerging markets, which were the darlings of 2017, have been reeling this year from a combination of escalating trade tensions, the gradual end of central-bank policy accommodation and a raft of idiosyncratic risks including Argentina’s fiscal woes, Turkey’s twin deficits and Brazil’s contentious elections.
For Turkey and Russia, hints from policy makers rocked markets last week. Turkey’s central bank signaled that higher rates are in the offing, while Russia’s Governor Elvira Nabiullina surprised markets by saying the first rate hike since 2014 could be discussed when policy makers meet. The new head of the monetary-policy department at the Russian central bank, Alexey Zabotkin, subsequently offered a less hawkish message.
Russia’s ruble advanced 0.9 percent against the dollar as of 9:19 a.m. in London, while the South African currency added 1 percent, the most among peers. The rand is due for a tactical correction after falling to a two-year low last week, according to Nedbank Group Ltd.
Glimmers of Hope
Some investors are seeing glimmers of hope for emerging-market assets. Negative local news has already been priced in, and since current-account deficits are lower than four years ago and inflation is relatively tame, the spike in volatility will probably wane over the next few months, according to Zurich-based Bernd Berg, a global macro and foreign exchange strategist at Woodman Asset Management AG.
Still, some patterns suggest that the rout that has taken the MSCI Emerging Markets Index below its 20-year average valuation has further to run before reaching the point where four major turnarounds in the past two decades began."

MILAN (Reuters) - A recovery in European shares stalled on Tuesday as uncertainty over a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing kept investors on edge.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) wavered around parity and by 0825 GMT was down 0.05 percent, as gains among oil majors on stronger crude prices helped offset a weaker basic materials sector. 
However, the pan-European index however is still up nearly 1 percent from the five-month lows hit last week.
""The delay in implementing new tariffs could be tempting some investors to dip their toes back into the water so to speak on a very selective basis,"" said CMC analyst Michael Hewson.
After initial gains, Germany's exporter-heavy DAX (GDAXI) index fell 0.05 percent, while strength in the pound on bets of a Brexit deal dragged the UK's FTSE 100 down 0.3 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days.
Among single stocks, takeover talk lifted Finnish sports equipment maker Amer Sports (HE:AMEAS) by as much as 14 percent.
Trading in its shares was halted ahead of a statement from Amer saying it had received a non-binding preliminary indication of interest from China's ANTA Sports Products and Asian private equity firm FountainVest Partners. 
 Ubisoft  (PA:UBIP) was another strong gainer, up 4.3 percent with traders citing a broker upgrade.
Solid updates pushed industrial equipment rental firm Ashtead (L:AHT) and asset manager  Partners Group  (S:PGHN) up 2.6 and 3.4 percent respectively.

Steel giant ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) led fallers, down 3 percent after it raised its bid for India's debt-laden Essar Steel in competition with Russia's VTB (MM:VTBR) and  Vedanta Resources  (L:VED).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's  Renesas Electronics Corp  (T:6723) said it had agreed to buy  Integrated Device  Technology Inc (IDT) (O:IDTI) for $6.7 billion, its second major acquisition as it deepens its push into semiconductors for self-driving cars.
The deal for the U.S. chip design firm underscores fierce competition between global chipmakers as they seek to boost their product line-ups and market share in the highly lucrative field of automotive chips.
Renesas is second only to  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI) in auto-related chips and commands 30 percent of the global market for microcontrollers used in cars. But it is weak in so-called analog chips which process signals from things such as sound, light or temperature into digital data.
In particular, Renesas has been keen to get its hands on IDT's know-how in analog semiconductors for wireless networks and sensors - expertise crucial to develop autonomous driving and connected car technology. 
It will pay $49 per share in cash for IDT's outstanding shares, a 16 percent premium to their closing price on Monday.
""We were weak in chips for wireless networks needed for the Internet of things and connected cars. We've been wanting to get such assets,"" Renesas Chief Executive Officer Bunsei Kure told a news conference.
Renesas said that the combination with IDT will allow the Japanese firm to provide more comprehensive chip systems for its clients. IDT is also strong in chips for data centers, opening up a new stream of revenue for Renesas.
Renesas' stock climbed 4 percent higher in afternoon trade, regaining some ground lost in a 14 percent slide since the Japanese firm said it was considering buying IDT on Aug. 31.
While IDT has averaged nearly 20 percent revenue growth in the past four reported quarters, some analysts worry that benefits from the deal could be hard to come by.
""Renesas is weak in telecommunications chips, so the combination isn't bad,"" said Akira Minamikawa, principal analyst at IHS Markit. ""But IDT doesn't have many automotive clients. Bringing their chips up to the level needed for automotive standards will not be easy.""
IDT generates just 11 percent of its revenue from automotive and industrial businesses.
The deal comes on the heels of last year's purchase of U.S. chipmaker Intersil Corp for $3.2 billion which also expanded its portfolio of analog chips.
The companies need to gain approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security issues, as well as from antitrust authorities in markets such as China.
Renesas said it was confident of obtaining the necessary approvals.
Renesas, which expects the deal to close in the first half of 2019, will finance the acquisition with 679 billion yen ($6.1 billion) of bank loans as well as cash, and expects to repay 200 billion yen every year.
The loan will be offered by the core banks of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411), a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The source was not authorized to be talk publicly on the matter and declined to be identified.
S&P Global Ratings put Renesas on a negative credit watch, saying it might cut the firm's rating by one or two notches if the acquisition proceeds as planned.
""Key financial ratios for Renesas Electronics would likely deteriorate significantly - even taking into account IDT's possible contribution to earnings,"" S&P said.

Renesas was late to join a wave of consolidation in the chip industry as it struggled to recover from damage suffered at key plants in an earthquake that hit Japan in 2011.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A law firm said on Tuesday it would file class-action lawsuits against Australia's biggest bank and wealth manager seeking ""very substantial"" damages for allegedly cheating millions of retirees.
The allegations stem from a powerful public inquiry into Australia's financial sector which could lead to criminal prosecutions and tougher regulations to prevent abuses by the country's dominant banks, insurers and pension funds. 
Australia's top financial firms have had nearly A$40 billion ($29 billion) wiped off their collective market value this year, as the Royal Commission inquiry unearthed systemic malpractice including alleged fraud, bribery, regulator deception, fee gouging and illegal telephone marketing.
The ""series of lawsuits"" flagged by Slater & Gordon Ltd would first target the pension arm of Commonwealth Bank of Australia and wealth manager AMP Ltd for giving customers ""ludicrously low"" or negative returns without justification, the firm said.
""It's been about lining their own pockets, about propping up their profits and undermining the entire superannuation scheme,"" Slater & Gordon head of class actions Ben Hardwick told reporters.
""You may as well have had the money under your bed.""
Slater & Gordon estimated CBA's Colonial First State and AMP combined had lost A$500 million of retiree money. The lawfirm planned to expand its action to other pension funds, potentially taking the number of plaintiffs to a third of Australia's 12 million working-age people.
It did not specify the size of the damages it would pursue beyond ""very substantial"".
An AMP spokeswoman said the company had not been served with legal proceedings but was working to fix problems identified by the inquiry. CBA said it was aware of Slater & Gordon's plan and that it would inform the market of developments.
AMP is separately defending multiple class actions for allegedly failing to disclose governance problems, while CBA has also been sued for alleged failures to disclose breaches of anti-money-laundering rules. 
AGGRESSIVE SALES
The year-long inquiry meanwhile turned its attention to the life insurance industry on Tuesday.
A Baptist minister told how his son who has Down Syndrome bought an insurance policy without understanding what he was doing, as a result of a phone call from Freedom Insurance Group Ltd (FIG).
""I was disturbed at this process and was concerned that others would be targeted in similar situations to him, and perhaps others who didn't have the support that he has to challenge this process,"" the minister, Grant Stewart, told the inquiry.
The inquiry heard recordings of a FIG representative selling the policy to Stewart's son who answered most questions - including about details of insurance policies - in single syllables after pauses of about five seconds.
The man's son clearly did not understand the purpose of the 2016 call and ""was being compliant"", Grant said.
FIG Chief Operating Officer Craig Orton told the inquiry the company had canceled most of its outbound sales calls and taken its call center operations in-house.

The U.S. planemaker's latest estimate for the period to 2037 is 6.2 percent higher than its previous prediction of 7,240 planes until 2036 made last year.
""The growth in China can be attributed to the country's growing middle class, which has more than tripled in the last 10 years and is expected to double again in the next 10,"" said Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, in a statement. 
Boeing and its European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) have been jostling to increase market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country.
The company has so far been mostly spared in an ongoing trade war between the United States and China. Large airplanes have been left out of China's retaliatory tariff lists although U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States. 
Boeing also predicted that China will account for 18 percent of the world's commercial airplane fleet by 2037, up from 15 percent currently, and forecast that the country will need over $1.5 trillion in commercial services to support its fleet.

Three quarters of the 7,690 plane orders over the next 20 years will likely be for single-aisle aircraft while China's widebody fleet will require 1,620 new planes, tripling the country's current widebody fleet size, it added.

The Shenzhen-based firm gained a large amount of profit from gaming. August saw its market value slumped by around $20 billion as China strengthened the crackdown on online gaming due to rising levels of myopia. 
In mid-August, Beijing banned the tech company’s blockbuster video game “Monster Hunter: World”, leading to slides in its stock price. Mainland investors sold a record of around $3.2 billion of Hong Kong equities last month, with Tencent accounting for over half of the sales. 
The company reported the first decline in quarterly profits in over a decade in August. "
157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Tencent Steps Up Share Repurchase After First Buyback Since 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. bought back shares for a second day on Monday after its first repurchase in four years spurred speculation the battered internet behemoth may do more to support the stock.
The Shenzhen-based company said it bought 124,000 shares for HK$39.1 million ($5 million) on Sept. 10, more than five times the amount it spent on Friday. The previous time Tencent bought stock was in April 2014, when it spent HK$77 million buying shares and spurred a three-day rally.
By starting with a small repurchase, Tencent could be testing market reaction before considering more, said Shawn Yang, an executive director of Blue Lotus Capital Advisors who covers the social networking giant. The stock fell as much as 1.5 percent on Tuesday and has lost 35 percent from its record high in January.
“This is just the beginning -- we may see more buybacks from Tencent,” Yang said on Monday before Tencent announced its second round of purchases. “Buybacks can minimize the downside impact but they’re not enough to immediately trigger a rebound in the stock price. We may continue to see more pressure for Tencent in the short term, but it’s good timing to buy back because it sends a message to the market that ‘look, we are not as bad as you think. ”’
The rout in Tencent stock has wiped more than $190 billion from its market value amid a global tech selloff and concerns about earnings in its lucrative games business amid a Chinese regulatory clampdown. It’s still one of the highest rated stocks with an average price target implying a 44 percent upside from Monday’s close.
Tencent buyers tend to be long-only investors who would prefer to wait until they get more clarity before jumping back in, Yang said.
“The market has been too over-concerned about short-term things like regulation and gaming slowdown,” said Yang. “What Tencent is trying to say is ‘you underestimate our future potential.”’

158,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 11:11PM ET</span>",Asia Equities Mostly Down on EM Jitters ,"Investing.com – Asian stock markets were mixed on early morning trade on Tuesday, as trade jitters between China and the U.S. remains in focus and experts forecast that emerging market currencies might fall further.
The U.S. stock market seems to have held on to an upbeat sentiment. The S&P 500 closed up 0.19% on Monday and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked the trend with a 0.23% drop.
Asian stock markets, however, closed the day mostly in the red, with markets in China and Hong Kong particularly hard hit. The Shanghai Composite ended down by 1.21%, the Shenzhen Componentfalling 1.97% and the Hang Seng Index sliding by 1.33%.
The dark mood was driven by new threats by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat on Friday to impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports, on top of $200 billion that have already gone through public consultations and could be imposed at any time. Those two sets of tariffs, added to other tariffs already imposed, would result in tariffs to virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S.
On Tuesday, markets started the day mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.13% as of 9:55PM ET (01:54 GMT) while the Shenzhen Component Index was down 0.38%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.13%.
Elsewhere, South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.14% but Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.93%. the S&P ASX 200 in Australia was up 0.44%.
Investors across Asia remain on tenterhooks, not only about the potential for a vastly expanded and disruptive trade war between the U.S. and China but also about the fears that one of the several currency crises underway in emerging markets could spread.
Seven emerging markets, including Turkey, Argentina and Brazil, are going through significant currency pain.  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) signaled that those currencies have further to fall, despite having plummeted already.
“Given the latest comments from Trump, investors are likely to see the potential for further depreciation in EM currencies with the trade war cranking up yet another notch,” said Rakuten Securities Australia Analyst Nick Twidale.
Argentina’s central bank is set to announce another decision on interest rates on Tuesday. In late August, it boosted rates to 60% and pledged not to cut them at least until December.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks on Monday to conclude a peace treaty that the two countries have not signed since World War II and to work together on economic activities on islands both countries claim off the Japan’s Hokkaido main island.

A rival group, including a unit of Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa (MX:TLVACPO), won a contract in June for nearly $36 million to provide internet to the oil company known as Pemex . 
America Movil (MX:AMXL) had presented a cheaper offer of roughly $24.5 million, a company spokesman said, and went on to file complaints against Pemex. 
A Pemex spokesman said on Monday that the company expects to respond in several days but has not set an exact date. 
America Movil, Mexico's largest internet carrier, and Televisa, the country's biggest broadcaster, have clashed repeatedly in the Mexican market.
An America Movil spokesman said Scitum, a subsidiary of the company's Telmex unit, began filing complaints in June to Pemex's internal auditors and audit committee. The company also filed a legal challenge asking that the contract award be suspended while the case is open.
Telmex subsidiary Triara was also part of the America Movil group vying for the contract. 
The turmoil was first reported by Mexico's Milenio newspaper late last month, making public the type of legal disputes over Mexico government contracts that are frequent but rarely rise to public attention. 
Pemex Chief Information Officer Rodrigo Becerra said in an interview that he was content with the tender awarded to Televisa and that Slim's companies made mistakes in their bid.
He added that when his team joined Pemex in 2016, it found an initial set of bidding requirements that could only have been met by one company, Scitum.
""They had some irregularities. They were, we thought, tilted to one provider in particular,"" he said. 
An America Movil spokesman denied that the company made mistakes and said that Pemex alone designed its bidding criteria.
Televisa subsidiary Operbes won the internet bid in a consortium with information technology firm TI America. The companies said that technical qualifications outweighed price in winning the Pemex contract.
""On occasion, some competitors present proposals that are apparently more competitive on price but do not meet the technological needs,"" the companies said in a statement on Thursday. 
America Movil's Telmex unit as well as Televisa both have substantial government contracting businesses, but neither breaks out those areas in detail.

Mexican think tank IMCO, which studies public contracting, says that Mexican government tenders often lack competition and transparency and are riddled with irregularities.

The turnover of overnight repurchase contracts, a tool traders use to seek financing to fund their bond purchases, increased for a second straight month to hit 66.1 trillion yuan ($9.6 trillion), official data showed. In August, the People’s Bank of China conducted repo agreements -- an instrument that hadn’t been used in about three years -- to mop up about 300 billion yuan of liquidity from the banking system, according to people familiar with the matter.
“The PBOC’s move was likely aimed at slowing the buildup of leverage and reducing short-term liquidity,” said David Qu, Shanghai-based economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “But it won’t damp traders’ motivation to borrow cheap funding and buy bonds -- they’d keep doing that as long as they expect money market rates to remain stable.”
The surge in leveraged buying of debt is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it could mean the central bank’s monetary easing will finally feed into China’s real economy as banks increase lending to companies via corporate bond purchases. On the other hand, it could signal a setback in the government’s efforts to reduce financial leverage. China will keep liquidity reasonably ample, without “flooding” the banking system through abundant cash supply, PBOC Deputy Governor Zhu Hexin said in late August.
Read: China Faces Problem in Getting Its Banks to Lend More Money
The PBOC drained short-term funds last month in an unannounced repo operation, people familiar with the matter said last Wednesday. The central bank said the report is not true, declining to give further details.
The reported cash withdrawal came as interbank rates tumbled to multi-year lows in August. That has spurred some traders to use their money borrowed via short-term repos to purchase bonds, said Julia Ho, the head of Asian Macro at the Asian fixed-income team at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. Most of the leveraged-related trading is aimed at policy banks’ bonds as well as investment-grade state-owned enterprises’ debt and local government financing vehicles, she said.
“The carry trade will remain profitable until at least next year,” said Meng Xiangjuan, an analyst at SWS Research Co. in Shanghai. “Officials won’t put limitations on the trade, as long as the level of borrowing remains normal. That said, the room for significant spikes in leverage is limited, as officials have placed plenty of restrictions in the past years already.”
The benchmark seven-day repo rate dropped 2 basis points to 2.65 percent on Tuesday, after spiking amid tighter liquidity late last week. The overnight cost was little changed at 2.57 percent. That brings the gap between the overnight rate and the yield of six-month AA+ rated NCDs to about 107 basis points, a spread that makes the carry trade still attractive, according to ANZ’s Qu.
That doesn’t mean the PBOC will keep its hands tied and watch leverage expand indefinitely. For Xu Hanfei, chief fixed-income analyst at Industrial Economics Research & Consulting Co. in Shanghai, the central bank may boost the overnight repo rate as it follows the Federal Reserve in an expected increase in borrowing costs this month.

SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is bringing retired workers back on the job as the world's largest planemaker tries to fix delays at its 737 jetliner plant outside Seattle, a union official told Reuters on Monday.
The snarl at its plant in Renton, Washington, triggered by shortages of engines and fuselages as Boeing sped production to record levels in June, is likely to hurt third-quarter results and threatens its goal to boost build rates again in 2019, some analysts said after meetings in the Seattle area last week.
Single-aisle aircraft like the hot-selling 737 and Airbus (PA:AIR) A320 families are the cash cows of the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers.
Investors will get a peek on Tuesday at how far behind Boeing is when it releases its order and delivery tallies for August, a month after deliveries fell to the lowest level in years. Deliveries are crucial to planemakers because that is when airlines pay most of what they owe for the aircraft.
Boeing started hiring retired mechanics and inspectors on a temporary basis after reaching an agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on Aug. 15, union spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said. Boeing had a similar agreement with the union last autumn following a round of voluntary layoffs, Kelliher said.
Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said the company was dedicating additional resources to the Renton site ""to ensure timely deliveries to our customers.""
Boeing has already deployed about 600 employees and new hires to Renton in recent weeks to help fix delays, analysts said. It was not clear how many retired workers Boeing intends to hire. 
2019 SPILLOVER? 
About 50 semi-finished 737s were scattered around the Renton plant last week, analysts said, several times the number of semi-finished aircraft Reuters reported in July.
Boeing largely attributes the snarl to shortages of fuselages from Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems Inc (N:SPR) and engines from CFM International Inc, a venture between France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE).
""We are working closely with our suppliers Spirit and CFM as they track toward recovery, as well as our customers,"" Bergman said. ""Our team has been mitigating supplier delays, and our factory continues to build 52 airplanes per month.""
CFM is working to fix delays by year-end, the GE-Safran venture said. Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Among airlines with large 737 fleets,  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has seen slight delays on a small number of 737 MAX deliveries, while No. 4 carrier Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) sees ""minor changes"" on future deliveries, but the delays have not disrupted operations, company representatives said.

Aircraft leasing company  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) was still seeing 737 delivery delays of ""a month or less,"" spokeswoman Laura Woeste said.

Moonves, who turned CBS from an aging radio and TV broadcaster into a successful provider of shows to digital platforms, had been expected to reap an estimated $100 million in severance.
CBS said in a regulatory filing that it and Moonves in addition would donate $20 million to organizations supporting the #MeToo movement. 
Moonves, the top executive at CBS since 2006 and a major figure at the broadcast network and media company for more than two decades, resigned on Sunday amid a new wave of allegations against him of sexual assault and harassment.
CBS had said it takes such allegations very seriously.
Moonves acknowledged three of the newly described encounters, but said they were consensual, in a statement to the New Yorker.
Later on Sunday, announcing his resignation, he said: ""Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am."" 
He did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
CBS said in the filing that the settlement of $120 million would be put in a trust within 30 days and that Moonves could end up with nothing if the result of the investigation went against him. (https:// The board will decide on the course of action before Jan. 31 and its determination will be subject to binding arbitration.  Separately, CBS and its controlling shareholder National Amusements Inc (NAI) will also end litigation for control of the company, putting a halt to one of America's big media corporate struggles. Moonves had opposed efforts by NAI, which is owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner Redstone, to merge CBS with Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), another company they own. Monday's filing confirmed NAI had agreed to not propose a merger between CBS and Viacom for two years unless it gets a vote of two-thirds of directors not affiliated with the controlling shareholder. ""The hiatus certainly does nothing to dispel the notion that the Redstones intend to recombine the two companies, leaving the existing overhang on CBS shares mostly unchanged in our view,"" Cowen analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a client note. CBS shares fell 1.5 percent to $55.20.  In earlier court filings, NAI had dropped support for a deal before it was sued in May by CBS for control of the company. The settlement does not preclude other parties from suggesting a merger or bringing other potential transactions to the board. Shari Redstone-controlled NAI will also consider in good faith any other deal suggested by those unaffiliated directors. Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello will take over as interim CEO as the board searches for a replacement of Moonves. In a note to CBS employees that was seen by Reuters, Ianniello did not mention the allegations against Moonves, saying that the company was in a position of strategic strength and that it was important to make clear the company's commitment to ""diversity, inclusion and a safe and positive working environment."" 
Moonves' wife, Julie Chen, who serves as host and moderator of ""The Talk"" and hosts reality show ""Big Brother"" on the CBS network, said in a statement on Monday that she was taking a few days off to be with her family.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.23%. The S&P 500 rose 0.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained about 0.27%.
Bargain-seeking investors scooped up beaten-up tech stocks, which suffered heavy losses last week, owing to concerns over increased regulations on social media companies like Facebook and Twitter.
Both Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares ended the day above the flatline, with latter posing a nearly-1% rise.

""We continue to believe this move is overdone, and we continue to expect semis to outperform through year-end,"" analysts at Evercore ISI said in a note to clients.
Still, upbeat investor sentiment on equities was fraught with ongoing concerns over simmering U.S.-China trade tensions following President Donald Trump's threat last week to impose another round of tariffs on China.
Trump on Friday signaled a willingness to slap additional tariffs on Beijing ""very soon,"" warning that another $267 billion was ready to go on short notice.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), often cited as a trade bellwether given its large international exposure, ended the day nursing losses.
Energy, meanwhile, ended the day roughly unchanged as oil prices were pressured by investor concerns that that a tropical storm could dent crude demand.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 0.29% to settle at $67.54 a barrel.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock surged more than 8% on positive analyst comments from Bernstein. Bernstein said Tesla would rebound from its recent slump. The automaker's shares had plunged 30% through Friday since CEO Elon Musk's infamous tweet on Aug. 7, in which he said funding had been secured to take the company private.
Others, however, attributed the move higher in Tesla to Musk's decision to tweak the company's management structure on Friday following the departure of key executives, including chief accounting officer, Dave Morton, who resigned last week.
In other corporate news,  Freds  (NASDAQ:FRED) shares surged after the company said it would sell prescription files and related pharmacy inventory from 185 Fred's stores in 10 southeastern states to Walgreens.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",Ryanair's German pilots to strike on Wednesday,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) on Monday called a 24-hour strike affecting all Ryanair (I:RYA) flights out of Germany on Wednesday to push its demands in talks with the Irish carrier on wages and work conditions. 
The union called on German-based pilots to strike from Wednesday 0101 GMT until Thursday 0059 GMT, affecting all flights departing from Germany during that period.
""Despite the clear signal sent with the strike in early August there's still standstill at the negotiation table,"" 
Ingolf Schumacher, VC's pay negotiator, said in a statement.
Ryanair (I:RYA) last month suffered its worst one-day strike after a walk-out by pilots in five European countries disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 travelers with the budget airline at the height of the summer holiday season. 
More walk-outs are on the cards as seven trade unions representing Ryanair cabin crew in five countries threatened last week to hold a strike in late September unless the airline agrees to improve working conditions.
""Since we have already offered local contracts and improved pay there is no justification for further disruption and we are calling on our German pilots to work this Wednesday,"" Ryanair said in a written statement in response to VC.
The union said bargaining agreements with Irish and Italian pilots last month could not serve as blueprints for Germany because key questions on pay and working conditions had not been addressed.

VC said the airline had proposed an Irish national as mediator, who VC rejected because the person lacked ""sufficient knowledge of German law"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks mostly edged higher on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rebounding to snap a four-day losing streak, although a drop in Apple kept gains in check.
The Dow fell, with Travelers (N:TRV) down 1.9 percent. Hurricane Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday, the National Hurricane Center warned of the Category 4 storm bearing down on the U.S. east coast.
UnitedHealth shares (N:UNH) also weighed on the Dow. The stock fell 3.2 percent after a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) downgrade. 
Apple (O:AAPL) shares dropped 1.3 percent, weighing on the three major indexes. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rebounded from losses last week.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he was ready to levy additional taxes on practically all Chinese imports, threatening duties on $267 billion of goods over and above planned tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese products. 
China said it will respond if Washington takes any new steps on trade. Also, Apple last week said a ""wide range"" of its products would be hit, although it did not mention the iPhone.
At the same time, investors are optimistic about U.S. economic data and forecasts for earnings.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to unveil tax cuts this week, intended to augment Trump's 2017 tax overhaul that added $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit through permanent tax cuts for U.S. companies.
Shares of  United Rentals  (N:URI) rose 5.0 percent after the company said it was buying privately held equipment rental firm BlueLine Rental.
Among other gainers,  Nike  (N:NKE) rose 2.2 percent after a report said the footwear maker's Labor Day sales rose, easing concerns about the hit to demand after the Colin Kaepernick advertisement.
Tesla (O:TSLA) gained 8.5 percent after brokerages Baird and Bernstein said the electric carmaker was on track to be profitable and cash-flow positive in the second half of the year.
 Alibaba  (N:BABA) dropped 3.7 percent after the company said Jack Ma will step down as chairman in one year, passing on the reins to trusted lieutenant Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

257,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 04:21PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. JOLTS Report on Tap
More figures on the U.S. employment situation arrive tomorrow, as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) is released at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists predict that the numbers for July ticked down to 6.646 million from the previous report.
The recent numbers, including the payroll report, show a strong labor market. But there are concerns that the growing number of people finding jobs is now putting upward pressure on wages, leading to inflation.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates to keep price inflation in check when it meets Sept. 25-26.
At the same time the latest figures on wholesale inventories come out. A rise of 0.7% in July is expected, the same as the gain seen in June.
2. Oil Traders Brace for Impact of Hurricane Season
Oil prices will likely be volatile as Hurricane Florence heads towards the East Coast of the United States.
While the storm is not expected to disrupt oil production, there is some concern on the part of traders that a severe storm could dent demand for oil as people and businesses hunker down.
There is also the potential for output as well as demand disruption as storms Isaac and Helene may hit energy production, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group.
At 4:30 PM ET (20:30 GMT), the API will release its weekly crude stockpiles report. Last week inventories fell by 1.2 million.
3. More Retail Earnings Arrive
The earnings calendar remains light, but specialty retailer Francesca's (NASDAQ:FRAN) will weigh in with numbers ahead of trading.
On average, analysts expect that the company earned 5 cents per share in its most recent quarter, on sales of about $121 million.
The stock has been hard hit in the last month, dropping from around $7.50 a share to near $6.
Also in the retail sector, convenience store chain Casey's General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY) will report. Analysts predict a profit of $1.66 per share on sales of about $2.6 billion."

259,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 03:13PM ET</span>",Ryanair bars journalists from AGM as pilot dispute rumbles on,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) on Monday barred all media from reporting at its annual shareholder meeting next week, saying the move is to allow shareholders to raise matters freely with the board without discussions being ""distorted"".
Journalists generally report from annual general meetings (AGMs) of publicly listed companies and Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary usually speaks to the media at press briefings for each year's meeting. Ryanair said there would be no press briefing this year.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has suffered its worst ever strikes this summer as it struggled to quell protests over slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements with pilots and cabin crew.
Ryanair's AGM last year was dominated by the cancellation of 2,000 flights because of rostering problems that sparked the staff unrest. The meeting was open to the media and O'Leary conducted a lengthy news conference afterwards.
While the airline secured a breakthrough last month by reaching agreement with striking Irish pilots and said it was hopeful it could soon secure deals in other markets, cabin crew in five countries threatened another major strike on Friday.
""Ryanair today advised all relevant financial media that at its AGM next week (Sept. 20), there will be no press invited or admitted to the meeting and no press briefing afterwards,"" the Irish airline said in a statement.

""We wish to allow shareholders to discuss all matters freely with the board without these discussions being distorted for PR purposes.""

NEW YORK (IFR) - Millions in projected cost-savings at Refinitiv will be a key consideration for investors mulling the US$13.5bn-equivalent loan and high-yield bond sale financing the buyout of the business, credit research firm CreditSights said on Monday.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) agreed to buy a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' Financial & Risk division - which includes IFR and has been renamed Refinitiv - in January.
The debt package is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis and is being seen as a major test of the leveraged finance markets on both sides of the Atlantic.
In a note on Monday, CreditSights analysts said one of the major factors investors will consider is the US$650m in run-rate cost savings expected to be made in the first couple of years, and how realistic that target is.
""Value creation from this deal will come first and foremost from cost cutting,"" CreditSights said.
""We view this target (US$650m) as aggressive, though not impossible, and would push management for more color on how these cost cuts will be achieved and how progress will be communicated to investors going forward.""
Blackstone's track record and its success in cutting costs at other companies it owns will be important.
But some investors have already told IFR that the magnitude of the cost-savings is off-putting.
Some details have already emerged on how the cost savings, to be completed by the end of the third fiscal year after closing, will be achieved. Almost half, or around US$300m will be from headcount reduction alone, CreditSights said.
Other savings are expected to come from the virtualization of IT infrastructure, procurement and real estate.
More details on the company's strategy are expected to emerge over coming days as meetings are held with investors. A bond roadshow began September 5 and continues this week. The bond is expected to price on September 18.
Price talk on the US$5.5bn-equivalent bond - which includes four parts in euros and US dollars - was announced last week.
Initial price thoughts are low 7% area and low 9% area respectively for the US$2bn 7.5-year non-call three senior secured first-lien bond and US$1.8bn eight-year non-call three senior unsecured bond. 
Two euro-denominated tranches are also on offer with the same maturities and seniority. They will be sized at US$1bn-equivalent for the 7.5NC3, and US$700m-equivalent for the 8NC3. Initial price thoughts are 5% area and 7% area, respectively. 
The debt package also includes US$8bn of loans.
ELEKTRON CROWN JEWEL
Blackstone is making its biggest bet since the financial crisis with the acquisition, which pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 
The F&R business - now counted as a discontinued operation - grew revenues by 2% in constant currency to US$1.55bn in the second quarter, Reuters reported last month.
After five years of transition at F&R, CreditSights said it was ""cautiously optimistic the worst is behind Refinitiv.
""Pressure on the desktop business from headcount reduction on the sell-side and commercial price adjustments will continue,"" it said.
""However, we expect growth from Elektron, transactions and risk will be able to offset these pressures at the group level.""
Refinitiv's data platform business Elektron was probably one of the most attractive assets to Blackstone, it said.
""The use of Refinitiv's data (the data that powers Elektron) will be a focus. There are many avenues through which big data can be levered to create value for Refinitiv. Elektron's large data set also puts Refinitiv in a strong position to make advances in AI.""
Blackstone will also look to consolidate parts of the business - either with companies it owns, or with competitors, CreditSights said. 
Press reports emerged earlier this year that a listing or sale of fixed income trading platform Tradeweb, which is majority-owned by Thomson Reuters, was also being considered.
The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and an affiliate of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC will invest alongside Blackstone. The deal is expected to close on October 1.

Other analysts have also been talking about the deal recently. Covenant Review on Friday published a note urging investors to push back on aggressive covenants.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 11:32AM ET</span>",VW investors sue for billions of dollars over diesel scandal,"By Jan Schwartz
BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Investors took Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to court on Monday to seek compensation for the hit to the carmaker's share price from its diesel emissions scandal, with plaintiffs holding out hopes for billions of dollars in damages.
Shareholders representing 1,670 claims are seeking 9.2 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in damages over the scandal, which broke in September 2015 and has cost Volkswagen (VW) 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines so far.
It is likely, however, that only some of the claims will be taken into account because of the statute of limitations, presiding judge Christian Jaede told the Braunschweig higher regional court as proceedings began, without giving a figure.
Andreas Tilp, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said he believes that claims worth 2 billion euros of the roughly 5 billion euros he represents have a chance.
""We are very confident that there will be money at the end of the day,"" he said.
Judge Jaede said the case was highly complicated, with many legal questions to be clarified. The court has not yet set a detailed timetable for proceedings in a case that could well end up in a higher court.
The plaintiffs say VW failed in its duty to inform investors about the financial impact of the scandal, which became public only after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a ""notice of violation"" on Sept. 18, 2015.
Had investors known about VW's criminal activities in rigging emissions tests, they may have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue.
VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars.
WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN?
""VW should have told the market that they cheated and generated risk worth billions,"" said Tilp. ""VW should have told the market no later than June 2008 that they could not make the technology that they needed in the United States.""
The carmaker's decision between 2005 and 2007 to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal, but it is not clear that it was taken to keep investors in the dark, judge Jaede said.
VW has admitted systematic emissions cheating, but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure.
""This case is mainly about whether Volkswagen complied with its disclosure obligations to shareholders and the capital markets,"" VW lawyer Markus Pfueller told the court. ""We are convinced that this is the case.""
A challenge of the case, according to Jaede, is that it covers many incidents stretching back to 2005, with claims before July 9, 2012 potentially invalidated by the statute of limitations, the court said in a summary of proceedings.
However, the results of a study into VW diesel engines commissioned by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) and investigations by U.S. regulators from May 2014 could constitute insider information, the court said.
Critical to the case, Jaede said, was the period from early 2014, when he said VW employees had learned that U.S. tests showed its diesel cars emitted far more toxic nitrogen oxide on the road than under laboratory conditions.
There is also the question of who within VW knew what, and when, whether the information would actually have had an impact on the share price had it been made public, and if so, how damages should be calculated, the court added.
VW's board did not see the need to brief investors before September 2015 because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an EPA notice of violation and because VW was in talks about reaching a settlement, the carmaker said in a court filing.
It added that board members at the time, including current CEO Herbert Diess and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, did not violate disclosure rules.
Plaintiffs, including fund management firm Deka, allege that managers below management board level, including divisional heads, knew early on about deliberate and systematic cheating.
The company was therefore aware of criminal activity and so investors should have been warned earlier, the plaintiffs say.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>","Once darling of foreign investors, Turkey's power market struggles","By Humeyra Pamuk
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - When Austrian energy company OMV started operating its power plant in Turkey in 2013, the country's electricity sector was the darling of foreign investors, lured by promises of market liberalization and the highest growth forecasts outside China.
Five years later, OMV has sold off its Turkish plant for barely half of the 600 million euros it initially invested and Turkey's power companies are in debt restructuring talks with banks, amid a tumbling lira and rising energy costs.
With the promised liberalization only partly delivered, and state-owned plants at times undercutting market prices, private sector firms found their margins squeezed even before the lira crisis drove up repayment costs on foreign currency loans.
""Turkey no longer fits our product portfolio,"" said an OMV spokesperson in Vienna. OMV also sold off its wholly owned fuel retailer Petrol Ofisi in 2017, two years after its former CEO described the Turkey investments as ""a disappointment"".
With their margins squeezed, many power companies are fighting to keep cash flows stable and struggling to find buyers, as the outlook darkens for the Turkish economy and for a still heavily state-regulated electricity market.
""We will be seeing cash tightness more frequently. I don't want to think of a scenario where the private sector or the state is not able to deliver on its pledges,"" said an industry source who works in a power generation company.
According to a report by Boston Consulting Group and Turkish business group Tusiad, a total of $95 billion of investments have been poured into the Turkish electricity market over the past 15 years, largely funded by cheap credit. Of this, around $50 billion is yet to be repaid.
Several Turkish companies, including power firms, are seeking to restructure their debt after the lira lost 40 percent this year due to concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan's opposition to higher interest rates and a bitter diplomatic dispute with the United States.
Conglomerate Gama Holding is among the latest in talks to sell some of its assets, including a stake in its Gama Energy, which produces electricity from hydro, wind and natural gas with around 1,100 MW installed power across Turkey.
Such financing issues risk clouding the outlook even for the renewables sector - a relative bright spot in Turkey's power market. Fitch Ratings last month downgraded its near-term forecasts for Turkish solar and wind capacity as it expected fewer projects to gain financing in the short run.
""It should not be a surprise for (power) companies to file for bankruptcy one after the other,"" said a senior manager at a Turkish energy firm. ""Many companies are really in a dire situation and they are in a panic to restructure,"" he said.
STATE INTERVENTION
Turkish energy officials declined to comment for this story.
Turkey has reduced the state's role in power production through privatizations and also brought power trading onto an exchange to boost transparency.
But the government still holds 25 percent of total installed power supply and often offers prices below market levels, effectively setting a ceiling that can defy market fundamentals.
The natural gas market has remained largely under state control, hampering further development of the power market. More than 37 percent of the 85,200 MW electricity generation uses natural gas. As a result, power plants fed by natural gas, which have more flexible production levels than renewables and coal-fired plants, are the hardest hit.
Turkey's state pipeline operator Botas has more than doubled prices for gas supplied to power plants, to 1,700 lira per kilowatt hour (KwH) this month from 717 lira last year.
But electricity sale prices for those gas-fired power plants have risen much less. The market clearing price at Turkey's Energy Bourse (EPIAS) rose 67 percent over the same period, while household power prices only rose 33 percent.
""Our margins have evaporated. There is no predictability or visibility in the market, which makes it even more difficult for restructuring. And that jeopardizes the financial stability of these companies,"" said Selim Guven, Commercial Director of Acwa Power in Turkey.
""When you are indirectly subsidizing the manufacturing sector and consumers with cheap electricity, you are damaging the financial sustainability, predictability and the foreign investor appetite in the power industry.""
When OMV and other foreign investors flocked to Turkey, its power market looked to be the only one in Europe promising returns, with energy demand forecasts second only to China.
Turkey's overall energy demand still grew at 4.4 percent a year in the decade to 2016, more than twice the global average, BP's Statistical Review of World Energy said.
But Turkey's recent economic woes have prompted economists to downgrade growth forecasts, and some now see prolonged economic contraction into 2019.
Some government measures - including incentives for power plants to use domestic coal to help reduce a $37 billion energy import bill - have damaged price predictability.

""You need predictability, consistent state policies, financial stability and access to longer term funding,"" Guven said. ""At the moment we are struggling in all these aspects.""

285,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 10:33AM ET</span>",Volvo Cars drops IPO due to trade tensions and auto stocks downturn,"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Laurence Frost
BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner Geely have postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker, blaming trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
But while Volvo's plans for a Stockholm listing were delayed indefinitely, Britain's Aston Martin vowed to push ahead with its own initial public offering.
""We've come to the conclusion that the timing is not optimal for an IPO right now,"" Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters by telephone on Monday, confirming a decision which was first reported by the Financial Times.
Volvo and its Chinese parent had been discussing an IPO to value the carmaker at between $16 billion and $30 billion, sources have previously said. The company said a listing was still possible in the future.
But Samuelsson said IPO prospects had dimmed with the business cycle, amid a broad-based decline in automotive shares that has dragged the Stoxx 600 Autos & Parts index (SXAP) 15 percent lower so far this year. 
Even before the recent sell-off, however, some observers doubted the $30 billion upper end of Volvo's target valuation.
""We had expressed our reservations concerning lofty valuation ambitions before,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said on Monday. ""Trade wars are just one red flag."" 
Washington's escalating trade spat with Beijing and tensions with Europe have rattled automotive investors, adding volatility to market outlooks. 
Volvo is less exposed than its German premium rivals to U.S.-China tariffs, however, and has said it will juggle production of its XC60 SUV to reduce their impact.
It delivered 61,480 cars in China in the first half, a fraction of BMW's (DE:BMWG) or Audi's (DE:VOWG_p) sales.
Geely, which paid  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) $1.8 billion for Volvo in 2010, also has stakes in Mercedes-Benz parent  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb) and Lotus. 
CHINESE INROADS 
Geely and its boss Li Shufu had concluded that Volvo should make deeper inroads into the Chinese market before listing, a person familiar with the group's thinking told Reuters. 
And Volvo, which is developing Polestar as an electrified performance brand and owns a stake in Geely stablemate Lynk&Co, has ""other alternatives"" to raise finance, Samuelsson said.
The IPO postponement reflects bigger concerns about ""price development after a potential IPO"" rather than about the initial valuation, the CEO added, citing sensitivities over the prevalence of public pension funds among Swedish investors.
""What made me nervous especially was leaving headroom for investors"" amid growing market uncertainties, he said.
Swedish telecoms operator Telia (ST:TELIA) drew public wrath after its shares sank from their 2000 debut. For a domestic car brand, such a setback could dent both image and sales.
Samuelsson also said that Aston Martin, as a pure luxury play, was ""more like Ferrari"" - whose widely envied listing came close to late boss Sergio Marchionne's 10-billion-euro target valuation. Like Volvo, Aston Martin was once owned by Ford. 

""I wish them luck with their IPO,"" Samuelsson said.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 09:51AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Campbell Soup steps up CEO search, COO a contender - sources","By Richa Naidu and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co's (N:CPB) board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said.
Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell's 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May. Morrison's departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings.
Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison's departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis.
That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month. Despite Morrison's exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources.
Mignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S. company's snack and meal businesses, in addition to U.S. sales and global development. Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011.
Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile. Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said.
CNBC reported in May, at the time of Morrison's departure, that Mignini was a likely candidate for the CEO seat. 
The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements. 
Campbell's board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on whether Mignini was the top internal candidate and said the board had been working with executive-search firms to assess both internal and external candidates. Third Point declined to comment.
Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion. 
Third Point's board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November. The turmoil could discourage some of the consumer industry's top executives from applying, the sources said. 
Third Point faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company. A board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell, however, to explore a sale with more urgency.
EXTERNAL CANDIDATES
Third Point, which manages $18 billion in assets, has played a role in bringing new CEOs to several companies, including Jose Almeida to Baxter International Inc (N:BAX), Tad Smith to Sotheby's (N:BID), and Marissa Mayer to Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA).
One external CEO candidate Campbell Soup's board is expected to consider is Mark Clouse, chief executive of Pinnacle Foods Inc (N:PF), who will soon be without a full-time job after his company agreed in June to sell itself to ConAgra Brands Inc (N:CAG) for $8.1 billion.
Clouse, 49, is an industry veteran, having also held senior positions at Oreo-maker  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) and Kraft Foods (NASDAQ:KHC) Inc. It is not clear if Clouse would be interested. He could not be reached for comment.
Campbell said on Aug. 30 it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale in the future, snubbing a call from Third Point to do so urgently. 
The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.

Campbell's latest foray into fresh food has faltered, while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt at the same time as costs increased.

A 2 percent jump in Italian shares on soothing budget comments had boosted Europe (EU) and Wall Steet was set to start higher, but it felt fragile after a fresh sell-off in China overnight (SS) dragged Asia to a new 14-month low.
Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. row after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday.
He said he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods in addition to the $200 billion already facing levies. He called on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to make its products in the United States. 
Strong U.S. jobs numbers on Friday had bolstered bets on a higher dollar, with expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising U.S. interest rates. 
""It's more of the same, markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,"" said fund manager GAM's Investment Director of emerging market equities, Tim Love.
He pointed to the latest fall in China's currency, the yuan, which is now down almost 9 percent versus the dollar since April. ""You are back to the highly politically charged question - is this currency manipulation or not?""
Europe's resistance to the gloom was led by the jump in Milan after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said over the weekend that the country's upcoming budget would help push down the government's bond market borrowing costs.
RELIEF IN SWEDEN
Stockholm and the Swedish crown strengthened after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than polls had predicted in elections on Sunday.
The crown rose about 0.6 percent to 10.43 against the euro, while the neighboring Norwegian crown surged after higher August inflation data cemented expectations that interest rates will go up there next week.
The euro made 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1575 after falling more than half a percent on Friday following the U.S. jobs data. 
Figures on Friday showed traders' overall dollar positions making their biggest drop in nearly six months. The pullback comes after speculators had boosted net long bets on the greenback to the highest for more than 1-1/2 years, in late August.
""There is an awareness that it is a very crowded trade,"" said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.
""There are some major uncertainties about just how far U.S. growth outperformance and monetary divergence will go,"" he said.
FRAGILE CHINA 
The most eyecatching action was in Asia again. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March.
Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launched any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it will resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China.
Chinese shares were battered, with the blue-chip index off 1.4 percent. Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite fell 1.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 1.3 percent.
Japan's Nikkei ended 0.3 percent higher after revised second-quarter data showed the world's third-biggest economy grew at its fastest pace since 2016.
Trump, who is challenging China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union on trade issues, has also expressed displeasure about the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
EMERGING MARKET RISKS 
The latest 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently.
Some Asian economies are vulnerable, too, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They also noted a ""concentration risk"" from some of the world's largest funds' heavy investments in emerging-market assets.
The Indian rupee hit a record low of 72.50 per dollar and Indonesia's rupiah - Asia's second-worst performer this year - weakened 0.4 percent, near an all-time low.
""Given the latest comments from Trump, investors are likely to see the potential for further depreciation in EM currencies with the trade war cranking up yet another notch,"" said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia.
There were other areas of fallout from the global trade worries too. The Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese growth because of the large volume of metals Australia sells to China, hovered near its lowest in 2-1/2 years and was last at $0.7115. 
Copper, which China hoovers up ferociously, tumbled 1.2 percent, after seeing a 20 percent drop already this year. 
Gold was lower at $1,193.01 but oil prices bucked the trend, climbing after three straight days of losses as data showed U.S. drilling stalling and with U.S. sanctions against Iran's crude exports looming in November.

U.S. crude futures were up 44 cents at $68.20 per barrel and Brent crude futures added 52 cents to $77.35 a barrel.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 08:15AM ET</span>",Elliott hits back at Vivendi over Telecom Italia accusations,"By Agnieszka Flak and Gwénaëlle Barzic
MILAN (Reuters) - Activist fund Elliott on Monday struck back at  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) after its accusations over the management and share price performance at  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) since the U.S. fund staged a boardroom coup at the Italian firm. 
Vivendi, TIM's top shareholder with a 24 percent stake, said last week the management of Telecom Italia (TIM) had been ""disastrous"" since Elliott wrestled board control away from the French media group in May. 
It also said TIM's share price had lost 35 percent since Elliott's involvement, while the fund had promised to double it within two years.
Elliott-backed candidates succeeded in securing two-thirds of TIM board seats in May after a two-month campaign by the activist fund to shake up the way Vivendi had been running the former telecoms monopoly.
On Monday, Elliott said it had not promised to double TIM's share price but offered ""an assessment of the upside potential"" to the stock over the medium-term if some of its proposals were executed by an independent board. 
Besides a governance overhaul, the activist fund had proposed a spin-off and partial sale of a soon-to-be-created network company, a conversion of savings shares, a return to dividends and asset sales.
""To date, the board has not adopted any of those recommendations. Instead, the board has thus far adhered to Vivendi's own approach,"" Elliott said.
Vivendi officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
TIM shares were up 3 percent at 0.54 euros by 1102 GMT, outperforming a 2.2 percent rise in Milan's blue-chip index (FTMIB). 
A trader said Elliott's note suggested the fund could resurrect its push for strategic changes at TIM, lifting the stock. Shares in European telecoms firms were also helped by a positive  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) report on the sector. 
FRESH IDEAS 
Under CEO Amos Genish, appointed when Vivendi controlled the board, TIM is working to execute a three-year turnaround plan focusing on a digital transformation, fixing the group's finances and getting back an investment grade credit rating.
However, the former state phone monopoly has been facing growing challenges in both fixed and mobile: broadband group Open Fiber is rolling out a rival fiber optic network while French telecoms group  Iliad  (PA:ILD) in May launched its low-price mobile offer for Italy.
Elliott said Vivendi had ""fallen prey to the 'short-termism' it has previously decried"", casting judgment on the new board just four months after it was appointed.
""If Vivendi now takes the view that fresh ideas are needed, Elliott would welcome its help in promoting value-creative solutions at the board level,"" Elliott added. 

Before the May boardroom coup, Elliott and Vivendi have been at loggerheads for months, with Elliott accusing Vivendi of serving only its own interests and the French media group saying Elliott was looking only for short-term financial gain.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 07:43AM ET</span>",CBS CEO Moonves resigns amid new allegations of sexual misconduct,"By Kenneth Li
(Reuters) - Leslie Moonves, the top executive at CBS Corp (NYSE:CBS) since 2006 and a major figure at the broadcast network and media company for more than two decades, resigned on Sunday amid a new wave of allegations against him of sexual assault and harassment.
His departure as chairman, CEO and president was confirmed by the company in a statement coinciding with its announcement of a deal to end litigation against majority CBS shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc for control of CBS.
Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello will take over as interim CEO as the board searches for a replacement, according to the announcement. The settlements end years of uncertainty over the future of CBS and could potentially open the door to future deals.
The announcement came after six more women accused Moonves of sexual assault and harassment in a report published on Sunday in the New Yorker magazine. The newly disclosed incidents, which the women said occurred between the 1980s and early 2000s, included claims of forced sex, Moonves exposing himself and his alleged use of physical violence and intimidation.
""Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am. Effective immediately I will no longer be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CBS,"" Moonves said in a statement on Sunday. 
Moonves, who turned CBS from an aging radio and TV broadcaster into a successful provider of shows to digital platforms, was expected to reap an estimated $100 million in severance. But Moonves, 68, could end up with nothing pending an investigation into the allegations of violence against women conducted by law firms hired by an independent committee of the CBS board of directors.
CBS said it and Moonves will donate $20 million of Moonves' severance to organizations supporting the #MeToo movement.
""Today's resolution will benefit all shareholders, allowing us to focus on the business of running CBS - and transforming it for the future,"" Redstone said in a statement. ""We are confident in Joe's ability to serve as acting CEO and delighted to welcome our new directors, who bring valuable and diverse expertise and a strong commitment to corporate governance.""
National Amusements agreed to avoid pressing for a merger of CBS and Viacom, which is also controlled by National Amusements, for at least two years.
In earlier court filings, NAI had dropped support for a deal before it was sued in May by CBS for control of the company. The settlement does not preclude other parties from suggesting a merger or bringing other potential transactions to the board, one source said.
Five current independent directors and one National Amusements-affiliated director have stepped down from the board of directors and six new directors have been elected, the company said.
Three of the new board members are women, each considered a trailblazer in their respective fields, bringing the total to six on the 13-member board. They are: Candace Beinecke, a senior partner at international law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed; Barbara Byrne, a retired vice chairman of investment banking at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), and Susan Schuman, CEO of SYPartners, a business consultancy.
Also new to the board are: Richard Parsons, former chairman of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Time Warner; Brian Goldner, CEO of Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS); and Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two Interactive TTWO.O.
CBS said the board will schedule its annual shareholders meeting no later than Nov. 30.
'DAMAGE DONE'
Reports of a potential big payout to Moonves drew fire from advocacy groups.
""CBS, as you sit in a room debating next steps to rectify the damage done, remember that the world is watching. We will accept nothing less than full transparency of the investigation's findings, a commitment to real change across all levels of CBS management and no reward for Les Moonves,"" Time's Up, a campaign against workplace sexual misconduct, said in a statement.
CBS said details of the litigation settlement and the Moonves agreement will be disclosed in an upcoming regulatory filing.
In a statement to the New Yorker, Moonves acknowledged three of the newly described encounters, but said they were consensual. (Full Story)
""The appalling accusations in this article are untrue,"" Moonves told the New Yorker. ""What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women.""
CBS said on Sunday it takes such allegations very seriously.
""The CBS Board of Directors is committed to a thorough and independent investigation of the allegations, and that investigation is actively underway,"" the media company's board said in a statement.
(This version of the story has been refiled to correct last name of Chief Operating Officer to Ianniello from Ianiello in paragraph 3)

298,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:41AM ET</span>",Hengli's high-tech petroleum complex breathes down PetroChina's neck,"By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng
DALIAN, China (Reuters) - On reclaimed land on the island of Changxin near the port of Dalian, workers are putting the finishing touches on a plant that is the future of China's refining and petrochemical industry.
Here, private chemical company Hengli Group will begin testing its $11 billion oil refinery and petrochemical complex in October.
The plant is a direct challenge to China National Petroleum Corp's (CNPC) Dalian Petrochemical Corp facility, the country's second-largest oil refinery. That 70-year-old plant has been a cash cow for state-owned CNPC but the aging refinery has come under scrutiny after several accidents.
Hengli's (SS:600346) high-tech complex will not only produce the fuels China craves but also the plastics and other chemicals the country will need for the future.
China plans to add a dozen petrochemical mega-complexes along its east coast over the next five years, in the biggest wave of expansion in its history.
The plants will be backed by state majors Sinopec and Sinochem, private groups Shenghong Petrochemical and Wanhua Chemical, as well as  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Germany's BASF.
""Under a more liberalized policy, more independent and foreign companies will join the investment that will make China more self-sufficient in chemicals,"" said William Chen, chemicals analyst at IHS Markit.
CNPC's listed arm PetroChina Co (SS:601857), which operates Dalian, has become one of the world's most valuable oil firms by providing the gasoline and diesel to power China's expanding private car fleet and the freight trucks underpinning its expanding commerce.
But Dalian may become a symbol of the past as competitors such as Hengli feed the demand of the world's biggest petrochemical consumer.
China's demand for diesel will likely peak by 2020 and gasoline by around 2035, according to IHS Markit.
However, the country's demand for ethylene, a building block for plastics and polyesters, will rise to 26.8 million tonnes by 2020, from 18.7 million tonnes in 2015, according to consultancy Globaldata.
Hengli's sprawling complex is geared to meet that demand and reduce imports.
It will be followed by a similar one in Zhejiang province by private polyester company Zhejiang Rongsheng Holding Group.
The sites for these mega projects include Zhanjiang and Huizhou in south China's Guangdong province, Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in east China's Fujian province, and Lianyungang in Jiangsu, with plants to be situated on islands or peninsulas far away from residents to contain environmental risks.
Meantime, China may raise its oil refining capacity by about 16 percent to 20 million barrels per day (bpd) by around 2023, according to a Reuters tally of announced projects. This will result in a surplus of about 3 million bpd, equal to about one-fifth of Europe's refining capacity, as fuel demand growth stagnates.
While China's government has not stated a specific target for closing down the excess capacity, industry executives have raised concerns about the widening glut.
Ethylene capacity will rise by 14 million tonnes a year during the same period, up by 76 percent from the current total estimated production, according to a count of announced projects.
FULL FLEXIBILITY
Hengli's new facility, showcasing private participation in the sector, will be one of the world's biggest.
It has a quota to import 20 million tonnes of crude oil a year, about 400,000 bpd and equal to its total refining capacity, the most of any independent refiner.
Hengli said it has signed agreements with state-owned Sinochem to import crude and export fuels, and signed Sinopec, CNPC's biggest national rival, as a domestic fuel marketing agent.
In addition to its crude distillation capacity, the Hengli complex will have two 3.2-million-tonnes-per-year residue hydrocracking units, and three 3.2 million-tonnes-per-year reforming units.
For chemicals, it will have a 1.5-million-tonnes-per-year ethylene unit and two 2.25-million-tonnes-per-year paraxylene units.
""Integration gives us full flexibility to optimize output among oil, olefins and aromatics as and when that market is in favor,"" said Hengli's spokesman Li Feng, ""It will be one of the industry's most profitable plants.""
Beyond China, Hengli's new facility will also challenge north Asian rivals and force them to cut output, said Steve Jenkins, a vice president at consultants Wood Mackenzie.
OLD NEIGHBOR
PetroChina's Dalian plant has the same crude refining capacity as the Hengli site but its fortunes have turned since a deadly pipeline blast at the oil receiving port in 2010 caused a large spill.
Other accidents followed, the latest a fire at the plant's gasoline unit in August 2017, resulting in tighter regulatory scrutiny from local environmental authorities.
Dalian is located just hundreds of meters from residential housing and there have long been complaints about safety, foul smells and pollution.
""Being a plant manager, you live under constant stress as you risk losing your job when next accident occurs,"" said a site manager at Dalian, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to talk to press.
Adding to the safety and environment concerns, Dalian's profit margins have been squeezed by a slowdown in fuel demand and rising competition from independent refiners.
CNPC and PetroChina declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Eventually, the Dalian refinery as well as similar plants that mainly produce fuels will become redundant.
""We're caught in a dilemma. There is little space for us to upgrade, while the cost of relocating will be too huge to bear,"" said the Dalian plant manager.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Danica Patrick has learned life lessons in the fast lane,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you ever wonder what it's like to be a woman in a man’s world, just consult the planet’s leading authority on the matter: Danica Patrick.
Racecar driving is a famously male-dominated arena, but that did not seem to unnerve Patrick as she developed into a champion racer and the most successful woman in the history of the sport.
So it stands to reason that Patrick, 36, might have a few things to say about standing up for yourself, following your dreams, and succeeding against tall odds.
As she transitions out of racing and steers her multiple businesses - athletic wear, winemaking, writing and speaking - she spoke with Reuters about the lessons learned from her high-risk, high-reward life on the track.
Q: Did you get your entrepreneurial spirit from your parents?
A: I grew up in Roscoe, Illinois, and my parents worked a whole lot. They started a glass business out of their garage, they had an oil exchange, they started a drywall company. So they were very much entrepreneurs, and always had that sort of mindset.
The business I probably remember most was the coffee shop. We were living in England at the time, since I was racing over there. We literally loved coffee, so we decided, ‘Let’s make a business!’ I even remember designing the logo on my little notebook paper. But my parents still say I was a terrible employee.
Q: As you first got started in racing, how did you deal with prejudice?
A: The challenge I always had was getting people to believe I could do it. Everybody deals with that on some level, but not with as much skepticism as I faced. Your confidence has to be pulled from your own knowledge. If you truly know what you are talking about, then you can hang with anyone, or even school them. People will usually respect you after that.
Q: When success hit, what was the best advice you got about handling fame and wealth?
A: It was from Bobby Rahal, my first IndyCar boss. I just saw him a couple of weeks ago, and told him it’s still the best advice I ever got. He said: ‘Don’t spend all your money, and make sure to create businesses that will still make money even after you are done racing. That way you can continue living the life you are used to living. Create that infrastructure early, so you can be financially secure even after you retire.’
Q: Any money mistakes that you regret?
A: The worst thing that happened to me is just learning from bad deals. With race teams there is a lot of money flowing in from different places, and the more hands it passes through, the more it gets confusing. So contract disputes develop, because one person thinks one thing, and another person thinks another. It’s sad to see money lost like that.
Q: You have done a lot of advocating for life insurance, as spokesperson for September's Life Insurance Awareness Month for the industry's trade group – why is that?
A: As soon as I started racing Indy cars and earning some money, I started thinking about life insurance. I thought, what if something happens to me? Who will pay the mortgage, or the monthly bills, or take care of my employees? Once things started getting risky on the track, I realized how important it was.
For me, I had to protect my house and my businesses, but for other people it might be their families and kids. You have to prepare for the worst, if your income stops coming in.
Q: How do you distribute your charitable dollars?
A: I thought about creating my own foundation, but it’s a lot of work, and there are already so many charities out there. So I would rather show up to my friends’ causes and support them, and draw attention to those charities. I’m the girl who raises her hand a lot at live auctions.
Q: What life lessons do you try to pass along to others?
A: Quite simply, follow your passion. When you do that, you are happier, and you are probably more successful because you really enjoy it. In life, you have to do what is calling you.

301,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","After its near-death, AIG CEO plots revival by returning to basics","By Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brian Duperreault, who rejoined American International Group Inc (N:AIG) as chief executive officer last year to turn the company around, remembers another era when the insurer was trying to blaze a trail toward greatness.
In 1973, Duperreault arrived at AIG's old Lower Manhattan office to interview for an actuarial position. The company's name was painted on the brick exterior of the building and linoleum tiles were missing from the floor inside, leaving spots of exposed cement and old, dried glue.
He was 26, fresh out of the U.S. Army and knew nothing about the insurance business, but Duperreault was sold on AIG's scrappy vibe and high-energy employees.
""I had made a choice with my heart and not with my head,"" he said in an interview. ""But it worked out pretty well.""
Now 71, Duperreault is taking a different gamble at the other end of his career, trying to restore lost shine to a company that has struggled ever since a $182 billion taxpayer bailout saved it from collapse in 2008. 
AIG finished repaying the debt, plus a $22.7 billion return, in 2012, but is still wrestling with the consequences of its near-death, including the sale of prized businesses to repay the U.S. government, and a post-bailout talent drain.
In two interviews, Duperreault detailed plans to expand AIG's international reach, improve underwriting practices and make employees feel proud to work at AIG, but also more accountable for performance.
As AIG's sixth CEO in a decade, Duperreault is bringing back some practices from the era of Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg, the man who built AIG into a global insurance colossus. For example, Duperreault is letting business heads set their own budgets and performance goals, and giving underwriters more autonomy.
Duperreault is also hunting for acquisitions that will boost performance and reestablish AIG's broad reach outside the United States. 
Possible targets could include an international life or an employee benefits business. The latter would enhance AIG's Life and Retirement business and could also cater to commercial customers who have asked for the service, people familiar with the matter said.
SMART RISK-TAKING
But Duperreault's most critical task is overhauling AIG's underwriting culture after years spent chasing revenue growth without appropriately weighing risks. 
Duperreault and his deputies have been telling staff to be more selective about clients and wind down or revise unprofitable policies. AIG is also buying reinsurance to mitigate losses on old business.
""Why are we performing badly when others are performing okay or pretty good?"" Duperreault said. ""It really just goes back to smart risk-taking. You can't play every hand.""
Duperreault's immediate challenge, as he describes it, is to get the company underwriting risks profitable again – a key measure of an insurer's performance and something AIG has not done since 2007. Then he wants to get it growing again.
Duperreault has told investors AIG will break even on underwriting by the start of 2019, which is only a ""waypoint"" on a path to richer profits, he told Reuters.
Since taking the helm, Duperreault has hired more than a dozen senior executives and 125 senior underwriters to help execute his vision. Many have previously worked at AIG.
Duperreault's own $43.1 million in 2017 compensation is the largest of any AIG CEO since Greenberg left the company in 2005, according to filings. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CnYJPF)
Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis criticized pay for Duppereault and other executives ahead of AIG's annual meeting in May, arguing that the company was not performing well enough to lavish tens of millions of dollars upon top executives.
Just 62 percent of voting shareholders signed off on compensation, far below the roughly 90 percent support S&P 500 companies typically receive, according to compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy.
Some analysts say Duperreault's strategies make sense, but success is far from guaranteed. Last year, AIG reported its lowest revenue and worst loss since the financial crisis, and this year has not been much better.
""I think he can get the process started,"" said Sandler O'Neill analyst Paul Newsome. ""But it will take a very, very long time to get it back to what it was before, if that's even possible.""
AIG shares have lost more than 95 percent of their value since 2007, including 11 percent since Duperreault's hiring. (https://reut.rs/2NRx8I0)
Valued at $47.4 billion, AIG is now worth about half of AIA Group Ltd (HK:1299), a former life insurance subsidiary it spun off to reimburse taxpayers, and one-fifth of its peak value of $239 billion in 2000.
EVERY DOLLAR
In response to criticism about compensation, Duperreault said that, in his view, every dollar that goes toward hiring people who can profitably grow revenue is a dollar well spent.
""If you hire people to make money, that's probably something you should continue doing,"" Duperreault said.
Some on Wall Street welcome his top-tier hirings. ""All of those people left their jobs in high-up positions across the industry to go help Brian fix AIG,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Elyse Greenspan.
Before he left AIG in 1994 to head a company himself, Duperreault had spent more than 20 years rising through the ranks under Greenberg's tutelage.
Duperreault then headed ACE Ltd, transforming it from a niche insurer into a global powerhouse, and in 2008 became CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (N:MMC) to reinvigorate the troubled insurance brokerage after it settled a bid-rigging case.
At AIG, Duperreault has also been working to improve relations with regulators.
One of Duperreault's early challenges was getting AIG off the list of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, or SIFIs, that regulators drew up after the financial crisis.
The company had previously been trying to convince regulators that AIG was no longer a risk to the financial system after selling or winding down some $560 billion in assets and ditching the derivatives business that nearly capsized the company in 2008.
But it was on Duperreault's watch that the council of top regulators removed AIG's SIFI shackles last September.
He also had to win over state insurance regulators for his plan to move discontinued business lines to a separate reinsurance unit in Bermuda, a global insurance hub where the unit has favorable requirements for capital it has to set aside.
State regulators were initially concerned about moving those businesses out of their oversight, but after Duperreault spoke to the regulators and created a new executive-level regulatory affairs position, AIG was able to establish the unit, called DSA Re.
""I think we were able to create a level of comfort that this was a well thought-out transaction with a concrete business rationale,"" said Thomas Leonardi, a former Connecticut insurance commissioner and investment banker who took up the new role at AIG last year.
Last month,  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) agreed to buy nearly 20 percent of DSA Re. The investment could spur more deals, analysts said.
Other deals Duperreault has struck include buying Bermuda-based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd for $5.56 billion in July, and a UK group life insurance specialist from Munich Re for undisclosed terms in June. 
Finding more acquisition targets that meet his criteria has been difficult, Duperreault said.
Duperreault is looking for a company in a large market with a mature legal system that does not cost too much.

""It's better to buy than not buy – but I don't have to,"" he said. ""There is so much profitability to be gained by getting more out of the premiums we currently have.""

302,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Jack Ma's Crazy Rich Asian Odyssey Has a Timely End,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Americans like to celebrate the wealthy. The Chinese, Crazy Rich Asians aside, tend to be a lot less indulgent.
That goes some way to explaining Jack Ma's plans to retire as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.'s co-founder and the almost daily unwinding of China’s once high-flying (debt-fueled) private conglomerates, including HNA Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group Co.
Ma said Monday he’s stepping down as executive chairman in September 2019, marking his 55th birthday, to focus on philanthropy and education. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang will succeed him at Asia’s most valuable company, though Ma will stay on the board until 2020.
Ma's impact can't be understated: The online marketplace the former English teacher founded with 17 others in Hangzhou has transformed China. Alibaba is the nation’s top e-commerce player, has created the country’s Alipay, dominant payments system, runs cloud-computing and wealth-management companies and expanded its reach to India and Southeast Asia. With so many Chinese using its services, the company also aggregates the kind of personal data Beijing can only envy.
In the process, Ma also became China's richest man. That's a potentially dangerous position to be in, as any student of Chinese history knows.
Time and time again, Chinese billionaires on lists of the super-wealthy – people whose activities tend to sap the business of state-owned players – have been cut down to size. The latest round focused on those private conglomerates that, in less than a decade, accumulated assets like trophy buildings in the U.S. The global spree stoked concern about the projection of so-called soft power. Two years ago, wary of capital flight and mountains of corporate debt, Beijing began targeting the conglomerates.
Fosun International Ltd., which acquired France’s Club Med SAS resort chain several years ago, is back in the buying game. But founder Guo Guangchang knows how risky debt-fueled acquisitions can be: He briefly “vanished” in 2015, just as Fosun’s overseas acquisitions were peaking.
Wanda's Wang Jianlin remains one of China's richest men, but the real estate and mall operator has been on a great unwinding mission ever since it fell foul of over-borrowing in July 2017.
Under Wu Xiaohui, whose ties to Deng Xiaoping gave him considerable political capital, Anbang Insurance Group Co. paid over the odds for Manhattan’s Waldorf Astoria hotel, and even attempted to buy  Starwood Hotels  & Resorts Worldwide (NYSE:HOT) LLC. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud in May.
HNA, roiled by the sudden death in France of Co-Chairman Wang Jian in July, is now busy shrinking back toward the regional airline it once was. The conglomerate has sold more than $17 billion in assets this year alone, and is now planning to dispose of its entire stake in  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn).
China’s tech giants, from Alibaba to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have been similarly acquisitive. The difference is they haven’t had to rely on debt. While they’re unlikely to be compelled to unwind their expansion in the same way as the conglomerates, tech’s too-big-to-fail status is at risk.
Tencent’s Pony Ma has been famously low-profile, but Beijing’s freeze on new games threatened his company. Meanwhile, Alibaba’s more gregarious Ma raised some eyebrows when he met with President Donald Trump to discuss the creation of 1 million new U.S. jobs – three months before President Xi Jinping had his first meeting with his American counterpart.
Ma may be wise, then, to talk of stepping down now, before the heat is turned up. He remains in the 36-member Alibaba Partnership that oversees the company, so even with a stake of about 5 percent, his stamp on the New York-listed firm won’t be lost. Ma is still admired for Yoda-like wisdom at a time when his rival Richard Liu, founder of JD.com Inc., the second-largest e-commerce company, faces allegations of rape.
China needs its private-sector entrepreneurs to provide the jobs its famously inefficient state firms can’t. Ma’s impending retirement may be part of a bigger cautionary message that they should perform that task without getting too big.

303,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Spotlight on Alibaba CEO Zhang as Jack Ma starts retirement countdown,"By Cate Cadell and Adam Jourdan
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Unlike his charismatic boss, Jack Ma,  Alibaba  (N:BABA) chief executive Daniel Zhang isn't usually one to grab the limelight, let alone make kung fu movies with superstars or dance in public.
Little is known outside the company about Zhang, a soft-spoken accountant who goes under the epithet ""Xiaoyaozi"" at work - the name of a character from a Chinese martial arts novel literally meaning the ""free and unfettered one.""
But he will have to step out from the shadows after Ma said he would leave his role as chairman in September 2019, handing Zhang the reins of his $420 billion tech giant.
""We don't know much about (Zhang) even though he's been CEO for a while, because he's by nature a very low-key person, low profile. He's happy to not be in the limelight,"" said Duncan Clark, managing director at Beijing tech advisory BDA and author of ""Alibaba: The House that Jack Built"".
The handover of power, the first such transition for any of China's major tech firms, will see Zhang, 46, elevated to the top of a sprawling empire that spans e-commerce, payments, fast food delivery and brick-and-mortar retail.
Zhang, who leads Alibaba's investor calls with polish stemming from his years at global auditors Arthur Andersen and PricewaterhouseCoopers, has been CEO since 2015.
His fingerprints are on some of the company's most successful moves: he was a key architect of Alibaba's ""Singles Day,"" the Nov. 11 event that has become the world's largest online shopping festival. 
The company has added around $200 billion to its market value since he became CEO, and has now posted nine straight quarters of revenue growth above 50 percent while investing in food delivery and offline retail, and pushing into Southeast Asia.
Crucially, Zhang oversaw the growth of retail platform Tmall, which has grown to be one of the company's most significant revenue drivers, squaring off against major Chinese e-commerce rival JD.com Inc (O:JD).
But he also inherits some challenges. Despite soaring sales, Alibaba's profit margins have been squeezed by rising competition and heavy investment to fend off rivals. The company's shares are down more than 10 percent this year after peaking in June.
A global trade war is also hampering Alibaba's ambitions for international expansion, including into the United States.
WEEKLY COMMUTE
Zhang, who joined Alibaba in 2007, sees Alibaba as an integrated ecosystem that lures consumers with movies, live-streamed sports, fast food deliveries and news.
""Alibaba today is more like all-in-one,"" he told investors and analysts on a call discussing the company's quarterly earnings in August.
Zhang, who is from Shanghai, said in an interview with local business publication Yicai last year that he returned to the city once a week from Alibaba's Hangzhou headquarters to recharge and spend time with his wife. 
He added that he had not bought a house in Hangzhou because he didn't have time. To relax, he enjoys watching soccer and basketball.
Zhang - like Ma - has worked hard to promote the company since its 2014 listing, making appearances at the World Economic Forum in Davos and other global events. 
But he doesn't have the same star power that founders in China's large tech companies hold, including Jack Ma, Baidu Inc's (O:BIDU) Robin Li and Tencent Holdings Ltd's (HK:0700) Pony Ma. 
Those three frequently headline tech conferences and even government events together. Ma even did a Michael Jackson-themed dance routine at an Alibaba anniversary event last year, complete with a costume.
Zhang and his team, although working under the radar, ""are ready"" to take over, Ma said in a letter to staff and shareholders. 
Ma described Zhang as having ""superb talent, business acumen and determined leadership.""
""His analytical mind is unparalleled, he holds dear our mission and vision, he embraces responsibility with passion, and he has the guts to innovate and test creative business models,"" Ma wrote.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",Australian insurer tells inquiry broke law governing sales calls,"By Paulina Duran and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian insurer said on Monday it had committed more than 300,000 criminal breaches when cold-calling customers, as a powerful inquiry into financial industry misconduct turned its attention to the insurance sector.
The inquiry, which has exposed widespread abuses across the financial sector this year, also heard that insurers had knowingly overcharged customers and employed flawed surveillance methods to assess policyholders' claims.
The Royal Commission has the power to recommend prosecutions and instigate sweeping reforms of the financial system, threatening to upend business practices at some of Australia's biggest financial institutions.
An executive at Clearview Wealth, the former life insurance arm of high profile insurer NRMA, provided an explosive start to two weeks of hearings on the insurance industry which began on Monday.
Greg Martin, Clearview's actuary and risk officer, said the firm had closed one of its divisions after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) accused it of breaching ""anti-hawking"" laws in every sales call from 2014 to 2017.
Anti-hawking laws require life insurance telephone salespeople to follow certain protocols like notifying potential customers of their right to join a ""do not call"" register and to seek independent advice.
""Breaching the anti-hawking provisions is a criminal offence, is it not, Mr Martin?"" a lawyer assisting the inquiry, Rowena Orr, asked during the hearing.
""That's my understanding, yes,"" Martin replied.
""You accept that there were that many breaches?"" Orr asked, referring to the 303,000 sales calls that the company had notified the regulator of as violating anti-hawking laws.
""Yes,"" Martin replied.
Clearview closed the direct-sales unit where the breaches had occurred, the inquiry heard.
""MISLEADING""
Orr separately told the hearing the inquiry had received admissions of possible misconduct from 16 domestic and foreign insurance companies. 
TAL, the Australian unit of Japanese insurance giant Dai-ichi Life Holdings, had said in a submission that it had made hundreds of misleading sales calls, including to people with limited reading skills, Orr said.
""From 2012 to 2017, TAL identified that approximately 3.5 percent of its monitored calls were misleading sales calls according to its internal criteria,"" she said.
American insurer Metlife Inc had said in its submission that it had used surveillance on policyholders who had made claims for mental health conditions, Orr said, without giving details.
Suncorp Group Ltd, the country's second largest general insurer, had told the inquiry about an allegation that its surveillance had caused a deterioration in a customer's mental health. 
Hong Kong-based AIA Group said it had overcharged customers on their premiums, while the Swiss giant Zurich Insurance Group reported cases in which it had applied the terms of its policies incorrectly, Orr told the hearing without elaborating.
Insurance Australia Group, which holds a nearly 20 percent share of the country's life insurance market according to IBIS World, had told the inquiry of systemic problems with its sale processes and the handling of claims, Orr said.
The inquiry also received reports of misconduct from the insurance units of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, the country's four largest banks.

Before the public hearings, companies are asked to identify in their submissions any misconduct they had engaged in, or any conduct that fell below community standards and expectations since 2008.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares inched up on Monday as banks gained, although trade-exposed sectors like autos suffered after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes in the trade dispute with Beijing.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index added 0.25 percent by 0821 GMT after ending on Friday just above its lowest close since early April. The export-oriented DAX (GDAXI) fell 0.1 percent and the FTSE (FTSE) rose 0.1 percent.
Late on Friday, Trump warned he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion worth set for levies in coming days.
""The looming likelihood that the week will see the further ramping up of the US-China trade war – with Trump potentially enraged by the news that China's trade surplus with the U.S. hit a record high in August – led to a quiet start to Monday,"" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. 
Autos, which rely on exports, led the declines, down 0.3 percent. Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers like Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and AMS (S:AMS) came under pressure after Trump said the iPhone maker should move production to the U.S. to avoid the tariffs.
Italian banks (FTIT8300) rose as the country's government bonds rallied. Italy's economy minister predicted yields would drop when the government laid out its budget for 2019.
Shares in Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) rose more than 4 percent. UniCredit (MI:CRDI) gained after its chairman said the bank, Italy's largest by assets, would assess strategic options as it planned for 2019. He was responding to a question about a possible merger with  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
On Sunday, Josef Ackermann, former CEO of German lender  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that Europe needed bank mergers to create a regional champion.
German lenders Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which have been rumored as possible partners, rose 0.1 and 2.2 percent respectively. 
Elsewhere,  Richemont  (S:CFR) rose 1.5 percent as the Cartier maker appointed Jerome Lambert CEO and posted a 10 percent rise in five-month sales.
""His appointment is likely to be welcomed amid some investor concerns about a long-term successor at the group,"" said Kepler Cheuvreuz analyst Jon Cox, affirming a buy rating on the stock.
""The strong sales figure is likely to support a stock that has drifted versus peers and trades at almost a 30 percent discount,"" he added in a note.
The solid update supported shares in peer Swatch (S:UHR), which gained 0.8 percent.
In the UK,  RPC Group  (L:RPC) soared 21.3 percent after Europe's biggest plastics packager said it was in early talks with funds about a takeover offer for the company. It was the biggest gainer on the STOXX.
AB Foods (L:ABF) fell more than 3 percent with traders citing the gloomy outlook of its sugar business. 

Earlier on Friday, the company maintained its full-year guidance, saying the performance of its Primark fashion chain, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses would more than offset a weak sugar operation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Aston Martin has lined up experienced FTSE executives to boost its board as the 105-year-old luxury carmaker presses ahead with plans to list on the London Stock Exchange, it said on Monday. 
The company, famed for making the sports car driven by fictional secret agent James Bond, said last month it was pursuing an initial public offering (IPO), the first British carmaker to do so for decades.
Penny Hughes, who has previously worked at FTSE companies  Vodafone  (L:VOD) and supermarket WM Morrison (L:MRW), will become Aston's non-executive chair of the board when the flotation takes place, Aston Martin said. 
Richard Solomons, who was chief executive of InterContinental Hotels (L:IHG) from 2011 to 2017, will become a senior independent director and chair of the board's audit and risk committee. 
Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters the appointments would help avoid a repeat of some of the previous mistakes made by the firm, which has gone bankrupt seven times in its history. 
""If one looks at the lessons from the past where we've had millionaires and billionaires buying us, investing in one car and then walking away and that's created the problems,"" he said.
""We need to be in good governance for the next 100 years and ... having an independent board, selecting that independent board because of their deep experience in running the boards of huge public companies I think is absolutely key."" 
Imelda Walsh, who is chair of the remuneration committee at transport firm FirstGroup (L:FGP), and Peter Espenhahn, who has audit and tax experience with accountancy firm Deloitte, will also join Aston. 
The news came as China's Geely [GEELY.UL] delayed the planned listing of its Volvo Cars business, citing valuation concerns amid a global trade war.
The indicative price range for Aston's IPO and the maximum number of shares to be sold will be detailed in the firm's prospectus which is due to be published on or around Sept. 20, the company added.
The carmaker will then detail the final offer price in early October ahead of admission to the FTSE, with at least 25 percent of the stock to be floated.
Aston, which has long said it could IPO, has undergone a turnaround plan since Palmer took over as CEO in 2014 as it boosts its volumes and builds a second factory. 

The automaker, which forecasts volumes will rise to between 6,200 and 6,400 vehicles this year, hopes to build nearly 10,000 in 2020 and follow Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) by using its exclusivity to appeal to investors.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",Cartier maker Richemont hands Lambert reins for digital era,"By Silke Koltrowitz
GENEVA (Reuters) - Cartier maker  Richemont  (S:CFR) made Jerome Lambert chief executive on Monday, handing the luxury goods veteran the task of continuing to take the group, in particular its watch brands, digital.
Richemont, also known for its IWC and Piaget watches, scrapped the CEO role a year and a half ago, when Richard Lepeu retired, appointing instead a senior executive committee.
The appointment of Lambert, which coincided with the announcement of a 10 percent rise in constant currency sales growth in the five months to Aug. 31, was read as a sign Richemont controlling shareholder and Chairman Johann Rupert is now confident enough to step back from day-to-day management.
""Jerome's new role sees him taking responsibility for the Group's future growth at a time when consumer habits are changing significantly,"" Rupert said in a statement.
Lambert, who steps up from his role as chief operating officer, was seen as a leading contender to take on the CEO role after Georges Kern left to lead rival brand Breitling.
Rupert did not elaborate on the changes, but a recent management overhaul and the acquisition of online distributors Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-a-Porter and Watchfinder.co.uk have made it clear that making Richemont's watches fit for the digital age is key.
Lambert would work with the heads of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and the group's finance head on the senior executive committee ""to ensure a coherent approach to achieving our common goals"", Rupert said.
""Rupert clearly doesn't see a major crisis on the horizon"", Jon Cox of Kepler Cheuvreux said, adding the appointment indicated Rupert would revert to his role of chairman. 
WATCHES SLOW 
Richemont said strong sales at its jewelry brands, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, particularly in Asia Pacific and the Americas, helped overall sales rise by 10 percent in constant currency in the five months to Aug. 31.
Including YNAP and Watchfinder, constant currency sales jumped by a quarter to 5.67 billion euros ($6.54 billion) in the five-month period, the Geneva-based group said.
The company, which holds its annual general meeting later on Monday, said it saw growth in all regions except for the Middle East, with double digit increases in Hong Kong, Korea and Macau and ""good growth"" in China.
Sales at its watch brands only rose 4 percent as Richemont continued to adjust inventories by buying back unsold stock from retail partners, a development Vontobel analyst Rene Weber called ""disappointing"". 

Richemont shares, which have lost 7 percent of their value so far this year, were up 1.4 percent at 0756 GMT.

Trump's comment came after Apple told U.S. trade officials on Friday that proposed tariffs by Washington in an escalating trade war with China would affect prices for a ""wide range"" of Apple items, including the Apple Watch. It did not mention the iPhone.
Shares in China-based Apple suppliers Luxshare Precision Co Ltd (SZ:002475),  Shenzhen Sunway Communication  Co Ltd (SZ:300136) and Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing Co Ltd (SZ:002384) all dropped as much as 10 percent.
 Lens Technology Co Ltd  (SZ:300433), Universal Scientific Industrial Shanghai Co Ltd (SS:601231) and Suzhou Anjie Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002635) fell between 6 and 8 percent. 
In Taiwan, camera lens-maker Largan Precision Co Ltd (TW:3008) slid nearly 8 percent, Foxconn (TW:2317), formally known as  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co, fell 3.4 percent, while assembler  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938) dropped nearly 4 percent. 
Taiwan's ASE Technology Holding Co Ltd (TW:3711), which counts Apple as one of its top clients, fell 2.9 percent.
Chien Bor-yi, an analyst at Taipei-based Cathay Futures Consultant, said Apple's component supply chain in Taiwan would take a major hit if the United States increased tariffs on Chinese imported products.
""People have concerns about the stock market. It's not a seller's market, but it's also not a buyer's market. No one knows how deep the well is,"" he said. 
The technology sector is one of the biggest potential losers in the $200 billion tariff list proposed by Washington on Chinese imports because the tariffs would make imported computer parts more expensive.
Trump warned on Friday that he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on a further $267 billion of goods.
Hong Kong-listed AAC Technologies (HK:2018) fell more than 5 percent. The company supplies acoustic components and haptic technology - which enables users to receive tactile sensations from an interface - for Apple products such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. 
In Japan, Nissha (T:7915) eased 0.4 percent, Japan Display (T:6740) fell 0.7 percent and Sharp Corp (T:6753) dropped nearly 1 percent. 

""People are in a bit of a panic today. Looking forward, the focus would be on how the market reacts after Apple releases its latest models,"" said Kevin Chung, analyst at JihSun Securities Investment Consulting.

The drop came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on the possibility of imposing tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese goods.
“What’s striking is that escalating U.S. trade aggression suggests that the appeals of U.S. businesses, warning that tariffs will place burden of rising costs disproportionately on U.S. businesses and consumers, have been in vain on Trump’s administration.” said Mizuho Bank on Monday.
China responded last week that it would be forced to retaliate if the U.S. imposes the new tariffs.

Trump told journalists that Washington might impose tariffs on an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods, on top of the $200 billion imports already in consideration.
“I hate to do this, but behind that there is another $267 million ready to go on short notice if I want,” Trump said.
China released new data on Saturday that showed its trade surplus with the U.S. climbed to a record high of $31.1 billion in August. Bank of China’s Institute of International Finance Analyst Gai Xinzhe said that importers in the U.S. are front-loading orders before the next batch of tariffs are imposed.
If the newly threatened tariffs are imposed they would add up to more than the total value of Chinese imports to the U.S., which amounted to $505 billion in 2017, according to Census Bureau figures.
Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at HIS Markit, said: “With further large-scale U.S. tariff measures imminent, Chinese exporters will be hit hard and China’s GDP growth rate in 2019 is likely to be dented.”
The threats put pressure on Asian equities.
The Shanghai Composite was down 0.75% to 2,683 by 9:47PM ET (01:47 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component and the Hang Seng Index fell 0.16% and 1.18% respectively.

Blackstone Group declared its A$5.52 per share offer as final. The U.S. private equity giant increased its offer for the Sydney-focused landlord last week in response to a rival bid from Canada's Oxford Properties Group.

A Sydney-based spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group, the real estate investment arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, declined to comment.
Australia's commercial property sector has defied a softening in home values. With overall unemployment sitting at a six-year low, economic growth surging and city downtown capacity barely growing, demand is outstripping supply.

The 6.7-magnitude quake in Hokkaido last Thursday killed dozens of people and temporarily cut off power on the island. Power was restored to Toyota's transmissions plant on Saturday and production facilities are being checked for a restart, Toyota said.

The U.S. financial newspaper said Viacom is doing a better job reusing its television shows and other intellectual property, cutting expenses on non-flagship networks and seeing ratings growth on its major outlets.
Barron's wrote that the rise in shares would not depend upon a deal to merge with CBS Corp (N:CBS), although such a combination could unlock opportunities for cost savings and cross-selling.
CBS on Sunday announced a deal to end litigation against controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc for control of the broadcaster. CEO Leslie Moonves resigned from the company and National Amusements agreed it would propose no merger between CBS and Viacom for two years.

Viacom shares closed at $28.98 on Friday.

In June, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) endorsed Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting MS - the most common type of the disease - but it has now rejected it for the rarer and more severe primary-progressive form of MS.
Ocrevus is the only available treatment for primary-progressive MS (PPMS), while there are several drugs for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and Roche UK general manager Richard Erwin said Monday's decision was ""devastating news"" for patients.
It is not the first time the Swiss drugmaker has clashed with NICE, which determines if drugs are cost-effective enough to be used in the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales.
Roche has also battled to get a number of its cancer drugs approved by NICE in the past, prompting Chief Executive Severin Schwan to brand Britain's health system as ""stupid"" three years ago.
In the case of Ocrevus, Roche said it had reached a stalemate because the authorities were not allowed to even consider a confidential discounted price for using the drug in PPMS that was different from the RRMS price.
That is a problem because the evidence showing the benefit of Ocrevus in PPMS is not as compelling as in RRMS, so a lower price would be needed to reach NICE cost-effectiveness thresholds.
The restriction meant NICE had to consider the existing RRMS approved price for the PPMS indication and this was deemed too expensive. In a statement, NICE said the size and duration of the drug's benefits in PPMS were uncertain and it could not be considered an acceptable use of NHS resources.
Worldwide, Ocrevus has proved to be a big commercial success for Roche, with sales topping $1 billion in the first half of 2018, and the company said it hoped an agreement could be reached for its use within the NHS.

""Roche is confident that given the flexibility to offer an indication-specific price, we will be able to offer a price that is deemed cost-effective for PPMS,"" the company said.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 06:26PM ET</span>",CBS CEO Moonves accused of sexual misconduct by more women in New Yorker story,"By Kenneth Li and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Six more women have raised sexual assault and harassment claims against CBS Corp (N:CBS) Chief Executive Leslie Moonves in a report published on Sunday in the New Yorker magazine, while the media company has reached an exit agreement with him.
Moonves' resignation, following similar claims made by six other women against him, could be announced as early as Monday morning, according to sources familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans had not been made public.
The newly disclosed incidents, which the women said occurred between the 1980s and early 2000s, were published in the New Yorker story and included claims of forced sex, Moonves exposing himself and use of physical violence and intimidation. All six of the women were named in the article.
The New Yorker reported that these women said Moonves also retaliated after they rebuffed him, damaging their careers.
CBS has negotiated an estimated $100 million settlement with Moonves, sources told Reuters.
""I definitely think he should resign, and I don't think he should get $100 million to resign,"" said Linda Silverthorn, who accused Moonves of unwanted sexual advances in the New Yorker article.
Silverthorn told Reuters the New Yorker's account was accurate.
Reached by telephone, another one of the women, Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb, referred questions to lawyer Gloria Allred.
Allred told Reuters she is representing two clients in the matter who are willing to cooperate with an ongoing independent investigation, ""and I do think it is important that the board receive a report.""
Efforts to reach the other women were unsuccessful.
Moonves, 68, joined CBS in 1995 and became CEO in 2006. He could not immediately be reached to comment on Sunday after the latest claims.
In a statement to the magazine, Moonves acknowledged three of the encounters, but said they were consensual.
""The appalling accusations in this article are untrue,"" Moonves told the New Yorker. ""What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career.""
CBS said on Sunday it takes such allegations very seriously.
""The CBS Board of Directors is committed to a thorough and independent investigation of the allegations, and that investigation is actively underway,"" the media company's board said in a statement.
The company also reached a deal to settle litigation over the control of the company with National Amusements in a deal expected to be announced as early as before the markets open on Monday, the sources told Reuters. A representative of CBS controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements declined to comment. 
CBS will donate a portion of the $100 million settlement to an unnamed charity and the company reserves the right to claw back all of the remaining payment pending the results of the investigation into allegations of sexual assault and harassment, the sources said.
In August, CBS hired two law firms to investigate allegations of sexual assault and unwanted advances following a New Yorker report that featured claims against Moonves from six women spanning different periods over two decades, from 1985 to 2006.
Following the New Yorker report in August, Moonves said he regretted ""immensely"" making some women uncomfortable by making advances, but added that he abided by the principle that ""no means no"" and stated he had never misused his position to harm or hinder anyone's career.
The author of the New Yorker articles, Ronan Farrow, previously has written reports that contributed to the resignation of Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein from his film and TV studio following accusations of sexual misconduct.
Weinstein has denied the accusations. His downfall helped spawn the #MeToo movement that has forced the resignation of powerful men in Hollywood, corporate America and politics.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CBS Corp (N:CBS) has reached a deal to settle litigation over the control of the company with its controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc in a deal expected to be announced as early as before the markets open on Monday, sources familiar with the discussions said.
CBS is also expected to announce on Monday Chief Executive Leslie Moonves is resigning, said the sources on Sunday, asking not to be identified because the plans have not been made public.

The investigation, which is conducted by two outside law firms, continues.
The settlement comes on the heels of a second report from the New Yorker published on Sunday in which six additional women have raised assault and harassment claims against Moonves. An earlier New Yorker report revealed six women who alleged similar behavior by Moonves between the 1980s and early 2000s.

In a statement to the magazine, Moonves acknowledged three of the encounters, but said they were consensual.

The company told trade officials in a letter on Friday that the proposed tariffs would affect prices for a ""wide range"" of Apple products, including its Watch, but it did not mention the iPhone.
Trump, speaking on Friday aboard Air Force One, said the administration had tariffs planned for an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese goods.
Trump tweeted that ""Apple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China - but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax, and indeed a tax incentive. Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now.""
Apple declined to comment.
The technology sector is among the biggest potential losers as tariffs would make imported computer parts more expensive. Apple's AirPods headphones, some of its Beats headphones and its new HomePod smart speaker would also face levies.

""The burden of the proposed tariffs will fall much more heavily on the United States than on China,"" Apple said in its letter.

VENICE, Italy (Reuters) - Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma"" won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, bringing Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) its first major festival victory to seal the online streaming company's reputation as a big name in arthouse movies.
""Roma"", named after the neighborhood in Mexico City where writer-director-cinematographer Cuaron grew up, is a Spanish-language drama that critics almost unanimously described as ""shimmering"" due to its luscious black-and-white cinematography.
At a festival where only one of the 21 films selected to compete for the Golden Lion was directed by a woman, ""Roma"" was one of several that focused almost exclusively on female characters, in this case Cuaron's mother and the two maids who helped bring him up.
Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy called it ""an immersive bath in some of the most luxuriantly beautiful black-and-white images you’ve ever seen"" and a huge change from the Sandra Bullock adventure ""Gravity"" which won Cuaron his Oscar in 2014.
""Roma may not be the memoir film many might have expected from such an adventurous, sometimes raunchy, sci-fi/fantasy-oriented filmmaker, but it’s absolutely fresh, confident, surprising and rapturously beautiful.""
The win is important for Netflix as it seeks to position itself as a major force in film, after it boycotted the Cannes festival in May due to French rules that ban simultaneous streaming of films shown in cinemas.
Another one of its movies, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"", a comedy-western written and directed by the Coen brothers, won best screenplay.
""The Favourite"", which, like ""Roma"", has a strong female focus, won the runner-up Grand Jury Prize, and its star, Olivia Colman, received the Volpi Cup for best actress for her uproarious portrayal of England's Queen Anne.
Willem Dafoe won the award for best actor for his portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh in the biopic ""At Eternity's Gate"".
Jennifer Kent, the only female director in the main competition, won the Special Jury Prize for ""The Nightingale"" a revenge thriller set in 1825 in Australia whose male lead Baykali Ganambarr won for best up-and-coming actor/actress.

Dedicating the award to the indigenous people of Tasmania, whose brutal treatment by the British is explicitly played out in the film, Kent said in her acceptance speech: ""The feminine force is the most powerful and healing force on the planet so I hope and I’m confident that next year, and the year after, and the year after, we’ll see more and more women inhabiting this space.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) billionaire co-founder Jack Ma will announce a succession plan on Monday to hand the reins of his sprawling empire to a new generation of leaders but will remain executive chairman for the time being.
Ma will announce the plan on his 54th birthday and the handover strategy will stretch over a significant period of time, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper reported citing a company spokesman.
Alibaba declined to comment but pointed toward the SCMP story when asked about Ma's plans.
Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in 1999, stepped down as chief executive in 2013. He currently serves as the company's international face at top political and business events. 
The New York Times reported on Friday that Ma would retire from the e-commerce company on Monday as the former English teacher seeks to focus on philanthropy in education.
China's third richest person with a net worth of $36.6 billion according to Forbes magazine, Ma was quoted by the New York Times as saying his retirement was not the end of an era, but the beginning of one.
While Ma's plan to gradually step back is a milestone, analysts and industry professionals said it was unlikely his involvement would change significantly. 
""I don't think it means that much, frankly. He stepped back from the CEO role about four or five years ago and very specifically made a comment about wanting the younger people to lead the company,"" said Kevin Carter, founder of The Emerging Markets Internet exchange-trade fund.
Ma oversees a number of charitable projects in education and environmental fields. He is a cult figure in China's internet industry and has attracted a big following among entrepreneurs and in pop culture. At events, he is often met with screaming fans. 
TRICKY TIME
Ma maintains a prominent international profile, frequently inviting global leaders to the company's Hangzhou headquarters. Last year, he met U.S. President Donald Trump, who described him as ""smart"" and ""open minded"".
Alibaba was founded by 18 people led by Ma. China's biggest e-commerce firm, it now has more than 66,000 full-time employees, the company's latest annual filing showed. 
The company had a market value of about $420 billion as of Friday. Ma also controls Ant Financial, which was valued at about $150 billion after a recent fundraising round. 
The succession plans come at a tricky time for Chinese tech firms. Authorities have increasingly sought to regulate the industry where Alibaba and main rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) are battling for consumers.
Trade tensions also present a new challenge for Chinese tech firms, especially those like Alibaba which are rapidly expanding overseas. 
This year, regulators shot down a $1.2 billion bid for money transfer service Moneygram International Inc (O:MG) by Ant Financial on national security grounds, which the company said was related to ""geopolitical"" changes.
Ma's decision also comes as U.S. police investigate an allegation of rape against Richard Liu, head of e-commerce rival JD.com Inc (O:JD), which has hammered its shares.
Liu was arrested and released without charge in the U.S. city of Minneapolis last week. Through his lawyers, he has denied any wrongdoing.

Liu is chairman and chief executive at JD.com, and the incident spooked investors as the company has no clear succession plan.

A sub-committee of experts of Germany's National Diesel Forum will back so-called selective catalytic reduction hardware refits to cut nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the newspaper said in an excerpt of an article to be published on Sunday, made available to Reuters on Saturday.
There is, however, no consensus on who will foot the bill for the retrofits, which can cost 3,000 euros or more per car, the paper said.
It cited a government spokeswoman as reaffirming a plan for Chancellor Angela Merkel to decide on measures to cut NOx emissions this month. 
A court ruled last week that Frankfurt, Germany's financial center, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city center from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality.
The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked older diesel models from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Porsche (DE:VOWG_p), are also considering bans.

The debate over air quality has been stoked by reports of persistently high NOx emissions in Germany's largest cities and by Volkswagen's admission in 2015 to have rigged diesel emissions tests in the U.S. with the help of engine control devices.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Friday that it had banned from its App Store the Infowars app belonging to popular U.S. conspiracy theorist Alex Jones after finding that it had violated the company's rules against ""objectionable content"".
The move makes Apple the latest tech company or social media platform to take action against Jones, a deeply controversial right-wing radio talk-show host who has suggested that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, among other sensational claims.
Apple said the guidelines Jones violated bar ""defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or place a targeted individual or group in harm's way.""
Representatives for Jones could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters on Friday evening. 
On Thursday,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) permanently banned Jones and his website from its platform and Periscope, saying in a tweet that the accounts had violated its behavior policies. 
In a video posted on the Infowars website on Thursday, Jones said in response: ""I was taken down not because we lied but because we tell the truth and because we were popular."" 
Last month, Twitter banned Jones and Infowars for seven days, citing tweets that it said violated the company's rules against abusive behavior, which state that a user may not engage in targeted harassment of someone or incite other people to do so. 
Apple said at the time that the Infowars app remained in its store because it had not been found to be in violation of any content policies, although it had removed access to some podcasts by Jones. 
The podcasts differ from the Infowars app by allowing access to an extensive list of previous episodes, subjecting all of those past episodes to Apple's content rules.
The Infowars app contains only rebroadcasts of the current day's episodes, subjecting a much smaller set of content to the rules. Apple said it regularly monitors all apps for content violations. 
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Spotify Technology SA have also removed content produced by Jones.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 09:42PM ET</span>",Australia's drought could produce a corker vintage,"By Tom Westbrook and Jonathan Barrett
GRIFFITH/BAROSSA, Australia (Reuters) - If Australia's big dry has a silver lining, it'll be worth cellaring, according to vintners, who are scrambling to irrigate vines while preparing for a smaller but sweeter vintage.
Spring, when vine buds burst into fruit and flower, has come with much of Australia's east gripped by a drought that has turned usually fertile pastures barren.
Winemakers say the next few weeks could make or break the A$6.2 billion ($4.4 billion) industry's season, with soils across three quarters of the continent's east classified by the weather bureau as dry or very dry.
If vines stay thirsty, yields will suffer. But the grapes that survive should hold a stronger flavor, more sugar, and might fetch a higher price for their superior quality, industry participants say.
""No rain means the berries are much smaller ... if the grapes or berries are smaller, their intensity is much higher, so they're much richer,"" said Vince Salpietro, managing director of high-end Australian cellar and wine merchant Grand Cru.
""But there is a point where if there is no rain at all, the vine really, really struggles along and the vines will effectively shut down and not produce anything.""
While drought years can produce small but great vintages, grape growers and winemakers say it is difficult to lift bottle prices accordingly, and with hardly any rainfall since last summer they are desperate to dampen the soil. 
In South Australia's premier red wine region, Barossa grape grower Greg Knight said he needs good rainfalls soon, or the vines won't shoot evenly.
""We are totally reliant on weather and climate here - we have some supplementary water available via the dams but it's only minimal,"" he told Reuters, while taking a short break from hand-pruning the vines.
Grape growers will be looking to extract a higher price from winemakers for their sweeter grapes to offset a reduced yield.
According to Rabobank wine analyst Hayden Higgins, while it is too early to predict market movements with much accuracy, a volume shortfall could prove tricky for both sides of the deal. 
""The ability to negotiate price is probably limited from a grower's perspective,"" he said, referring to the fixed-contracts many are locked into.
If yields are significantly depleted, spot prices for leftover crops could jump, cutting into winemaker margins, Higgins said.
Australia's largest wine exporter,  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE) told Reuters it was too early in the season to forecast the impact. No. 3 winemaker  Pernod Ricard  SA (PA:PERP) said it does not expect the drought to effect grape supply ""at this stage"".
SCRAMBLE TO IRRIGATE
Not all Australian vineyards are suffering the effects of the extended winter drought. 
Australia's west coast wine country has been spared the dry weather, and irrigated vineyards in the east also have a cushion against the kind of steep production shortfalls seen last season in South Africa and Europe. 
Australian growers are also not subject to the strict controls on irrigation which apply to some of Europe's oldest wine regions as a check on supply.
But even irrigated vineyards can't fully compensate for mother nature, especially in the drought-savaged Hunter region of New South Wales.
Hunter Valley winemakers speak reverently of drought-year vintages in 1991, 2006 and 2007 but Col Peterson said he has never turned the taps on so early in 45 years growing grapes in the region. 
Peterson plans to use his entire water allocation on the land over the four months from August.
""This time of year it is critical that we water the grapes,"" he told Reuters, though adding he already expects yields will drop.
""I expect significant price rises, especially for reds this year. In a good season you make a bit more; a bad season, yes it costs you a bit more but you've got to balance it out."" 
Further inland at Griffith, where duststorms are raking over dry fields, growers and winemakers are hoping the worst drought in living memory produces a once-in-a-lifetime vintage.
""In general, you would expect your yields to be lower,"" said Lorraine Brewer, owner of vineyard and winery Yarran Wines.
""In saying that, you often get fantastic quality wine in drought times ... so if you're starting a cellar and we have a dry (harvest) this would be a really good year to put some stuff aside.""

333,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 07:58PM ET</span>",Apple says U.S. tariffs on China would hit 'wide range' of products,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - A ""wide range"" of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) products including the Apple Watch would be affected by proposed U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, the company told U.S. trade officials, but gave no sign of an impact on its iPhone cash cow.
Apple did not disclose specific revenues for most of the affected products, but of those the Apple Watch may be the biggest seller. It brought in about $6.1 billion in revenue last year, according to an estimate from analyst firm Bernstein. That represents a small portion of Apple's $229 billion in overall sales.
Apple laid out the impact on its products of the Trump administration's proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in an unsigned letter it submitted on Wednesday to U.S. officials as part of a public comment period.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One, said that he has tariffs on an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods ""ready to go on short notice if I want."" 
Cell phones, the biggest U.S. import from China, have so far been spared, but would be hit if Trump activates the new $267 billion tariff list.
AirPods headphones, some of Apple's Beats headphones and its new HomePod smart speaker also face levies as part of the proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to the letter submitted on Wednesday.
""Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,"" Apple said in the letter.
Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
The letter did not mention the iPhone, which accounted for about two-thirds of Apple's $229 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. The letter also made no mention of the iPad, which brought in $19.2 billion in sales in the most recent year, or most of its Mac computers, which generated $25.8 billion. 
Apple did say its MacMini, a low-priced computer that comes without a keyboard or mouse, would be affected.
Many Apple accessories, such as mice, keyboards, chargers and even leather covers for iPhones and iPads would face tariffs, Apple said.
Reuters reported in July that the Apple Watch was likely to be affected by the tariffs.
Shares of Apple closed down 0.8 percent in regular Nasdaq trade on Friday, and slipped another 1 percent in extended trading.
Apple also said that computer parts for its U.S. operations would be hit by the tariffs. The company said that ""main logic boards with microprocessing units"" could face levies, along with equipment used for research and development.
On Apple's most recent earnings call in July, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company could face such tariffs ""related to data centers.""
In its letter, Apple argued that the way U.S. trade officials calculate the U.S. trade balance - attributing the entire value of a product to a country like China where final assembly happens - fails to reflect the true value that Apple generates in the United States. The company noted it spent $50 billion with 9,000 U.S. suppliers in its most recent fiscal year, including Texas-based chip firm Finisar Corp and Kentucky-based Corning Inc.
""Given the balance of Apple’s economic footprint, the burden of the proposed tariffs will fall much more heavily on the United States than on China,"" Apple said in its letter.

The technology sector is one of the biggest potential losers in the proposed $200 billion tariff list. Fitness tracker maker Fitbit (N:FIT) said it would be hit by tariffs, and chipmaker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) said the levies could slow down the adoption of 5G networks, the next generation of wireless data technology for phones and other devices.

340,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 05:05PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Wage Inflation Worries Dent Stocks
The start to a new month brings with it a deluge of data, including the all-important employment report, which (unsurprisingly) proved to be the big economic event of the week.
The U.S. employment report for August augured strong economic growth. But markets were spooked by an acceleration in wage inflation, which boosted expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike rates twice more this year.
Beyond the creation of 201,000 jobs in August and a jobless rate holding near 18-year lows, the focus was on the 2.9% increase in wage inflation, its fastest since April 2009.
Although a quarter-point rate hike was already fully priced in for the Sept. 25-26 Fed meeting, odds for an additional increase in December rose to about 76% compared to 70% ahead of the report, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor tool.
2. Tesla Shares Jarred by Executive Departures (and Pot)
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continued to give investors fits. Before the bell Friday, the electric car maker announced in a regulatory filing that its chief accountant would be leaving after one month on the job. Shortly after that, its head of HR told Bloomberg she would not be returning from a leave of absence.
This news came after social media was abuzz with video of Musk smoking marijuana (legal in California) and drinking whiskey on a podcast.
“Since I joined Tesla on August 6th, the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,"" Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton said in statement. ""As a result, this caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission, and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”
3. Market Still Has to Wait on Trade
It was a wait-and-see week for Wall Street on the trade front. The market waited, but never quite saw.
On Friday, President Donald Trump signaled a willingness to slap additional tariffs on goods from China ""very soon."" Investors had been expecting Trump to pull the trigger this week based on published reports.
“The $200 billion we are talking about could take place very soon depending on what happens with them. To a certain extent it’s going to be up to China,” Trump said, according to Reuters. ""And I hate to say this, but behind that is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That changes the equation.”
Earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump won’t make a decision until officials evaluate public comments on the tariffs.
There were also no new developments as Canada negotiated with the U.S. about a revamp of NAFTA.
4. Nike Shares End Week Lower After Boycott Calls
Shares of  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) were active this week as the company was subject to calls for a boycott.
Over the long weekend, the company unveiled former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick as on of the faces of its “Just Do It” ad campaign. Kaepernick is the most-well-known athlete who protested racism by kneeling during the national anthem before games.
The president has been very vocal in his displeasure about athletes kneeling during the anthem, calling for them to be fired or suspended.
Shares of Nike sold off sharply to start the week. But they recovered some of those losses by the end.
Nike ended the week about 2.3% down from last Friday’s close.
5. Social Media Washington Spotlight Spurs Selling
Social media stocks were hit this week as executives facing questions on Capitol Hill gave investors an excuse to take some profits.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg testified before Congress on election interference and moderating content, including charges of censorship.
Both Sandberg and Dorsey defended their efforts in preventing abuse of their platforms and conceded that they have since stepped up efforts to stop online election meddling following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Still, lawmakers appear to be leaning toward the need for further regulatory scrutiny on tech companies. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general later this month to express concerns that tech companies may be hurting competition and limiting free exchange of ideas on their platforms.
Facebook, Twitter and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which chose not to send a representative to the hearings, ended lower for the week."

343,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Proxy adviser ISS backs call for safety report at Smith & Wesson parent,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended that investors vote in favor of a shareholder proposal at American Outdoor Brands Corp, parent of gun maker Smith & Wesson, calling for a report on the safety of the company's products.
In a report e-mailed by an ISS spokesman, the leading proxy adviser also recommended that investors support all 10 director nominees at American Outdoor's online-only shareholder meeting on Sept. 25.
The proposal was submitted by religious investors. The debate in the United States over gun safety and gun control grew in intensity following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February.
ISS wrote the proposal was worth backing as a way to show the board it is looking at long-term risks, and noted the proponents ask the company to report on its efforts to produce safer guns.
""There is reason to believe that smart gun technology could be employed to make guns safer in the U.S. and that any engineering problems could be overcome if there was a market for the product,"" ISS wrote in its conclusion. 
Springfield, Massachusetts-based American Outdoor has said the report is unnecessary and that it already discloses its reputational and financial risks.
Elizabeth Sharp, American Outdoor vice president for investor relations, said in an email that the company was pleased with most of the proxy's recommendations.
Sharp said, however, the company is ""extremely disappointed in their decision to depart from our board’s recommendation on a stockholder proposal that would do nothing to make our communities safer, forwarded by a politically-driven proponent whose objective is not to create value for our stockholders, but to destroy value."" 
On Thursday, rival proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co also recommended investors back the safety report, and recommended investors vote against one American Outdoor director.

In May, a majority of investors backed a similar safety report proposal at competing gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Company Inc

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.31%. The S&P 500 fell 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.25%.
Gripped by fear the United States and China are heading further down the path toward a full-blown trade war, investors reined in their bets on riskier assets like stocks, pressuring the broader averages.
With the administration already expected to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China, Trump upped the ante on trade, threatening levies on another $267 billion of goods.
The levies on the list of goods could reportedly cover a wide range of products from popular tech companies, including Apple, according to Bloomberg. Apple later confirmed in a letter that the tariffs would affect the Apple Watch, AirPods and Apple Pencil.
""It is difficult to see how tariffs that hurt U.S. companies and U.S. consumers will advance the Government's objectives with respect to China's technology policies,"" Apple said in the letter.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell on the news, exerting further pressure on the beaten-up tech sector.
Positives on U.S.-Canada trade negotiations were few and far between amid signs of limited progress on an agreement to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), often cited as trade bellwethers given their large international exposure, struggled to sidestep concerns about a ramp in trade tensions as both closed lower.
Energy, meanwhile, did little to stem losses in the broader market after ending the day roughly unchanged, as oil prices were pressured by a rising dollar and concerns about oil-demand growth, amid rising trade tensions.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 2 cents to settle at $67.75 a barrel.
Economic data provided a little optimism for investors as the U.S. economy added 201,000 jobs in August, above forecasts for 191,000 new jobs. But average hourly earnings grew 0.4%, raising inflation fears. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.9%.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock dropped 6% after Chief Accounting Officer Dave Morton resigned as the ""the level of public attention placed on the company,"" prompted him to rethink his future.

Trump also said he was considering taking action against the Times, whose shares moved briefly lower after his comments were made public.
""We’re going to see. I’m looking at that right now,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ""should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe it's national security.""
The Times issued a statement saying it was confident the Justice Department ""would not participate in such a blatant abuse of government power.""
""The President's threats both underscore why we must safeguard the identity of the writer of this op-ed and serve as a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press to American democracy.""
Trump did not indicate what sort of action he was considering against the Times and it was unclear what legal grounds he could act on. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department does not confirm or deny investigations. The Times could not be immediately reached for comment. 
A number of top Trump advisers have disavowed the piece, which was published on Wednesday without a name in what the Times said was a rare but necessary move to protect the writer.
In the column, the writer slammed Trump's ""amorality"" and leadership style. The official said there were a number of U.S. officials who were part of an ""quiet resistance"" inside the administration who was ""working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.""
Trump regularly attacks the media for focusing on negative news about his administration and decries what he perceives as ""fakes news."" He repeated on Air Force One that he believes libel laws should be strengthened.
Trump had threatened to sue the Times when he was running for president in October 2016 because of its story about allegations of sexual assault against women. The Times stood by its story and dismissed a Trump attorney's demand for an apology and retraction. No suit was filed.

Earlier this week the Justice Department said is set a meeting with state attorneys general to discuss concerns social media platforms are stifling conservative voices.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Kraft Heinz sees rising costs, still weighing M&A deal: CEO","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co is feeling the pinch from trade conflicts and rising costs, but is still willing to consider an acquisition to fuel growth, its chief executive officer said on Friday.
CEO Bernardo Hees said in an interview that the maker of Heinz ketchup and Maxwell House coffee is ""being hurt"" by retaliation over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, which Canada responded to by slapping taxes on goods ranging from sauces to coffee. Kraft Heinz has described coffee as one of its key commodities in the United States and Canada.
Hees said the company and food industry was seeking exemptions from the tariffs on specific products.
Febreze and Gillette manufacturer Procter & Gamble Co told Reuters in July that some of its products sold in Canada would be affected by the tariffs as well.
Canada's top trade negotiator and her U.S. counterpart started a third day of talks to save the North American Free Trade Agreement on Friday as differences between the two sides appeared to have narrowed.
Yet the trade conflict is adding to the pressures on Hees and industry peers trying to fatten profits even as consumers change their eating habits and U.S. inflation perks up.
Kraft Heinz topped quarterly profit and revenue estimates when it reported results last month as it raised product prices and posted higher-than-expected U.S. sales for the first time in several quarters.
Hees nonetheless said cost pressures are creeping up from labor to transportation, oil and plastic packaging. He did not specify how much he expected costs to hit the company's earnings, saying that consumption and other economic trends are ""really on the right foot.""
""That's why for us to have an agreement on this - it would be very positive,"" Hees said of U.S.-Canada trade negotiations. ""In reality it takes the uncertainty out so we can invest for the long run.""
Many analysts believe Kraft Heinz, controlled by Brazil's 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, should include an acquisition among those investments.
Hees is a partner at 3G, which is known for engineering big mergers, such as the creation of Restaurant Brands International Inc by combining Burger King with Canada's Tim Hortons, and then imposing draconian cost cuts.
Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have fallen more than 40 percent. The S&P 500 rose 22 percent in the same period. Hees has said the stock market will take care of itself if the company delivers.
The company's potential acquisition targets are getting cheaper and, arguably, more vulnerable. The S&P 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index is down 9 percent this year.
One possible acquisition target, Campbell Soup Co, is fighting off a proxy fight by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC. Loeb is moving to remove Campbell's entire board just one week after Campbell unveiled a strategic review, deciding to sell two businesses.
While Kraft Heinz had considered a Campbell acquisition in the past, it was not currently exploring a bid, a source told Reuters in August.

""If there would be more consolidation for the industry, we'd like to be a force behind it,"" he said, noting that the company would be disciplined.

""We like strong brands, we like business that can travel, and we like businesses that have synergies, that can be reinvested behind brands, product and people. When we find a combination of that, we tend to move very fast.""

Pirelli, owned by Chinese state-owned firm ChemChina , said the sale to a consortium of South American entrepreneurs and the firm Sommers International would have no financial impact.
Pirelli's plant in the city of Valencia has been closed since early last week, when about 100 of its 700 employees protested outside after finding the gates locked. 
In a statement on Friday, Milan-based Pirelli said the disposal agreement called for ""employment continuity.""
""Pirelli wishes to thank its collaborators and clients for its 28 years of activity in the country and wishes the new management every success,"" the statement said.
Multinational companies including cleaning products firm  Clorox Co  (N:CLX) and cereal maker Kellogg Co (N:K) have been steadily leaving the country amid shrinking demand caused by a fifth year of recession and hyperinflation.
President Nicolas Maduro has said Venezuela is victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries with the help of Washington.

Pirelli, which supplies tires for Formula One, was acquired in 2015 by China National Chemical Corp, known as ChemChina.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes moved lower on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he had tariffs ready to impose on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports, though stocks pared losses late in the afternoon.
Trump's remarks came after the comment period regarding another round of tariffs, on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, ended on Thursday night. Earlier, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump would not make any decisions on those tariffs until officials evaluated public comments.
Additionally, Trump said the United States and Japan have begun trade discussions.
The S&P 500 and the Dow had opened lower as the U.S. Labor Department's employment report showed accelerating job growth and a surge in wage growth. Though the report indicated a strong economy, it raised concerns among investors regarding inflation and the Federal Reserve's plans for increasing interest rates.
After Trump's comments on tariffs, both indexes added to losses, while the Nasdaq, which had been boosted by a recovery in tech stocks, gave up its gains. The three indexes recovered some of their losses later in the session.
Several investors said the unsettled stance on trade contributed to U.S. stocks' meandering path on Friday.
""It's not that we have good policies or bad policies; it's that we don't know what the policy is,"" said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. ""It's very fickle.""
""It's kind of a tempest in a teapot, more than anything,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see us end the day flat.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.27 points, or 0.21 percent, to 25,940.6, the S&P 500 lost 2.25 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,875.8 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.01 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,919.72.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. Consumer discretionary, health care and financial stocks posted modest gains.
The S&P 500 technology index was trading flat after being shellacked in the last two sessions over concerns regarding the possibility of increased regulation of social media companies.
Shares of chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc rose 7.5 percent after a strong current-quarter revenue forecast.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares slid 6.4 percent following reports of two executives leaving the company and on mounting investor concerns about Chief Executive Elon Musk's behavior after he smoked marijuana on a live Web show.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 62 new lows.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Change Ahoy: Mondelez's new strategy weighs on earnings outlook,"By Richa Naidu
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) forecast smaller-than-expected earnings growth for 2019 as Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put unveiled a series of strategic changes, sending the Chips Ahoy-maker's shares down 2.8 percent on Friday 
Like other food makers, Mondelez has struggled to grow sales in recent years as consumers move away from packaged food in favor of healthy eating. Van de Put's review of the company, which owns the Oreo and Cadbury brands, has been highly anticipated since he took the top job in November.
Van de Put said Mondelez's transformation would focus on driving sales and include investing more in e-commerce, perking up existing brands, investing in sustainable ingredients and expanding its footprint in higher-growth parts of the world.
""The consumer packaged goods space has changed dramatically and will continue to change,"" Van de Put said at an investor meeting. ""To meet these needs, we are adjusting and changing our way of working.""
The company's shift to focusing more on sales growth than on cutting costs is important after several years of intense focus on margins, Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said.
However, investing in sales is expected to weigh on earnings next year.
""2019 will be more of a reinvestment year than previously expected,"" Weissman said.
Mondelez said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings to rise by 3 percent to 5 percent. Analysts on average had estimated 5 percent net income growth for the period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Mondelez forecast better-than-expected organic sales growth for 2019 of 2 to 3 percent. Weissman said this estimate topped expectations for rival food companies.
Van de Put's predecessor, long-time CEO Irene Rosenfeld, had for years been under pressure to boost earnings by shareholder activists Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management. Trian President Peter May has sat on Mondelez's board since February, when Peltz stepped down, saying he was happy with the company's progress.

Shares in Mondelez were down as much as 4 percent on Friday, set for their worst day in more than four months. The company also said it expected to buy back about $2 billion in stock this year.

360,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","As Tesla Shares Go Up in Smoke, Short Investors Go to the Bank","(Bloomberg) -- Not everyone looking at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s implosion this week is unhappy.
Investors with a bearish bet on the stock, aka the short sellers, whom Elon Musk wanted to “burn,” are reinvigorated after the electric vehicle maker’s latest public relations disaster, coupled with the rapid exits of two high-profile executives, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC.
Tesla shares have been on a roller-coaster ride this year, and its short sellers have been in the red for most of 2018, but “this week they’ve turned profitable,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, said, adding that the firm has seen renewed short activity in Tesla over the last week. More such selling emerged on Friday’s news and price move. Tesla’s short interest had reached a new high of $14 billion in mid-June and has since declined by more than a third in less than three months.
Activist short seller Andrew Left sued Tesla on Thursday, claiming Musk manipulated Tesla’s stock price to squeeze shorts and, in the process, hurt all buyers of the company’s shares by issuing false and misleading information. An analysis by S3 shows he has lost about $2 million in both realized and unrealized losses.
In the month since Musk’s now infamous “going private” tweet, Tesla has lost nearly one-third of its value, prompting even long-time bullish analysts to urge the board to consider major changes to its executive lineup and relieve the CEO of some of his “banal” day-to-day duties of running a public company.
An almost imperceptible ray of hope is that Tesla’s share price is fast approaching a technical support level that the stock has not breached since January 2017, though it might be of little consolation to long investors caught in an avalanche of terrible news.
What happens next, to both the share price and the hefty short bets in the stock, will depend on the actions taken by Tesla’s board and Musk. “Tesla short interest may decline to $5 billion or increase to $15 billion -- its board’s actions or inactions will be the driving force,” Dusaniwsky added.

The SEC said that from 2013 to 2018, a group of South Florida-based investors manipulated the share price of stocks in three unidentified companies, generating over $27 million from unlawful sales and leaving retail investors with ""virtually worthless stock.""

The SEC named Barry Honig and ""Miami biotech billionaire"" Phillip Frost among the individuals, saying Honig helped acquire large quantities of company stock and engaged in manipulative activity after taking ownership interests in the companies.

362,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Ex-PBOC's Zhou Sees Sentiment Risk From China-U.S. Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- China could be hit by a change in market sentiment in the event of an all-out trade war with the U.S. even if the direct impact on the economy isn’t that large, according to former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan.
Zhou, who retired just this year, said the U.S. tariffs on China -- when looked at in light of the size of the economy -- are “not very significant.” Nevertheless, the pass-through to confidence is a potential channel for disruption.
“People may become nervous,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Francine Lacqua. “Nobody really knows. Suddenly there is a trade war. They may change their mind in terms of stock market investment.”
“This kind of behavior is much bigger than the real impact” on the economy, he said in the interview at the Ambrosetti Forum in Cernobbio, Italy.
China is already grappling with a policy-induced economic slowdown that’s collided with uncertainties over the impact of a trade war. That’s prompted leaders to ease their campaign to curb debt as they seek insurance against the risk of a future economic downdraft.
‘Minsky Moment’
Zhou previously warned in October that China should defend against the risk of a “Minsky moment,” or a sudden collapse of asset values. The concept is named for Hyman Minsky, an economist who argued that long bull markets can lead to major collapses. China’s currency has weakened more than 6 percent since mid-June, the worst performer in Asia, while stocks have entered a bear market.
Zhou said on Friday that close vigilance is needed and China’s “number one” priority must be avoiding an asset bubble. “We should keep the currency floating with the market demand and supply relationship to avoid any kind of distortion,” he added.
Zhou said that globally, there needs to be stronger supervision of financial assets and he also highlighted the risks from global monetary authorities keeping policy loose for so long after the financial crisis.
“It should be a relatively short-term measure,” he said. “If it lasts too long, it’s also dangerous.”

380,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",Third Point launches proxy fight for full Campbell board,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC is launching a proxy fight to remove the entire sitting board at Campbell Soup Co, charging the American food company with being in a ""mess"" and faulting the board for failing to take corrective action.
Loeb's $18 billion hedge fund, which owns a 5.65 percent stake, is nominating 12 people, according to a letter sent to Campbell's board on Friday. The slate includes executives from the hedge fund, a descendant of the inventor of Campbell soup, and experts in marketing, operations, and transactions.
Loeb's move comes one week after Campbell unveiled a strategic review, deciding to sell two businesses.
Previously Third Point has said that under the current management team and board, the company should put its entire business up for sale. But its stance has shifted somewhat to suggest that other outcomes might be possible with a new board.
Investors had expected Loeb to ask for board seats, but pushing to throw out all sitting directors is a rare step in the industry and especially for Third Point, which usually asks for only a few board seats.
Third Point said it took the step because the board failed to ""understand the depth of the Company's crisis"" and failed to take ""bold action.""
Loeb said the board stood by as the company went on an acquisition spree and said $7 billion in value was destroyed since 2016. Campbell's stock price is now 20 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Loeb said, criticizing the board for failing to have a CEO succession plan in place. This year the stock price has lost 17 percent.
""At this point, it would be simply reckless to leave the Board that caused this mess in charge of fixing it,"" Loeb said.
Campbell said in a written statement in response to Loeb's move that the board determined the best way forward is ""to optimize the company's portfolio, divest certain businesses and pay down debt."" It also said it was open to evaluating all strategic options in the future.
FAMILY SOUP
As Third Point seeks to remake the board, it has allied itself with George Strawbridge, a grandchild of chemist John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago. Strawbridge previously sat on the Campbell's board and may now be called on to convince the family, which jointly owns roughly 41 percent of the shares, that updating is needed at the company.
The Third Point slate also includes William Toler, former chief executive of Hostess Brands, and Munib Islam, a partner at Third Point. And it includes three women: lawyer Franci Blassberg, marketing executive Sarah Hofstetter and Bozoma Saint John, who had been chief brand officer at Uber.
However, Loeb could face an uphill struggle for control of Campbell Soup, given the large stake owned by Dorrance descendants and the fact two grandchildren and a great grandchild currently sit on the board.
Third Point last ran a proxy contest four years ago and reached a settlement for three seats on the board of auction house Sotheby's.
Unseating an entire board is rare but it was accomplished when hedge fund Starboard Value replaced all directors at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in 2014.

Third Point has hired Okapi Partners as its proxy solicitor, which also worked for Starboard on Darden.

381,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Stocks - Tesla Still Slumping Midday; Utilities, Real Estate Fall","Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remained one of the biggest-losing stocks in midday trading after a brace of executive departures and more troubling behavior from CEO Elon Musk.
Meanwhile, interest-rate sensitive sectors struggled the most after today’s employment report revealed stronger inflation pressure on wages than expected.
Tesla lost about 5% at 11:55 AM ET (15:55 GMT).
Before the bell, the electric car maker announced in a regulatory filing that its chief accountant would be leaving after one month on the job. Shortly after that, its head of HR told Bloomberg she would not be returning from a leave of absence.
This news came after social media was abuzz with video of Musk smoking marijuana (legal in California) and drinking whiskey on a podcast.
Meanwhile, real estate and utilities stocks struggled after the jobs numbers supported the theory that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates twice before the year is out. Average hourly earnings rose more than expected in August, which will exacerbate Fed worries about the rate of inflation.
The S&P Real Estate Sector index fell about 1%. Real estate stocks tend to struggle when it looks like mortgage rates will climb.
Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) was the weakest component, falling about 2.5%.
The S&P Utility Sector index lost about 0.8%. Utility stocks traditionally pay high dividends and sell off when their yields erode in a rising rate environment.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Starbucks pulls in crowds at first Italian cafe,"MILAN (Reuters) - Around two hundred people queued outside the first Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) cafe in Italy on Friday, as the world's biggest coffee chain faces one of its toughest tests yet with an upmarket roastery in the center of Milan.
Coffee-obsessed Italy has more than 57,000 cafes and Starbucks, at its lavish roastery decorated with brass and marble, is charging almost twice what Italians are used to paying for their daily espresso drunk standing at a bar. 
Yet people who stood in line in the central Cordusio square seemed undeterred by the prices which have drawn complaints from an Italian consumer association. 
The opening enticed curious Italians and tourists alike.
""I hope the coffee here tastes better than it does in America,"" said Milan resident Sonia Vesti.
The cafe features a green industrial-scale roaster and serves coffee made only with premium-quality Arabica beans, while most Italian cafes use a cheaper blend.
Cocktails, pastry and ice creams are also on sale at the store that marks the realization of a lifetime dream for Howard Schultz, the man who turned Starbucks into the world's biggest coffee chain.
Schultz has said he was inspired to develop Starbucks, which now spans almost 29,000 stores worldwide, during a 1983 visit to Italy where he was struck by the rapport between baristas and their clients.
The Milan shop is Starbucks' first roastery in Europe. There are two others, in Seattle and Shanghai. 
The coffee market is one of the few fast-growing areas of the drinks market and global food groups like Nestle are signing deals to get a share of the action.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) agreed to buy Costa, the world's second-biggest coffee chain, last week, while Nestle bought from Starbucks the exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain's packaged coffees and teas around the world.
Starbucks' arrival in Italy could shake up the local cafe industry, analysts said.
""Our research shows younger Italians, 16-34 year olds, are much more open to American coffee-style concepts such as flavored Frappuccino's, cold brew and more lightly roasted coffee,"" said Jonny Forsyth, global drinks analyst at market research group Mintel.

Starbucks plans to open four traditional cafeterias in Milan with local partner Antonio Percassi by the end of this year, the group's Global President of Retail, John Culver, told Reuters.

Schottenfeld disclosed a stake of 6.9 percent late on Thursday. His stake stood at 5.7 percent, according to a regulatory filing in July.
Schottenfeld said he expects to continue his talks with company's founder-chairman, Leonard Riggio, and its management over filling top leadership positions with executives who could reverse years of falling sales and consider all opportunities for a possible sale.
The company fired Chief Executive Officer Demos Parneros in July over allegations of sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior and said it would begin the process to find a replacement only after its annual shareholder meeting in early October.
Parneros sued the company in August and also accused Riggio of engineering his firing after turning on him when an unnamed company withdrew a takeover bid for the New York-based company in early June.

Barnes & Noble did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Things Keep Happening at Tesla,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Funding, Lawsuit, Accounting, Podcast, Etc. Watch 2018.
Huh, you don’t see this every day:
Citron Research founder Andrew Left, an activist short seller known among other things for calling beleaguered drug company Valeant a “pharmaceutical Enron,” is suing Tesla Inc. and Chairman Elon Musk for inflating the company’s stock price.
In his lawsuit, Left seeks to represent a class of investors who traded Tesla shares from Aug. 7 to Aug. 17. The suit cites Musk’s “long-standing public feud with short sellers,” claiming he manipulated the price of Tesla securities to hurt such investors -- and in so doing damaged all buyers of the company’s shares by issuing false and misleading information.
To be clear, the reason you don’t see it that often is that generally short sellers are happy when companies fraudulently manipulate their stock. Short sellers love it when they find a company that is a market darling but secretly just a bunch of cobwebs: Then the short sellers can sell the stock at a high price (because the market is fooled), wait until the market notices that there’s nothing there (and perhaps help that process along by publishing negative research), and then buy the stock back at a low price when the market collapses. When Elon Musk tweeted on Aug. 7 that he was thinking about taking his company private at $420 per share, and the stock shot up from $340ish to $380ish, that was a great short selling opportunity, if you correctly concluded that he wasn’t actually going to do it. (There were signs!) The stock closed yesterday at $280.95. If you did that trade, you did great and have no reason to sue Musk.
Left’s problem is that he bought Tesla shares after Musk’s tweet. “In response to the tweets,” says his complaint, “many Tesla short-sellers were forced to cover their positions at artificially high prices, losing approximately $1.3 billion in a single day.” (An exhibit to the complaint makes clear that he was trading very actively in the hours and days after Musk’s announcement, alternately shorting and covering.) I don’t know how universal that experience is—probably plenty of short sellers just kept their positions on, and others gleefully jumped in to short Musk’s announcement—but Left argues that it was Musk’s goal:
Defendant Musk has a long-standing public feud with short-sellers and has threatened them in the recent past. For example, on May 4, 2018, he tweeted that the “short burn of the century [was] comin[g] soon” and that the “sheer magnitude of the short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit[.]” He then tweeted on June 17, 2018 that Tesla short-sellers had “about three weeks before their short position explodes.” As described herein, Defendants’ statements were an ill-conceived attempt to artificially manipulate the price of Tesla securities in order to “burn” and “squeeze out” the Company’s short-sellers.
Left’s class-action complaint isn’t limited to short sellers—it’s on behalf of anyone who bought or sold Tesla securities between Aug. 7 and Aug. 17—but it probably does help that he can point to Musk’s obvious personal animus against people like him. If you’re accusing someone of securities fraud, it helps to have a reason that they might want to defraud the market; often the reason is “because they were selling stock into the fraudulent demand,” but here Musk and Tesla weren’t selling stock. Musk’s extremely public and intensely self-documented desire to burn short sellers, though, is a pretty plausible explanation for why he might announce a going-private transaction without actually intending to do it.
Also I have to say there is something tidy and logical about a short seller suing a company for securities fraud. Usually the plaintiffs in these cases are stock owners, and there is an obvious inefficiency when shareholders sue their own company: If they win, then the company will give them money, but it was their money in the first place. It’s just a transfer of money from shareholders to shareholders, with lawyers taking a cut. Meanwhile short sellers really want to cost the company money; if they win their lawsuit, then it is just a pure win for them.
Elsewhere, Tesla’s chief accounting officer is quitting after a month on the job, which is fine, it’s fine, don’t worry about it, it’s totally normal and fine:
Dave stated: “Since I joined Tesla on August 6th, the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations. As a result, this caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission, and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”
I mean to be fair he started the day before Musk tweeted about going private, which really did increase the public attention focused on Tesla in a way he couldn’t have predicted. On the other hand it also increased the public—and regulatory—attention focused on Tesla’s numbers, which the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into even before it was forced to look into Musk’s going-private tweets. You hate to see your chief accounting officer quit because he is stressed out by people paying so much attention to your accounting. That’s exactly when you need a chief accounting officer!
Also Tesla’s head of human resources quit this morning.
We talked the other day about two theories of Tesla’s problems: One is that the culture of 24/7 workdays and reckless decision-making causes trouble, while the other is that Tesla is beset by saboteurs who are secretly working for short sellers. Which one is this? It sure looks like the first one: The CAO is burned out by “the pace within the company” and the attention brought down by Musk’s impulsive tweeting. But if he pops up next week working for a Tesla short seller, and using his knowledge of Tesla’s books to bet against it, then … one, that will be amazing, but two, I will have to concede that Musk has a point.
In more Tesla news, I was on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to talk about Musk’s dalliance with going private. And: “Elon Musk sipped whiskey and smoked marijuana during a 2 1/2-hour podcast with California comedian Joe Rogan that touched upon everything from flame throwers and artificial intelligence to the end of the universe,” and I have to say that for a man who complains constantly about working 120-hour weeks, sleeping at the office and never seeing his family, he sure seems to waste a lot of time on the internet. Of course I find that extremely relatable.
Lending for IPOs.
We have talked many times before about how investment banking is a Maussian gift economy in which banks bestow lavish gratuitous gifts on companies with the expectation that one day the companies will do the same for them. The basic rationale for this system is probably that it is hard to evaluate investment banking services—it is all advice and introductions and negotiation and judgment—so giving potential clients a free sample is a good way to convince them that you know what you’re doing. But from the banks’ perspective there are some other big advantages. It is probably more lucrative than just, like, charging people for services: The pricing is less transparent, people are more willing to pay you a lot if they are bound to you by gratitude and friendship, and these relationships of loyalty and trust probably do reduce grubby price competition.
More than that, though, it is nice for the bankers. They are not just tradesmen doing a service and collecting a check; they are trusted advisers and essential partners and respected peers and beloved friends to their corporate-executive clients. Their relationships are deep and rich, and when they work through the night advising a client they are not just giving up time with their families for money: They are being good people, good advisers, good friends; they are deepening the connections to important people in their lives; they are doing the right thing for a client who needs them. There is a nobility, a sense of purpose, in building and sustaining relationships that you don’t get from just doing some work for a check.
Anyway obviously you gotta lend to clients to get roles in their initial public offerings, but this feels a little grubby and sad:
SoftBank Group Corp. has told potential underwriters seeking a large role in the blockbuster IPO of its Japanese wireless unit that they should offer to lend to other parts of the parent company’s empire, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. 
One option being discussed is banks lending a combined $8 billion, said two of the people, with SoftBank’s stake in British computer-chip designer ARM Holdings (LON:ARM) Plc being used as collateral, one of them said. Loans against stakes in other companies have also been considered as the group dangles the carrot of participating in the IPO of SoftBank Mobile, the people said. Firms offering financing are seen as much likelier to get a spot on the IPO, they said.
So much of life is about the fine but important distinction between a “relationship” and a “quid pro quo.” Not—to be clear—that there’s anything wrong with the quid pro quo here. Giving money to SoftBank executives in exchange for a role in the IPO would obviously be bad, but lending money to SoftBank to win banking business with SoftBank is utterly normal and expected. It’s just socially nicer if it’s a little more subtle and indirect, if it’s more like “we will be a good partner to you because we want a long-term mutually beneficial relationship” and less like “the price tag for an IPO mandate is $2 billion of loans.” 
Crisis anniversary.
Next weekend marks 10 years since the day that Lehman Brothers Inc. filed for bankruptcy. I suppose you could argue for other dates being the pivotal moment of the global financial crisis, but I think most people sensibly take Lehman Day as the anniversary of the crisis. Certainly I have a vivid memory of where I was on Sept. 15, 2008 (on vacation, in Napa, very confused about why no one around me was freaking out), which is not true of, say, Bear Stearns Hedge Funds Day. So expect a lot of crisis commemoration in the next week or two.
Here’s one from the Wall Street Journal about some people who definitely remember where they were on Sept. 15, 2008: at Lehman Brothers, starting their first day of work. Oops! “During training, everyone was learning to do things like model Excel while we watched the stock price drop,” says one. (The official start date was Sept. 15 but the training was before that; after training, there was no stock to drop.) But not really that oops:
I was preparing for a licensing exam in my apartment on Sunday, Sept. 14, and there was a new news story every minute. I refreshed my computer browser and all a sudden there was a headline that Lehman declares bankruptcy. I got that feeling in the pit of my stomach. The next day we all went in to work, but everyone was a zombie.
I kept working there, but this cloud was hanging over us. I worked in the fund of hedge funds group for two and a half years, but then got super jaded. I went to Peru and worked for a nonprofit for almost a year.
I mean he stayed there for two and a half years and left, not because he was working for a bank that had imploded and couldn’t pay him anymore, but because he got “super jaded.” Another one “was fortunate that my position was maintained at Neuberger Berman [an investment-management firm then owned by Lehman], and I spent eight years there”—and now works for Dick Fuld at his new firm. It is all a bit eerie to read. Of course Lehman’s bankruptcy led, fairly rapidly, to many job losses in the financial industry, and particularly—of course—at Lehman. But there is a lot of populist anger to the effect that investment bankers brought down the global economy and escaped relatively unscathed, and that anger will not be much assuaged by learning that these young bankers—who, to be fair, had nothing to do with bringing down the economy!—kept their jobs for years after Lehman’s bankruptcy and left only when they felt super jaded.
Elsewhere in crisis commemoration, here are “The Regrets of Lewis Ranieri,” who invented private mortgage-backed bonds. And today is actually Fannie/Freddie Day, another key crisis anniversary; Congress marked it by announcing yet another proposal to end the current state of affairs in which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are essentially government-owned mortgage guarantors:
House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling unveiled a proposal Thursday that would effectively shutter Fannie and Freddie. Their roles would be replaced by enabling private companies and Ginnie Mae to backstop the trillions of dollars of mortgage-securities that underpin the U.S. housing market. Ginnie is a government corporation that guarantees mortgage bonds.
“The legislation has slim chances of advancing during an election year.”
Everything is wire fraud.
It’s not that long ago that Congress passed a law saying that “spoofing”—entering orders in markets with the intent to cancel them before they execute—is a crime. And the government has prosecuted people for spoofing. And sometimes it has won and they have gone to prison, and other times it has lost and they have gone free. These odds are apparently not good enough for prosecutors, though, so they’ve fallen back on the old reliable:
Late July the Justice Department took a new tack. Rather than use the spoofing law, prosecutors charged two former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) traders, James Vorley and Cedric Chanu, with wire fraud. The government claims the pair placed and quickly canceled orders for precious metals futures contracts to create the impression that there was greater supply or demand.
I sometimes think that if I were made king I would write specific laws covering specific types of white-collar crime. There’d be a spoofing law setting out penalties for spoofing, and an insider-trading law setting out penalties for insider trading, and a public-company-accounting-fraud law setting out penalties for accounting misrepresentations, and a Ponzi law setting out penalties for Ponzis, and so forth. The penalties would be based on how harmful the crimes are, how bad the criminals’ intent is, how hard they are to catch, and sure yes also on how big the dollar amounts involved are. There’d probably be a residual “other bad fraud” statute, because people will always dream up new frauds that aren’t directly covered by other laws, but I’d try to encourage prosecutors to prosecute people for the specific thing they did rather than for the catch-all “dishonesty using a computer.” Anyway I look forward to someone murdering someone and then saying over the phone “no I didn’t murder that guy,” and being prosecuted for wire fraud.
Until then there’s this!
Federal prosecutors are investigating whether former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein violated wire fraud or other laws in any efforts to silence women who accused him of sexual misconduct, say people familiar with the matter, an indication he could still face federal charges after his arrest in May on state charges.
I like to say that everything is securities fraud, and sexual misconduct is clearly securities fraud, but that’s mostly if you do it at a public company. But even the things that aren’t securities fraud are wire fraud, and it looks like private-company sexual misconduct is also somehow wire fraud. 
People are worried about bond market liquidity.
“ETFs edged out credit-default swaps -- at the single-name and index level -- and were second only to corporate bonds themselves as a way for professionals to access fixed income,” it says here, and of course those professionals are worried about liquidity:
“Credit market participants have been forced to make a trade-off between liquidity and specificity, and they’re choosing liquidity,” according to Ken Monahan, senior analyst on the market structure and technology team at Greenwich and author of the report.
It’s the theme du jour. Angst over “vanishing” liquidity was the chief concern expressed by credit buyers in Europe in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).’s client survey last month.

389,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 07:33AM ET</span>",VW faces about $10.7 billion investor suit over dieselgate scandal,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) faces a trial next week as investors seek 9.2 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in compensation arguing that the carmaker should have informed shareholders about a diesel pollution scandal before regulators did in September 2015.
The lawsuit bundles 1,670 claims brought mainly by VW's institutional shareholders who have accused the carmaker of failing to inform investors about the scope of a scandal which has cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines.
Had VW warned investors about the size of the scandal before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a ""notice of violation"" on Sept. 18 2015 then institutional investors may have avoided losses on their shareholdings, plaintiffs said. 
VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars. 
Volkswagen has admitted systematic emissions cheating but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure.
Presiding Judge Christian Jaede at the Braunschweig higher regional court will make opening remarks at the trial on Monday. 
VW insists that the U.S. EPA's issuance of the notice of violation was not in keeping with how U.S. authorities had handled similar cases involving other carmakers.
Because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an EPA notice of violation, and because VW was in talks about reaching a settlement, VW's board did not see the need to inform investors, the carmaker said in a filing with the Braunschweig court. 
VW had already made substantial provisions in late 2015 to cover other vehicle recalls, and because previous fines by U.S. authorities for similar violations were below $200 million, there was no need to issue an ad-hoc disclosure notice under German law, the carmaker said in the filing.
Volkswagen says board members at the time, including Volkswagen's current chief executive Herbert Diess and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch therefore did not violate disclosure rules, according to the VW defense document filed with the court.
""Neither the management board nor individual board members caused or were involved with the compliance violation in the United States,"" VW's court filing said. 
However, plaintiffs, including lawyer Andreas Tilp from law firm TILP and fund management firm Deka, argue that managers below management board level, including divisional heads, knew about deliberate and systematic emissions cheating. 
The company as such was therefore aware of severe criminal activity and investors should therefore have been warned earlier, the plaintiffs said.

Siluanov's comments came a day after he met business representative Alexander Shokhin and other heads of companies to discuss ways of supporting Russian business.
""The relatively stable rouble has allowed business leaders to receive good earnings. That's why we say: friends, please send these earnings in the direction of Russia's economy,"" Siluanov said on Friday.
""Don't guzzle them away. Don't invest them in whatever foreign assets. Spend them here.""
The minister said that he and Shokhin, a former deputy prime minister who now heads the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, had discussed policies to create favorable conditions for business. 
""For some reason, (business leaders) think we are trying to confiscate, to trick them, to take steps to take away their additional profits,"" Siluanov said.
""That's not the case at all. Quite the opposite.""
Russian ministers and business leaders are in talks following a proposal by Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov to raise 500 billion rubles ($7.24 billion) a year for the stretched state budget from metals and mining firms.
His initial suggestion of a windfall tax on the firms, which the government says have profited from a weak rouble and strong commodity prices, triggered a sell-off in metal and mining shares and was opposed by Siluanov. In late August Belousov proposed instead that firms invest in social projects in Russia.
Russia needs extra budget revenue to meet economic goals set out by Putin when he began a new six-year term in the Kremlin in May. The government has already announced plans to raise value-added tax from 2019 and increase the retirement age.
Moscow has meanwhile adopted or proposed a number of measures to make it easier for Russian businesses to move their money home, including scrapping penalties on funds repatriated from abroad.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The Gulf state of Qatar on Friday said it would invest 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in Germany over the next five years, including the possible creation of a liquefied natural gas terminal.
Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani announced the funding boost for its long-term trading partner and Europe's largest economy at a bilateral investment conference in Berlin. Germany is Europe's biggest energy consumer.
The latest investment pledge comes on top of 25 billion euros Qatar has already invested in key German companies such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and others.
""To express our trust in the strength of the German economy and the importance of investing in it, I announce the intention of Qatar to pump investments that amount to 10 billion euros into the German economy in the next five years,"" al-Thani said.
He said the overall volume of German-Qatari trade had dipped slightly in 2017 after doubling to around 2.8 billion euros, but he expected further growth in coming years.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the energy sector offered promising opportunities to expand business ties, adding that Qatar's LNG supplies would help diversify supply sources.
""From my point of view, the energy sector in particular offers considerable potential to expand our economic ties,"" Merkel told the emir and other conference participants.
She said Germany was already linked with LNG terminals in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland, but her government was working to expand the LNG network within Germany, and German companies were working toward a potential local LNG terminal.
Qatar's energy minister Mohammed al-Sada on Thursday threw his support behind the possible cooperation of Qatar Petroleum, the world's top supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in the project.
On Wednesday Qatar Petroleum said it was in talks with Germany's RWE and rival Uniper about the potential LNG terminal.

The German LNG Terminal consortium comprising Dutch gas network operator Gasunie, German tank storage provider Oiltanking and Dutch oil and chemical storage company Vopak are developing a plan with a funding decision due by the end of 2019.

395,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","This Time Is Different? For Argentina and IMF, It Had Better Be","(Bloomberg) -- Argentina and the International Monetary Fund have history. Not the good kind. Their last loan deal was among the most disastrous of all time.
That’s why the stakes are so high –- for both sides –- as Argentina resumes the role of IMF borrower after almost two decades. And already there are signs that the current $50 billion bailout is getting blown off course.
President Mauricio Macri is pushing to revise an agreement reached less than three months ago. He wants more cash up front to prop up the peso, whose dramatic slump last week helped trigger an emerging-market rout.
He’ll probably get it. But that may just create a fresh set of problems for Macri, Argentina’s first market-friendly leader since the country swung left after the crash of 2001. His approval ratings are already plunging -- and now he risks having to run for re-election, in little more than a year’s time, against a backdrop of IMF-mandated austerity and an economy in recession.
Fundamental Villain
That’s a hard sell anywhere. It’s especially toxic in Argentina, where “fundamentally, the IMF is a villain,’’ according to Benjamin Gedan, head of the Argentina Project at the Wilson Center in Washington.
Macri’s government has been talking to the IMF this week, after announcing $6 billion of fiscal savings for next year. The goal is a balanced budget (before interest payments on debt), from a projected deficit of 2.6 percent in 2018.
Even if that’s enough to get public finances on track, “the real question is whether it’s politically viable,’’ said Gedan. “The opposition, and the Argentine people, do not buy into this.’’
Working in Macri’s favor is the rethink on austerity that’s under way at the IMF.
Anxiety Attack
The Fund got burned in 2001, too. The damage to its reputation wasn’t commensurate with the economic depression and social unrest endured by Argentina. Still, it was enough to prompt an 85-page internal report into what went wrong.
“The provision of significant new financing only postponed the inevitable,’’ was one finding. Translated out of IMF-speak, that means: We threw good money after bad.
Paul Blustein identifies another mistake. After indulging plenty of fiscal backsliding by Argentina early on, the IMF ended up putting its imprimatur on “a very constrictive budget policy,’’ according to Blustein, the author of “And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out),’’ a study of the 2001 crisis.
“Its image suffered accordingly,’’ he said. “I can only imagine how anxious people at the Fund are to make sure they avoid another Argentine rescue that goes bad.’’
‘Very Different’
Argentina was just the start of the IMF’s re-education. It subsequently poured money into Greece -- whose economy kept failing to rebound the way the Fund forecast it would.
A landmark paper in 2013, co-authored by then-chief economist Olivier Blanchard, identified the root of the error: Cutting government spending, as Greece was required to do under its program, did more damage to growth than the IMF’s models predicted.
Later, the Fund pushed for Greek debt relief and sought to distance itself from austerity. “The IMF is a very different institution from when it last engaged with Argentina,” spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters on Thursday.
Guillermo Nielsen, who negotiated with the Fund as Argentina’s finance secretary in the years after the 2001 crash, says it wasn’t easy back then to persuade the IMF that spending cuts carried risks.
“We tried to show them the social limits of some of those measures,” he said. “We had a very tough time.”
‘Until the End’
But when talks with Macri’s government got under way this year, the IMF itself was making a similar case, according to one person familiar with its approach in the discussions.
Fund bosses were worried that Macri could lose domestic support and get kicked out of power, the person said. They didn’t want the program to be perceived as another round of IMF austerity for Argentina, and pushed for social protections to be built in.
The IMF’s new stance may be reflected in the route Macri is taking toward a tighter budget. Subsidies for transport and energy will be trimmed, along with capital spending. But the main social benefits won’t be cut. They’re even due to increase slightly.
The biggest saving comes not from spending cuts but tax increases –- on exports. In Argentina that means large-scale farmers take most of the hit.
Julio Reumann, who has about 10,000 acres of crop fields and cattle pastures, says he’s OK with getting squeezed. “We farmers can bear it,’’ he said.
Reumann says he’ll back Macri’s government “until the very end.” But he’s critical of the president’s policy of “gradualismo,’’ saying Argentina needed shock therapy instead. And his support doesn’t extend to Macri’s pursuit of IMF loans.
“The best thing would be for them not to lend us anything,’’ the farmer said. “Borrowed money only puts off a crisis for later.’’

396,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 06:29AM ET</span>",J&J to work with India on compensation for recalled hip implants,"By Aditya Kalra
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (J&J) said it would work with the Indian government to compensate patients who had suffered from hip implants that were recalled by the U.S. healthcare firm eight years ago after data showed high failure rates.
This follows last week's recommendation from a government panel that J&J pay at least 2 million rupees ($27,812) to each patient for the faulty ASR hip implant. The federal government has asked states to help patients get relief soon.
About 93,000 people worldwide received ASR implants which were recalled in 2010. The Indian panel said in its report that about 4,700 of those people were in India.
Given the recent committee report, ""we are seeking to work with the Indian government to develop an appropriate process for providing further support and compensation for patients in need"", a J&J spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters, adding the firm was committed to support all ASR patients in India.
Sushobhan Dasgupta, a senior J&J executive in India, has, however, told Indian newspaper Mint that the company ""will not pay people who had an ASR implant if they are doing well"".
The company is not okay with the methodology used by the Indian panel, Dasgupta told the paper in an interview https://www.livemint.com/Companies/d5JxJ6YLFqLsUu8sRtf2fO/Not-all-hip-implants-faulty-everyone-wont-be-compensated.html published on Friday. The report has ""factual inaccuracies"" and ""the conclusions could also be inaccurate"", he added.
In 2013, J&J agreed to pay http://reut.rs/I20AZB nearly $2.5 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits from patients in the United States who said they were injured by the implants.
In India, the company paid $2 million to patients for repeat surgeries and about $250,000 in related diagnostic costs under its ASR reimbursement program, but the government panel has criticized J&J for offering no compensation.
Metal hip implant systems such as ASR were designed to be more durable than a traditional metal-on-plastic, ball-and-socket design. But many Indian patients suffered adverse reactions to the implant, the panel said.
J&J entered the Indian market in 1947 when it started selling its now-ubiquitous baby powder. It has in recent years faced issues such as price caps on medical devices.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares remained stuck at five-month lows on Friday as uncertainty over global trade rippled through markets and investors dumped riskier sectors.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gave up timid early gains to stand 0.1 percent down at 1003 GMT while the exporter-heavy German DAX (GDAXI) declined by 0.3 percent.
Europe's benchmark was set to end the week with a 2.4 percent loss, its worst weekly performance since the end of March, with investors' appetite for risk dented by worries over an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China as well as weakness in emerging markets.
Shares in more cyclical sectors, such as financials, energy and miners, were shunned as markets remained on edge after the deadline passed for the public comment period on proposed U.S. tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports.
The exact timing of when such tariffs would take effect remains uncertain.
""Investors still have the emerging markets issue and the global trade concerns to contend with,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, adding that he expects volatility to remain low ahead of the release of a closely watched U.S. jobs report later in the day.
European autos (SXAP), which have been particularly sensitive to headlines on tariffs, were down 0.3 percent.
Tech stocks (SX8P) were also slightly lower. Chipmakers AMS (S:AMS) and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) were down 0.9 percent and 3.9 percent respectively, continuing a decline seen among U.S. peers overnight.
A drop of as much as 5 percent in shares of International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) (L:ICAG) weighed on the travel and leisure sector (SXTP), which fell 0.7 percent.
British Airways, owned by IAG, said it had suffered a data breach involving the theft of financial and personal data from potentially hundreds of thousands of customers.
""That credit card information has been accessed by the hackers arguably makes this an order of magnitude more serious than the high-profile data breach at Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) in 2017,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
In the 2017 Dixons breach, the affected customer records did not contain payment card or bank account details.
Among Friday's gainers, shares in French telecoms operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) led the way with a 5 percent rise on speculation that the company could be delisted.
Iliad declined to comment on the rumors.
Amer Sports (HE:AMEAS) advanced by 2.5 percent after the Finnish sporting goods maker put its Mavic cycling business up for possible sale late on Wednesday.

The company added that it was reviewing options for its fitness equipment and sports watch businesses.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",Swedish election could put government's Telia stake in play,"By Olof Swahnberg and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Telia's plan to buy Bonnier Broadcasting could prompt the Swedish government to sell its 37 percent stake in the telecoms firm to limit state influence over local media, particularly if the centre-right bloc wins Sunday's general election.
The $1 billion deal, announced in July, is politically sensitive because the government already controls Sweden's public service television network SVT, while Bonnier's TV4 is the Scandinavian country's biggest commercial channel.
All the major political parties oppose the deal because it would concentrate more media power in the hands of the state. But blocking it outright could prove complicated for a government that owns stakes in many companies and would likely lead to legal battles, experts say. 
European Union regulators are also examining the deal. But as their core focus is the impact on consumers, they may wave the deal through, putting the ball back in Sweden's court.
Apart from selling its stake, currently worth about 64 billion Swedish crowns ($7 billion), Stockholm could also look at breaking up Telia (ST:TELIA), the Nordic region's biggest telecoms company, to limit the state's role in the media. 
Much will depend on the outcome of Sunday's election, with the minority governing Social Democrats generally in favor of keeping the Telia stake, but the opposition center right open to potentially selling it. 
""We have been clear in our party that it's not appropriate that the state is main owner of TV4, that we are a big player in media,"" said Elisabeth Svantesson, a lawmaker who speaks for the main opposition Moderate party on economic issues.
The centre-left bloc, uniting the Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party, currently has a slim lead over the centre-right in opinion polls, but neither is likely to win an outright majority, potentially leaving the anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party holding the balance of power.
The Sweden Democrats told Reuters they would prefer the state to keep Telia's copper and fiber networks for national security reasons, but were open to selling the rest.
Telia wants to buy Bonnier Broadcasting to expand its media business as internet, telecoms and entertainment converge and U.S. streaming players such as Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) gain market share.
A majority in parliament must approve a potential sale of the Telia stake, but the final decision on whether to proceed rests with the government. 
The Moderate party believes there is a good chance a majority in parliament would back a sale, while a break-up that might keep Telia's copper and fiber networks in state hands was also a possibility. 
""There might be a point in splitting the company, as one possible solution,"" Svantesson said.
The state, which either owns or partly owns 48 companies in Sweden, sold 30 percent of Telia 18 years ago and listed the firm on the Stockholm stock exchange. 
OBSTACLES 
The government is by far the biggest single shareholder in Telia, followed by Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) with a 2.9 percent stake and Swedbank Robur funds, holding 2.5 percent, according to Telia based on data from June 30.
While the state could simply try to block the Bonnier deal, Daniel Stattin, professor of company law at Uppsala University, said that could prove difficult. 
""I think it is not likely they will get approval from all owners,"" he said. 
""Even if the state would get approval at a shareholder meeting, the minority could say that would be detrimental to them, which the board could refer to and thus refuse to comply with the decision.""
Swedbank Robur, for example, backs Telia's strategy to find new growth areas where it can achieve good levels of profitability, a spokeswoman said in an e-mail. 
As the main owner of Telia, the state - which does not have a seat on the board - could seek to replace the board. But that would be a drastic move that would likely undermine investors' confidence in the state as a corporate owner, Stattin said.
An even more extreme measure to stop the deal, floated by some politicians, would be to try to revoke the broadcasting license of Bonnier's TV4. But as that could be seen as curbing freedom of expression, the reason for withdrawal would have to be very strong, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Press and Broadcasting Authority said. 

The spokeswoman added the authority would only look at the deal after the EU has taken a decision, which is expected in the second half of 2019.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 05:15AM ET</span>",World shares driven toward worst week since March by trade tensions,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares limped toward their worst week in almost six months on Friday, with Asia carving out a 14-month trough as investors braced for a new salvo of Sino-U.S. tariffs.
A slump in U.S. chip stocks and reports that President Donald Trump had also weighed a trade scrap with Japan dragged on tech-heavy Asia overnight, while Europe's main bourses faded after an initial attempt push higher. 
A flat pan-European STOXX 600 was set to end the week with a 2.3 percent loss, its worst weekly performance since the end of March. Emerging market stocks have lost even more, some 3 percent. 
Nerves were set to be frayed further after the public comment period for proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports passed at 0400 GMT. The tariffs could now go into effect at any moment, although there was no clear timetable.
China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. Australia's dollar, often used in as play on China's fortunes due to its huge metals exports there, hit a 2-1/2 year low early on it Europe. 
""It is all linked to the trade comment period expiring and now we are wondering what the implementation plan is going to be and how China is going to respond,"" Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy said. 
""The Aussie dollar of course is a proxy within G10 for that,"" he added, also pointing to shares in mining giants such as BHP trading down near key technical levels.
There were some crumbs of comfort, however, for traders. 
Battered emerging market shares were on course to snap a 7-day losing streak. China had closed higher overnight despite the tariff feud and Turkey's lira and South Africa's rand and Argentina's peso all looked relatively calm early on.
Chinese blue chips had managed their 0.5 percent bounce as beaten-down health care stocks found buyers after taking a savaging in recent months amid vaccine scandals.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had still lost 0.3 percent though, having earlier reached its lowest since mid-July last year.
The Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, undermined by a rising yen and reports U.S. President Donald Trump could be contemplating taking on Japan over trade.

ON THE JOBS
Other emerging markets were trying to steady after a punishing week, with Indonesia and the Philippines still badly scarred by fears of capital flight following crises in Argentina and Turkey and the rumbling U.S.-China trade strains.
""It seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts wrote in a note.
""The tech sector was also very weak overnight, with a slide in Micron of almost 10 percent and further weakness in the Chinese Internet ADRs.""
Eyes were also turning to the U.S. payrolls report for August which is expected to show a robust rise of 191,000, in part as July was temporarily depressed by the closure of the Toys R Us chain that month.
Still, analysts at NatWest Markets cautioned that: ""Despite employment indicators pointing to another strong report, it is worth noting that there is a tendency for August payrolls to initially disappoint and then be revised up noticeably later.""
Just as important will be figures on U.S. wages where a rise above the 0.2 percent forecasted would likely boost the dollar and pressure Treasury prices.
The dollar could do with the lift, having lost out to the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc. It was changing hands at 110.70 yen after falling 0.7 percent on Thursday, the sharpest one-day loss in seven weeks.
Part of the decline came after a Wall Street Journal columnist reported Trump had mused about starting a trade fight with Japan.
The dollar also hit a four-month low on the franc around $0.9645. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index nudged lower to 94.939 and was heading for a fourth weekly drop.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1645, while sterling idled at $1.2939 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations.
In commodity markets, the dip in the dollar left gold a sliver higher at $1,200.67 an ounce.
Crude oil was slightly up too after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday when U.S. data showed gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly last week. 

Brent was 20 cents higher at $76.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude edged up 23 cents to $67.99.

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management has renewed its pressure on  Hyundai Motor  Group with a fresh restructuring proposal after forcing the South Korean conglomerate to abandon its own reform plan in May.
Elliott also urged Hyundai to form a committee to review its proposal with other investors and experts, expressing frustration at what it called Hyundai's silence toward its attempts to discuss the new proposals.
The renewed push comes amid growing public scrutiny over families controlling large conglomerates in South Korea following a corruption scandal last year involving the Samsung (KS:005930) Group.
In a rare victory for an activist shareholder in the country, Elliott and other shareholders helped in May to force Hyundai, South Korea's second-largest business group, to scrap its own restructuring plan, which would have prepared the group for a switch of management from father to son.
""We express our frustration as to HMC board's silence toward our consistent attempts... to communicate and advance the restructuring and other projects,"" Elliott said in a letter sent to Hyundai on August 14. It released the letter to the public on Friday.
It proposed to establish a committee to discuss restructuring, shareholder returns and a board makeup. 
Hyundai rejected the proposal for the committee on the basis that it could potentially violate ""fair disclosure rules, which prevent us from sharing material confidential information about the company and its businesses to only a subset of our shareholders.""
""We hope to share our thoughts on how to improve shareholder value with all of our shareholders in due course,"" Hyundai said in a statement on Friday.
Under its new proposal, billionaire Paul Singer's fund asked car-parts maker  Hyundai Mobis  Co (KS:012330) to sell its after-sale service business to Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380), and then merge what is left of Mobis with logistics affiliate  Hyundai Glovis  Co (KS:086280).
Then it proposed the merged Mobis-Glovis purchase stakes in Hyundai Motor from the controlling family and affiliate Kia Motors (KS:000270) to tighten its grip over the crown jewel of the group.
The news raised investors' expectations that the stalled restructuring of Hyundai may revive, sending shares in Hyundai Glovis 5.5 percent higher and Hyundai Mobis up 2.4 percent. Shares in Hyundai Motor fell 1 percent.
Hyundai's original plan was to spin off Hyundai Mobis' lucrative after-sales business and merge it with Hyundai Glovis, whose top shareholders are chairman Chung Mong-koo and his only son and heir apparent Chung Eui-sun.

Elliott owns around 3.0 percent of Hyundai Motor, 2.1 percent of Kia Motors and 2.6 percent of Mobis.

Signs of macroeconomic stability, a narrower current account deficit, and foreign reserves at higher levels than during the 2013 taper tantrum should help the country, according to Andrew Swan, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s head of Asian and global emerging markets equities.
The Jakarta Composite Index sank 4 percent this week, making it the world’s worst-performing major stock market amid an emerging market rout that rattled investor confidence, sending the rupiah to its lowest since the 1998, during the Asian financial crisis.
“We remain positive on Indonesia and believe the economy is better able to handle higher U.S. 10-year yield compared to before,” Swan said in an email. The firm is “most overweight” on banks as fundamentals remain firm and non-performing loan ratios have been improving.
Swan’s remarks came as various strategists warned that the weakness in the nation’s currency may keep investors away as the emerging-market turmoil deepened. Morgan Stanley analyst Sean Gardiner said that there’s still danger of continued currency weakness that may spill over into corporate activity and Goldman’s Nupur Gupta wrote in a report that Indonesian asset classes may remain under pressure if the selloff in emerging markets continues.
Foreign investors have pulled out $3.8 billion from equities market this year, set for the biggest annual outflow from Indonesia ever.
Indonesian stocks did stage a comeback on Thursday. The nation’s key stock index rallied in late afternoon trading and closed 1.6 percent higher, the steepest daily gain in three weeks, after the government introduced measures to prop up the currency.
Swan expects some capital outflow in the near term, but fundamentals remain firm and “potential opportunities could arise should investors throw the baby out with the bath water.”

(Reuters) - Passengers and crew on two flights arriving in Philadelphia from Europe on Thursday were screened by medical teams after 12 people aboard became ill with flu-like symptoms, a day after a similar outbreak on a flight from Dubai to New York.
All 250 people on separate American Airlines (O:AAL) flights from Munich and Paris were ""held for a medical review"" as a precaution, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was notified, Philadelphia International Airport spokeswoman Diane Gerace said. 
Flight 717 from Munich and Flight 755 from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris both arrived in Philadelphia on Thursday afternoon, she said.
The CDC worked with Philadelphia health officers, emergency responders and Customs and Border Patrol agents to evaluate the sick passengers for influenza and other respiratory illnesses, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said.
""Twelve passengers from the two flights reported sore throat and cough, none were identified with fever. None of the passengers are severely ill, and they will be released and informed of test results in 24 hours,"" Haynes said. 
The rest of the passengers from the two flights were allowed to continue on to their destination, he said, adding that the CDC would provide further information when tests results were confirmed.
No one on either plane was quarantined, American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said. She said members of the crews had not contacted medical personnel ahead of landing to alert them of sick passengers on board. 
On Wednesday, at least 19 people aboard an Emirates airlines [EMIRA.UL] double-deck Airbus 380 flight from Dubai were confirmed ill when the aircraft landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. 
Ten of them were treated at a local hospital. A press secretary for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday that test results had confirmed influenza.
""Some tests came back inconclusive on other viruses, which is common,"" de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips said on Twitter, adding that the tests were being re-administered.
""All 10 patients will be kept in the hospital as a precaution until we know those final results,"" Phillips said.

Separately, health officials in Houston said they were looking into a case of a person with measles possibly exposing others to the virus during a flight connection at that city's Hobby Airport on Aug. 21 and 22.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 08:42PM ET</span>","Smith & Wesson parent company defends directors, sways Glass Lewis","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - The parent company of gunmaker Smith & Wesson on Thursday defended its directors and its contribution disclosures ahead of a proxy vote that will test how far leading fund firms will press concerns about firearms safety, and won rare new recommendations from a proxy adviser.
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, American Outdoor Brands Corp responded to proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co, which on Tuesday had recommended investors withhold their support from half of the company's 10 board nominees and backed a call for a safety report.
In an unusual update, a spokesman for Glass Lewis on Thursday evening sent a new version of its report stating that in light of American Outdoor's additional disclosures, it would recommend against only one director nominee. The proxy adviser still backed the call for the safety report.
The new view underscores the attention being focused on American Outdoor's Sept. 25 shareholder meeting, which will likely spotlight just what role the financial industry should play overseeing firearms companies.
After a gunman wielding a Smith & Wesson assault-style rifle massacred 17 people at a Florida high school in February, some banks restricted firearms lending, and asset managers including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group said they would speak to gunmakers about the safety of their products.
BlackRock and Vanguard, which together hold about 20 percent of American Outdoor's shares, must decide how to vote at the shareholder event, to be held only online. 
In recommending votes be withheld from director Mitchell Saltz, Glass Lewis' new report cited how the company had not disclosed that he also sits on the board of police training services provider VirTra Inc, a potential conflict of interest. 
Glass Lewis initially had recommended votes against four other directors over the issue, but changed its stance in light of American Outdoor's disclosure Thursday that the lack of disclosure was due to ""an inadvertent omission"" by Saltz.
The company's filing also reiterated arguments the safety report is unnecessary, saying among other things that the smart gun technology proponents would like reviewed ""is not commercially viable or reliable.""
American Outdoor also said its policy did not require it to disclose contributions of $1.5 million it has made to groups including the National Rifle Association, the politically influential gun rights advocate. 
The proxy adviser previously noted criticism by a shareholder activist group, Majority Action, that the company should have reported the money. In its update Glass Lewis said while shareholders should not vote against directors only on the issue, they should ""take note"" given past rocky relations between the company and the NRA. 
BlackRock and Vanguard representatives declined to say how they will vote.
In May, both backed a call for a safety report at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Company Inc, but backed all directors.
BlackRock said it voted for a safety report at one gunmaker because it barred talks with shareholders. 

Via email, American Outdoor Vice President Liz Sharp said, ""We do respond to engagement requests from our investors."" She declined to comment on Glass Lewis' update.

""As we continue to increase transparency around our rules and enforcement actions, we wanted to be open about this action, given the broad interest in this case,"" the company tweeted. ""We do not typically comment on enforcement actions we take against individual accounts for their privacy.""
In a video posted on the Infowars website on Thursday Jones said, ""I was taken down not because we lied but because we tell the truth and because we were popular.""
The ban came weeks after Apple (O:AAPL), Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) YouTube, and Facebook (O:FB) took down podcasts and channels from Jones, citing community standards.
Jones, whose conspiracy theories include that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was a hoax, hosts the syndicated radio program ""The Alex Jones Show."" 
Last month, Jones lost a bid to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought against him by the parents of a boy who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting.
On Wednesday, Jones attended a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on ways to counteract foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections and political discourse. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey testified at the hearing.
Twitter said on Thursday that it would evaluate any reports regarding other accounts potentially associated with Jones and Infowars. 

Last month, Twitter banned Jones and Infowars for seven days, citing tweets that it said violated the company's rules against abusive behavior, which state that a user may not engage in targeted harassment of someone or incite other people to do so.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>",CBS negotiating Moonves' exit and Viacom merger standstill: sources,"By Ken Li and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Media company CBS Corp's (N:CBS) board is in talks with Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves to negotiate his exit, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
These discussions are occurring as the company and its controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc are also hammering out a settlement to a legal dispute over the control of CBS. 
The two sides would agree to a two-year standstill on any discussions of a CBS and Viacom Inc (O:VIAB) merger as part of the settlement, sources close to the talks told Reuters. 
The board has offered a roughly $100 million exit package, CNBC reported earlier on Thursday, citing people familiar with the negotiations. The number could not be independently verified.
A New Yorker report in late July featured claims against Moonves from six women spanning different time periods over two decades, from 1985 to 2006. The allegations included sexual assault and unwanted advances.
The board has asked for autonomy from its controlling shareholder, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. If granted, CBS could be free to pursue a sale. 
CBS shares rose more than 3 percent.
Moonves will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Joe Ianniello as interim CEO, CNBC reported. 
Long viewed as a successor to Moonves, Ianniello was instrumental in CBS's success following its split from Viacom in 2006. He has overseen the company's transformation from traditional TV and radio broadcaster to a supplier of shows to digital platforms and the launch of its own streaming TV service.
As of Wednesday's close, CBS stock had risen by more than 120 percent from a close of $24.04 on Dec. 30, 2005, a day before the company split. Viacom stock has fallen more than 28 percent from $41.15 in the same period.
""CBS will be in very good hands with Joe Ianniello running the company and allow for a smooth transition,"" analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners said.
CBS declined to comment. Representatives of the board and representatives for the investigations into Moonves declined to comment.
Moonves, who joined CBS in 1995 and became CEO in 2006, has been locked in a legal battle over control of the company with National Amusements, owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner who also control media company Viacom.
Viacom shares traded flat on Thursday. 
Moonves received total compensation of $69.33 million in 2017, making him one of the highest paid U.S. executives. Under his contract, he is entitled to up to $180 million in severance. 
According to the CNBC report, the board wants to reserve the ability to claw back some of the compensation depending on the results of investigations into sexual harassment allegations against Moonves. It was not immediately clear if this could mean Moonves receives less than $100 million or anything at all. 
CBS in August said it had retained two law firms and the board had set up a special committee to probe the allegations.
According to a filing from CBS in April, if Moonves is terminated for cause, or in the event of resignation without “good reason,” no incremental payments and benefits would be made.
One of the definitions for ""cause"" include ""willful and material violation of any Company policy that is generally applicable to all employees or officers of the Company, including, but not limited to, policies concerning insider trading or sexual harassment,"" according to the filing. 
Moonves had earlier said he ""may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances"", which he called mistakes he regretted immensely, but that he understood ""'no' means 'no'"" and never used his position to harm anyone's career.
A big payout could open the company to shareholder litigation, experts said. 
""There’s an established legal doctrine that says you can potentially be sued for overpaying your CEO to go away,"" said Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School corporate governance professor. ""If you authorize payment of a big exit fee, you have to be acting in good faith to further shareholder interests.""
The precedent came out of shareholders suing over Michael Ovitz’s exit compensation from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) as president, claiming the board breached its fiduciary duty, Talley said. Shareholders ultimately lost but the legal battle established the standard boards and companies must meet when dealing with executive departures.

News of discussions with Moonves were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.

425,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Another Strong Jobs Report Expected
Wall Street’s attention will be laser focused on the employment report tomorrow.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the August jobs numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that of 191,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.
But barring a big beat or miss, the figures on average hourly wages will be the most interesting, giving investors some insight into what the Federal Reserve might do in December.
The consensus is that hourly earnings grew 0.3% in August, matching the rise in July.
2. Two Fed Speakers on the Calendar
There could also be more insight on the Fed’s thinking when two Federal Reserve members speak tomorrow.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren is scheduled to give a speech at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Rosengren has recently warned on the economy growing above capacity.
“I think the policy path that will increase the probability of a longer recession-free period is the path where the economy does not run above capacity and, thus, fall far below the sustainable unemployment rate,” Rosengren said in June, according to Reuters.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan will speak at 12:45 PM ET (16:45 GMT).
Kaplan said in August three or four more rate hikes will bring the FOMC to a neutral rate.
3. Rig Count Data on Tap
Oil prices were hit today and traders will be looking at the latest Baker Hughes rig data for more clarity.
The rig count came in at 862 last week.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by 4.302 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 31, data showed today, beating expectations for a draw of 1.294 million barrels.
The large draw in crude supplies comes despite a modest climb in imports by about 0.500 million barrels per day (bpd), while exports declined by 0.271 million bpd, data from EIA showed.
Production was unchanged at 11.0 million bpd for the second-straight week, which also supported the draw in crude supplies."

428,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Drops as Tech Wreck Weighs; Trump Eyes Japan Trade Battle,"Investing.com - A wave of selling pressure emerged across tech stocks Thursday as semiconductor stocks slumped on fears over a wobble in the industry, while the threat of increased regulation sent Facebook and Twitter tumbling.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.08%. S&P 500 fell 0.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.91%.
Semiconductor companies sounded the alarm on the stability of industry, warning that margins would likely be knocked by falling DRAM (memory chip) prices and oversupply in NAND (flash memory) products as demand wanes.
Nanya delivered the first blow earlier this week, when it provided a cautionary outlook for server DRAM for the fourth quarter. Both Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) exacerbated those concerns, as the latter said that its December quarter ""would be up less than thought,"" owing to weakness in the memory market.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), meanwhile, delivered another blow to semiconductors, asserting that ""memory markets have worsened in recent weeks,"" as ""too much supply"" is weighing on NAND, while inventory and prices pressures were curbing demand for DRAM.
Tech was thrown into further disarray amid an ongoing slump in a well-known cohort of large-cap tech stocks on concerns that lawmakers were ready to pull the trigger on plans to increase regulation, which many fear could keep a lid on profits of tech companies.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) sunk for a second-straight day, leaving tech on course to end the week nursing a 2% loss.
Late drama unfolded on the trade front, as President Donald Trump told a columnist for The Wall Street Journal that Japan was next in his crosshairs, further exacerbating fears of a global trade war.
This comes as the United States and Canada continued talks on reaching an agreement on NAFTA revamp after reportedly working late into the night on Wednesday.
Traders were also awaiting confirmation on whether Trump would impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports on Thursday when a public comment period on the new tariffs ends.
Energy, meanwhile, also contributed to the plunge in stocks as oil prices were pressured by a government report showing a large increase in fuel stockpiles, which offset a draw in crude supplies.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 1.4% to settle at $67.64 a barrel.
On the corporate news front, CBS (NYSE:CBS) CEO Les Moonves is reportedly set to leave the media company with a potential $200 million payoff. This comes after Moonves, acknowledged “mistakes” in the way he had treated women in the early throes of his career.
Ahead of the all-important nonfarm payrolls report due Friday, private sector job data did little boost investor hopes for an upbeat report as  private sector job creation in August, undershot economists' expectations.

456,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Watch These Markets as Trump's $200 Billion Trade Salvo Nears,"(Bloomberg) -- The elephant in the room for markets this week is the trade war with China, and investors are waiting to see which way it might step.
President Donald Trump is said to be ready to push ahead with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports after the deadline for public input ends Thursday, a move that could rattle markets from U.S. stocks to emerging markets and offset some of the American economy’s long strides forward.
“It’ll cause some volatility in the short run,” Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, said by phone. “We’re just now starting to see from an economic perspective some of the impact of trade and tariffs, so if we go through with this and China does retaliate, we won’t see the effects of it until probably the first quarter.”
Here are some of the markets that have taken it on the chin as trade tensions mounted over the past few months and may be vulnerable as protectionism ramps up:
China Tech
One of the main targets of the Trump administration’s trade tactics has been the Chinese technology sector. The U.S. proposed tariffs in March in response to “unfair trade practices” tied to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation. Since then, Chinese companies have severely underperformed their American counterparts. Chinese technology giants Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), and Tencent account for roughly 12 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, meaning the benchmark global index may go along for the ride.
Industrials
Another fragile sector in the trade spat is U.S. manufacturers that rely on international sales and supply chains. The industrial companies have underperformed the S&P 500 Index by about 5 percent since the start of the year.
Small Caps
On a broader scale, U.S. small caps have outperformed global stocks and are seen as being relatively immune from trade disputes due to their elevated domestic exposure. This disparity has also happened as the dollar has strengthened amid robust economic activity, continued monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, and turmoil in some emerging-market economies.
EM Rout
Emerging markets may be the most unnerved by the tensions between trade powers, as they also grapple with a stronger dollar. The MSCI EM index, of which roughly one-third are Chinese and Hong Kong-listed stocks, is down more than 20 percent since reaching the highest in more than a decade in January.
China’s Currency
The Chinese yuan has been closely watched by investors amid trade tensions. The country’s offshore currency has depreciated as much as 11 percent against the dollar since reaching a year high in March. The weakness has helped to counteract some of the U.S. trade actions, yet the Chinese government has also been weary of capital flight.
Soybeans
One of the biggest U.S. agricultural exports to China caught up in the tit-for-tat is soybeans. The commodity has tumbled about 22 percent since April when the Trump administration said it would levy an additional 25 percent tariff on imports of 106 U.S. products, including the American staple.
So as traders wait for Trump’s next move, some wonder if the president will reassess the wisdom of a trade war if markets continue to take a beating.
“This president is clearly more tuned to the stock market than previous presidents. And in that sense, the stock market could be the new vigilante,” Hank Smith, the co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co., which manages $8 billion, said by phone. “If you saw a swift decline in the stock market based off of a Trump action, I think he would pay attention to that. It’s almost a put if you will.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top markets regulator, backed by the United States, urged the European Union to soften its stance and grant broad access to UK banks after Brexit to avoid hitting investors and harming markets.
Britain and the EU are negotiating the outline of future trading terms and Brussels has said the best option for banks, insurers and asset managers is probably the bloc's current system of market access known as equivalence.
Under this, the EU alone decides if a foreign country's rules are close enough to its own to grant access. 
""It would be a mistake to move away from open financial markets as they are needed to support trade in goods and services,"" Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told a Eurofi conference in Vienna.
Britain has said equivalence does not cover all activities and lacks certainty, leaving the country facing patchy access to its biggest export market for financial services in future.
The EU's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis told the same event that Europe must be and will be the champion of an open and integrated international system, based on multilateralism.
""This is true whether you look at the global trading system, or at financial regulation and equivalence,"" Dombrovskis said.
Earlier this week, Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, urged his counterparts in the EU and elsewhere to defer to each other's rules when based on international standards.
He criticized EU plans to supervise U.S. and other foreign clearing houses on their home turf under revised equivalence rules.
Bailey said he strongly welcomed Giancarlo's calls and urged the EU to back Britain's proposal for a much broader form of equivalence, given that both sides will have identical rules when Britain leaves the bloc next March.
""And we should now work together to put in place the arrangements to achieve this in practice,"" Bailey said.
Giancarlo told the Vienna conference it was time for the EU to expand the use of equivalence in a way that avoids ""rule-by-rule exactitude"". 

""Thus, EU can provide necessary legal and regulatory certainty to third country firms, and the EU should rely as much as possible on third country regulators and supervisors,"" Giancarlo said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's accountants received the most stark warning yet over auditing standards as the nation's leading financial regulator threatened punitive action for failure to properly check how financial firms record client assets.
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Chairman Charles Randell said that, while adherence to the FCA's ""CASS"" regulations has improved significantly in recent years, some auditors have not invested enough in building their understanding of the rules.
""We continue to see client asset reports that are just not good enough,"" Randell told an audience of accountants on Thursday. ""We continue to monitor this area, but be warned: we have a very low tolerance for CASS failings.""
The FCA has powers to fine companies that breach its rules.
Randell's blunt warning follows recent criticism from lawmakers that the Big Four audit firms -- KPMG, EY, PwC and Deloitte -- are failing to spot problems at companies and need shaking up to increase competition and quality.
Accountants have come under the gun since the financial crisis left taxpayers to bail out banks only months after they were given a clean bill of health by auditors.
""Ten years on from the start of the financial crisis, there’s still much more to be done to ensure that accountants in general, and auditors in particular, play their part in supporting markets that function well,"" Randell told members of professional accounting body ICAEW.
Randell said he was ""very disappointed"" with the results of the latest review from the accounting sector's watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, which showed a decline in audit quality at the Big Four, especially in bank audits.
""The profession needs to address audit quality as a matter of urgency,"" Randell said, adding that auditors need to show ""robust scepticism"" and an ability to challenge management at companies they audit.

The world's biggest coffee chain is making its first foray into the home of espresso coffee by opening an upmarket roastery in a central Milan square.
Customers walking into the converted post office now housing the lavishly decorated cafe will pay 1.80 euros ($2.09) for an espresso, almost twice the normal market price.
Codacons also said Starbucks' price tag of 4.50 euros for a cappuccino compared with the average Milan price of 1.30 euros. 
""These above market prices can cause a damage to Italian consumers who want to have the experience of a coffee at Starbucks,"" it said in a statement on Thursday. 
""We have asked the antitrust (authority) to verify the correctness of Starbucks' commercial practice in its first Milanese store,"" it added. 
Starbucks Global President of Retail John Culver told Reuters the roastery prices reflected ""the premium experience"" the venue offered. 
Starbucks' model offering customers seating space and premium coffee drinks is a novelty for Italians, who are used to drinking their several espresso cups per day while standing at a bar counter.
Starbucks had no immediate comment. 
A spokeswoman for Italy's antitrust authority said it would assess the complaint when it had received it.

(Reuters) - The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw sharp declines on Thursday as internet stocks faltered for a second day on concerns about increased regulation, while warnings from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) led a slide in chip stocks.
Micron sank 8.7 percent after Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said prices of NAND chips declined in the third quarter and at least two brokerages said the markets for NAND and DRAM chips were worsening.
KLA-Tencor tumbled 9.6 percent, and weighed on other chip equipment makers, after Chief Financial Officer Bren Higgins said September was still ""a drought for DRAM"" and that a pick-up in business later this year would be less than expected.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index slid 2.6 percent, led by Micron and KLA-Tencor.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter executives defended their companies before skeptical U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday and the U.S. Department of Justice said it would discuss, at a meeting on Sept. 25, concerns that social media platforms are ""intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas"".
Facebook fell 3.8 percent, Twitter dropped 6.1 percent, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) slipped 2.8 percent and Snap was down 4.8 percent, hitting a fresh record low.
The losses, along with those in chip companies sent the S&P 500 Information Technology index down 1.37 percent.
""The market has lost its leader for now, while people take profits based on the potential for regulation,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
""We've stretched this rubber band pretty far and potentially it's time for other sectors to lead rather than follow.""
Investors were keeping an eye on trade developments as a public comment period, on the Trump administration's plan for fresh tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, ends on Thursday. China has warned of retaliation if Washington implements any new tariff measures.
U.S.-Canada talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement continue on Thursday.
At 13:04 ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 60.09 points, or 0.23 percent, at 25,914.90, the S&P 500 was down 20.95 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,867.65 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 108.49 points, or 1.36 percent, at 7,886.68.
Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 0.44 percent rise in the real estate sector and a 0.37 percent gain in utilities.
Among the bright spots, CBS Corp's shares rose 3.3 percent after a report that the media company's board was in settlement talks with Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves to negotiate his exit, which raised chances of a sale rather than merger with Viacom. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 49 new lows.

Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh announced that he had filed administrative charges against Arizona-based Insys, which he said provided doctors thousands of dollars to induce them into prescribing its medication Subsys to their patients.
""The allegations against Insys describe a calculated scheme employing doctors, pharmacists, and sales reps to increase profits and market share at the expense of the health and well-being of vulnerable patients,"" Frosh said in a statement.
The case added to the legal woes of Insys, whose former top executives have been caught up in a federal criminal investigation into accusations the company paid medical practitioners kickbacks to prescribe Subsys.
Those executives including billionaire founder John Kapoor, who has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Insys in August said it reached a deal to pay at least $150 million to resolve a U.S. Justice Department probe.

The company declined comment. It has said that it has taken steps to prevent past mistakes from happening again.

Demos Parneros, who was fired over allegations of sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior, sued Barnes & Noble in August, saying that the company had falsely accused him of violating its sexual harassment policy.
The company is in the process of ""healing and fixing,"" Chairman Leonard Riggio said on a post-earnings call with analysts, adding that the former CEO's lawsuit was ""nothing but a smokescreen in an attempt to extort money from the company"". 
Barnes & Noble also reported a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss as sales were hit by a ""major glitch"" in the company's website that stopped customers from looking up if their local store had a book in stock. Same-store sales also dropped more than analysts' estimates.
The company's shares were down 7 percent at $4.60 on Thursday.

The department has sought more information from the bank to see if management pressure prompted the employees to improperly alter or add the information prior to a regulatory deadline, the Journal reported https://on.wsj.com/2PJ9gqG, citing the same people.
The Justice Department is interested in learning if there is a pattern of unethical and potentially fraudulent employee behavior tied to management pressure, the WSJ reported.
The incident happened in 2017 and early 2018 as Wells Fargo was trying to meet a deadline to comply with a regulatory consent order related to the bank's anti-money-laundering controls, according to a WSJ report in May.
The report had also said the bank had reported the problem to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the agency was probing the problem.
Wells Fargo, smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, has been a subject of a number of regulatory probes.
Wells Fargo did not immediately comment on the report.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek banks made further progress during this year's second quarter in reducing their exposure to doubtful and non-performing loans, central bank data showed on Thursday.
So-called non-performing exposures (NPEs) are the biggest challenge facing the sector. At the end of June they had fallen by 4.1 percent from the first quarter to 88.6 billion euros ($103 billion) or 47.6 percent of banks' overall loan book compared with a target of 90.2 billion euros or 46.9 percent.
Greek banks have been under regulatory pressure to tackle the bad debt problem which restricts their ability to expand credit and help the economy's recovery.
The country's debt crisis since 2010 drove unemployment to nearly 28 percent, which stopped many borrowers from servicing their loans and shrank the economy by a quarter.
European Central bank board member Benoit Coeure said earlier this week that reducing the burden of sour debt should be a top policy priority for Greece's banking sector.
""Reducing NPLs (non-performing loans) is certainly top of the list from our point of view. Only stronger and healthier banks can provide the necessary basis for an increase in the supply of credit that can support economic growth,"" he told Greek newspaper Kathimerini.
NPEs comprise restructured loans likely to turn sour and non-performing loans (NPLs), which are credit past due for more than 90 days. Cutting them would free up more capital to fund productive sectors of the economy.
Greek lenders had NPEs totaling 14.5 billion euros ($16.3 billion), or 5.5 percent of loans, when the global financial crisis began in 2008.
While NPEs soared to 106.9 billion or 50.5 percent of loans at the end of June 2016, banks have agreed with ECB regulators to shrink them to 64.6 billion by end-2019, meaning the NPE ratio will fall to 35.2 percent of their books.
The agreed targets are back-loaded, meaning most of the reduction will take place this year and in 2019. Banks are aiming for a 37 percent reduction by December next year. 
The reduction in the second quarter was brought about mainly by loan sales of nearly 2.0 billion euros and write-offs of 1.6 billion.
The second quarter also saw collections and liquidations. Default rates picked up to 2.1 percent and were higher than the pace of restoring loans back to performing status (cure rate) of 1.8 percent, the central bank said.
At the end of June, the NPE ratio of mortgages was 44.3 percent, that of consumer loans 56.9 percent with sour business loans at 48 percent. Coverage by loan-loss provisions was 48.6 percent, slightly down from the first quarter's 49 percent.
Greece's four major banks - Piraeus, National, Eurobank and Alpha - and three less systemic banks submit data on nine operational targets.

LONDON (Reuters) - European customers will avoid deals with Russia's United Company Rusal, under U.S. sanctions, when the industry meets in Berlin next week to seal 2019 metal supply agreements, three sources familiar with the discussions said.
Known in the industry as the ""mating season"" and taking place alongside a conference run by industry publication Metal Bulletin, negotiations typically agree quantities and premiums paid above the London Metal Exchange benchmark aluminum price.
The aluminum market has so far been sanguine about the fallout from Rusal being placed under sanctions on expectations they would be lifted in October. The sources disagree.
""We can't agree a deal with Rusal on the basis that sanctions will be lifted by Oct. 23,"" a Rusal customer in Europe said. ""Anyone that has a relationship with Rusal will be preparing for the sanctions to remain in place for now.""
Rusal declined to comment.
Aluminum prices jumped 35 percent between April 6 and April 19 to seven-year highs of $2,718 a tonne after the sanctions were announced, while premiums for the metal on the physical market in Europe hit 3-year highs above $140 a tonne. 
The metal price has since retreated to around $2,100 a tonne and the European premium to below $90 a tonne. If Rusal sells on the open market, further significant price drops are likely. 
""In the current situation of complete uncertainty, Rusal cannot sign contracts for next year,"" a source familiar with the matter said. 
The U.S. imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Rusal's former president Oleg Deripaska, and the 12 companies they own or control in April. Rusal last year accounted for more than 6 percent of global aluminum supplies estimated at around 63 million tonnes.
""Large scale end-customers of the company include  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), Toyota, SMZ JSC, Mechem SA, and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Inc,"" Rusal said in its 2017 annual report.
SANCTIONS DEADLINE
U.S. customers have until Oct. 23 to wind down business with Rusal, a major producer of aluminum used widely in the transport and packaging industries. European customers have to abide by the deadline if they have operations in the U.S. or if they sell to U.S. customers.
Rusal staff are expected to be in Berlin Sept. 12-14 and will meet existing and potential new customers, even though its head of sales and some marketing people left soon after the sanctions were imposed.
""Customers will be reluctant to negotiate with them this year. We can't take risks with our supply chain, we have to find alternative sources,"" an aluminum consumer said. 
""Rusal probably won't have any contracts for next year and if the embargo is lifted they will have to sell metal on the spot market. Price volatility is going to shoot up.""
U.S. premiums for aluminum in the physical market, already elevated after the announcement of import tariffs on aluminum in March, rose $70 to $490 a tonne during April and have since fallen back to around $440 a tonne.
""The market has been ignoring the Rusal conundrum since the extension of the deadline. Maybe the penny will drop in Berlin, that four million tonnes (a year) could be taken out of the market,"" a source at a commodity trader said. 
The U.S. Treasury extended its deadline for U.S. consumers to wind down business with Rusal to Oct. 23 from June 5 and said it would consider lifting sanctions if Deripaska, ceded control of the company.
""Even if the U.S. do lift the sanctions, they won't do it until after the (U.S. midterm) elections in November,"" an aluminum industry source said, adding that a probe into possible collusion between President Donald Trump's election campaign and Russia would delay any action.
""The administration will not want to show any sort of leniency to the Russians before the elections, not before they know what sort of a mandate they have.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it would recall 2 million F-150 pickup trucks in North America to address fire concerns relating to seat belts that have been linked to three serious incidents but no injuries.
The second-largest U.S. automaker said it was aware of 17 reports of smoke or fire in the United States and six in Canada relating to seat-belt pretensioners, but was not aware of any accidents or injuries as a result. The mechanism of the pretensioner, which works in tandem with air bags, involves an explosive charge that locks a seat belt in place during a crash. 
Some pretensioners in front seat belts could generate excessive sparks when deployed, resulting possibly in a fire, the company said.
The recall comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a preliminary investigation in August into 1.6 million Ford trucks after five complaints of fires in the seat belt component, including three vehicles destroyed by fires. 
Owners should ""take action"" when they receive recall notices from Ford disclosing the timing for free repairs, NHTSA said in a statement Thursday. 
The automaker ""identified this issue through its normal quality processes. We have been cooperating with the agency, as we always do,"" Ford spokeswoman Elizabeth Weigandt said on Thursday, referring to NHTSA. 
The recall covers 2015-18 Ford F-150 Regular Cab and SuperCrew Cab vehicles in North America for driver and front passenger seat-belt pretensioners.
Ford said the recall included 1.62 million U.S. vehicles, 340,000 in Canada and 37,000 in Mexico.
Shares of the company were down about 0.3 percent in morning trading at $9.46.
To resolve the issue, dealers will remove some insulation material and remnants of wiring harness tape from the vehicle's B pillar area, and apply heat-resistant tape to the carpet and its insulation. They will also modify the back interior panels of Regular Cab vehicles. The B pillar is the vertical support behind a vehicle's front seat windows.
Transport Canada, the Canadian auto regulatory agency, contacted Ford in November 2017, regarding a B-pillar area fire on a 2015 vehicle. That prompted a joint vehicle inspection by Ford and the agency, but the cause could not be determined.
NHTSA reached out to Ford earlier this year to inquire about the reports relating to the three fires before it opened its formal probe.

Ford said the components in the older 2015-2017 models were built by Takata, which was acquired by Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, while ZF Friedrichshafen AG built the parts starting with the 2018 model year.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Burberry ends bonfire of the luxuries after waste outcry,"By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Burberry will no longer burn unsold luxury goods to protect its brand after an admission that it destroyed almost $40 million worth of stock last year sparked a furor over waste in the fashion industry.
Burberry also said on Thursday it would no longer use real fur such as mink and racoon, in another step to improving its social and environmental credentials which was immediately welcomed by animal rights campaigners. 
The waste revelation in July from Burberry came only months after the owner of Cartier and Montblanc admitted to destroying some of their unsold watches and coincides with growing public awareness of waste and its environmental impact.
""Modern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible,"" said CEO Marco Gobbetti, who is in the process of taking Burberry, where coats sell for more than 2,500 pounds ($3,234) and handbags are priced at up to 1,500 pounds, more upmarket. 
Many retailers have been called out in recent years for destroying unsold stock, including by slashing or punching holes in garments before throwing them out.
Richemont, owner of luxury watch brands, said it bought back unsold stock from dealers during a recent downturn and recycled the precious metals and stones that were in the high-end pieces. 
Burberry physically destroyed 28.6 million pounds worth of finished goods in the financial year to April, up from 26.9 million pounds the previous year, including 10 million pounds worth of beauty products such as perfume. 
The products are generally those that did not sell via discount outlets and are more than five years old. Burberry said it would try to reuse, repair, donate or recycle its products while a strategy to make fewer, more targeted collections should help reduce excess stock. 
It is also working with the sustainable luxury company Elvis & Kresse to transform 120 tonnes of leather offcuts into new products over the next five years.
GROWING AWARENESS
Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Luca Solca said Burberry's announcement could put pressure on other luxury names to be more transparent about how they handle unsold goods. 
""Concerns about sustainability are slowly but surely becoming more relevant for luxury goods consumers,"" he said.
Some luxury groups also offer sales to employees and journalists to limit the amount of unsold stock. Both  Kering  (PA:PRTP), owner of Gucci and Alexander McQueen, and LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Celine, Christian Dior and Givenchy, declined to comment. 
In the mass market, major brands have also struggled to shift stock in a fast changing environment. 
H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer after  Inditex  (MC:ITX), has said in the past it burns stock, but only when it is damaged or, for example, has high levels of chemicals in it. At the end of May the Swedish group had $4 billon of unsold stock that it said it hoped to sell. 
""Under no circumstances do we destroy clothes that are safe to use,"" a spokeswoman said. 
Burberry is following the likes of Versace, Gucci and the trailblazer for ethical fashion, Stella McCartney, in removing real fur from its ranges. 
The moves are part of a series of changes at Burberry where Gobbetti is pinning his hopes on new designer Riccardo Tisci to transform the quintessentially British fashion house. Former Givenchy star Tisci has previously designed costumes for Beyonce and Madonna and releases his debut collection in September. 
""We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products,"" Gobbetti said. 
PETA, the campaign group for the ethical treatment of animals, welcomed Burberry's move to stop using fur, which it said was a sign of the times. 
""The few fashion houses refusing to modernize and listen to the overwhelming public opinion against fur are now sticking out like a sore thumb for all the wrong reasons,"" PETA's director of international programs, Mimi Bekhechi said.
Campaign group Humane Society International said animal charities would unite during this year's major fashion shows to call on Italian brand Prada to follow Burberry's lead.
The head of the International Fur Federation, Mark Oaten, said substituting natural fur with ""plastic petroleum-based materials, like fake fur"" was neither luxury nor responsible.

Mediobanca SpA, Credito Emiliano SpA and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA were also given a negative outlook, down from stable, Fitch said Wednesday as it confirmed the five banks’ long- and short-term ratings for now. Fitch cut its outlook on Italy to negative on Friday.
The decision reflects Fitch’s view that the banks would likely be downgraded if Italy’s rating was cut, given their exposure to the domestic economy and their purchases of government debt. Last week, Fitch said there was an increased chance that Italy’s government will reverse some previous structural reforms, negatively impacting the country’s credit fundamentals. It also said the relatively high degree of political uncertainty compounds the risk.
This summer, investors have turned their attention to Italy’s budget, sending bond yields higher in response to the new government’s expensive electoral promises. Those pledges include hefty tax cuts and some form of universal income for the poor that could have a negative impact on the country’s debt and deficit.
There is a “strong link between sovereigns and banks’ ratings,” Andrea Filtri, an analyst at Mediobanca, wrote in a note Thursday. Still, the Italian government is making “more market-friendly statements of fiscal discipline” of late, Mediobanca’s Filtri said.
While the banks’ shares were little changed, Wednesday, they have underperformed the national stock benchmark this year, with UniCredit and Intesa both down about 15 percent. While UniCredit is more geographically diversified than the other four banks, its risk profile remains highly correlated with that of Italy, Fitch said.

503,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Italy preparing for first dollar bond in eight years, talking to banks","By Giuseppe Fonte, Virginia Furness and Abhinav Ramnarayan
ROME/LONDON (Reuters) - Italy is making preparations to issue its first dollar-denominated bond in eight years and is talking to investment banks about setting up swap infrastructure for the deal, several sources told Reuters.
Rome is keen to diversify its funding sources away from the euro zone bond market, especially as its sovereign borrowing needs are likely to rise to meet the election promises of the ruling coalition. Italy's public debt is large and second only to that of Greece as the highest in the euro zone relative to its economic output.
An Italian economy ministry official said the government was working with banks to update rules on how it would post collateral on derivative trades linked to the new issue.
In the wake of the financial crisis, lenders are under regulatory scrutiny to better manage the risk on their books and the amendments aim to make it easier for banks to manage a dollar issue and for Italy to sell bonds in foreign currencies.
""The Treasury is defining the contract scheme, all the specialists are involved,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The official said the Treasury aimed for the steady issuance of dollar bonds under a new bond program. But Italy will only return to issuing dollar bonds if its cost of funding is cheaper than for euro-denominated BTPs.
Italy had 2.26 trillion euros ($2.63 trillion) in government debt outstanding at the end of 2017, according to Eurostat.
This includes two dollar issues maturing in 2023 and 2033 <IT004622596=> <IT016409294=> and worth $3.5 billion and $2 billion respectively.
A three-year dollar bond issued in September 2010 has already matured.
The new dollar issues are likely to be governed by New York law, which some investors feel offers stronger protection against debt restructuring, including a currency redenomination, than euro issues under Italian law.
Both the existing dollar bonds outperformed their Italian-issued, euro-denominated peers during May's bond rout..
Two primary dealers in London told Reuters the process had been in the works for a while. The government said in February it planned to issue dollar bonds by mid-2019.
""It has been on the agenda for much of this year in Italy, and it is a bit of a priority for the Treasury to regain access to the dollar markets,"" said one of the bankers.
But the second banker was unsure the deal would get off the ground just yet because of Italy's political situation. The country will present a 2019 budget plan in October that investors fear could breach EU spending limits.
""I would strongly recommend them or any other issuer to diversify if they can, but certainly not Italy at the moment -- I would wait until this current situation stabilizes and the dust settles,"" the banker said.
""I wouldn't rule out this year but next year is more realistic.""

Speaking at an energy conference Wednesday, Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean said that while its Canadian affiliate has “attractive assets” and “no debt on the balance sheet,” the company’s primary objective was to use those projects to support the Trans Mountain expansion.
“It’s a set of midstream assets in what we think is an attractive seller’s market for those assets,” he said. “We are going to explore that over the coming months.”
In addition to the Canadian portion of the Cochin pipeline system and the Jet Fuel pipeline system, Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd. has a network of crude storage and rail terminals in Edmonton, Alberta, and the Vancouver Wharves Terminal in British Columbia.

""In summary, I think equity investors are too cautious, which is surprising because the U.S. market is hitting all-time highs,"" said Eddie Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance.
""People are too worried about trade wars, so I am inclined to add a bit of risk in export-oriented industrial companies and emerging market equities.""
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped more than 1 percent to a one-year trough of 515.24 points. It was last down 0.7 percent.
Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent and Australian shares dropped 1.1 percent. China's blue-chip index fell 1.1 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 1 percent.
Further weighing on sentiment, data out earlier showed German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in July, another sign that factories in Europe's largest economy are feeling the bite of protectionist trade politics.
Investors are also watching for developments as the United States and Canada resume talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was imminent.
The dollar, considered a safe haven at times of turmoil because of its status as the world's reserve currency, has generally benefited from the trade conflicts. It has gained 8 percent since the end of March, with currencies in emerging markets taking a hammering.
But measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar retreated from the two-week highs it reached earlier this week to stand 0.1 percent lower at 95.09.
The euro was a tad stronger at $1.1628.
Sterling held on to gains made on Wednesday as investors positioned for a favorable Brexit outcome [GBP/]. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.2920.
Emerging markets have been hit by the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey. In Indonesia, the central bank has had to intervene several times in recent weeks to stem the rupiah's slide.
Indonesia's benchmark stock index was last up nearly 1.6 percent while the rupiah also gained a tad.
MSCI's index of emerging market currencies, which had earlier paused near 15-month lows, was up 0.1 percent on the day after two straight days of heavy declines.
But analysts warned of further losses because investors were no longer looking at Argentina, Turkey and South Africa as isolated cases. They were fretting over the impact of rising U.S. inflation and interest rates on heavily indebted economies.
""As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the U.S. President disturbs the global trade cycle, there's definitely more to the EM sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness,"" wrote strategists at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in a note to clients.
The emerging market equity index has been crunched in the past month or so, falling for six consecutive sessions and down more than 3 percent this week.
A range of factors have hit the stocks: policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the crises in Turkey and Argentina, the Sino-U.S. trade war and broader concerns about China's economy.
In commodities, oil prices rose, encouraged by a weaker dollar and evidence of strong U.S. fuel demand. U.S. crude rose 0.1 percent to $68.79 a barrel. Brent was last up 0.3 percent at $77.50. [O/R]
Gold was stronger with spot gold up 0.8 percent at $1,205.87 an ounce.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 06:13AM ET</span>",U.S. court cases aim to rein in age-discrimination hiring practices,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Dale Kleber is an experienced attorney, but when he spotted an ad back in 2014 for a corporate law position at a medical device and services company that specified “no more than seven years of experience,” he applied anyway.
At age 58, Kleber had extensive experience working for law firms, as an in-house general counsel and in general management jobs. But he had been out of work since the summer of 2011, when he lost his job as the CEO of a dairy industry trade association. 
Kleber’s search for senior-level general counsel positions had proved fruitless, so he widened his scope to include more junior positions. But his application for the position at CareFusion, a medical device/services company, had gone nowhere. CareFusion had not called him in for an interview for its senior counsel job, and it ultimately hired a 29-year-old candidate, according to the company's response to the original U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint that preceded the lawsuit.
Kleber, who lives in suburban Chicago, thought the seven-year cap on experience described in the job ad violated the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which protects the rights of workers aged 40 and older. “Very few attorneys are practicing law who have more than seven years and are not 40 years old, or older,” he said.
Kleber and his lawyers say his story underscores the difficulties older workers can face getting hired. In 2015 he brought a lawsuit against CareFusion. They hope the case, if successful, will expand legal protections against age discrimination in hiring.
The company that now owns CareFusion - Becton Dickinson and Co - denies that CareFusion discriminated against Kleber. “Fostering an inclusive and diverse culture is at the very heart of our core values,” said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company’s senior director of public relations. “BD is deeply committed to providing equal employment opportunities and a workplace free from discrimination.”
The Kleber case revolves around a legal concept known as “disparate impact,” which occurs when a policy appears to be nondiscriminatory, but still has a disproportionate impact on a class of people who enjoy protection under the law. Kleber’s claim is that the seven-year experience cap effectively weeded out all older applicants, making it a “disparate impact” claim.
OTHER CASES BEFORE THE COURTS 
The Kleber case is one of several lawsuits now working their way through the courts dealing with alleged age discrimination in hiring practices. One charges that companies discriminate against older workers through use of advertising that micro-targets only younger candidates. (https://reut.rs/2wnCSCI)
Disparate impact is the biggest legal challenge facing people trying to prove age discrimination in hiring, said Laurie McCann, senior attorney with the AARP Foundation, which is representing Kleber.
“Unlike cases of dismissal, the burden is that you’re on the outside looking in,"" she said. 
In the Kleber case, she added, “The ad doesn’t specifically say 'young people only,' but it has the effect of screening for age.”
The ADEA clearly covers employees claiming disparate impact, but the current legal battle focuses on whether it protects applicants as well. The question is important. A recent AARP survey found that more than 90 percent of U.S. workers see age discrimination as “somewhat or very common” in the workplace, and 44 percent of older job applicants say they have been asked (illegally) for age-related information from potential employers.
Kleber's resume includes a stint as general counsel for a Fortune 500 company, Dean Foods Co, consulting in the dairy industry, and serving as CEO of the American Dairy Products Institute. 
When Kleber lost his job at the trade association, he and his wife were still working to finish putting four children through college, and while the family was not facing a financial crisis, he did need an income. “I wanted to be able to meet our expenses and not invade our retirement accounts - we still had bills to pay.”

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares were buoyed on Thursday by gains among utility stocks although fresh losses in emerging markets and worries Washington will follow through on plans to levy an extra $200 billion of Chinese imports kept investors on the edge.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark hit its lowest level since early April in early trading but later turned slightly positive to trade up 0.1 percent by 0854 GMT.
""The turmoil within emerging markets also continues, widening from Argentina and Turkey, (is) dampening global sentiment even further all the while we await the U.S. decision on additional China import tariffs,"" Accendo Markets analyst Mike van Dulken said. 
A consultation period on the proposal to slap fresh tariffs on China ends on Thursday, paving the way for a decision, although it is unclear how quickly that will happen. 
Utilities were the strongest gainers with Italy's state-controlled  Enel  (MI:ENEI) rising 2.5 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to buy. Analysts at the U.S. bank said Enel has the capacity to buy back 10 billion euro worth of shares over the coming years. 
In Britain,  Centrica  (L:CNA) added 3.7 percent after the local regulator set an energy price cap that was at the lower range of analysts' expectations.
Top gainer on the STOXX was  Safran  (PA:SAF) which rose to a fresh record high after a strong update. 
The world's No. 3 aerospace supplier raised full-year forecasts following better-than-expected results in the first half on strong demand for spares and services.
Safran gained 6 percent, supporting other aerospace stocks including plane maker Airbus (PA:AIR), which rose 1.8 percent.
Among top fallers was Sodexo (PA:EXHO), down 5 percent, after the French food services and facilities management group unveiled a new strategic plan that failed to dispel concerns that the road to recovery would be long. 
Sodexo, whose shares been hit this year after warnings mostly related to weaknesses in the North American business, said it planned to deliver revenue growth above 3 percent by fiscal year 2019/20.
""Financial targets out to 2020 are relatively muted and would suggest it will take time for any material improvements to be delivered,"" RBC Capital Markets in a note.
 Weir Group  (L:WEIR) led fallers, down 6.3 percent after the maker of pipes for the energy and mining industries said there were initial signs of pricing pressure and flagged a softening in demand.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) and AMS (S:AMS) fell 2.5 and 1.5 percent respectively with traders citing disappointing August sales unveiled by Taiwanese peer Largan Precision (TW:3008).

(Reuters) - Overseas buying of Asian equities in August was the highest in seven months, but analysts doubt such inflows could be sustained if the Sino-U.S. trade dispute were to escalate, notwithstanding contagion from Argentina and other volatile emerging markets.
Foreign investors bought a net $2.42 billion of Asian stocks last month, their biggest monthly purchase since January, data from seven stock exchanges showed.
Foreign investments in Asian equities: https://reut.rs/2PCdT5P
South Korea's and Taiwan's equity markets led the region with inflows of $1.65 billion and $1.08 billion respectively, while Indian equities also received some inflows.
Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at trading and investments provider IG said the reversal of the strong dollar trend in the latter half of August prompted inflows last month.
""That being said, investors are likely cautious going into September with emerging market contagion concerns yet to blow over, while uncertainty remains with regards to U.S.-China trade tensions.""
China and the United States have applied tariffs to $50 billion of each other's goods and Trump could impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports after a public comment period on the new tariffs ends on Thursday, although when the duties would actually take effect is not known.
An escalating trade war would be expected to affect the regional trade, and in turn Asian companies' earnings prospects because they derive a major chunk of revenue from exports.
Economic meltdown in Argentina and Turkey and South Africa's recent fall into recession also deters investors from emerging market countries, especially those with high external deficits.
The Indian rupee has hit a record low this week and the Indonesian rupiah touched a 20-year trough following the falls in Argentina's peso and the Turkish lira.
""Effectively, we are in an environment where investors are very cautious towards any emerging markets running current account deficits. In Asia, India and Indonesia fit that bill,"" said Khoon Goh, ANZ's Singapore-based head of Asia research.
On Wednesday Indonesian stocks (JKSE) lost nearly 5 percent, the biggest fall in almost two years and authorities intervened ""decisively"" to support the currency and bond markets.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo blamed ""a barrage of external factors"" for the rupiah's fall to 20-year lows and said his priority was to increase investment and exports to contain the country's current account deficit.
ANZ's Goh expects the Indian and Indonesian markets to face more pressure this year, but is positive on South Korea and Taiwan because those countries run current account surpluses.
""Flows into Asia will still remain volatile for sometime,"" he said.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 12:52AM ET</span>","Starbucks' Italian dream comes true, but it is not cheap","By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, will realize its chairman's dream on Friday when it opens an upmarket roastery and cafe in Milan, but the test will be to convince coffee-obsessed Italians to pay more for their daily espresso.
The store will be the Seattle-based giant's first foray into the Italian market, the world's fourth-largest consumer of coffee, and comes 35 years after chairman emeritus Howard Schultz visited the country and was inspired to set up his own cafe chain.
The venue features a green industrial-scale roaster, marble counters, brass engravings - and a price that could make many Italians reluctant to make it their regular cafe.
At 1.80 euros ($2.09) for a simple espresso, Starbucks (O:SBUX) will charge nearly double what Italians pay at their local bars.
""The price reflects the premium experience we will offer customers,"" Starbucks Global President of Retail, John Culver, told Reuters as he showed media through the store, built inside an elegant, century-old palazzo which the company renovated.
""Once they enter the space our customers will understand exactly what that premium experience is going to be.""
Coffee chains are having to up their game as big money flocks to one of the few fast-growing areas of the drinks market. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) agreed to buy Costa, the world's second-biggest coffee chain, last week, while drinks group JAB snapped up Britain's Pret A Manger in May.
Schultz has said he was inspired to develop Starbucks, which now spans almost 29,000 stores worldwide, during a 1983 visit to Italy where he was struck by the rapport between baristas and their clients.
As in Seattle and in Shanghai, where Starbucks has opened its other two high-end Roasteries, the Milan store is designed as a playground for coffee drinkers, serving it in more than 100 different ways and showcasing the roasting and brewing process.
The 2,300-square-metre store will also offer cocktails, catering for the Italian evening tradition of aperitivo.
Starbucks said it would start rolling out regular cafes across Italy this year - a move that will bring it into closer competition with Italy's more than 57,000 cafes.
No other Western country has as many, according to market research provider Euromonitor International.
""The Starbucks model and the economic sustainability of their stores are built on a price of its flagship products - cappuccino, espresso, frappuccino - which is very far from the average price in the Italian bars,"" said Marco Eccheli, Director at consulting firm AlixPartners in Italy. 
Starbucks will find it hard to become an everyday choice for Italians, but is likely to attract customers looking for a more complete experience, particularly younger people, he said.
The U.S. group will open four traditional cafes in Milan with its local partner Antonio Percassi by the end of this year.
Federico Castelmare, 55, the barista of one cafe near the new Starbucks cafe said its higher price would not allow him to charge customers more. 
""I expect my clients to be faithful to me, but tourists will surely go to the roastery.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) said on Thursday it will invest more than $1 billion to build its first data centre in Asia in Singapore, slated to open in 2022. 
Facebook's facility will be located in the west of the island, near where Google (O:GOOGL) is expanding its Singapore data centres in an $850 million investment as mobile growth, e-commerce and cloud computing demand rise across the region.
""This will be our first data centre in Asia,"" Thomas Furlong, Facebook's vice president of infrastructure data centres, said at a press conference with local authorities in Singapore.
He said the facility was expected to open in 2022 depending on the speed of construction.

Details of the settlement talks could not be ascertained and could still change, the source said.
A settlement would potentially end the long-running saga over the future of CBS and Viacom, which owns the MTV cable network and Paramount studios.
CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves has been locked in a legal battle over control of CBS with National Amusements, the company's largest shareholder, owned by Shari Redstone and her father Sumner who also control media company Viacom (O:VIAB).
News of the settlement talks was first reported by Deadline Hollywood, a media industry website. 
The trial is scheduled to begin on October 3 in Delaware.
The Wall Street Journal reported that CBS, which owns the CBS television network and Showtime cable network, would agree to drop its attempt to strip voting control from National Amusements, CBS's majority shareholder.
Meanwhile, National Amusements would agree to abstain from pushing for a merger between CBS and Viacom, the Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
In April, before CBS sued National Amusements, Redstone's holding company had dropped support for a merger, according to legal filings. 
In July, in the midst of the fight, CBS said that it had hired outside counsel to investigate accusations of sexual misconduct against Moonves.

Moonves said at the time that he “may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances,” which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood “‘no’ means ‘no’” and never used his position to harm anyone’s career.

527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>","JPMorgan, BlackRock Warn Contagion Hitting Emerging Markets","(Bloomberg) -- First came the Argentine selloff. Then Turkey. And before long, assets from South Africa to Brazil and Indonesia were getting hit in a stampede of selling across emerging markets.
It’s a phenomenon that has a cadre of investors and strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). to BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). reaching for a single word: contagion.
The argument goes like this: while the asset class may offer value over the long haul, investors will sell relatively safe holdings to cover losses in more vulnerable markets or, worse, treat all emerging markets the same and sell indiscriminately. A herd mentality has taken over, meaning no matter what the relative risks and potential returns are in individual countries, investors who choose to buy run the risk of being trampled.
“We are having a confidence crisis in emerging markets, with some level of contagion being present,” said Pablo Goldberg, a money manager at BlackRock Inc. in New York. “With the short-term currency moves, it’s hard to jump in.”
Developing-nation currencies have slid to their weakest levels since May 2017, with the Argentine peso, Turkish lira and Indian rupee among those sinking to unprecedented lows in recent days, reinforcing the view that these aren’t merely idiosyncratic episodes. Indonesia’s rupiah hit its weakest since the Asian financial crisis two decades ago.
Global trade tension, a strengthening dollar and the prospect of more U.S. interest-rate increases led portfolio flows into emerging markets to slow to $2.2 billion last month from $13.7 billion in July, according to the Washington-based Institute of International Finance.
“That’s not a good story for emerging markets,” Anastasia Amoroso, a global investment strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank in New York, said on Bloomberg TV. “As long as trade wars are front and center and the Fed is hiking at a runaway pace versus the rest of the world, I think we are in an environment that argues for a stronger dollar.”
Buying Opportunity
Some investors have seen the selloff as an opportunity to buy on the basis of stronger fundamentals, such as easing inflation, trade surpluses and widening growth differentials between emerging and developed markets.
“One of the interesting things contagion sets up is a selloff in the weak and the strong,” said Arjun Jayaraman, who helps oversee $4.8 billion at Causeway Capital Management LLC in Los Angeles. “That’s when you have to step up and buy the strong currencies, the exporting, current-account surplus countries.”
Stocks from India, South Korea and Taiwan look attractive in this environment, according to Jayaraman. Amoroso said investors will eventually want to step into local debt, while Goldberg said he would prefer hard-currency sovereign debt if trade concerns ease.
One country proving resilient now was at the epicenter of the Asian crisis two decades ago -- read about that here.
Pressure on emerging markets will probably persist for now, with Turkey, Argentina, South Africa, Pakistan, Brazil and India among the weakest links, Wolfe Research strategists including Chris Senyek wrote in a note to clients. The New York-based firm said default probabilities in Asia, interbank lending markets in Europe and credit-default swap spreads from individual banks show some similarities with the 1997 emerging-market crisis, suggesting broader fragility in the asset class.
“Our EM ‘blow-up’ monitor suggests that weakness is spreading across the most vulnerable EM countries,” Senyek said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Tide Point Capital Management is shutting down due to the majority owner's personal wishes, the latest casualty in the $3 trillion industry which has faced increasing challenges in raising money and delivering top returns, two sources with knowledge of the move said on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the fund declined to comment.
Tide Point, based in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, was launched six years ago by hedge fund industry veteran Christopher Winham, who served as the fund's chief investment officer and is its majority owner. Most recently the firm managed roughly $800 million in assets, one of the sources said.
Winham has been speaking with investors this week to relay his decision to shutter the fund which he said is purely personal and driven by a desire to spend more time with his family, the sources said.
After nearly 25 years on Wall Street, where he worked at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund SAC Capital plus Diamondback Capital which was founded by SAC alumni, Winham told investors that the industry has changed dramatically over that time. 
His fund invested largely in industrials, basic materials and consumer cyclicals, according to regulatory filings, with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:JEC) ranking as the firm's biggest U.S. holding at the end of the second quarter.
Jacobs was a new position in the second quarter as was  FMC Corp  (NYSE:FMC) and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. Winham also cut his bet on burrito chain  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) by 22 percent during the quarter. The restaurant chain has enjoyed a stock rally after hiring a new chief executive officer in February.
Over the last few years, small- and medium-sized funds have found it tougher to raise fresh capital and stay in business. Many investors have tired of hedge funds' largely lackluster returns and high fees, moving money into less expensive index funds as the stock market marched higher over the last years.
The average global hedge fund returned 1.89 percent in the first eight months of the year, according to data from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). By comparison, the S&P 500 Index rose nearly 8 percent during that period.
During the first three months of 2018, 145 hedge funds went out of business compared with 158 that opened up for business, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.

(Reuters) - U.S. TV station owner  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) is kicking off a new round of talks to sell itself after its planned $3.9 billion sale to peer Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI) failed to get regulatory clearance, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Tribune terminated its deal with Sinclair last month, and filed a lawsuit arguing that the latter mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators. 
Tribune is working with financial advisers Moelis & Co (N:MC) and Guggenheim Securities LLC to field interest from potential buyers, including rival Nexstar Media Group Inc (O:NXST) and private equity firms, the sources. The discussions are at an early stage and no deal is certain, the sources added.
Tribune declined to comment, while representatives from Nexstar, Moelis and Guggenheim did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Tribune shares rose as much as 3 percent on the news and ended trading on Wednesday up 2.5 percent at $37.55, giving the company a market capitalization of $3.3 billion.
Based in Chicago, Tribune Media owns or operates 42 local television stations reaching approximately 50 million households. It also owns national entertainment cable network WGN America, whose reach is more than 77 million households, and a variety of digital applications and websites commanding 54 million monthly unique visitors online, according to its website.
The broadcast media sector has seen a flurry of merger talks amid expectations that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) could relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate. The FCC has yet to vote on the matter. 
Privately held Cox Enterprises Inc announced in July that it was exploring strategic options, including a potential sale, for the 14 broadcast TV stations it owns in cities such as Atlanta, Boston and Memphis. It has since hired two investment banks to handle the sale, sources have said.
Tribune Chief Executive Officer Peter Kern said on an earnings call last month that ""the environment remains welcoming and open to sensible consolidation.""
Tribune has filed a lawsuit against Sinclair seeking damages of at least $1 billion for what it called Sinclair's ""misconduct"" and ""willful breaches"" of the merger agreement. 
In its counterclaim in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Sinclair rejected Tribune's allegations and suggested the companies had been very close to winning U.S. Department of Justice approval. The deal was scuttled when the FCC took the unusual step of referring it to an administrative judge for review and questioned Sinclair's candor over the planned sale of some stations.
The FCC said Sinclair did not “fully disclose facts” relating to the planned sale of three stations, including pre-existing business relationships the company had with prospective buyers.
Tribune emerged from bankruptcy in late 2012 and completed a spinoff of its newspaper assets in 2014.

Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) approached Nexstar last summer to express interest in acquiring it, Reuters reported in July. Nexstar's focus, however, is on being an acquirer in light of Sinclair's torpedoed acquisition of Tribune, according to the sources.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:42PM ET</span>","Nasdaq falls as U.S. lawmakers grill Facebook, Twitter executives","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday, dented by technology stocks after  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) executives defended their companies before skeptical U.S. lawmakers.
Adding to pressure on technology stocks, the Justice Department later said it would meet with state attorneys general to discuss worries that social media platforms were ""intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas."" Facebook and Twitter were not specifically named.
Twitter shares dropped 6.1 percent. Facebook shares fell 2.3 percent, contributing heavily to both the Nasdaq's and the S&P 500's declines. The Dow, however, eked out a slight gain.
Shares of other tech companies, including Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL),  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), also fell. In the consumer discretionary sector, investors also sold off shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), two members of the group of stocks known as FANG.
Tech and consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest weights on the S&P 500. The S&P 500 technology index fell 1.5 percent, and the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell 1.1 percent.
""Because these companies have become so prominent, they're attracting scrutiny on the part of regulators and legislators,"" said John Carey, managing director at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""They remain market leaders, but there are potential risks.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 22.51 points, or 0.09 percent, to 25,974.99, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 8.12 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,888.6 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 96.07 points, or 1.19 percent, to 7,995.17.
Energy stocks added to the S&P 500's losses.
 Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) fell nearly 6.0 percent after the oilfield services provider warned third-quarter earnings could be hurt from moderating activity in the Permian Basin and a slower-than-expected ramp-up of new Middle East contracts.
Rival Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) dropped 1.5 percent and Baker Hughes (N:BHGE), the oilfield services arm of  General Electric  (N:GE), fell 2.2 percent.
With concerns over trade simmering, Commerce Department data showed that the U.S. trade deficit hit a five-month high in July, which economists said could heighten the White House's resolve to aggressively pursue an ""America First"" approach to trade.
The data comes amid concerns that a U.S. proposal to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports could go into effect soon after a public comment period ends on Thursday, even as the U.S.-Canada talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement continue.
China's JD.com Inc (O:JD) slid 10.6 percent, down for the second day in a row, after police said the retailer's Chief Executive Officer Richard Liu was arrested in Minneapolis last week after a rape allegation. Liu has denied any wrongdoing and was released on Saturday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.30-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 51 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.03 billion shares, compared to the 6.15 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>","Roy Moore sues Sacha Baron Cohen, Showtime, CBS in $95 million defamation case","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Roy Moore, the former U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama, on Wednesday filed a $95 million defamation lawsuit against Sacha Baron Cohen, claiming he was duped into appearing on the British comedian's Showtime series ""Who Is America?"" and falsely portrayed as a sex offender.
Moore, a Republican and former chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court, also sued Showtime and its parent CBS Corp (N:CBS) for defamation, and accused all three defendants of fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Baron Cohen's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Showtime spokeswoman said the network does not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit arose from a July 29 broadcast where Baron Cohen, disguised as fictional Israeli anti-terrorism expert Erran Morad, interviewed Moore and demonstrated a supposed ""pedophile detector"" that beeped when waved near him.
Moore, 71, whose wife Kayla is also a plaintiff, said he had been lured to Washington, D.C. on the pretense he would receive an award for his support of Israel, and would not have met Baron Cohen had he known what was planned.
After the beep, he told Baron Cohen: ""I support Israel. I don't support this kind of stuff,"" and walked out.
""This false and fraudulent portrayal and mocking of Judge Moore as a sex offender ... has severely harmed Judge Moore's reputation and caused him, Mrs. Moore, and his entire family severe emotional distress, as well as caused and will cause plaintiffs financial damage,"" the complaint said.
Running in heavily Republican Alabama, Moore lost his Senate race last December to Democrat Doug Jones after being accused of sexual misconduct toward female teenagers while in his 30s. Moore has denied wrongdoing.
The lawsuit was filed in the Washington, D.C. federal court.
Larry Klayman, a conservative lawyer representing Moore, in a statement called his client ""a man of great faith, morality and intellect,"" and said the defendants will be held legally accountable for Baron Cohen's conduct.
Baron Cohen, 46, is known for portraying characters like Ali G, Bruno and Borat Sagdiyev whose interactions with people, who do not realize they are serving as foils, often result in their revealing more of themselves than they realize.

His sketches have gotten him in legal hot water before, including when two former college fraternity students claimed they were duped while drunk into appearing in his 2006 film ""Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."" That case was dismissed in 2007.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Tesla bond hits record low, stock slips as investor worry deepens","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla's (O:TSLA) stock and bond prices dropped on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk renewed an attack on a British caver whom he had previously insulted on social media and a day after Mercedes unveiled a challenge to the electric car maker. 
The stock dropped 2.8 percent to $280.74, the lowest level since late May, following a 4.2 percent decline on Tuesday after Mercedes introduced its first fully electric car in Stockholm.
The $1.8 billion high-yield bond Tesla issued a year ago hit a record low price on Wednesday. It also became more expensive to insure Tesla's bonds against default. 
Tesla's stock has lost a quarter of its value since Aug. 7, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding for a previously undisclosed plan to take Tesla private.
Musk on Aug. 24 abandoned that plan, but he faces lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of his tweet that funding for the deal was “secured.” The incident is weighing on investor confidence and has hurt the credibility of Musk, long viewed by Tesla supporters as its most valuable asset.
Also raising concerns about Musk's leadership and focus as Tesla struggles to increase production of its Model 3 mass market sedan, BuzzFeed News reported late on Tuesday that Musk, in an email to the news site, called British cave diver Vernon Unsworth a “child rapist.” 
Musk in July apologized to Unsworth for similar insults he made on Twitter following the rescue of a dozen Thai schoolboys and their football coach from a cave in Thailand. Unsworth, who played a leading role in the rescue, drew Musk's wrath when he said that a mini-submarine created by Musk's rocket company SpaceX to help in the rescue ""had absolutely no chance of working.""
BuzzFeed reported that Unsworth, through his attorney, denied Musk's accusations, and that it found no evidence to substantiate Musk's claim. Tesla did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment. Reuters was unable to verify the emails reported in the BuzzFeed article. 
“Elon Musk’s ongoing campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr. Unsworth is outrageous,"" Unsworth's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, said in an email to Reuters.
""Musk has publicly and clearly stated that he ‘hopes’ to be sued. Let me be equally clear in response - Musk will be sued - not because of his hopes, but because he deserves to be sued,” Wood said.
Previous attacks by Musk against Unsworth on Twitter, and his surprise announcement about taking Tesla private, have led to concerns about Musk's judgment and the ability of Tesla's board to influence his behavior.
""He should not tweet about things outside of car production and the auto industry,"" said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth, who has a ""neutral"" rating on Tesla. ""The board, even though it is friendly to him, has now been put in a position where the internal governance of the company has been questioned.""
Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash as it has aggressively ramped up production of the Model 3, a process Musk has called ""production hell."" Tesla bulls are counting on Musk to exponentially raise production, leading to long-term profits.
But the company has repeatedly missed production targets.
Marking the start of a German onslaught against the U.S. car maker, Mercedes on Tuesday showcased a SUV with a 450-kilometer (280-mile) range that it hopes will appeal to luxury customers and tech-savvy millennials alike. That range compares with the 295-mile range of Tesla's Model X SUV.
Falling prices for Tesla's bonds on Wednesday showed deepening concerns about the company's dwindling cash pile. Its $1.8 billion junk bond maturing in August 2025 <88160RAE1=> dropped more than a point in price to a record low 85.75 cents on the dollar. 
Tesla is rated “B-minus“ by Standard & Poor’s and “B3” by Moody’s Investors Service, six notches into junk bond territory and just one notch above the “C” area typically assigned to distressed issuers. The outlook from both agencies is negative.

The cost to insure Tesla debt against default has been rising, and its five-year credit default swaps  hit a one-month high, according to Markit. Combined with an upfront payment of 17.2 percent of the bond’s insured value, it would cost an investor around $230,000 to insure $1 million of Tesla debt for a year, up from less than $200,000 two weeks ago, when Musk was still exploring a possible purchase of the company.

536,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Employment Numbers Roll In
The economic calendar is packed tomorrow, with a healthy dose of numbers on jobs ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
The ADP private sector job creation numbers come out at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), with economists predicting that nonfarm payrolls fell to 188,000 in August from 219,000 in July.
At 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), the government will report the latest figures on initial jobless claims for last week. Claims are expected to stay about the same as the week before.
Before these numbers, employment services firm Challenger reports its monthly numbers on layoffs at 7:30 AM ET (11:30 GMT).
For Friday’s big number, the consensus forecast is for the creation of 191,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.9%.
After the start of trading, the Institute of Supply Management releases its measure of services activity for August at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Economists expect that the ISM non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) rose to 57 last month from 55.7 the month before.
At the same time there will be figures on the July factory orders.
2. U.S.-China Trade Battle Set to Escalate
Trade continues to weigh on Wall Street and lately there are few signs the pressure will lift.
There was no information on restarted talks between the U.S. and Canada for the market to trade on today. And President Donald Trump’s tweets focused mainly on Bob Woodward’s book about the presidency.
Investors will be waiting tomorrow to see if, as expected, Trump slaps tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China, which would ratchet up the trade dispute with Beijing.
Data recently showed that business activity in China slowed in August, indicating that the trade dispute with the U.S. is hitting demand.
3. Barnes & Noble Reports; GameStop Issues Results Amid Takeover Talk
There are still some earnings reports for investors to trade on this week.
Ahead of trading, Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS) is expected to report another quarterly loss on sales of about $831 million.
After the bell, videogame retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), which soared about 16% today on reports that the company could be bought out by a private equity firm, issues its latest numbers.
Wall Street is forecasting a drop in profit to 7 cents per share on sales of about $1.6 billion.
Also, optical components company Finisar (NASDAQ:FNSR) will report. Shares sank sharply on Tuesday ahead of earnings and have been yo-yoing along with other telecoms in August.
On average, analysts expect that Finisar earned 12 cents a shares in the latest quarter on revenue of about $316 million.
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) also weighs in after trading."
537,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Closes Lower on Fears Tech Set for Regulatory Spotlight,"Investing.com - The S&P closed lower Wednesday as tech stocks slumped after U.S. lawmakers touted a tougher stance on regulating social media companies, which could hurt profits, while concerns over trade also weighed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.09%. The S&P 500 fell 0.28%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 1.19%.
A sea of red washed over tech stocks on Wednesday, weighing on the broader market, as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testified before Congress about their efforts to prevent abuse and protect privacy on their platforms.
Both Sandberg and Dorsey defended their efforts in preventing abuse of their platforms and conceded that they have since stepped up efforts to stop online election meddling following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Still, lawmakers appear to be leaning toward the need for further regulatory scrutiny on tech companies. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general later this month to express concerns that tech companies may be hurting competition and limiting free exchange of ideas on their platforms.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-Parent (NASDAQ:Alphabet) stocks, part of the so-called FANGs, led the tech retreat. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) dropped 6%.
Beyond the tech turmoil, trade concerns remained front and center, as the United States and Canada resumed talks to reach an agreement on a revamp of NAFTA.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland described the talks as ""constructive"" and ""positive,"" insisting there was ""good faith and good will on both sides,"" as talks are set to continue.
The positive slant on U.S.-Canada trade talks comes as investors fret about the prospect of a ramp-up in the U.S.-China trade war.
The Trump administration could impose a 25% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imported goods after the comment period expires on Thursday.
Those fears, however, had little sway on trade-sensitive names like Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), as they ended the day above the flatline.
Energy, meanwhile, was roughly unchanged, sidestepping a plunge in oil prices as investors cut bets on storm Gordon disrupting oil supplies after it weakened and did not hit the oil-rich U.S. gulf region.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell $1.15 to settle at $68.42 a barrel.
There was little on the economic news front to help turn sentiment on stocks as data showed the U.S. trade deficit posted its biggest monthly increase in almost three-and-a-half years in July.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ten people aboard an Emirates flight from Dubai were taken to New York hospitals with a mystery ailment on Wednesday after scores of passengers and crew complained of feeling sick during the 14-hour overnight flight from the Middle East.
The nature of the illness was not immediately confirmed, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement that symptoms included fever and coughing. 
The airliner, with at least 521 passengers, landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport at around 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) and was immediately surrounded by dozens of ambulances and other emergency vehicles as anxious passengers waited to be evaluated by health officials.
Eventually, the airline and the New York mayor's office said a total of 19 people were confirmed ill. Three passengers and seven crew members went to the hospital, Dubai-based Emirates said. 
""Nine passengers underwent additional medical screening at the site near the aircraft and were released afterwards,"" said an Emirates spokeswoman. ""The rest of the passengers were allowed to leave and clear customs.""
The CDC said in its statement that as many as 100 passengers and crew members reported feeling sick during the flight from Dubai. There was no immediate explanation by the CDC for the discrepancy between the number of people initially reported as feeling sick and the much-smaller number of confirmed cases.
The plane - a double-deck Airbus 380 - was taken to a location away from the terminal so emergency officials could evaluate the situation, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials said in a statement. The A380 is the world's largest passenger aircraft. 
The White House was monitoring the situation, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, and President Donald Trump was being updated as new information became available. 
Diala Makki was traveling first-class on Flight 203 en route to New York Fashion Week when she learned from flight crew that a number of people had become sick onboard and passengers were to be detained until officials made checks. 
""The Emirates cabin crew were super helpful, they were not in panic mode, which was amazing,"" Makki, a 36-year-old television host from Dubai, said outside the airport. ""Then we got the American officials check every one of us until we got out. They dealt with it really well.""

544,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:06PM ET</span>","Uber 'on track' for IPO in 2019, no plans to sell tech unit: CEO","By David Shepardson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc is on track to go public next year and has no plans to sell its self-driving car research arm, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.
The ride-hailing company will not sell its Advanced Technologies Group ""at this time,"" he told Reuters in an interview after a media event to unveil changes to improve the safety of drivers and riders.
""Ultimately, it is a big asset that we are building and we can monetize that in whatever way we want to. It's not something we're thinking about it at this point,"" he added.
Uber is ""quite optimistic"" it can resume testing of self-driving cars later this year after a fatal crash involving an autonomous Uber car in Tempe, Arizona in March, Khosrowshahi said. Federal regulators are investigating the crash.
Advanced Technologies Group will ""absolutely"" be a part of Uber after the initial public offering, but it will also partner with other companies that are building self-driving technology, he added. ""We want to get the technology ready for prime time as soon as possible,"" he said.
Last month, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it would invest $500 million in Uber to jointly develop self-driving cars. ""We are incredibly happy to start with Toyota but it's not going to end there,"" he said.
Reuters reported in July that Uber was being probed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for alleged gender discrimination on issues such as pay.
In August 2017, Uber said it was cooperating with a preliminary investigation led by the U.S. Department of Justice into possible violations of bribery laws. Reuters reported in 2017 the Justice Department had begun a criminal probe into Uber's use of a software tool that helped its drivers evade local transportation regulators.
Khosrowshahi said Uber is ""in process of working with a number of authorities to resolve these investigations"" but he did not think resolving those probes would be a factor in the IPO's timing.
Uber is preparing to address the ""systems"" requirements of a publicly traded company, Khosrowshahi said. ""The growth rates for a company our size are unrivaled. Right now, we're on track for an IPO next year, market conditions permitting.""
Khosrowshahi, who has led the company for a year, said he was not concerned if rival ride-hailing firm Lyft went public first because he expected enough demand for both companies.
""Historically, there has been plenty of funding for Uber, for Lyft, etc. and we don't think that's going to change,"" he said. ""This is an enormous market we are going after.""
Khosrowshahi unveiled new efforts to ensure the safety of U.S. drivers and passengers by using software to detect unusual events including crashes.
He said Uber would use software to flag atypcal rides and would contact drivers and riders in the event of a possible crash in what it calls ""Ride Check."" The feature could be prompted by a long unexpected stop during a trip.
Uber also plans to use sensors on the driver's phone to analyze acceleration data and other factors to detect probable crashes.

Uber will protect riders' information by concealing specific pickup and dropoff addresses in a driver's trip history, the company added.

545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>",Little Relief in Sight as Emerging Stocks Slide Near Bear Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The rout in emerging markets showed few signs of abating, even as some of the worst-hit currencies took a breather, as an index of stocks slipped toward bear territory and a basket of currencies traded near its lowest since May 2017.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of shares extended its slide to 19.7 percent from a January peak. Among the worst-hit stock markets were Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, where benchmark indexes tumbled by the most in about two years. The Argentina peso and Turkish lira, which have led global losses this year, eked out gains as the nations took measures to curb the damage.
The declines added to concern that investor anxiety is beginning to infect markets whose economies are more robust than others. The negative tone was set Tuesday by a U.S. manufacturing report that boosted the odds of further Federal Reserve rate increases and a strengthening dollar, and South African data showing the economy entered into a recession in the second quarter.
It’s “no longer just about EM fundamentals,” Sameer Goel, the head of macro strategy for Asia at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in Singapore, said in a Bloomberg TV interview with David Ingles. It’s “increasingly about contagion, which largely happens because of cross-holdings and the pressure of redemptions.”

546,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 02:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Dalian Wanda seeks to reduce AMC stake - sources,"By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin's real estate-to-media conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group is exploring a deal to cut its stake in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (N:AMC), the world's largest cinema operator, people familiar with the matter said.
The move is the latest sign of how Wanda, like many of its Chinese peers, is under pressure from the country's regulators to reduce overseas holdings after embarking on a major acquisition spree in the United States and Europe. 
Wanda is exploring a deal in which AMC would borrow hundreds of millions of dollars through a convertible bond, and then use that money to buy back some of Wanda's 60 percent stake, the sources said on Wednesday. Wanda controls AMC though its ownership of Class B shares, and aims to retain control after any deal, the sources added.
Private equity firms, including Silver Lake Partners and Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO), are in talks with AMC about making the debt investment, the sources said. They could obtain board representation at AMC as part of any deal, the sources added.
The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Wanda and AMC representatives could not be immediately reached for comment. Silver Lake and Apollo declined to comment.
AMC shares fell from their highest level this year following the news, dropping as much as 3 percent and trading down 1 percent at $19.05 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.4 billion.
Based in Leawood, Kansas, AMC has more than 1,000 movie theaters globally. Wanda acquired a majority stake in AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, in what was then the largest overseas acquisition by a privately held Chinese company and Wanda's first foray into the United States and Canada.
In 2017, Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funding to companies such as Wanda, HNA Group Co Ltd [HNAIRC.UL] and Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL] for overseas acquisitions, amid concerns over financial overstretching. 
Wanda also owns Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment but had scrapped a $1 billion deal to buy television producer Dick Clark Productions last year. It has already sold several other overseas assets, including property developments in the UK and Australia and a stake in Spanish football team Atletico Madrid.

Silver Lake does not have any other movie theater investments, but it owns talent agency WME IMG and was the lead investor in a $4 billion deal to buy mixed martial arts promoter UFC in 2016. AMC was partly owned by Apollo when it sold to Wanda for $2.6 billion in 2012.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 12:38PM ET</span>",AIG CEO sees 'huge potential' in investor market for insurance risk,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said on Wednesday he sees ""huge potential"" within the insurer's portfolio for use of a market in which investors trade assets tied to insurance liabilities.
The insurance linked securities (ILS) market, which developed over the past couple of decades as a way for insurers to pass on to investors some of their risks, mainly those associated with natural disasters, is a ""good tool,"" Duperreault said at an insurance conference sponsored by investment bank KBW, a unit of  Stifel Financial Corp  (N:SF). 
""I think you’re going to see more of it, not less of it"" within AIG, Duperreault said.
Insurance companies that participate in the market typically issue catastrophe bonds, or CAT bonds. If no catastrophe hits, the bonds pay out a percentage of the premiums by way of coupons. But if a disaster does occur, the insurance company can use the funds to pay claims to its policy holders.
AIG's acquisition of Bermuda-based Validus Holdings Ltd, which was finalized in July, included Validus' AlphaCat unit, an investment adviser that manages capital for investors and AIG through insurance-linked securities and other investments.

The insurance-linked securities market gives insurers another way for their underwriters to match risks they take on with sources of capital to cover potential claims, Duperreault said.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 12:33PM ET</span>",Investors back off U.S. stock funds for first time in three weeks: ICI,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors spooked by trade-war fears took a cautious stance, pulling cash from U.S.-based stock funds for the first time in three weeks, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) said on Wednesday.
Markets face the prospect of a trade war that threatens to spoil global economic growth. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled little sign of deviating from hiking U.S. interest rates, giving safe U.S. bonds more attractive yields and attracting money from abroad.
Trade conflict, rate hikes and eroding investor sentiment have conspired to push the dollar higher, pressuring developing markets that need to repay debts with greenbacks that are harder to come by.
U.S. equity mutual funds reported an elevated $8.1 billion in withdrawals during the week ended Aug. 29, nearly offset by $7.4 billion reeled in by stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the trade group's data showed. Together, the funds reported net withdrawals of $684 million.
ETFs are heavily trafficked by quick-trading investors while mutual funds are more exclusively used by long-term retail investors.
During the week, traders took solace from a U.S.-Mexico agreement on trade and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying there was reason for caution about hiking rates too aggressively.
Yet three years after economic concerns in China convulsed assets worldwide in 2015, long-term investors are again wrestling with the prospect that an emerging market crisis could shake up sanguine markets. MSCI's broad emerging markets index is down more than 10 percent, including dividends, this year.
""It is often said that the market climbs a wall of worry, and the next 12-18 months should provide plenty to fret about ... trade concerns, mid-term elections, inverting yield curve, rising inflation, tighter monetary conditions and decelerating (earnings per share),"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub in a note on Wednesday. 
""We believe the market's path will be determined by something much simpler ... the health and longevity of the business cycle.""
In the meantime, investors seem content to hunker down in debt funds despite many such funds posting negative returns in 2018 as rising rates pushed bond prices lower. U.S.-based bond funds attracted $4.4 billion during the latest week, marking a 28th straight week of positive sales, ICI said.

Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in his prepared remarks that a ""relatively small number of bad-faith actors were able to game Twitter to have an outsized impact.""
Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the company was too slow to respond to Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election and general American political discourse, but insisted it is doing better.

Prior to the hearing, President Donald Trump in an interview with the Daily Caller accused social media companies of interfering in the U.S. mid-term elections in November, without appearing to offer any evidence.

Trump, without offering evidence, said in a post on Twitter that the sportswear company was ""getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts."" He also continued to blast National Football League players for their protests over racial and social injustice.
Representatives for Nike could not be immediately reached for comment on Trump's tweet. Shares of the company were up less than one percent in midmorning trade on Wednesday; the stock had dropped nearly 4 percent at one point on Tuesday.
The footwear and apparel maker's campaign this week further stoked a national debate over social justice that Kaepernick and other NFL players sparked with their protests aimed at addressing police brutality against minorities, racial injustice, and reforming the criminal justice system.
Trump has embraced the issue as a political cause, frequently criticizing players for taking a knee at games and questioning their patriotism. Critics have defended their protests as a fundamental American right to free speech.
On Tuesday, he criticized Nike's decision but also appeared to defend the right for such movements.
Marketing experts predicted that the brand recognition sparked by the ads would be successful in the long run, despite current calls for boycotts on social media.
NFL players and the league are continuing to negotiate over the issue of protests.

LONDON (Reuters) - British asset manager  Schroders  (L:SDR) expressed interest in buying CarVal Investors in May but the hedge fund that is owned by U.S. agri group Cargill said it was not for sale, a CarVal executive said.
CarVal, with $11.6 billion under management placing it in the top 2 percent of global hedge funds, would have been a major acquisition for Schroders as it expands its product range.
""Schroders ... said they would be interested in looking at ways we could work together,"" CarVal Managing Principal Lucas Detor told Reuters. ""They asked if we were for sale, we said no."" 
""We have been very clear with every person we have spoken to that CarVal is not for sale. We've been approached by numerous different asset managers of large size over the last 24 months.""
Schroders, a FTSE 100 company with 449 billion pounds ($576 billion) in assets under management and administration at end-June, declined to comment.
Two sources familiar with the matter valued CarVal at about $200 million. Detor said that was not ""a fair approximation"".
Privately-owned Cargill tried to sell the hedge fund business two years ago. But two potential deals fell through. Shortly after that CarVal's president at the time, John Brice, was replaced by Detor and two other managing principals.
Schroders has bought several so-called 'alternatives' businesses in recent years, including real estate and private equity to diversify its products and geographic reach.
Hedge fund acquisitions are rare, with just one deal so far in 2018 and one in 2017, Dealogic data showed. But other major agri business firms have exited their hedge funds.
Louis Dreyfus Company, one of the world's top four agri business firms with Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland (N:ADM) and  Bunge  (N:BG), wound down its commodity fund manager Edesia Asset Management last year. 
""I see the Cargills, Bunges and others starting to take action and going back to basics to what they traditionally have done and not get too fancy,"" said Jay O'Neil, senior agricultural economist with Kansas State University.
Cargill closed another hedge fund in 2015 but Detor said he had no indication it wanted to sell CarVal, saying the parent firm had ""been very supportive of our team and our initiatives.""
Cargill has cut costs, shed assets and overhauled its management as global supplies of commodity grains soared and profit margins in the trading business have tightened. 
CarVal runs approximately 20 funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds.

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) is testing whether independent drivers could deliver its groceries as the retailer races to meet its goal of offering home delivery to more than 100 U.S. cities by the end of the year.
The pilot program called Spark Delivery is similar to Amazon Flex, a service from rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) where a fleet of drivers use their own cars to make fast deliveries. 
Walmart's Spark Delivery is a crowdsourced platform, which works with independent drivers who partner with Delivery Drivers Inc, a separate firm that manages such workers.
The initiative is Walmart's latest attempt to tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called ""last mile"" of delivering goods to online customers. Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years.
Walmart is the largest U.S. seller of groceries and its aggressive expansion into home delivery follows Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, which spurred several traditional retailers to push such services fearing increased competition in the sector.
Walmart has so far had mixed success with its various delivery initiatives. Reuters was first to report the end of Walmart's delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft and how in a separate trial the retailer struggled to get its own employees to deliver groceries to customers' homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours.
In March, Walmart said it will offer home delivery of groceries to 100 U.S. cities covering 40 percent of U.S. households by the end of 2018 and has since tied up with several small delivery companies like Doordash and Postmates, who offer gig-style jobs to workers, to meet its goal.
As of Wednesday, Walmart said its grocery home delivery service is available in nearly 50 markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Miami and Seattle.
The company said its work with third-party delivery providers will continue to be a leading part of its delivery strategy even as it runs this pilot. 
""Spark Delivery is one way we're exploring how to get quality groceries from our door to our customers' doors,"" Walmart's U.S. CEO Greg Foran said in a statement. 
Spark uses Walmart's in-house platform to allow drivers to sign up for time slots that work best with their schedules and offers navigation assistance among other services.
Walmart said its partner Delivery Drivers will handle recruiting, screening, background checks, payment and accounting, among other services for drivers.
A Walmart spokeswoman told Reuters, drivers will earn a fee on each delivery along with the gratuity they receive from customers. Dependent upon the number of orders delivered, driver's pay can exceed $20 an hour, she said.
Rival Amazon Flex pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs are borne by the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website.

Spark Delivery is currently being tested in Nashville and New Orleans with plans to roll out to a few more metro areas this year, Walmart said without offering more details.

West Texas Crude oil futures slumped 1.56% to $68.78 a barrel as of 10:42 AM ET (14:42 GMT). Meanwhile Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., decreased 1.25% to $77.19.
The anticipated storm had driven prices higher on Tuesday after oil companies shut down dozens of oil rigs in anticipation of Tropical Storm Gordon. The storm was expected to strengthen into a hurricane, but weakened after making landfall and deviated away from oil-producing areas.
Oil prices have been driven higher in the past few months as demand for oil outsrips supply and upcoming U.S. sanctions against Iran have also supported price increases. The financial sanctions against Iran will target the petroleum sector in November, when a global drop of crude supply is expected. Data on oil rigs last week also supported prices, as drillers added oil rigs for the first time in three weeks, increasing the rig count by 2 to 862, according to weekly data from Baker Hughes.
Investors are also looking ahead to weekly inventories data, with analysts expecting a drop of 1.9 million barrels last week.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its supply reportat 4:30 PM ET (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday, a day later than usual because of the Labor Day holiday on Monday. Crude oil inventories are expected to come out on Thursday.

They're trading at their lowest level since February 2017.
Liu, CEO of the second-largest Chinese e-commerce company after  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), was detained in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he spent last week as a Ph.D. student in a business administration program at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management.
 Hennepin County Sheriff jail records show that he was arrested at 11:32 pm CT on Friday and released at 4:05 p.m. CT on Saturday, without requiring bail.
Liu faces a first-degree felony if he is charged with the crime,  according to the Associated Press and the South China Morning Post, citing police records that are not public at the moment. The Minneapolis police department declined to give further details of the case and circumstances of the arrest ""because this is an active criminal investigation.""
First-degree rape is the most-severe charge of sexual assault under Minnesota law. If charged and convicted, Liu could be sentenced to 30 years in prison.
JD.com told Business Insider on Sunday that Liu has been falsely accused, and that it ""will take the necessary legal action against false reporting or rumors."" On Monday evening local time, the company said in a statement on the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo that Liu has ""returned to China to continue work as normal."" 
Liu appeared at an event in Beijing on Tuesday for JD.com, and his attorney, Earl Gray, an attorney for Liu, doesn't expect Liu to face charges.
""There is no believable or credible evidence that he has done anything wrong and he denies any wrongdoing,"" Gray said,  according to the The Wall Street Journal.
The 45-year-old, also known as Richard Liu, has a net worth of $10.8 billion and was listed as the 16th-richest person in China and the 140th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes.
Liu is married to Zhang Zetian, who at 24 is China's youngest female billionaire. Zhang has a sobriquet ""Sister Milk Tea"" as she shot to fame after a photo of her holding a cup of milk tea went viral on Chinese social media. The couple married in 2015 and have one daughter together.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Tuesday reiterated its skepticism,  saying that a double-whammy of increased competition and ending tax credits could be a problem for Tesla. 
""Tesla is losing the US tax credit ahead of competition, posing further challenges to affordability at a time when competition is intensifying,"" Tamberrino said in a note to clients Tuesday, re-instating his sell-rating after briefly suspending coverage.
""This comes as we still believe the higher up-front costs of EVs require an equalizer to match internal combustion engine (ICE) as the current price differentials (approximately $8k on a like-for-like basis comparing just propulsion costs) to ICE vehicles still put EVs out of the mainstream.""
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also warned in a separate note Tuesday that Tesla's autonomous ride sharing program could be worth a tiny fraction of Waymo's — a major blow to the program that is widely seen as Tesla's long-term goal. 
Together, the two sell-ratings helped bring down Wall Street’s average target price for shares of Tesla to $328 — 15% above where shares were set to open Wednesday.
Away from Wall Street, Musk re-instated his attacks against a British cave diver who helped rescue a boys soccer team from a Thailand cave. In an email to a Buzzfeed reporter, the billionaire told the journalist that he hopes the diver, Vernon Unsworth, sues him.
""I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,""  Musk wrote in the email, according to BuzzFeed News. ""He's an old, single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time,"" the email continued.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>",Steinhoff's former CEO says not aware of accounting irregularities,"By Tiisetso Motsoeneng
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Steinhoff's (J:SNHJ) former chief executive Markus Jooste was not aware of any accounting irregularities when he left the retailer in December, he told a South African parliamentary inquiry on Wednesday which is examining an accounting scandal that rocked the company.
Jooste, who is also under fraud investigation by South African police, resigned in December after the company uncovered accounting irregularities.
The scandal hit Steinhoff's shares and left the company scrambling for working capital.
Jooste was instrumental in transforming Steinhoff from a small Johannesburg furniture outfit into multinational retailer with more than 40 retail brands including Conforama in France, Poundland in the UK and Mattress Firm in the United States.
In his first public testimony about the scandal, Jooste said he never lied about activities of the company and neither sold his shares in Steinhoff nor held a short position on its stock.
He told the parliamentary inquiry that he lost 3 billion rand ($193 million) due to the fall in the company's shares after the scandal was uncovered.
""I must place on record that when I left Steinhoff on the 4th of December, I was not aware of any accounting irregularities they are referring to,"" Jooste said.
""I don't blame anybody for what happened at Steinhoff.""
Steinhoff's battered shares rose at much as 5 percent as Jooste gave his testimony to the parliamentary committee. It traded 3.82 percent higher at 2.72 rand by 1236 GMT.
In July, creditors agreed to hold debt claims for three years, removing a imminent threat of default that would have tipped the company into bankruptcy.
Steinhoff's chairwoman Heather Sonn a week ago told the parliamentary committee that its board would meet to discuss asset sales to boost cash flow and pay down debt, months after creditors of the South African retailer threw it a lifeline.
On Tuesday, Steinhoff said a subsidiary had agreed to sell a 50 percent stake and related properties in German furniture chain POCO to Austrian businessman Andreas Seifert for 271 million euros ($313 million).
Steinhoff last week reported a 2 percent rise in sales to 12.9 billion euros ($15 billion) for the nine months to June 30 helped by a strong showing at its listed African unit Pepkor (J:PPHJ). 
Jooste said his main mistake during his tenure was agreeing to a joint venture with Seifert, adding that Steinhoff probably grew too quickly.
SWIFT ACTION
After the hearing ended, Yunus Carrim, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, the parliamentary committee hearing Jooste's testimony, said its members felt that the former Steinhoff CEO could have been more forthcoming.
""His account to parliament reinforces our call that the regulatory bodies and other state agencies should act swiftly and more decisively,"" Carrim said.
Carrim said the committee recognized the complex and global nature of corporate scandals such as Steinhoff’s and the huge amount of forensic and other investigative work needed to establish exactly what happened, but he said there should have been more progress 10 months after the Steinhoff scandal was uncovered.
""More can and needs to be done,"" said Carrim.
He also said the panel wanted to see more cooperation between the relevant state agencies in South Africa and Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer (DE:BAYGN) cut its earnings forecast on Wednesday due to delays to its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), and said sales of its consumer care products fell, hitting its shares, already reeling from a legal battle over the weed killer Roundup. 
The weaker earnings forecast adds to a number of challenges facing the German drugmaker as it braces for years of legal wrangling over the alleged cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers. 
Bayer said the number of plaintiffs seeking damages over Monsanto's Roundup and Ranger Pro herbicides had risen to 8,700 from 8,000 from last month, and said that it expected more to sue. It has vowed to defend itself in court, citing regulators and studies as saying the products are safe. 
The inventor of aspirin and the maker of Yasmin birth control pills is struggling to stem falling sales at its consumer health arm as U.S. consumers switch from drugstores to online shops, and it faces increasing pressure to strengthen its pharmaceutical division after a string of setbacks. 
The company lowered its forecast for adjusted core earnings per share for the year to 5.70 - 5.90 euros, down from 6.64 in 2017, short of analyst expectations, dragging the stock down as much as 3.7 percent in morning trade.
The shares were down 1 percent at 1030 GMT, leading to a loss of about 16 percent since a U.S. jury's verdict on Aug. 10 for Monsanto to pay close to $300 million in damages in the first of thousands of lawsuits over alleged links between the Roundup weedkiller and cancer.

Second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for one-off items, rose to 2.34 billion euros ($2.71 billion), the company said on Wednesday, below an average estimate for 2.44 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. The company blamed delays to the closure of its mammoth acquisition of Monsanto, which meant it missed out on a typically stronger first-half than the second for the seeds maker it agreed to buy in 2016.
""It is clear that analysts have not appreciated the extent of this phasing deviation,"" said analyst Alistair Campbell at brokerage Berenberg. ""Nevertheless, this will disappoint.""
The addition of Monsanto will make Bayer as reliant on farming supplies as on pharmaceuticals for earnings. It is in the midst of an overhaul of its drug research and development activities that could result in job cuts as it faces calls to beef up its development pipeline.
Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the enlarged Crop Science division, now the world's largest supplier of seeds and pesticides, almost doubled to a better-than-expected 631 million euros, helped by a recovery in Brazil and as Monsanto, part of Bayer since June 7, contributed 70 million.
But its consumer health business, which makes Claritin against allergies, Coppertone sun screen and Dr. Scholl's foot care products, saw earnings fall by 18.5 percent as a weak U.S. dollar weighed on the value of overseas sales and as customers continued to shop elsewhere for cheaper products.
Berenberg's Campbell said the ""division remains highly problematic"". 

Bayer said it would still pay out a dividend per share for 2018 that was at least at the year-earlier level, more than its dividend payout policy of 30 to 40 percent of core earnings per share would command.

DUBAI (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings cut its credit ratings for two Dubai state-owned companies, saying a weakening economy in the emirate was hurting the government's ability to extend emergency support to the firms if needed.
The downgrades were a fresh sign of pressure on Dubai's economy, where the real estate and equity markets are slumping. The emirate does not have a sovereign credit rating, so analysts often look at state firms as indicators of its financial health.
""In our view, credit conditions in Dubai have deteriorated, which we believe affects the government's likely ability to provide extraordinary financial support to its government-related entities (GREs) if needed,"" S&P said.
The Dubai government's media office could not immediately be reached for comment.
S&P lowered its rating on utility Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) late on Tuesday to BBB from BBB-plus, assigning it a negative outlook, which indicates a significant chance of a further downgrade in future.
It was S&P's first outright downgrade of DEWA. The agency had previously upgraded the company in 2012 and 2016, as the emirate recovered from a credit crisis that nearly caused it to default on its debt. A default was averted with $20 billion of aid from neighboring Abu Dhabi.
""The negative outlook on DEWA reflects the possibility that our assessment of Dubai's creditworthiness could deteriorate further in the next two years, which would put further pressure on our rating on DEWA,"" S&P said.
""This is because we assume that the government could use its power to intervene negatively, which could include burdening the company with additional dividends, taxes, or other liabilities.""
S&P also lowered its rating for real estate firm DIFC Investments (DIFCI) to BBB-minus, one step above junk status, from BBB, but with a stable outlook. DIFCI owns an office and retail complex in Dubai's international financial center.
Analysts say that the pressures on Dubai are not as serious as those it faced a decade ago, and it has strengthened its finances since then by restructuring billions of dollars of debt at state-linked firms.
But as the region's top business center, it has been hurt by an economic slowdown in Saudi Arabia and other nearby countries due to low oil prices. Political tensions with Qatar and Iran, and increasing competition for investment capital with Saudi Arabia, have also dampened business.
Dubai government bond prices and the cost of insuring Dubai sovereign debt showed little reaction on Wednesday to the S&P downgrades, partly because many investors assume Dubai can count on further aid from Abu Dhabi if necessary.
S&P said that because Dubai's population growth had outpaced economic growth, its gross domestic product per person had declined to $37,000 in 2018 from a peak of $45,000 in 2013, a sign of deterioration in the government's potential tax and funding base.

The agency predicted the drop would continue over the next couple of years, reaching $36,000 in 2020.

588,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Saudi Bourse CEO Sees Aramco IPO as ‘Certain’ Despite Delay,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s bourse is in no doubt that state-owned oil giant Aramco will eventually list its shares on the local stock market following a delay in what was going to be one of the world’s largest IPOs.
“I’m certain Aramco will join the market,” Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, the chief executive officer of the Saudi stock market, said in an interview in Riyadh on Wednesday. “The decision has been made to take the company public, and the government has announced, several times, that they are looking at the proper time for listing Aramco.”
Aramco’s initial public offering was put on ice last month so it can focus on buying a stake in local petrochemical group Sabic for as much as $70 billion. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at the time that the government would pursue the share sale “at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum.” Saudi officials were looking at raising as much as $100 billion, based on a $2 trillion valuation that some analysts have said was too high.
In the meantime, the bourse is pushing ahead with improvements to the local market to attract foreign investors, the CEO said.
It aims to start a derivatives market by the first half of next year with the trading of future contracts on an index it is jointly developing with MSCI Inc., he said, adding that the composition of the index hasn’t been determined yet. Single stock futures and options are expected by 2020, Al Hussan said.
Saudi Arabia will join the group of countries that MSCI and FTSE Russell classify as emerging markets from 2019. The country’s main stock gauge has climbed about 9 percent this year. Most of the foreigners buying shares in Riyadh currently are based in the U.S. and in the U.K., according to Al Hussan.
The kingdom remains a viable market “even without Aramco,” said Henry Fernandez, MSCI’s chairman and CEO. He said that there is still interest from foreign investors despite the government’s decision to postpone the share sale, with their main concerns being global political turmoil."

LONDON (Reuters) - The sell-off in emerging markets gathered pace on Wednesday and global stocks fell for the fourth day in a row as a looming deadline in the U.S.-China trade conflict kept the dollar holding firm near two-week highs.
Wall Street was set to open weaker. 
A public comment period on the possibility of fresh U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that the additional levies will be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The United States and Canada will also resume discussions on Wednesday on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Ottawa is not expected to back down on key issues despite Trump's threats to retaliate.
The dollar is benefiting from these uncertainties. But it has also drawn strength from upbeat U.S. indicators supporting the case for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve -- data showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerating to more than a 14-year high in August.
Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat on the day, though it retreated a touch to stand just off two-week highs hit on Tuesday.
The greenback's 8 percent surge since end-March has sent emerging markets reeling, with MSCI's emerging equity benchmark falling for the sixth day in a row and down 1.5 percent on the day, while an index of emerging market currencies shed 0.3 percent to 15-month lows.
European shares retreated 0.6 percent to two-month lows, following weak closes in Asia, where expectations of U.S. tariffs sent Chinese shares down almost 1 percent. 
""Until last month people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what's happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China,"" said Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. 
""If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.""
The growth outlook fears, particularly for the developing world, were encapsulated by South Africa where data on Tuesday showed the economy slipping into recession for the first time since 2009. The rand has subsequently joined the Turkish lira and Argentine peso in a relentless sell-off, falling 1 percent and adding to the previous day's 3 percent slump.
Argentina's peso fell again on Tuesday, even though International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde confirmed the IMF was working to improve a $50 billion standby finance deal for the country. The peso has shed more than half its value to the dollar this year, with Turkish lira a close second, having fallen more than 40 percent.
There were signs of distress also in Indonesia, where the rupiah is trading at its lowest since the 1998 financial crisis. The Mexican peso shed 1 percent to a two-month low against the greenback.
""Rising U.S. rates, weak emerging market macro fundamentals and jittery geopolitics make for a poisonous concoction for EM assets,"" analysts at Danske Bank said.
They also highlighted a geopolitical element to the sell-off, noting that Russia and Turkey at least had ""seen their crises aggravated by geopolitical confrontation with the U.S."".
The trade war fears are not sparing U.S. markets either, with equity futures for all three New York indexes down around 0.3 percent. 
Along with the U.S. interest rate outlook, these concerns are keeping intact the dollar's safe-haven appeal. The greenback was at a near one-week high versus the yen while the euro was flat, following a loss of 0.35 percent on Tuesday.
The British pound retreated 0.2 percent to two-week lows.
""In a context where U.S. growth is still resilient, it supports a Fed rate hike in September and likely also in December,"" Barraud said. ""There is focus on the growth differential (between the United States and the rest of the world).""
One bright spot was Italy, where the mood has been lifted by signs the coalition government has abandoned plans for a spending binge that would have risked credit rating downgrades and put Rome on collision course with the European Union. 
Italian stocks rose 1 percent, contrasting with declines elsewhere and sovereign borrowing costs fell sharply -- 10-year bond yields slipped under 3 percent for the first time in more than two weeks.

On commodity markets, oil prices fell one percent, pressured by the dollar and signs a tropical storm had impacted U.S. Gulf coast production less than expected.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) Opel unit said it is working on plans to protect 2,000 research jobs in Ruesselsheim, Germany by transfering them to a new company run by French firm Segula Technologies.
Research and development work in Ruesselsheim has dropped since French carmaker PSA's purchase of the Opel and Vauxhall brands from General Motors (NYSE:GM) for $2.6 billion last year.
Ruesselsheim was once a global engineering hub for developing small and medium sized vehicles for various brands including Opel, Vauxhall and Buick and R&D work for GM accounted for 50 percent of the center's workload. 
""The Segula Technologies proposal aims at creating a European engineering campus and Center of Excellence in Ruesselsheim enlarging the scope beyond the automotive industry and including fields such as rail and energy,"" PSA's Opel said.
In addition to a lack of work from GM, Opel needs fewer engineers capable of developing vehicle platforms because new cars are now built on underpinnings provided by PSA.
Segula Technologies will become a subcontractor for Opel if a deal is struck, but Opel will not retain a stake in the venture, Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said. 
Any deal is subject to agreement by Opel's works council and would include vehicle and propulsion engineering facilities together with up to 2,000 employees of the Ruesselsheim research and development being taken over by Segula, Opel said.
Uncertainty over the future of Opel's engineering center has already led to a wave of departures among Opel's senior engineering staff and when rumors of a sale first surfaced in July, Opel's labor leaders were quick to condemn plans they said would ""threaten Opel's existence"".

Segula technologies is offering to protect jobs until July 2023, Opel said. Lohscheller declined to say whether the transfer of jobs will have a positive financial impact for Opel.

LONDON (Reuters) - On any given day, the chair in Raven Rose's Ewing, New Jersey, bedroom might be draped with shirts, pants or pyjamas.
""It depends on how exhausted from work I am and if I plan to wear them again,"" said the 35-year-old retail clerk.     
Marketers at consumer goods giant  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) are calling it the ""chairdrobe"" - the heap of lightly worn clothes that often ends up crumpling one's go-to garments. 
It's a familiar sight in the bedrooms of some 60 percent of millennials – 22- to 37-year-olds earning more than a quarter of the world's income - who approach laundry differently from other age groups, Unilever's market research shows.
That's a pain point for the company, maker of the world's second-biggest detergent, Omo.
For decades, Unilever and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), the industry leader that created the best-selling brand, Tide, have pitched new and improved laundry detergents and fabric softeners, primarily to women using washing machines.
But millennials are less loyal to traditional brands and have new demands, including that products save time and be environmentally sustainable. 
Many, like 36-year-old Olivia Tusinski, want to spend as little time as possible on laundry. Plus, washing too often wears your clothes out faster, she says.
""I don't like to waste water or energy,"" said Tusinski, a government employee in London. 
P&G tested a line to woo the wash-weary a decade ago after discovering how common re-wearing clothes was. The Swash brand was parlayed into a $499 de-wrinkling appliance in partnership with Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) but two products made it to market as Downy Wrinkle Releaser spray and Tide Stain Pen. 
Now, Unilever is having a go with Day 2, an aerosol spray that went on sale online only last week that it says refreshes, reshapes and dewrinkles clothes on the chairdrobe.
There are versions for denim and delicates, in addition to the original. Denim jeans are by far the most reworn garment, Unilever says. 
""That's a high pride point for a lot of millennials, you know, ensuring that their denim is as pristine as possible,"" said Day 2's co-founder and marketing head Nathan Olivieri.
Indeed, denim aficionados have warned for years against washing jeans. Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh, a 28-year veteran of P&G, told a conference in 2014 that the jeans he was wearing that day were a year old and had never been washed.
LIKE A START-UP
Unilever's home care president Kees Kruythoff calls catering to millennials' mindset a way of ""future-proofing"" the portfolio. In addition to Day 2 in the United Kingdom, Unilever is testing a portion-controlled detergent in the Netherlands called Less. Both projects have been structured as if the developers were small and agile start-ups, not a multinational. 
The global laundry detergent market is expected to reach $205.2 billion by 2025, up from $133.3 billion in 2016, according to Grand View Research, which predicts 4.9 percent annual growth fueled by the rising penetration of washing machines in developing countries.
In more developed markets, growth is being helped by eco-friendly brands like Seventh Generation, now owned by Unilever, and Method, Grand View said. 
These upstart brands, which boast fewer chemicals and packaging with recycled plastic, are part of the wave of disruption that earlier slammed food and personal care and has finally shaken up home care.
Laundry leaders P&G, Unilever and Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) are aiming to save consumers time with pre-measured or all-in-one offerings. Meanwhile, start-up subscription brands deliver soap to consumers' homes, while new mobile apps offer laundry services on demand. 
Unilever's detergent Skip has partnered in Paris with the mobile app Cowash to connect people with neighbors willing to wash and iron their laundry for a fee. 
Cowash says about 80 percent of its customers have washing machines and wash some of their clothes, but use the service to avoid time-consuming items like shirts that need ironing.
""They don't do it because they don't have washing machines, they do it because they don't have time,"" Cowash founder Adrien Hugon said.
Indeed, the project brief Unilever handed down to Olivieri some 10 months ago was to create a product that would give millennials more confidence to rewear worn clothes, since there was nothing on the market that explicitly targeted the issue and addressed smell, wrinkles and shape, the 25-year-old told Reuters.
While P&G's Febreze spray can be used to remove odors from clothes, for example, it more often focuses on hard-to-clean fabrics in the home or car such as upholstery and curtains.
Olivieri aimed to create a premium all-in-one product in an attractive can that could be displayed in a bedroom. 
Over the course of one month last autumn, Olivieri's ten-person team developed the brand away from corporate headquarters in a rented house in a village outside Liverpool, frequently inviting consumers in for real-time feedback. 
""We know the chairdrobe is a universal concept ... but as we move into a modern age where we're more time-poor than ever, that's becoming an even more relevant consumer problem,"" Olivieri said.

LONDON (LPC) - Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk (F&R) division, has launched price guidance on its US$8bn-equivalent term loan B after a bank meeting on Tuesday morning.
The seven-year term loan B comprises a US$5.5bn facility and a US$2.5bn-equivalent euro-denominated facility. Price guidance on the dollar loan is 400bp-425bp over Libor and the euro loan is guided at 425bp over Euribor.
The deal is the largest buyout financing since the financial crisis, and its launch has been eagerly awaited since the deal was underwritten in January. The size of the deal means that it has been priced to attract support in the leveraged loan markets on both sides of the Atlantic.
“The banks had no choice but to price it attractively and it’ll be interesting to see how it goes,” an investor in London said.
The deal is being marketed with leverage of 4.25 times secured and 5.25 times unsecured, based on adjusted Ebitda of US$2.5bn which includes US$700m of cost savings and synergies from the business’s reported Ebitda of US$1.8bn.
In order to buy the deal, investors have to buy into the adjustments and cost savings forecast, the first investor said. A portfolio manager in London said that he had calculated that leverage for the deal is “nearer six and seven times”.
Senior managing director at Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Martin Brand said at Tuesday’s bank meeting that some US$250m of the costs forecast will be made in the three months after the acquisition closes, primarily through technology savings such as a “server virtualization”.
“Blackstone made a fair point that this deal has been in gestation for a long time and so they know almost down to the individual headcount what they’re going to do,” the portfolio manager said.
Brand said that Blackstone is the biggest investment bank fee payer on Wall Street, at over US$1bn a year, and is also the largest provider of capital to the hedge fund industry, which will help Refinitiv to gain further traction with financial institutions and grow the business.
Refinitiv currently spends up to US$500m a year on capital expenditure, which Refinitiv executives said at the bank meeting is expected to fall after the acquisition which will boost free cash flow.
“It is sometimes strange with these very large transactions as investors almost make the decision at the beginning that they’re going to do it,” the portfolio manager added. “Often when you drill down into the business though you realize it’s actually not an easy story.”
David Craig, president of F&R and future CEO of Refinitiv, said at the bank meeting that much of the hard work was behind the company, as previous price reductions had now been absorbed and its restructuring was complete.

598,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Top Goldman Banker Awaits His Fate as New CEO Fills No. 2 Post,"(Bloomberg) -- The bonhomie was flowing as a cadre of senior Goldman Sachs investment bankers convened in July at Silo Ridge, a private enclave set among the rolling hills of New York’s Hudson Valley.
Officially, the retreat two hours north of Manhattan was to talk strategy for the firm’s investment banking division, and enjoy a round or three on the club’s Tom Fazio-designed golf course.
Unofficially, it was something more: a quiet celebration and pregame for an era to come. The unit’s former leader, David Solomon, had just that week been named the firm’s next chief executive officer. Now, anticipation was building that the man leading the annual off-site, John Waldron, would grab the second-highest post -- becoming a president of the bank. It would mean even greater clout for their business.
Waldron is the name that keeps making everyone’s list in what’s become the favorite parlor game at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).: predicting who will rise to co-president -- or even sole president -- under the new CEO. Executives around Waldron are convinced nothing short of a shock decision by Solomon can disrupt his elevation to that level.
A company spokesman declined to comment.
Traditionally, Goldman’s dealmakers have vied with its traders for supremacy atop the firm. The ascent of not one but two bankers would cement a dramatic shift in power that’s become a point of worry for the once-dominant trading division. Lloyd Blankfein, who came up through fixed-income trading, is set to step down as CEO at the end of this month. His longtime deputy, veteran trader Gary Cohn, left in late 2016 for a more raucous stint at the White House. And some of the firm’s most-experienced trading leaders also have moved on.
In the world of M&A, Waldron, 49, is known for the ties he’s forged with Rupert Murdoch. Recently, that’s meant advising the patriarch of the Fox empire on selling a key chunk of his business to Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. in a $71 billion transaction. But sometimes having a seat at the table for the Murdoch family’s deliberations means counseling them against proposed deals that never see the light of day.
“He’s very candid. He cuts to the chase,” James Murdoch, Rupert’s son and the CEO of 21st Century Fox Inc., said in an interview this week. “He’s not someone who messes around with long-winded PowerPoints that, if you change the logo in the bottom corner, could come from anywhere.”
The younger Murdoch and Waldron have bonded over the years, and have gone backcountry skiing together, sometimes dropped out of helicopters. Waldron is adept at maintaining relationships that are both personal and commercial, said Patrick Healy, co-CEO at buyout firm Hellman & Friedman.
“I don’t think anyone wakes up in the morning and wants to pay Goldman Sachs a fee,” Healy said. “It’s one thing to give advice and be a show pony, but on race day he gets up and performs.”
Inside Goldman, Waldron is seen as a loyal ally of its next CEO, a relationship that took root when they worked together in the eat-what-you-kill world of Bear Stearns Cos. The two have bought properties on the same island in the Bahamas and at Silo Ridge.
Peacemaking Banker
While Solomon is known as a demanding boss, Waldron has crafted a softer image at work, with a less taxing approach as the head of Goldman’s most profitable unit. Those who know him define him as a stereotypical investment banker -- good golfer, consummate salesman and an effective advocate. He’s not the type to put an unusual hobby on public display, as Solomon sometimes does popping up on weekends as DJ D-Sol.
“David has a little devilish side to him and he enjoys that,” said David Mussafer, a managing partner at private equity firm Advent International. “John is more straightforward.”
Mussafer would know. He was on the other side of the table when Solomon and a group of bankers showed up in yoga gear to pitch for the Lululemon IPO pre-crisis (Advent was one of the clothing retailer’s early investors). A half-decade later, after doing some advisory work for the Red Sox, Waldron began sharing season tickets to Fenway Park with a small group of dealmakers including Mussafer, a devoted fan. The timing was auspicious: It was 2013, the year the baseball team climbed from last in their division to win the World Series.
In the cutthroat deal-making world, Waldron will have to play peacemaker for financing issues that crop up and manage the constant paranoia that another firm is getting a better look at a lucrative transaction. Executives and competitors describe him as well suited for that role.
“John is one of those individuals you can call when something hasn’t gone well,” said Mussafer. “Goldman has to deal with a myriad of conflicts, otherwise they won’t be able to do anything. He’s one of those people you like to speak with even on thorny matters.”
Professor Volcker
Waldron grew up in Cleveland with some ties to Wall Street, his father working at Smith Barney. Hoping to become a sports writer, he earned a degree in English from Middlebury College, but he also dabbled in financial topics. That included a class where Paul Volcker nudged those present toward a career in civil service. These days, Waldron advocates for the need to cut back on onerous rules adopted after the financial crisis -- measures championed by the one-time guest speaker at the Vermont school.
Waldron joined Goldman in 2000 -- a year after Solomon made a similar jump -- and snagged the title of partner in 2002. He ran the media and entertainment banking group before becoming a head of leveraged finance, which Solomon had grown in his first role at the bank.
In 2007, Waldron was dispatched to London to head a group that exclusively dealt with buyout firms, arriving just as the wheels were falling off the global economy. He was back in New York by 2011, focusing on a new group for the firm’s most senior global bankers: cultivating and strengthening its most critical relationships.
“He’s like the human LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD),” H&F’s Healy said.
By 2014, he was elevated to head the investment bank alongside Solomon and Richard Gnodde. With promotions and transfers that have followed since, he’s now the most senior member of the new trio leading the unit.
Romney and Bush
Waldron and his wife Amanda, a former Goldman investment banker (the two met at the firm) live with their children in a limestone condo off Manhattan’s Central Park, where they purchased two units. Neighbors have included Blankfein, Goldman trading head Ashok Varadhan and the singer Sting.
Waldron, a registered Republican, has also carried on Goldman’s storied tradition of nurturing ties to political power. He was involved in Mitt Romney’s run for president in 2012, and was one of the organizers for a Jeb Bush fundraiser in 2015, back when the son and sibling of former U.S. presidents seemed like Wall Street’s best bet.
Within Goldman, Waldron has furthered Solomon’s push to turn the investment bank into a lean, numbers-focused unit that rewards those who bring the money into the firm, much like how the trading world works.
Bear Boys
That has led to a disparity in compensation among partners in the unit, with the cream taking home most of the gains. Many of the rest are compensated as at any other firm on the Street, erasing an edge Goldman has always held over rivals.
The beneficiaries of that system were among those at Silo Ridge during the mid-week retreat in July. People aware of the private gathering agreed to describe it on the condition they not be named. One person said attendees presented on matters such as using technology to win deals, targeting clients, the partnership model and strategy for the year ahead.
If Waldron rises, the priorities they ironed out there would have all the more import for the entire bank. The timing for the decision is also noteworthy. It was 10 years ago that Solomon and Waldron’s former firm, Bear Stearns, was among the first to succumb to a worsening financial storm. Now, the pair could lead Goldman Sachs into the future.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 05:52AM ET</span>",Indonesia stocks sink most in nearly two years as emerging markets slump,"By Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian stocks tumbled the most in nearly two years on Wednesday and authorities intervened ""decisively"" to support the currency and bond markets as a global rout in emerging market assets intensified.
As Jakarta stocks lost nearly 5 percent after the midday break, President Joko Widodo also blamed ""a barrage of external factors"" for the rupiah's fall to 20-year lows and said the priority was to increase investment and exports to contain the country's current account deficit.
""There are only two key (things) - investments must continue to increase and exports must also increase so (we) can resolve the current account deficit,"" Widodo told reporters during a visit to Jakarta's port, in comments posted on the cabinet secretary's web page.
Indonesia's current account deficit was 1.7 percent of gross domestic product last year, but is expected to widen to around 2.5 percent in 2018 as economic activity increases, Bank Indonesia (BI) has said.
Indonesian assets have sold off as investors flee emerging markets, with the vulnerability of Southeast Asia's biggest economy increased by worries about its current account deficit and need to import oil.
The threat of fresh U.S tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could take effect after a public comment period in Washington ends on Thursday and a deepening sell-off in other emerging markets kept investors nervous.
Stock markets in the Philippines, China, Singapore and India fell alongside Indonesia’s as Asian markets which had so far been sheltered from the rout in other more indebted emerging economies succumbed to news that South Africa had slipped into recession and to further sharp falls in markets in Turkey and Argentina.
The Jakarta stock index (JKSE) closed down 3.7 percent - its fifth-straight session of losses and its sharpest one-day fall since November 2016.
The battered rupiah  fared better on the day, although it was still headed for its biggest seven-day selloff in three years, after heavy intervention by authorities to support the currency.
It was trading at 14,940 against the dollar, around its lowest level since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. The rupiah has lost around 9 percent this year.
Indonesia's central bank ""decisively intervened"" in the foreign exchange and bond markets on Wednesday morning to ""smooth volatility"" of the rupiah, Nanang Hendarsah, head of monetary management at Bank Indonesia (BI) told reporters.
On Wednesday, OCBC Bank in Singapore said attempts by BI to support the rupiah are slowing down its slide, but ""are insufficient to turn the tide"". 
Indonesia's benchmark 10-year bond yield was at 8.448 percent, up from previous day's closing of 8.340 percent.

On Tuesday, Indonesia's government said that authorities will take firm action against currency speculators, and announced plans to delay import-heavy energy projects.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati did not specify what sanctions speculators could face, but warned that large currency transactions would be checked by the central bank and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to ensure they were based on actual trade or commerce.
In an attempt to anticipate future dollar requirements, Widodo asked ministers to assess how much foreign currency would be needed to pay for imports related to large infrastructure projects.
The government also announced plans to delay an estimated $24 billion to $25 billion in import-heavy power station projects, and enforce rules to keep export earnings at home, among efforts to prop up the rupiah.
To reduce the oil import bill, Indonesia has sought to boost the use of biodiesel.
On Wednesday, the government will announce import tariffs on hundreds of consumer goods, Indrawati said.

Among other planned changes, Indonesian oil producers must offer crude to state energy company Pertamina before selling it overseas, a move expected to save the state energy company up to $4 per barrel on shipping costs.

The board also voted to approve a plan for a “reverse stock split” of the restricted voting shares and special voting shares on a one-for-three basis, the unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI). said in a statement Tuesday.
The Trans Mountain extension project, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government bought for C$4.5 billion, suffered a major setback last week after a Canadian court nullified its approval. The line, which takes crude from the oil sands to the country’s Pacific Coast, faces strong opposition in British Columbia, the province it crosses to reach the shore.
The payment to holders of restricted voting shares will take place Jan. 3, with the reverse stock split to follow, if the plan is approved. The proposals will be voted on at a special shareholder meeting during the fourth quarter of this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares traded lower on Wednesday as trade tensions and growing worries about emerging market currencies cut investor appetite for risky assets. 
At 0826 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.7 percent, with losses spread across industry sectors and trading centers despite data showing that Euro zone business activity accelerated slightly in August. 
A rare glimmer of optimism lifted Italy's banks, buoyed by deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini saying that Rome would ""try to be good"" with respect to European Union budget rules. 
Rating agency Scope also issued a note saying that while ""volatile politics have reignited fears around Italian banks"", there has been progress on non-performing loans. 
Shares in UBI Banca (MI:UBI), Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) were up by 3.2 percent, 2.5 percent and 2.1 percent respectively. 
Corporate announcements also triggered strong swings, most notably in French pharmaceutical group BioMerieux (PA:BIOX) which was the best performer on the STOXX 600 index, up by 8.3 percent after better than expected first-half results and a raised 2018 outlook.
In the same sector, Bayer (DE:BAYGn) lost 2 percent after reporting a disappointing 3.9 percent gain in underlying core earnings for the quarter. 
Overall, the European Healthcare sector (SXDP) was down 0.8 percent. 
Another French firm was also among the highest risers. Outdoor advertising group JCDecaux (PA:JCDX) added 6.8 percent after a rating upgrade by BofA Merrill.
British betting company  William Hill  (L:WMH) jumped 4.5 percent after it signed a 25-year sports-betting partnership with casino operator Eldorado Resorts (O:ERI), which investors see as a major step in its U.S. expansion. 
The biggest faller was Denmark's Ambu (CO:AMBUb) whose shares sank 13 percent after reports of a shareholder selling his stock at a discount.

Following a domestic recall announcement by Japan's transport ministry, Toyota said that in affected vehicles, the wire harness which connects to the hybrid power control unit can come into contact with the covering at the connection point.
If dust accumulates on the wire harness or the cover, the insulation on the wires could wear down over time due to vehicle vibrations. This could cause an electrical short circuit, which could generate heat and lead to a risk of fire, Toyota said. 
The issue affects vehicles produced in Japan between June 2015 and May 2018, and includes the plug-in version of the Prius and the C-HR compact crossover SUV sold in Japan, Europe, Australia and other countries. 
Roughly half of the recalls would take place in Japan, Toyota spokesman Jean-Yves Jault said.
Only the Prius model would be recalled in the United States, where around 192,000 vehicles were affected. he said.

Jault added that the issue had led to one incident of a short circuiting in Japan which produced smoke from the vehicle.

604,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Five Stocks to Watch as China Breaks Into Global Drug Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Many of China’s most innovative drug firms have ambitions to be global leaders in the next generation of medicines for cancer, hepatitis and other diseases. While the industry is still at a nascent stage, more companies are attempting to develop their own blockbuster therapies.
The MSCI China Health Care Index surged to a 14-year high in June and then started tumbling, a correction that gained momentum in July after a small local vaccine producer, Changsheng Bio-Technology Co., was found to have sold substandard vaccines. President Xi Jinping’s government has pledged more scrutiny of the entire industry.
The Chinese players are tiny compared to their global rivals, making it harder for them to gain a foothold internationally, but the sector still has its fans. Beijing’s ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, intended to upgrade the country’s manufacturing industries, includes plans to build homegrown champions in the pharmaceutical industry.
The government hasn’t given up on its ambitions, according to Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which tracks 28 companies in its China BioPharma Exchange-Traded Fund. “There’s a new crop of globally recognized management teams doing first-class science,” he told Bloomberg Television on Aug. 16. “These are companies that don’t aim to be leaders just in China domestically but leaders globally.”
As the industry continues to expand, here’s a few of the companies that are likely to be bellwethers, offering insight into the outlook for the sector:
Sino Biopharmaceutical: Billionaires
While shares of this Hong Kong-based drugmaker have dropped about 19 percent since the vaccine scandal broke, Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd. may get a boost on Sept. 10, when the company becomes one of the 50 members of the benchmark Hang Seng Index. Founder and Chief Executive Officer Tse Ping and Vice Chair Cheng Cheung Ling are both billionaires and own more than one-third of the company, which has major product lines for the treatment of hepatitis and cancer. Their daughter, Theresa Tse, is chairman and also a billionaire via her holdings in the company.
Sales in the second half of the year are likely to get a boost from anlotinib, a new type of anti-tumor drug developed by Sino Biopharma that got approval in May. On Aug. 16, the company reported progress in winning Chinese approval for a generic version of pomalidomide for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. The drug is one of more than 100 generics in the development pipeline, according to a BOCOM International Research report in August.
Sino Biopharma shares sank as much as 4.5 percent on Wednesday as the benchmark Hang Seng Index lost more than 2 percent.
BeiGene: Cutting-Edge Cancer Drug
China has lots of “me-toos where people are making duplicates around IP of something else,” CEO John Oyler told Bloomberg TV on Aug. 8. “We believe it’s time that we can lead from China in this industry.” Nasdaq-traded BeiGene Ltd. has a market capitalization of about $10 billion and even with the selloff in Chinese drug stocks its share price is still up more than 80 percent this year.
BeiGene’s tislelizumab, a member of a new category of oncology drugs designed to inhibit the PD-1 protein (which prevents the immune system from targeting malignant cells) shows early promise in treating classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts, but that’s too small of a market to make a major impact. “To lift the drug’s prospects, it must be proven to work in other tumor types,” the analysts wrote in a note published Aug. 22. A lot therefore is riding on late-stage trials now under way with lung-cancer patients.
Jiangsu Hengrui: Making the List
Before investors soured on Chinese health-care stocks, Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. was a star performer, with its shares rising about 55 percent from the start of the year to early June. Since then the stock has dropped about 20 percent. But on Aug. 14,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its price target for Hengrui by 35 percent, thanks to optimism about its pipeline.
China’s National Health Insurance Bureau on Aug. 17 announced its latest list of oncology drugs being considered for insurance coverage. Drugs from Hengrui and Sino Biopharma were the only Chinese-developed drugs included. However, a plan by China’s Center for Drug Evaluation to speed up approvals for 48 foreign medicines may hurt Hengrui more than other local rivals because it has the most products overlapping the multinationals, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Ascletis Pharma: Pre-Profit IPO
A Hangzhou-based producer of drugs for HIV and liver cancer, Ascletis Pharma Inc. was the first biotech company to take advantage of the Hong Kong stock exchange’s decision to allow listings by companies without profits. However, a month after the listing Ascletis shares traded about 48 percent below the IPO price, a warning to other newcomers.
That slide was temporarily interrupted on Aug. 31, when Ascletics reported a 34.1 million yuan ($5 million) profit in the first half of 2018, compared to a loss of 17.5 million a year earlier. The stock soared as much as 37 percent. To help with the turnaround, Ascletis is counting on successful sales of Ganovo and Ravidasvir, hepatitis C drugs recently approved by China’s drug regulator.
Ascletis climbed as much as 15 percent Wednesday as brokerage firms initiated coverage on the stock, with Morgan Stanley giving it an overweight rating while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and China Merchants Securities listed it as a buy.
3SBio: Canadian Flop
The worst may not be over for 3SBio Inc. investors after the biotech company’s shares dropped more than 30 percent from their high earlier this year. The Shenyang-based company’s first-half revenue fell short of some analysts estimates, with Nomura noting a ""big miss"" in sales of some drugs. The company is now waiting for Chinese government approval of a biosimilar to Herceptin, Roche Holding (SIX:ROG) AG’s breast cancer medication.
3SBio has struggled to expand beyond China, which accounts for almost all of its business. Last year it proposed buying the contract development and manufacturing business from a Canadian drugmaker for $290 million to enter the North American market but called off the deal in May.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2018 02:24AM ET</span>","Investa to weigh $2.4 billion bid from Oxford, delays vote on Blackstone offer","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian office landlord Investa Office Fund (AX:IOF) said it will study a $2.4 billion takeover bid from Canada's Oxford Properties Group, an offer that was criticized by rival suitor Blackstone (N:BX) which also threatened to drop its own bid.
Oxford had lobbed a last-minute A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) offer for Investa on Tuesday that was A$90 million higher than U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group's bid which had already won the backing of the target. 
Investa said on Wednesday it is adjourning a planned shareholder meeting for Thursday that was set to vote on Blackstone's offer while it weighs the attractiveness of Oxford's bid.
Blackstone, in a letter to Investa, said the Oxford offer was ""not a superior proposal"" and that it reserved its rights to terminate its bid and claim a break fee if the meeting were to be adjourned and Oxford's offer deemed better.
""The alternative proposal is subject to completion of full due diligence ... (and) there is a lack of funding certainty for the transaction,"" the letter, which was released to media, said. 
A Sydney-based spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group, the real estate investment arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, was not immediately available for comment. 
Investa has been a takeover target for years, as tight supply and strong growth lift rents in Australia, especially in Sydney where the company's towers are concentrated.
Oxford's offer is also slightly above the book value of the 20-property portfolio, which, besides Sydney, includes towers in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.
But, according to Blackstone, its rival lacks experience in Australia and does not have funding secured for the deal.
""It is our belief that pursuing the alternative proposal will provide uncertainty to IOF unitholders,"" the letter says.

Investa units closed 2.3 percent higher on Wednesday at A$5.44, below Oxford's A$5.50 per unit offer but above Blackstone's A$5.3485. The broader market (AXJO) was 1.0 percent lower.

The move follows a failed attempt by Theranos to sell itself, during which it reached out to more than 80 potential buyers through Jefferies Group, the Journal reported, citing an email http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Theranos_Stockholders_Letter_2018.pdf to shareholders from Chief Executive David Taylor.
""Unfortunately, none of those leads has materialized into a transaction. We are now out of time,"" Taylor wrote in the letter, a copy of which was published by the WSJ.
The firm will attempt to pay unsecured creditors its remaining cash in the coming months, the Journal reported, adding that big name investors had lost about $1 billion.
Neither Taylor nor representatives for Palo Alto, California-based Theranos immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who started the company when she was 19, was celebrated as a rising Silicon Valley star until it became clear that many of the claims about the company's supposedly revolutionary blood test were bogus.
In June this year, Holmes and former Theranos president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani were indicted on charges that they engaged in schemes to defraud investors, doctors and patients.
They used advertising and solicitations to encourage doctors and patients to use Theranos's blood testing laboratory services despite knowing the company could not produce accurate and reliable results consistently, prosecutors had said.
Theranos was in default under its credit facility with Fortress Investment Group, Taylor said in the letter.
He said the company was attempting to reach an agreement with Fortress to give it ownership of Theranos's patents but leaving its remaining cash of about $5 million for distribution to other unsecured creditors.
Besides Fortress, Theranos owes at least $60 million to unsecured creditors, Taylor said. ""Because the company's cash is not nearly sufficient to pay all of its creditors in full, there will be no distributions to shareholders,"" he added.

The company aims to seek board and shareholder consent for the Fortress settlement and corporate dissolution later this week and proceed with the actions starting Monday, Taylor said.

The KC-46, which is derived from Boeing's commercial 767 airframe, will receive a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC). https:// 
The KC-46 is a multirole tanker which will refuel U.S., allied and coalition military aircraft using its boom and hose and drogue systems. 
Earlier in July when Boeing reported quarterly results, the company said it would spend an additional $426 million before taxes on the program as it worked through test delays and production changes to eight aircraft in various stages of production.
Analysts had said they were worried that the additional expenses on the KC-46 program would slow shares, adding that the higher tanker costs came with unchanged earnings and cash flow forecasts. 
""This milestone is important in that it is one of the last major hurdles in advance of first delivery to the U.S. Air Force,"" said Mike Gibbons, Boeing KC-46A tanker vice president and program manager.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Wealth manager Perpetual Ltd (AX:PPT) said it has divested Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) from its A$1.3 billion ($933.6 million) ethical fund due to revelations of corporate misconduct, the first big institutional investor to do so.
The move by one of Australia's best-known share managers could encourage other socially minded stock pickers to divest from Australia's ""Big Four"" banks on ethical grounds. 
CBA has suffered a string of scandals over the past year that have included rate-rigging charges, breaches of anti-money laundering laws, and fees charged to dead clients.
Perpetual's divestment, disclosed in an investor update, places further pressure on Australia's banking sector to clean up its act as a powerful inquiry airs allegations of bribery, fee-gouging and board-level deception across the industry. 
Perpetual's decision applies to its ethical Australian share product, which listed CBA as one of its largest holdings as recently as April. The fund manager has, however, retained its large CBA holding in its mainstream equities product.
A Perpetual spokeswoman said in a statement its ethical fund filters were tightened at the start of June. 
""This included widening the definition of its governance (socially responsible investment) filter to capture more instances of corporate misconduct,"" the spokeswoman said.
An additional 25 companies were caught by the screens, Perpetual said in a statement to Reuters, without disclosing the names of the affected stocks.
CBA said in a statement it had nothing further to add to Perpetual's disclosures.
The ""sustainable, responsible and impact"" (SRI) investment sector housed $23 trillion around the globe at the end of 2016, according to the most recent biennial survey by the Global Sustainable Investment Review.
While Europe is the dominant region for such funds, SRI investments have increased rapidly in fossil-fuel-rich Australia from $148 billion to $516 billion between 2014 and 2016.
DAMAGING REVELATIONS
Revelations of poor practices have been flowing from the country's most powerful type of inquiry, called a Royal Commission, since the start of the year, testing the ethical screens of Australia's SRI funds which tend to focus on issues like a stock's exposure to uranium, alcohol, tobacco and gambling.
Investment consultant Mercer's global business leader of responsible investment, Helga Birgden, said governance issues were now being closely assessed by mainstream funds.
""Not because they label themselves as ethical or socially responsible, but because these are genuine and material investment risks,"" Birgden said.
CBA is one of Australia's biggest listed companies, with a market cap in excess of A$120 billion ($86.5 billion), making any decision to remove it from a share portfolio significant. 
The quasi-judicial inquiry has also exposed bad business practices at National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), along with fund managers AMP (AX:AMP) and IOOF Holdings (AX:IFL).
The revelations have already cost AMP - itself a large fund manager that offers SRI products - several high-level resignations and about A$4 billion in market value. 

Australian Ethical Investments said in May it was divesting its holdings in AMP.

626,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",How Much Worse Can the Emerging-Market Slump Get?,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market assets have further scope to fall, thanks to investors who have been reluctant so far to cut their positions on what’s been one of the most popular trades of recent years.
Fund-manager positions are one of the reasons keeping Morgan Stanley’s James Lord bearish, even after the MSCI Emerging Market Currencies Index fell to a fresh one-year low. The pressure on developing nations Wednesday rotated into equities, with Hong Kong’s benchmark down almost 1 percent and Jakarta’s and Manila’s sliding nearly 2 percent.
“We stick to a bearish view across credit, rates and FX, and hold short positions across most of the high-beta space, including Indonesia and Malaysia, which are two countries we expect investors to increasingly focus on,” Lord and fellow  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists wrote in a report Tuesday.
Five years on from the taper tantrum, when worries about a rollback in U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus hit riskier assets, emerging economies are beset by the Fed’s accelerating destruction of liquidity as it normalizes policy. That’s sent funding costs up around the world, casting a pall over countries that have enjoyed faster growth than in developed nations.
“Real money positioning is not yet clean and broader external funding challenges are high,” the Morgan Stanley analysts concluded, using a term for non-leveraged institutional investors such as mutual and pension funds.
The worst hit nations have been those with the weakest fundamentals. South Africa’s rand led global declines Tuesday as data showed its economy fell into a recession. Turkey’s lira slid amid concern the nation’s central bank will underwhelm investors at its policy meeting next week, while the Argentine peso slumped to a record and Indonesia’s rupiah sank to the lowest in two decades even after the central bank intensified its fight to protect it.
Read more on how these emerging markets hold key to sell-off.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). analysis suggests that while investors have largely cut back on their local-currency bond holdings in emerging markets, there’s scope for further pullback in stocks and fixed income denominated in dollars and other developed-country currencies.
“EM local currency bond managers appear to have been mostly responsible for the recent EM correction,” JPMorgan strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note Friday. Their analysis showed that active bond-fund managers “abruptly” unwound their positions in local emerging debt last month after building up overweight positions in July. The reversal was so big that it probably amounted to “capitulation,” they wrote.
Equity managers, on the other hand, “are far from capitulation territory,” having also shifted into an overweight position in July, according to JPMorgan.
“Active EM equity and hard-currency bond fund managers continued to exhibit rather elevated betas during August, suggesting that the EM equity and hard-currency bond universes are more vulnerable in the event of re-escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict into September,” the JPMorgan team concluded.
For Khiem Do, co-head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management, there’s likely to be more turmoil in the absence of the Fed pulling back on the speed of its policy tightening. And that looks unlikely, bond markets indicate.
“If the Fed were to pause, this would be fantastic news for emerging markets,” he said in a Bloomberg TV interview from Hong Kong. “But the Fed is likely going to hike rates again in September. December we’re not sure, they may pause. As soon as they pause, that would be a massive relief for emerging markets.”

627,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 11:39PM ET</span>",JD.com CEO was arrested on allegation of rape: police report,"By Todd Melby and Adam Jourdan
MINNEAPOLIS/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The founder and chief executive of Chinese retailer JD.com Inc, Richard Liu, was arrested in Minneapolis last week following an allegation of rape, according to a public information report released by police on Tuesday.
Liu, identified in the report by his Chinese name Liu Qiangdong, was released from custody on Saturday without being charged, and he returned to China.
Earl Gray, a Minnesota-based lawyer for Liu, said on Monday that the Chinese businessman has denied any wrongdoing and that he did not expect his client to be charged.
On Tuesday, defense attorney Joseph Friedberg said, ""They are not going to charge in this case. There's no credible complaint."" 
Minneapolis Police Department spokesman John Elder said on Tuesday that if there were any charges against Liu they would not be filed until completion of a criminal investigation that would not occur before Friday. 
The police report shed a bit more light on the nature of the accusation, which authorities had previously left vague. It said the alleged offense was ""criminal sexual contact - rape,"" and said domestic violence was not involved. 
It gave no further details, but Elder said the alleged attack reportedly occurred at 1 a.m. local time on Friday, and that Liu was taken into custody later that evening.
Elder declined to disclose whether any accuser was cooperating with police. ""I wouldn't address that. That goes to the investigation,"" he said. 
JD.com Inc's stock fell as much as 7 percent on Tuesday, hitting an 18-month low, reflecting investor uncertainty. Shares in China's second largest e-commerce company closed down 6 percent at $29.43 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq and were steady after hours.
JD.com's rules require Liu, who holds nearly 80 percent of the company's voting rights, to be present at board meetings for the board to make decisions, although it was not clear if he has to be physically present or could participate by teleconference.
The company counts Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and China's Tencent Holdings as investors. It faces stiff competition from rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd at home.
""If this spirals as a media focus, negative attention could offset some of the positives associated with endorsement by Walmart and Google,"" analyst Rob Sanderson of MKM Partners said.
""Negative publicity could also compromise JD.com's ability to attract international brands to its marketplace, which has been a top focus of the CEO over the past two years or so,"" Sanderson said.
Liu lost a court battle in Australia in July to keep his name out of a sexual assault trial. Liu was not accused of any wrongdoing in that case, according to a court document. 

The case involved a person who had been a guest at a party hosted by Liu at his home in Sydney 2015 who accused another guest of sexually assaulting her at a hotel. The defendant was found guilty of seven offenses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump blasted CNN and NBC News yet again in a tweet on Tuesday, criticizing NBC's handling of a story on movie producer Harvey Weinstein and suggesting a ""look at their license,"" without specifying what exactly he was calling for.
Trump has frequently criticized the U.S. news media for what he has said is unfair coverage of him. 
""I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?"" he wrote in the tweet, which cited the outlet's coverage of Weinstein.
Ronan Farrow, a reporter, has said NBC News blocked him from working on a story about Weinstein, who is facing criminal rape and sexual assault charges and a civil lawsuit for sex trafficking. A former NBC producer corroborated Farrow's allegations.
Farrow later published the story in the New Yorker magazine. NBC News has defended its handling of the story. Weinstein has denied ever having nonconsensual sex. 
Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which owns NBC News, declined to comment. Following the tweet, a decline in the price of Comcast shares on the Nasdaq extended slightly.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission did not immediately comment on the tweet, but in October the FCC's chairman said the agency does not have authority to revoke broadcast licenses over editorial decisions.
Late on Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Chuck Todd, the host of ""Meet the Press,"" a news show on NBC, suggested that it was ""time for the press to stop complaining and to start fighting back."" 
""Actually Chuck, they’ve been doing that from the day I announced for President. They’ve gone all out, and I WON, and now they’re going CRAZY!,"" Trump said on Twitter.
Trump blasted NBC and other TV networks last October, calling their news ""Fake"" and suggesting he would ""challenge"" their licenses.
Democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel responded to Trump's most recent tweet by posting the FCC rules on licensing. ""One more time...this is not how it works,"" she wrote on Twitter.
The FCC, an independent agency, does not issue licenses to individual networks but to local stations, including those directly owned by broadcasters such as Comcast through NBC.

The agency has said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ""expressly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast matter"" and that its role ""in overseeing program content is very limited.""

632,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","As inquiry lashes Australian financial firms, more ethics study for would-be bankers","By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - When Nick Wailes started as the head of Australia's top-ranked business graduate school in February, he already had the idea of offering a course to address a shortfall of training in ethical leadership.
A few weeks later, the country's most powerful type of inquiry, a Royal Commission, began airing allegations of bribery, fee-gouging and board-level deception in the finance sector, and the University of New South Wales' ""Law, Regulation and Ethics"" course was born.
The course will be compulsory for all 2,000 students attending UNSW's graduate school from next year.
""If one of the students says 'Why are we studying this?' it's not hard to make that argument now,"" said Wailes. ""It was something we were doing anyway, but I think the Royal Commission has reinforced the need for that type of focus.""
The Royal Commission has flagged it will recommend criminal charges against some of the country's biggest money managers when it reports to the government this month.
People teaching the next generation of banking executives say they are yet to see any lessening of interest and corresponding dip in enrolments in courses aimed at the highly paid financial sector.
But the daily drumbeat of negative headlines is making it impossible to quarantine the classroom from community concerns, they say, and they are changing the course work accordingly.
""There is a trust deficit, and it is important that we don't bury our head in the sand,"" said Pamela Hanrahan, the UNSW professor writing the 10-week course which covers topics ranging from accountability to the relationship between ethics and the regulation system.
""We do have to respond to the fact that there's a change in expectations and what the community thinks businesses ought to do,"" added Hanrahan, who is also advising the Royal Commission.
LONG DECLINE
The year-long Royal Commission has become an outlet for public rage against a sector seen by many Australians as greedy and unfair.
But study of corporate ethics began in earnest in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has been helped along by years of scandal, educators interviewed by Reuters said.
""I've been teaching the subject Ethics in Finance for the past seven or eight years now and I've never had any shortage of the most annoying cases of unethical misconduct,"" said Paul Kofman, dean of business and economics at University of Melbourne. ""All that the Royal Commission is doing is pulling it together.""
For its final hearing, starting Sept. 10, the inquiry will turn its focus to the country's A$46 billion ($33 billion) insurance industry, having already racked over the banking, superannuation and funds management sectors.
Elizabeth Sheedy, an associate professor of applied finance at Macquarie University, said the Royal Commission showed the way ethics was being taught was ineffective.
""Historically it's been done (in a way that's) very philosophical,"" said Sheedy, a former employee of investment bank Macquarie Bank Ltd and No. 2 Australian lender Westpac Banking Corp.
""What we need to do is make the discussion less theoretical and more practical. 'Assuming you're in this situation, what could you actually do?',"" she said.
While there was no immediate sign the Royal Commission was affecting enrolments, years of scandals had played a part in a gradual, industry-wide decline in numbers of students opting to study finance, Sheedy said.
France's INSEAD, one of the world's largest MBA schools, which has Australian students, said 12 percent of its graduates joined the finance sector in 2017, compared to 14 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015.
The company has ""strengthened our ethics coverage in our teaching"", said INSEAD's affiliate professor of ethics and social responsibility N. Craig Smith.
INSEAD did not give Australian-specific figures.
""EMBARRASSMENT AND SHAME""
The Royal Commission has focused on the adverse effects of finance sector misconduct on customers but the reputational damage has spread to employees of the industry, psychologists and ethics coaches said.
The sector employs around 450,000 people, or 4 percent of Australia's workforce.
""They are experiencing a range of adverse effects: a sense of embarrassment and shame through association (and) fatigue caused by the need to respond to the extraordinary demands for documentation,"" said Simon Longstaff, executive director of The Ethics Centre which wrote the voluntary ""Banking and Finance Oath"" for industry employees after the financial crisis.
Thomas Clarke, a professor at University of Technology, Sydney's business school, said students shared the disillusionment, but ""just as customers have nowhere else to go but the big banks, our students looking for a career can hardly dismiss them lightly"".
At a University of Sydney open day last month, there was no sign of waning interest in business studies, as crowds of bright-eyed juniors and academics brushed off the detail of the inquiry's revelations to focus instead on their future.
""We talk about the Royal Commission at the classroom,"" said Yuvraj Kang, a final year finance student running one of the many information stalls.
""It's important that it is happening (but) it doesn't change my perception of working at a bank. At the end of the day, you are still trying to work with good people, maximize efficiency and add value to the clients or customers and that doesn't change.""

So far 34 people have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported, CDC said on Tuesday, adding that three more states - Delaware, Maine and Minnesota - have reported cases of illnesses.
Kellogg had in June decided to recall an estimated 1.3 million cases of its Honey Smacks cereal from more than 30 U.S. states due to the potential for Salmonella contamination.
However, the contaminated cereal is still being sold in some locations, CDC said, citing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Illnesses in this outbreak started on dates ranging from March 3 to Aug. 7, CDC said, adding the investigation is still ongoing. 
Kellogg had not yet shipped any new cereal to retailers and that people who bought the potentially affected product can contact it for a full refund, the company said in a statement

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Tuesday briefly joined Apple Inc (O:AAPL) to become the second $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company after its stock price more than doubled in a year as it grew rapidly in retail and cloud computing.
Its shares traded as high as $2,050.50 before easing a little to end the session at $2,039.51, up 1.3 percent and just short of the milestone level of $2,050.2677.
If the online retailer's shares keep up their recent pace, it would be a matter of when, not if, Amazon's stock market valuation eclipses that of iPhone maker Apple, which reached $1 trillion on Aug. 2. 
Apple took almost 38 years as a public company to achieve the trillion dollar milestone, while Amazon got there in 21 years. While Apple's iPhone and other devices remain popular and its revenues are growing, it is not keeping up with Amazon's blistering sales growth.
Amazon has impressed investors by diversifying into virtually every corner of the retail industry, altering how consumers buy products and putting big pressure on many brick-and-mortar stores. 
""It says a lot about Amazon and its ever-increasing dominance of segments of the retailing world as well as the web services business,” said Peter Tuz, President Of Chase Investment Counsel In Charlottesville, Virginia. ""They have a tiny share of the worldwide retail sales market so there’s a lot left to capture there.""
(Graphic: Amazon vs. Apple: https://reut.rs/2PwtdRg)
Amazon also provides video streaming services and bought upscale supermarket Whole Foods. And its cloud computing services for companies have become its main profit driver. 
""Amazon's a little bit more dynamic than Apple because the iPhone has become more mature. Amazon's cloud business is an extra growth driver that Apple doesn't have,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta who describes Amazon's cloud services as its ""crown jewel."" 
In the second quarter the unit accounted for 55 percent of Amazon's operating income and 20 percent of total revenue, according to Morgan. 
Apple started trading in December 1980 but its stock did not truly start to take flight for another 25 years, spurred by the iPhone, the breakthrough device that left competitors in the dust.
Amazon - founded as an online book-retailer in Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' garage in 1994 - started trading on May 15, 1997 at $1.50 on a split-adjusted basis. 
By October 2009 it had risen to $100 and the stock hit $1,000 for the first time on May 30, 2017. It has held above that level since Oct. 27, 2017.
Just 10 months later, on Aug. 30, Amazon shares hit $2,000 for the first time, just $50 per share away from giving the company a $1 trillion market value. 
(Graphic: Analyst Price Targets: https://reut.rs/2NHwHQq)
The stock is up 74.5 percent year to date. In comparison, Apple has risen about 35.0percent in 2018. 

Analysts expect Apple's revenue to jump 14.9 percent in its fiscal year ending in September, according to Thomson Reuters data, a hefty rise but still far short of Amazon’s expected revenue growth of 32 percent for 2018.

1. Twitter CEO Heads to the Hill
Expect Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock to be active tomorrow as its CEO, Jack Dorsey, appears on Capitol Hill.
Dorsey will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee and say that Twitter “does not use political ideology to make any decisions,” according to his prepared statement released today.
“We do not shadowban anyone based on political ideology,” he said in the statement. “In fact, from a simple business perspective and to serve the public conversation, Twitter is incentivized to keep all voices on the platform,”
Twitter and other social media and tech companies have come under fire from President Donald Trump, who alleged censorship of conservative voices.
In relation to Russian interference to the 2016 election, Dorsey said; “We now possess a deeper understanding of both the scope and tactics used by malicious actors to manipulate our platform and sow division across Twitter more broadly.”
2. Trade Balance Figures Arrive
Trade is still front of mind on Wall Street and tomorrow brings the latest data on the U.S. trade deficit.
On average, economists expect that the deficit widened to $50.3 billion in July, compared with $46.3 billion in June.
Exports were at about $214 billion in June, with imports at about $260 billion.
Talks between the U.S. and Canada about Canada joining a revised trilateral NAFTA agreement are set to continue tomorrow. On Friday, the White House notified Congress of its intent to move ahead with a trade deal struck with Mexico in 90 days that Canada can still join.
3. U.S. Faces More Push and Pull
Trade also continues to impact the U.S. dollar, as does the latest data underscoring strong economic growth.
Along with negotiations with Canada, greater tension between the U.S. and China is expected when President Donald Trump puts tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, as anticipated.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by about 0.29%.
U.S. manufacturing business conditions surged in August to a 14-year high, according to a survey of industry executives.
ISM manufacturing data  for August rose to a reading of 61.3, beating expectations of 58.1. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates anexpansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy.
In addition, currency traders will be looking ahead to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting later this month. There is a certainty that the Fed will hike at this meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed rate monitor. So, hints about December’s meeting will likely have the most impact."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Major U.S. corporations bringing home cash from abroad, thanks to President Donald Trump's tax overhaul, have boosted share buybacks but there is little evidence they are reinvesting much of that money to expand, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December, slashed the corporate income tax rate and charged multinationals a one-time tax on profits held overseas. As a result, companies repatriated over $300 billion in the first quarter.
(Graphic: U.S. companies repatriated about $300bn in Q1 2018: https://reut.rs/2P9t9aK)
In those three months, share buybacks spiked among the 15 U.S. companies with the largest holdings of cash abroad, according to research published by the Fed on Monday, which did not name them. Those companies bought back $55 billion of their own shares in the March quarter, more than double what they spent on buybacks in the prior quarter, according to the Fed's research. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) snapped up a record $43 billion of its stock in the first six months of 2018, exceeding the stock market value of almost three-quarters of the companies in the S&P 500 and helping push its stock market value above $1 trillion last month.
Evidence that companies invested repatriated cash to grow their businesses was limited, according to the study. The Fed paper detected no spike in capital expenditures and R&D in early 2018, but it noted that the top 15 cash holders' levels of capital expenditures have been slightly increasing in recent years relative to other companies.
Proponents of the tax reform argued that cutting corporate taxes and making it easier for U.S. companies to bring home profits from overseas would lead firms to reinvest that money to grow their businesses.
Increased spending on buildings, assembly lines and R&D indicates companies expect to expand over the long term, while buying back shares is widely viewed as a way to increase stock prices and return unproductive capital to shareholders better able to reinvest it.

On Sept. 19, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is expected to report current account data for the second quarter, including cash repatriated by companies from abroad.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Top U.S. regulator calls for 'reset' in relations with other countries,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - How the United States supervises cross-border derivatives is flawed and needs resetting to avoid fragmenting markets and placing undue burden on companies, a top U.S. regulator said on Tuesday.
In a speech that will be widely seen as targeting the European Union, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agency was guilty of overreach by regulating firms that were not based in the United States but did business with U.S. customers.
He said it was not surprising the foreign regulators did the same.
This ""overly expansive, unduly complex"" approach has shown insufficient deference to other countries even though they comply with the same international standards applied in the United States.
The CFTC will soon publish a ""White Paper"" setting out a more thoughtful ""next act"" for regulating the cross border swaps market, Giancarlo told an audience in London's financial district.
""In a number of areas, the White Paper will recognize deficiencies in the CFTC's current approach to regulating cross-border activities and seek to recalibrate the CFTC's cross-border approach based on a set of guiding principles,"" he said.
""The CFTC should pursue multilateralism, not unilateralism for swaps reforms that are designed to mitigate systemic risk,"" he said.
Giancarlo said the aim was to spur dialogue among CFTC commissioners before a final decision was taken. He said he was meeting with regulators in the EU and Japan later in the week.
The next version of CFTC cross-border rules would focus better on addressing systemic risks from foreign firms to the U.S. financial system, leaving supervision of trading practices and market structures like clearing houses to their home supervisor, he said.
Scott O'Malia, a former CFTC commissioner and now chief executive of global derivatives industry body ISDA, said he welcomed the thoughtful, risk-based approach.
Giancarlo's pledge follows CFTC criticism of overreach in a draft EU law that would give EU regulators a role in supervising U.S.-based clearing houses that service customers in the bloc, encroaching on the CFTC's turf.
Giancarlo has said it should be amended to avoid harm to U.S. businesses, saying the EU should defer to the CFTC when it comes to supervising American clearing houses.
""I have been pretty firm with our friends in Brussels, the notion that there would be two sets of hands on the steering wheel is not something that we would support,"" Giancarlo said on Tuesday.
BREXIT BOOST?
Giancarlo said an approach based on deference when it comes to margin, trading venues, clearing houses or other areas was essential to ensuring a strong and stable derivatives market that supports economic growth within and outside the United States.
The call for a ""deference""-based approach between regulators from different countries will be welcomed by Britain in its bid to maintain London as Europe's biggest center for clearing euro-denominated derivatives after leaving the EU next March.
Financial industry officials in the City are seeking to enlist global support to persuade the EU to ""enhance"" or broaden its system of financial market access in time for Brexit.
But France has said large chunks of euro clearing should move to the euro zone after Brexit so that EU regulators can supervise the activity properly.
Britain says this is not necessary as it will still be complying with the same international financial rules as those enforced in the bloc.

Asked if the CFTC would implement the new approach unilaterally, Giancarlo said the agency would be ""very cognizant"" of what foreign regulators do before deciding whether to defer to them. He declined to give any timeline.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said that the decision by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) could open the way for Vattenfall to receive billions of euros in compensation.
It cited a copy of the ICSID decision in a two-paragraph digest of a report due to be published in its Wednesday edition.
Vattenfall said it was not immediately in a position to comment.
The company is seeking 4.7 billion euros ($5.44 billion) in damages over a decision by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to phase out nuclear power following the 2011 disaster at Japan's Fukushima plant.
Utilities E.ON (DE:EONGn), RWE (DE:RWEG) and Vattenfall sued the German government, arguing that the decision to close all nuclear plants by 2022 amounted to expropriation.
Germany's highest court ruled in 2016 that utility companies were allowed to seek limited damages from the German government over the hastening of nuclear plant shutdowns.
Vattenfall first turned to the ICSID in 2012 with the filing of a complaint against the German state. Germany sought in a letter to the arbitration panel in April to have the case thrown out. 
Berlin cited a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) on a similar case, where arbitration from a court outside an EU country in relation to a case between a company and a member state was found to be invalid.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 01:12PM ET</span>","Citigroup CFO Gerspach to retire, be replaced by Mason: memo","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and David Henry
ZURICH/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc's (N:C) longtime Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach will retire in March, to be replaced by Mark Mason, CFO of the institutional clients group, the third-largest U.S. bank told employees on Tuesday.
Gerspach, an accountant, joined Citigroup in 1990 and became CFO in July 2009. He became known for fielding analyst questions about the company's irregular progress in divesting businesses, satisfying new capital rules imposed by regulators and failing to meet financial targets.
He also had to answer for problems that cropped up at far-flung operations around the world, including losing $500 million on fraudulent loans in its Mexican bank.
""He has represented our company exceptionally well, not just in good times but in tough ones as well,"" Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat said in the memo seen by Reuters.
Corbat also announced that North America CEO Bill Mills and Europe, Middle East and Africa CEO Jim Cowles would be leaving the bank at year-end, and named Kristine Braden, who is country officer for Switzerland, as his new chief of staff.
The changes follow an executive shuffle a few weeks ago at Citigroup's consumer bank, which has had trouble keeping up with performance expectations on Wall Street.
Mason takes over the CFO role at a time of investor frustration with Citigroup's lagging stock price. Its shares trade for about 1.2 times tangible book value compared with 2.1 times for shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets. 
The institutional clients group where Mason is now finance chief provides trading, lending, treasury and investment banking services to large companies. He is also responsible for submitting Citigroup's capital plans to the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its annual stress test, a process that determines how much money the bank can return to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks.
In prior roles, Mason worked closely with Corbat to unload Citigroup's troubled assets following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and later ran the private bank that caters to ultra-wealthy individuals.
Mason grew up in Queens, New York, and lived in a house overlooking an expressway to John F. Kennedy International Airport, he said in a 2017 podcast interview with the president of Howard University, his alma mater.
He and his younger brother were raised by a single mother with help from family members who lived nearby. He went to public schools until attending Howard for his undergraduate degree, then getting an MBA from Harvard Business School.

""We didn't have much, but we had a lot of family,"" Mason said. ""So, it was a good childhood, but it was one that was short of money in ways, so I learned very early on the importance of hard work and the correlation between that and achievement and money.""

673,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",U.S. SUV sales jump again in August,"By Rachit Vats and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Top automakers pointed to a small increase in U.S. auto sales in August including another sharp rise in SUV sales, as low unemployment and strong consumer confidence helped mitigate the impact of rising interest rates and fuel prices.
The reports from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and other top carmakers follow a rise in consumer confidence to a near 18-year high which allayed fears about the impact of President Trump's protectionist trade policy on sentiment. 
Analysts said the results were roughly on track to meet Reuters-compiled consensus forecasts for the annualized pace of U.S. car and light truck sales of 16.8 million units for the month, compared to 16.6 million a year ago.
Ford, the No.2 U.S. automaker, sold 218,504 vehicles in August, compared with 209,897 a year ago, when Labor Day sales efforts were marred by the arrival of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. 
The rise included a 20.1 percent surge in sales of sport utility vehicles while pickup truck sales rose 5.7 percent. 
Ford's head of US Marketing, Mark LaNeve, said annualized seasonally adjusted U.S. car and light truck sales (SAAR) were between 17.0 million and 17.4 million in August, including medium and heavy trucks which typically make up around 300,000 units.
""The overall health of the consumer is very strong right now, which provides a solid base for our industry,"" LaNeve said.
""On an absolute basis, we estimate overall industry sales to be flat, but it could make it up as high as being up 1 percent while we're still pulling in some of the numbers.""
U.S. auto sales dropped 2 percent last year from a record 17.55 million in 2016 as consumers shifted away from traditional passenger cars toward larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks, which are also more profitable for automakers.
Ford said earlier this year it would gradually cease production of most passenger cars in the United States. Its new Navigator SUV had an average transaction price of $84,000, up $30,000 a year ago when the previous design was being sold. The company sold 1,522 of the large SUVs last month, up from 755 in the same period last year.
Rival Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), which has a larger share of cheaper passenger vehicles, said its U.S. sales had fallen 2 percent to 223,055 vehicles in August. Its SUV sales rose 8.9 percent.
General Motors (N:GM), the No. 1 U.S. automaker, no longer reports monthly sales. Industry analysts last week estimated GM sales fell about 8.5 percent in August.
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) said U.S. sales were up 10 percent to 193,718 vehicles in August, led by Jeep and Ram.
The U.S. jobs market is viewed as being near or at full employment, helping to support consumer spending and boost the overall economy. 
Yet many analysts are forecasting weaker auto sales for the second half of 2018 and further declines in U.S. vehicle demand next year.
Ford's Senior Americas Economist Bryan Bezold said that US industry sales could go higher but were more likely to plateau where they are now.
""Overall, the data suggests continued economic growth in the second half, albeit with the signs of increasing price pressures,"" he said. 
""Economic conditions remain broadly supportive of vehicle sales around the recent run rate as we head into traditionally strong retail SAAR month later in the year.""
Honda Motor Co Ltd's (T:7267) U.S. sales rose 1.3 percent in August to 147,903 units, lead by a roughly 19 percent increase in sales of SUVs including CR-V and Odyssey minivans.

Nissan Group's August sales rose about 4 percent to 112,376 vehicles, helped by higher sales of crossovers such as Murano and Rogue.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>",Kaepernick ad spurs Nike boycott campaign,"By Uday Sampath Kumar and Emma Thomasson
(Reuters) - Protesters on social media called for people to burn their  Nike  sneakers and boycott the sporting goods maker after it chose former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem as a protest against racism, to participate in a new ad campaign.
Shares in the Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) fell more than 2 percent after Kaepernick posted a black-and-white close-up of himself on Instagram on Monday featuring the Nike logo and ""Just do it"" slogan, along with the quote: ""Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.""
Kaepernick will be one of several faces for a campaign marking the 30th anniversary of Nike's ""Just Do It"" slogan. He has been sponsored by Nike since 2011 but has reportedly negotiated a new deal with the U.S. brand that will include a signature shoe and apparel.
President Donald Trump has been critical of athletes taking a knee during the national anthem and has said he would love to see NFL owners fire football players who disrespect the American flag.
Nike is just the latest sports brand to face boycott calls, which industry analysts said can alienate some customers, while winning over others, but often blow over quickly.
""Nike is not a stranger for backing sporting personalities who take views and act on them. Politicizing sport is likely to result in polarizing demographics,"" said John Guy, an analyst at Mainfirst Bank in London.
""Freedom of speech is one of America’s core tenants, so placing this freedom within a sporting context for a brand as big as Nike will always make headlines,"" he added.
Under Armour faced criticism last year after its chief executive made comments supporting Trump, while Adidas (DE:ADSGN) drew calls in May to cut its ties to rapper Kanye West after he described slavery as a choice and praised Trump. 
The customers Nike could lose will be more than made up for by attracting new younger consumers who are looking to buy brands that stand behind political topics, said Jessica Ramirez, a retail analyst with Jane Hali & Associates.
Noting the fleeting effect of calls for boycotts of Under Armour and Adidas, she added: ""We don't hear much about it today.""
TRENDING TOPIC
Over 30,000 people were tweeting with the hashtag #NikeBoycott on Tuesday morning, making it among the top trending topics on Twitter. Some posted images of themselves burning and ripping their Nike shoes and apparel.
""First the @NFL forces me to choose between my favorite sport and my country. I chose country,"" Twitter user @sclancy79 said in a post retweeted 16,000 times. ""Then @Nike forces me to choose between my favorite shoes and my country. Since when did the American Flag and the National Anthem become offensive?""
Others edited the ad to show images of U.S. army veterans with the same caption, criticizing Nike for signing the athlete and saying it disrespected the memory of fallen soldiers. 
Still, there were a large number of other users who responded positively to Nike taking a stand on social issues. 
Athletes including LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Serena Williams and Chris Paul showed support, posting images of Kaepernick's ad on their Instagram profiles.
Even former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in, tweeting: ""The #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster. Even though he is one of the best Quarterbacks in the league.""
CORE DEMOGRAPHIC?
Some analysts said the boycott would not have a big impact on Nike, which in June reported a major sales rebound in its North America business and forecast strong growth for 2019.
""The alt-right calls for a Nike boycott will fail just like the boycott of Dick's Sporting Goods failed,"" said Matt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD Group. ""Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike."" 
Gun rights supporters called for the boycott of Dick's Sporting Goods earlier this year after the retailer stopped selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines following a massacre at a Florida high school in February.
Another analyst, GlobalData Retail's Neil Saunders, said the campaign will harm Nike in middle America, where it is battling Germany's Adidas for dominance in the sneaker market.
""The company's stand may go down well on its native West Coast; it will be far less welcome in many other locations,"" he said. 

Nike, which confirmed on Monday that Kaepernick was part of the campaign and called him ""one of the inspirational athletes of his generation"", did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

In the tweet, Trump claimed that NBC’s journalistic standards were worse than those he believes are practiced at CNN, a long-time ""fake news"" media target of the president.
NBC has been under scrutiny on allegations that the network attempted to kill Ronan Farrow’s report on the Harvey Weinstein sex scandal in Hollywood that served as the basis for launching the #MeToo movement against sexual discrimination in the film industry.
Farrow accused NBC of providing “numerous false or misleading statements” when the network defended its handling of the report.
Farrow insisted that he took the story to another outlet “only after it became clear that I was blocked from further reporting”.

Of the 316,405 vehicles registered in Germany last month, only 32.6 percent went to private owners, KBA statistics showed. VW brand registrations rose by 46.2 percent and registrations at its premium brand Audi and Porsche jumped by 45.3 percent, and 60.8 percent respectively, KBA statistics published on Tuesday showed.
Volkswagen had warned that the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which came into force in September, would dampen sales in September and October. The carmaker rented multi-storey car parks and open parking lots to store the vehicles it cannot yet deliver. 
From September onward, only half of VW's 14 passenger car models are compliant with the new standard, the carmaker said, drastically curtailing its offering in September and October. 

Registrations of Mercedes passenger cars dipped 10.9 percent, while BMW recorded a 3.1 percent jump during the same period.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>","Prudential launches consumer-direct insurance, investing service","By Suzanne Barlyn
NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) -  Prudential  Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU) is going straight to consumers with its insurance and investment products for the first time in its 143-year history, a move that follows rivals and startups which are already well established in the field.
The direct-to-consumer service marks a sea change for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential (LON:PRU), the largest U.S. life insurance company by assets, managing $1.4 trillion, according to a filing. 
Prudential is also one the oldest U.S. insurance and investment companies, which has traditionally sold its products through a large network of advisers as well as employer-sponsored insurance and retirement plans.
Prudential quietly unveiled the service, LINK by Prudential, in August, which offers personalized financial planning, recommendations for insurance, annuities and investments in a portfolio of exchange-traded funds, Prudential executives said in an interview. 
Customers can buy products through the LINK website, through remote advisers, or set up one-on-one meetings with local advisers. 
The shift, which comes long after insurance and financial services competitors have established an online presence and dozens of online life insurance startups have sprouted up, is an effort to balance a growing demand for online sales, without alienating the sales force that has played a large role in building the company.
Prudential's advisers continue to play a ""critical role"" in the company's success, said Stephen Pelletier, chief operating officer of Prudential’s U.S.-based businesses.
""Given where the investing world is going, this makes sense,"" said Sandler O'Neill analyst John Barnidge, noting that the service is just one piece of Prudential's multifaceted business. ""Millennials and other younger people have large purchasing power,"" Barnidge said, adding that they do not value insurance agent relationships as much as previous generations. 
The company's service differs from others sold direct to consumers because it offers a more ""seamless experience,"" with customers able to get advice and buy both insurance and financial products from the same site, or choose from different levels of advisory services, said Naveen Agarwal, Prudential's chief customer officer. 
Prudential’s goals also include finding new ways to grow business from customers it now serves through existing businesses. The insurer and investment company already works with 5 million customers who buy its insurance, income and investment products through Prudential's adviser network.
Prudential will also make the service available to 20 million people through workplace businesses, including retirement plans and pension payments it took over from other companies that bought group annuities, Pelletier said.

699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Honda’s Rough Accord Results Highlight America’s Shift to SUVs,"(Bloomberg) -- Honda Motor Co. (T:7267) extended a bleak stretch for a car model widely regarded as one of the best on the U.S. market, showing just how swift consumer demand has shifted to SUVs and away from sedans.
Total deliveries for Honda rose 1.3 percent last month, trailing analysts’ average estimate. While sport utility vehicles including the Honda Pilot and Acura RDX are setting sales records, the Accord’s 11 percent drop lengthened a dismal run of declines to 10 straight months. Sedans also slumped for Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. as consumers snubbed models like the Camry and Fusion.
The Accord’s spell has spoiled Honda taking home the hardware for the North American Car of the Year award in January. While the family sedan won plaudits for sleeker styling, roomier interior and a standard safety system that recognizes traffic signs, Honda decided to dial back production so that it could boost the number of CR-V crossovers it builds for what’s been the hottest segment of the market.
SUVs including car-based crossovers like the CR-V “continue with their sharp improvement trajectories,” Ryan Brinkman, a JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). analyst, wrote in a report last week. As a result, he predicted the industry probably increased average vehicle selling prices again in August.
U.S. auto demand has been a little better than analysts anticipated entering the year, as surging demand for relatively spacious and fuel-efficient SUVs has offset collapsing demand for traditional car models.

700,By Business Insider,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>","MoviePass is trading at just 2 cents a share, but investors are still piling into bets it's headed to zero","But that doesn't seem to be enough for ruthless short sellers, who are continuing to load up on bets the company's stock is headed to zero.
It's unusual behavior for investors to continue wagering against a stock once its price has fallen below $1 a share, according to financial-analytics firm S3 Partners. At that point, traders usually close out positions and take profits.
But the high-profile nature of MoviePass — combined with the speed of its decline — has clearly kept the attention of investors, even as shares hover near just two cents. Their insistence upon continuing to short, even at such depressed levels, suggests a high degree of conviction.
The chart below shows notional short interest — a measure of bets against a stock — for Helios & Matheson. As you can see, it's surged in recent months as MoviePass' woes have mounted.
This insatiable desire for short-selling profits stands in stark contrast to the issues faced by the legions of retail shareholders who have taken deep losses. And to make matters worse, as Helios & Matheson's stock has tumbled, the company has covered massive losses by selling new shares to passionate investors.
Meanwhile, the fundamentals of Helios & Matheson are getting shakier by the day. Just last week, a director resigned from the company's board, accusing management of withholding material information for months. A few days earlier, reports began trickling out that MoviePass was making life difficult for annual subscribers who wanted refunds.
And that's just in recent days.
All of the negative turmoil could explain why short sellers have been so adamant about continuing to bet against a company that's already quite beaten down.
""Usually we see a plateauing of shares shorted when we get to such low price levels because traders don’t see much meat on the bone,"" Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's managing director of predictive analytics, told Business Insider over email.
""But in HMNY’s case, traders must be thinking that HMNY’s stock price will go to $0.00, otherwise they wouldn’t be initiating new short positions."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) will build wings for its F-16 combat plane in India with its local partner, Tata Advanced Systems Limited, an executive at the U.S. company said on Tuesday. 
Lockheed is bidding for a contract - estimated at more than $15 billion - to supply the Indian air force with 114 combat planes, which must be all manufactured locally under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship Make in India program. 
However, Vivek Lall, vice president of strategy and business development at Lockheed, said the proposed Indian production of the F-16 wings would not be contingent upon the company winning the order for the planes. 
""Producing F-16 wings in India will strengthen Lockheed Martin' strategic partnership with Tata and support Make in India,"" the company said in a statement.
Modi has been pushing for local manufacturing that will provide jobs and also end the military's dependence on imports.
Lockheed's announcement came just days ahead of top level talks between the United States and India aimed at expanding defense ties. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. 
Boeing (N:BA) has pitched its F/A-18 Super Hornet for the Indian contract as well as Sweden's Saab with its Gripen fighter. France’s Dassault (PA:AVMD) Systemes SE’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also in the fray.
Lall said Lockheed had offered to make India its sole F-16 production facility that would supply the Indian military but also other countries. ""If India buys the F-16 then it becomes the center of manufacturing for the global market,"" he said. 
Lall said the company planned to begin production of the F-16 wings in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad from 2020. He said these were being produced at a facility in Israel and would not impact any jobs in the United States. 
The Israeli center will continue to be involved in other production, he said. ""All F-16 wings globally are to be built in the Hyderabad facility,"" he said.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>",Back from the brink: How Noble Group was saved from an Iceberg collision,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In May 2017, Paul Brough had just assumed the chairmanship of Noble Group and immediately faced a room full of angry bankers demanding their money back from the struggling commodity trader. 
Mustering all his 25-plus years of experience as a restructuring specialist, Brough needed their support to keep the credit lines open that underpinned the operations of what had once been Asia's biggest commodity trading house.
At the meeting in Amsterdam in late May, banks were shocked by a recently reported quarterly loss and were in no mood to keep supporting the company.
GRAPHIC: Rise & fall of Noble Group - https://tmsnrt.rs/2NcfXDN
""The atmosphere in the room was highly charged,"" Brough told Reuters in an interview last week. ""A number of them were already taking the decision that they wanted to exit the relationship,"" said Brough, a former senior regional partner at KPMG in Hong Kong who helped wind up the Asian business of Lehman Brothers.
The following week's meeting with U.S. banks did not go much better, with Brough, 61, saying the banks ""made it very clear that they wanted their secure debt repaid very, very quickly.""
However, Brough, who managed China's Sino-Forest after its $4 billion collapse in 2011, convinced the U.S. banks to give Noble a 120-day debt reprieve to sell its assets in the United States.
From there, Brough, who took over from company founder Richard Elman, brought Noble back from among the biggest near-death corporate experiences in Asia. The company last week secured shareholder support for a $3.5 billion debt restructuring.
In the 15 months between Brough's appointment and last week's deal, Noble dramatically downsized and reported a $4.9 billion loss for 2017, including a $2.1 billion valuation adjustment of its controversial derivatives contracts.
By the time Brough became chairman, Noble had fended off two years of accusations by Iceberg Research that it had inflated its assets. Noble, which has stood by its accounts, later revealed Iceberg to be led by ex-Noble credit analyst Arnaud Vagner.
When Brough took charge, Noble had lost 80 percent, or nearly $5 billion in market value, since Iceberg issued its first report in February 2015.
Brough reckons he traveled 500,000 miles negotiating with hundreds of creditors and shareholders from Hong Kong and Singapore to New York, London and Amsterdam.Noble then hired investment bank Moelis & Company and lawyers Kirkland & Ellis, specialists in debt restructurings, the first sign of a possible wholesale restructure.
PJT Partners and Comprador Ltd joined as financial advisors as Brough unveiled a strategic review of Noble. He brought together seven of its core trade finance banks at the Amsterdam meeting.
Those banks included MUFG Bank, ING Bank and Rabobank. MUFG and ING declined to comment, while Rabobank said it does not comment on individual clients as a policy. 
""It was really one of those meetings that served as a kick-off meeting where everybody was put on alert,"" said a person who participated in the talks.
COMPLEX RESTRUCTURING
Noble's rescue is viewed as one of the most complex debt restructurings due to its global trading business and the mix of creditors, from banks to different strata of bondholders and shareholders.
""The dual needs of keeping Noble adequately capitalized with trade finance at a time when bankers were very nervous about relationships and when customers are also very nervous, meant that it was very, very challenging,"" said Neil McDonald, a partner at Kirkland Ellis.
When Noble won an extension for its credit facilities in June 2017, its shares surged 50 percent, but bond prices slid after it skipped an interest payment.
""We had to call banks morning, noon and night to make sure they were comfortable with the restructuring,"" said one advisor. For Brough, those summer months were the lowest point in the salvage operation, with ""banks making aggressive requests"" and there were times Noble could have run out of cash.
""We found ourselves having to increase the margin that we were giving banks for our trade finance facilities and for our brokerage facilities,"" he said.
GLIMMER OF HOPE
Noble agreed to sell its U.S. gas and power business to Mercuria for $248 million last July, a deal that also increased its trade finance access. Then in October, it announced the sale of its most capital-intensive business, oil trading, to Vitol for $1.2 billion. ""The first glimmer of hope was when we announced the sale of the oil business,"" said Brough, who will step down after the restructured company, focusing on coal and freight trading in Asia, kicks off later this year.
In November, Noble formally announced the debt restructure and then agreed to a deal to give creditors 80 percent of the new company equity. Resistance from big shareholders such as Elman, and Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi-based fund, put it at risk.
But in March, Noble's creditors agreed to give existing shareholders a 20 percent equity share, up from a previous 10 percent, with an ultimatum - back the proposal or face insolvency.
However, Iceberg's Vagner says the new Noble will still be debt-heavy. ""Most importantly, interest skyrockets. So, it will incur almost the same interest costs,"" he told Reuters by email.

Noble will also gain $800 million in trade financing and hedging facilities from ING and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), the last two banks supporting the company, down from 70 banks five years ago.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's state-controlled airline Finnair (HE:FIA1S) has turned to the financial world for its new chief executive, appointing Nordea Bank's (ST:NDA) Topi Manner to take the role from January.
Manner, 44, currently works as the head of personal banking at the Nordic region's biggest bank and he will succeed departing Finnair boss Pekka Vauramo. Vauramo is widely credited with returning the airline to profit growth on the back of cost cuts and a focus on passengers flying between Europe and Asia. 
""Topi Manner has extensive experience in both private and corporate customer business, and he has played a strong role in the digital transformation and customer service development of his bank,"" Finnair Chairman Jouko Karvinen told a news conference.
Manner has worked for more than 20 years at the bank in different positions.
Vauramo, Finnair CEO since 2013, is joining engineering company  Metso  (HE:METSO) in November.
Share in 55.8 percent state-owned Finnair were down 0.65 percent in a weak market.
The airline suffered a setback in July when it warned that a substantial increase in fuel prices would weigh on profits in the second half of the year.
Inderes analyst Antti Viljakainen told Reuters he did not anticipate major changes to Finnair's strategy under the new management.
""Chairman... highlighted (Manner's) experience in people-centric leadership. It is of the utmost importance at Finnair, to be able to balance between the personnel groups and the owners,"" said Viljakainen, who has an ""accumulate"" rating on the stock.

Manner takes the helm of an airline that has struggled for several years to compete with discount carriers and had difficulties in restructuring its operations due to strong trade unions. Also, relations with the state have been strained.
A board member for management compensation quit earlier this year after the government criticized a supplementary pension arrangement for Vauramo. In 2012, the government replaced six of its board members due to lack of openness in compensation decisions.
In the past years, some former and current government officials have looked into scrapping a clause that obliges the state to own more than 50 percent of Finnair, saying the change would pave the way for Finnair to take part in industry consolidation.
However, the idea has proved too sensitive for politicians. 
Chairman Karvinen, asked on the ownership, told Reuters that the company was focused on developing its business ""under the current situation"".

""For sure, we think about all kinds of strategic options. I have a peaceful mind... and we will always discuss these matters directly with the owners,"" he said.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell slightly in late morning trade on Tuesday, reversing a positive open as investors remained cautious due to worries the U.S. could slap new tariffs on imports from China.
Losses in British advertising group WPP (LON:WPP) after a margin outlook cut and weakness among telecoms also weighed, dragging the STOXX 600 index (STOXX) 0.27 percent lower by 0902 GMT.
Washington is expected to decide whether to implement a plan to tax an extra $200 billion of Chinese imports following a public comment period that expires on Thursday. 
WPP was the biggest faller on the pan-European index, down 7.3 percent, after the company said profitability would decline this year, although a rise in sales helped it nudge its full-year net sales outlook higher. 
""WPP is weak because there is a margin outlook cut for 2018 and the message is that turning around this behemoth is going to take time and be costly,"" said Neil Campling, Co-Head Global Thematic Group at Mirabaud Securities.
""There was also some hope that we might see quick progress on asset sales or merging of units but the message from the new CEO is not to expect wholesale changes,"" he added.
Telecoms were the biggest sectoral fallers, down 1 percent, and led lower by  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) which fell 5.5 percent after Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral, saying the market underestimated the threat from fiber competition. 
In France, telecoms operator  Iliad  (PA:ILD) cut its mid-term profitability targets after suffering in the first half its first loss of mobile subscribers since the launch of its mobile business in 2012. However, its shares, which have already fallen more than 40 percent this year, rose 4 percent. 
Financials were the biggest gainers, supported by strength among some Italian banks as government bond yields fell following soothing comments from Italian ministers on forthcoming budget proposals.
Among Italian banks, which are seen as a proxy for political risk due to their large sovereign debt holdings, UBI Banca (MI:UBI) led the way, up 4.3 percent, while Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and BPER Banca (MI:EMII) rose more than 2 percent. 
""We guess the ruling coalition doesn't want to (commit) suicide by presenting 2019 deficit targets near 3 percent compared to the 0.8 percent planned. We guess they will present something acceptable and incorporated in BTP and Stock market prices,"" said Fidentiis in a note to clients. 
Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) woes weighed on its shares, which were down more than 4 percent following a report suggesting its Estonian branch handled $30 billion of non-residents' money in 2013.
 ING Groep  (AS:INGA) also fell, down 2.8 percent, after news the Dutch bank will pay 775 million euros in a settlement with prosecutors, who accused its financial controls of being so poor that customers were able to easily launder money.

Elsewhere,  Scor  (PA:SCOR) rose 8.7 percent after the French re-insurer rejected a friendly takeover offer by Covea.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 05:49AM ET</span>","Automakers fret as China clamps down on capacity, seeks consolidation","By Norihiko Shirouzu and Yilei Sun
BEIJING (Reuters) - Some automakers in China are alarmed by proposed government restrictions on investing in new manufacturing capacity and the ways in which Beijing is trying to trigger consolidation of the country’s flabby auto industry through mergers and strategic cooperation. 
China's National Development and Reform Commission, seeking to address mounting excess auto manufacturing capacity, wants to restrict ways automakers can invest in new capacity to manufacture traditional gasoline-fueled cars as well as electric battery cars, according to a draft of the policy which has made public.
To be allowed to invest in greenfield developments such as new factories, automakers would need to have healthy, above-industry-average capacity utilization and R&D investment, and a commitment to green cars and exports, among other conditions.
Industry players are alarmed by the prospects because they say very few automakers would be able to meet the conditions fully if the proposed policy took effect as drafted.
“It basically means, more or less, no more new factories. The government wants us to use existing idled factories to expand capacity instead,” a China-based executive with a global automaker said.
The proposed new rules come at a time when some automakers, especially Toyota Motor Co (T:7203), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Geely [GEELY.UL] are growing their market share in China and are keen to investment in new capacity. 
NDRC wants to prevent the excess capacity problem from becoming a crisis similar to those that have previously hit a score of other industries in China – from solar panels to steel to ship building, according to the four sources. 
By making it difficult for automakers to install new capacity, China’s industrial policymakers want to trigger an industry consolidation, say the sources - two industry officials and two executives from automakers.
NDRC did not respond to a request for comment.
BLOATED INDUSTRY
According to a 2017 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a third of China’s overall capacity in 2018, or 14 million of the 42.8 million vehicles a year capacity, is estimated to be idled.
China's auto industry has grown rapidly, helped by generous subsidies and funds from the central government, as well as provinces trying to accelerate development and competing to create jobs. 
PwC says China now has some 80 automotive groups and more than 180 vehicle assemblers but many have not had meaningful output or sales for years. Now, with growth set to slow and a slew of startups racing to add capacity to make electric cars, less successful producers face being squeezed out of the market. 
The proposed policy, which NDRC published for public comment in July, says the agency wants to “encourage enterprises to carry out merging, reconstruction and strategic cooperation through equity investment and other modes, so as to... organize production jointly and enhance industrial concentration.”
The industry largely supports the “spirit” of the new policy but wants to see the NDRC dial down the restrictions, according to the four individuals who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
“Our biggest concern is that the new policy, as proposed, places obstacles to a healthy, spontaneous development of the industry,” said one of the two industry officials representing foreign automakers. “It deprives us of the discretion we have in freely formulating business plans and invest without interventions.” 
NDRC indicated over the weekend it may modify the proposed rules but remained insistent on policing investments.
At an industry conference in Tianjin on Saturday, Nian Yong, head of NDRC’s Department of Industry Coordination, said the agency will strictly prevent “haphazard investment and redundant development” in the auto industry, apparently referring to the proposed rules. Nian said Beijing will soon publish and implement the new rules, without elaborating.
BOOM AND BUST
Xu Haidong, an assistant secretary general of industry body the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said capital was flowing into the sector on expectations of long-term growth.
""But given the all-known historical pattern of booms and busts, the state should prevent investment from losing control, prevent blind construction, disorderly development, and promote high-quality development,” Xu told Reuters.
There is, however, a view among some industry officials that no matter how severely NDRC restricts investments for new manufacturing capacity, the decree might be disregarded given fierce competition among different cities and provinces chasing investments. 
“Provincial governments will prioritize attracting new investments as in the process will find ways to ignore NDRC’s rules,” one of the two industry officials said.
According to the proposed rules, any automaker planning to invest in new capacity for gasoline fueled cars and hybrids would have to clear five conditions, including the utilization rates for its manufacturing capacity being above industry average, and its output of so-called new-energy vehicles being above industry average.
Draft conditions also include hard-to-meet thresholds for R&D spending, export sales and vehicle production capacity utilization rates in provinces where new plants are proposed, including for EVs.
Already, there is evidence that automakers are being asked to help cut back excess capacity.
When Nissan decided to boost its China capacity by 40 percent to as many as 2.1 million vehicles a year by 2021, it said nearly half the new capacity would come from two existing assembly plants, even though it is looking to build a new plant in Wuhan.
Toyota, which is looking to boost its China capacity over the next few years by 240,000 vehicles a year, or by about 20 percent, plans to add extra capacity to its existing manufacturing facilities in Tianjin and the southern China city of Guangzhou. Toyota declined to comment.
One industry executive said they understood the government wanted to maximize existing capacity, but the reality was ""much more complicated"". 

""Companies and executives have egos, but most important, they want to invest the way they want to – freely and without constraints,” the executive said.

The airline, which has been hard hit by strike actions by its French employees, appointed a new CEO on Aug. 17 to steer the group through a fraught stand-off with unions in France. 
The following day it was warned by Dutch pilots they would consider strike action later this year unless the airline begins hiring new staff more aggressively to ease their workload and give them sufficient rest between flights.
The Dutch union said on Tuesday that a mediator had helped union leaders reach a compromise with KLM's management under which longer rest periods will go into effect earlier than planned.
The deal must still be approved by members, but the union said it will not proceed with strike preparations.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Sales of Lego dinosaurs and a Bugatti sports car helped the Danish toymaker stabilize revenue in the first half of this year after a drop in 2017 for the first time in more than a decade. 
The privately-owned firm, famous for its colorful plastic bricks, pushed the ""reset button"" last year, acknowledging its business had grown too complicated.
Its attempts to recover have been hampered by the bankruptcy of the biggest U.S. toy-store chain Toys'R'Us, but demand for new products such as the dinosaur-themed Jurassic World range helped to steady revenue in the first six months of the year.
""I am satisfied, because we set out to stabilize growth this year and we have already done it during the first half,"" Chief Executive Niels B. Christiansen told Reuters. 
Overall, consumer sales grew 1 percent during the half, while revenue was flat in constant currencies and fell 5 percent in Danish crowns to 14.3 billion crowns ($2.23 billion) - a far cry from the 25 percent growth achieved in 2015.
The fastest-growing ranges were the advanced Technic series, the warrior-themed Ninjago, the Creator range that can be built into several designs, and the Classic series. 
Successful innovation is crucial to Lego, as 60 percent of its portfolio consists of new products each year. 
Sales in Western Europe grew in the low-single digits, measured in constant currencies, while North America declined slightly. China remained a bright spot with double-digit growth, although it accounts for less than 10 percent of group sales.
Lego, an abbreviation of the Danish ""leg godt"" meaning ""play well"", plans to open two flagship stores in Shanghai and Beijing and continue its partnership with Chinese internet giant Tencent.
It is also working with local education departments, state schools and the private education providers in China to get kids playing with Lego as a way to boost motor skills, creativity and attention spans.
""The Chinese appreciate and emphasize that children learn something when they play ... There is a really nice fit between China and Lego,"" said Christiansen, who joined Lego last year after nine years as CEO of Danish industrial group Danfoss. 
Lego, which competes with the likes of Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT) and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), the firm behind My Little Pony, is also betting on toys that combine the physical brick with the online world.
One successful example, according to Christiansen, is an app with which kids can write a simple code to control a self-built DUPLO train or Batmobil.

722,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Tesla’s Cobalt-Light Batteries Seen Providing Cost Advantage,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s lead in battery technology gives it a cost advantage that may last for several years and help the U.S. electric-car maker face down an onslaught of new competition, according to new research from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
Batteries made by the U.S. manufacturer and its Japanese partner, Panasonic Corp., require less cobalt, the metal whose price has shot up with demand for electric cars. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on June 5 said Tesla is targeting a cell-level price of $100 per kilowatt-hour in 2018 and battery-pack costs below that level within two years. BNEF doesn’t expect average pack prices to drop below $100 until 2025.
“If Tesla reaches its pack-price milestone, it will be several years ahead of our industry benchmark,” BNEF said in the report. The researchers noted that others made batteries for as low as $120 per kilowatt hour in 2017, “which suggests that Tesla is not alone in being ahead of the curve.”
Tesla hasn’t been able to extend its U.S. dominance in electric cars to other regions, and is now under threat from new models coming from European brands like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler, Volvo Cars and BMW. The competition will be toughest in the SUV and crossover segment, where the Model X goes up against new models from Jaguar Land Rover’s I-Pace, Audi’s coming E-Tron and the Hyundai Kona, due in 2019.
Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz unveils its EQC crossover on Tuesday in Stockholm, part of a plan to invest at least 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) to develop a range of electric vehicles.
With expanded consumer choice, competition will focus not just on the availability of electric cars, “but by more prosaic issues such as price, build quality, aftermarket services and user experience,” the report said. “If Tesla is to maintain its early leadership in the EV industry, it may have some ground to catch up in these areas against the established automakers.”
By contrast, Tesla and China’s BYD Co. are the only two vertically integrated electric-car makers, “which may confer a long-term advantage if battery technology becomes a major differentiator,” the report said.
BYD is the leader in global electric-car sales, with 9.9 percent of the market, according to BNEF. Tesla is just behind at 9.7 percent.
In other areas, the results are mixed. Tesla is improving production of the Model 3 and its products will still stand out through 2020, BNEF said. The company will need significant investments in China and to develop its semi-truck, Model Y and pickup truck, the report said.
Meanwhile, delays to an upgrade of its Autopilot feature and a lack of mobility services leave it behind other carmakers, the report said. The Solar City business it acquired for $2.1 billion hasn’t lived up to expectations.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:55AM ET</span>",Ryanair passenger numbers up 9 percent in strike-hit August,"(Reuters) - Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair (I:RYA) flew 9 percent more passengers in August than a year ago, it said on Tuesday, its purchase of Austrian carrier Laudamotion helping offset the impact of strikes and staff shortages. 
Ryanair came to terms with its Irish pilots late last month after strikes and shortages caused 550 flight cancellations in August compared to just 27 a year ago. 
The Irish airline endured its worst one-day strike earlier in August after a walk-out by pilots in five European countries disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 people at the height of the summer holiday season.
The airline is still stuck in negotiations with other trade unions, with Dutch pilots' body VNV saying the Irish agreement did not appear to cover all the issues at stake in its conflict.
Separate figures for traffic at European budget carrier Wizzair, which competes with Ryanair in eastern Europe and flies around a quarter as many passengers, showed numbers up 20 percent year on year. [nRSD6294Za]

Ryanair's total traffic grew to 13.8 million passengers, including half a million from its purchase of Laudamotion, which EU regulators approved in July.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>",Alcoa braces for alumina strike vote in Western Australia,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A vote by striking workers at Alcoa's (N:AA) giant west Australian operations will close on Thursday, with the union anticipating a strong ""no"" vote that could prolong the four-week old strike.
Around 1,500 workers at three alumina refineries and two bauxite mines in Western Australia state walked out on Aug. 8 over a new workplace agreement that they say does not offer sufficient job security.
The refineries account for around 9.3 million tonnes of capacity or some 8 percent of the world supply of alumina, which is used to make aluminum.
An extended outage threatens to further stress a market already suffering from a global shortfall.
An  Alcoa  spokeswoman said the company had contingency plans to ensure operations can continue during industrial action.
""We have not experienced any significant impact from the action to date and will continue to assess the situation as it develops,"" she said.
Alumina prices rally on global shortfall: https://reut.rs/2N7DcPF
A shortfall in alumina has grown this year due to U.S. sanctions against global aluminum maker UC Rusal (HK:0486) and the partial closure of the world's biggest alumina plant, Norsk Hydro's (OL:NHY) Alunorte in Brazil. 
Prices for alumina futures  traded at $558 a tonne this week, up by a quarter from $450 in late June. In the physical market, a recent tender went for $632, traders said.
Australian producers of alumina, South 32 (AX:S32) and Alumina Ltd (AX:AWC), both said last month that they expect high prices for the alumina to stretch into next year based on tight global supply, while Chinese producers have stepped up exports. 
Alcoa last year also won regulatory approval to ship 2.5 million tonnes of West Australian bauxite to third-party customers, on top of the production it supplies to feed its Western Australian alumina refineries.
Alcoa said it had offered employees a generous agreement that provided income growth on top of already ""very competitive pay and conditions."" 
Australian Workers' Union (AWU) Western Australian branch secretary Mike Zoetbrood said the union had seen ""no movement on the 'job security' issue"" with Alcoa, and was waiting for the ballot result due this Friday.
""We anticipate a very strong 'no' vote from the members,"" Zoetbrood said in an emailed response to questions.
Alcoa also said there had been an ""operational issue"" at the Pinjarra alumina refinery over the weekend that was ""unrelated"" to the industrial action. The problem has been fixed. 
The refineries and mines are owned by Alcoa of Australia Ltd, which is part of the AWAC group of companies and owned 60 percent by Alcoa and 40 percent by Alumina Ltd.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 07:24PM ET</span>","In India, Google races to parry the rise of Facebook","By Paresh Dave and Sankalp Phartiyal
SAN FRANCISCO/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Google retains only a slight lead over Facebook in the competition for digital ad dollars in the crucial India market, sources familiar with the figures say, even though the search giant has been in the country far longer and has avoided the controversies that have dogged its rival.
Facebook's success has shaken Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, led by an Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has made developing markets a priority.
Google officials in India earlier this year were alarmed to learn that  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was likely to generate about $980 million in revenue in the country in 2018, according to one of the sources. Google's India revenues reached $1 billion only last year.
Facebook and Google declined to comment on Indian revenue figures or the competition between the two companies. 
Google is now pushing back, attempting to lure customers with better ad-buying tools and more localized services. The revamped strategy mirrors initiatives that have succeeded in boosting the time Indian consumers spend with Google services.
The battle in India reflects an epic challenge for Google in developing markets around the world that are crucial to the company's long-term growth - many consumers in those country's are gravitating to Facebook and it's siblings, Instagram and WhatsApp, at the expense of Google search and YouTube, and advertising dollars are quick to follow.
""Facebook is a far more user-friendly platform even though they haven't created features specifically for Indian advertisers,"" said Vikas Chawla, who runs a small ad-buying agency in India. 
Facebook ads, compared with those on Google search or YouTube, tend to transcend language barriers more easily because they rely more on visual elements, said Narayan Murthy Ivaturi, vice president at FreakOut Pte Ltd, a Singapore-headquartered digital marketing firm. Pinpointing younger consumers and rural populations is easier with Facebook and its Instagram app, he and other ad buyers said.
And Facebook is succeeding in India, which boasts the fastest-growing digital ad market of any major economy, despite internal turmoil and political controversy. It has been without a country head for the last year, and has faced a series of incidents in which rumors circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp have prompted mob violence.
Facebook and Google between them took 68 percent of India's digital ad market last year, according to advertising buyer Magna. Media agency GroupM estimates digital advertising spending will grow 30 percent in India this year.
The Facebook phenomenon is evident close to home for Google. During a recent lunch period, six out of 10 people who walked out of Google's Bangalore offices while looking at their phones told Reuters they were checking WhatsApp. All 10 said they regularly used Whatsapp.
Eight Indian ad buyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Facebook would overtake Google in Indian ad revenue. That such a question would even be debated explains why Pichai, Google's chief executive, has pressed to flip the company's approach to emerging markets. 
""India is the most important market for the 'Next Billion Users' initiative,"" Caesar Sengupta, the head of the effort, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual ""Google for India"" event in New Delhi last week.
NEW TACTICS
For many years Google designed its services for early adopters of new technology, who tended to be in Silicon Valley, said Nelson Mattos, who oversaw Google's Europe and Africa operations for several years. Great products would then find a broad global audience. 
""Over time, as you saw the growth of Facebook, the importance of WhatsApp and other tools in these new markets, and not the same adoption of Google, the company started to realize that maybe they had to change that approach,"" Mattos said.
Shortly after taking the helm three years ago, Pichai mapped a new strategy for places such as India: More services tailored to locals; more marketing on radio, billboards and TV; more local staff and start-up investment. 
Google's India workforce has more than doubled since to more than 4,000 employees, or about eight times Facebook's presence, according to a tally of LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles and company statements. 
Its products evolved too, becoming easier to use with low data plans. Smartphone apps such as Files Go and Tez - rebranded last week as Google Pay - were aimed at Indians. 
""There's definitely a sea change,"" said Asif Baki, a user researcher at Google who oversees two-week ""immersion trips"" in developing markets for senior executives and staff.
The efforts are bearing fruit. Indian users during the first half of this year spent more time on Google services than on Facebook services, according to estimates from audience measurement firm Comscore. Over a similar period a year ago, Facebook came out on top. 
Extending those gains to the ad business is a work in progress. A handful of Google executives, including leaders for display ads and small business advertisers, traveled to India earlier this year in a previously unreported trip to better understand the needs of Indian clients. 
The visit spurred them to consider ideas such as enabling advertisers to reach users only in a particular Indian state, since language and literacy vary greatly around the country, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
At the New Delhi event, Google unveiled a plan to bring Indian newspaper content online, to increase the supply of search results - and ads - available in regional languages. 
Google still has to reckon with other issues. Small businesses in emerging markets are less likely to have websites, a foundation for Google ad campaigns but unnecessary for Facebook. 
Executives met with one Indian merchant who recorded product videos on YouTube then messaged the links to potential customers on WhatsApp, said Kim Spalding, the company's general manager and product lead for small business ads. 

    Facebook, meanwhile, is already on to commercializing such behavior. Just weeks ago, it began charging for text-based marketing features on WhatsApp, with video ads expected to launch next year.

734,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Philippine Stock Rebound Faces Skepticism Before Inflation Data,"(Bloomberg) -- Philippine inflation data this week may help determine whether one of Asia’s worst performing stock markets can continue its road to recovery.
Traders at AB Capital and Investment Corp. and Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. are warning that the Philippine Stock Exchange Index could face a bout of profit-taking, just as a tentative rebound has begun that has seen it rise more than 12 percent from a 17-month low in June. Among their concerns are rising inflation, a falling peso and decelerating economic growth.
Investors are waiting to see if August inflation data Wednesday supports a view that a record $1.37 billion exodus of foreign funds this year has made equity valuations cheap. The report may also signal whether the central bank’s rate hikes have had an impact on price rises, which are running at the fastest pace in nine years. An increase in inflation was among the concerns that knocked Philippine stocks down 16 percent in the first half of 2018, the worst performance in Asia.
“Until the market gets a better sense of macro-economic conditions, it’s still possible to get blindsided by unfavorable numbers,"" said Gerard Abad, who helps manage $355 million as chief investment officer at AB Capital in Manila. “Given that there are still risks moving forward it’s prudent to pocket some gains and keep some cash.""
Just in case there’s a selloff, Abad has been shifting some money from the AB Capital Equity Fund, up 12.5 percent this quarter, to time deposits. The PSEi could slump 11 percent based on Monday’s close to 7,000 this year should inflation exceed 6 percent and third-quarter economic growth drop below 6 percent, he said.
Inflation is seen accelerating to 5.9 percent in August from July’s 5.7 percent, according to the median of a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Steven Ko, a trader at Rizal Bank, said the index may sink below its support at 7,500 should the data show that inflation exceeded 6 percent, but could rebound to 8,200 by year-end. He has been selling outperforming stocks in recent weeks and is investing in either cash or shares that have lagged the benchmark, which closed at 7,832.22 on Monday.
“The market has gone up too fast, too soon,"" said Ko. But, “there are still large undervalued names out there, while the banks are providing some good value.""
While cautious about the market’s prospects, AB Capital’s Abad said he is also investing in larger capitalized companies that may rise if foreign funds return to the market. He is also looking at stocks outside of the benchmark index such as San Miguel Food and Beverage Inc., his biggest holding.
Still, he doesn’t think valuations in general are attractive in the Philippines. He points out that the ratio of the nation’s stock prices to estimated earnings is among the highest in Asia, even though it’s about one standard deviation below the five-year average. Better earnings visibility is needed for the stock market to extend its rally, he said.
“It’s nice to be hopeful that the market will breach 8,000 but investors shouldn’t be faulted for cashing in some of their gains,” Abad said. “Hopefully, we get better corporate earnings because valuations aren’t really cheap.""
Wilson Sy, a fund manager at Philequity Management Inc., said the benchmark could break the resistance at 8,000 but it will require a stable peso, a resolution of the global trade war and a corporate earnings growth recovery from a “dismal"" 4.3 percent expansion in the first half. Otherwise, a correction to as low as 7,400 is possible. He has selectively added to his holdings, preferring stocks that reported better-than-expected earnings.
“It’s still fraught with danger and risks but we are already on the slow road to recovery"" he said.

738,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Argentina Taxes Exports to Balance Budget as Crisis Bites,"(Bloomberg) -- Argentina will impose taxes on exporters as it looks to balance its budget in 2019, a year earlier than planned, after the peso collapsed last week and investor concern grew about the government’s ability to finance itself.
The government will also eliminate about half of the current cabinet ministries to reduce spending, President Mauricio Macri said in an almost 30-minute speech that started more than an hour later than planned. The government will target a fiscal surplus by 2020, Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne said at a press conference after Macri spoke.
“To cover the shortfall during this transition we are going to ask those who have the greatest ability to contribute to pay,” Macri said. “It is a failure to not reach a balanced budget. This isn’t any other crisis. It has to be our last one.”
The changes are intended to signal a shift in the government’s strategy as it heads into talks on Tuesday with the International Monetary Fund to speed up the disbursement of cash from a $50 billion credit line. Crippling inflation, a historic drought and the world’s highest interest rate are holding back the economy, which is set to enter its second recession in three years. Macri vowed to tighten spending and focus on bringing the fiscal deficit as close as possible to zero in 2019.
The peso fell to 38 per dollar on thin trading after the news because of the holiday in the U.S. The benchmark Merval stock index was down, led by Aluar Aluminio Argentina, an exporter of aluminum. The stock dropped 5.7 percent, while food exporter Cresud slid 1.7 percent.
The announcement follows one of Argentina’s most turbulent weeks in recent memory. The peso fell 16 percent after Macri made the surprise request last Wednesday to seek faster payments from the IMF. The central bank sold reserves and hiked its key interest rate to 60 percent from 45 percent.
“This is good news because now the bar has been set to achieve fiscal balance in 2019 and a decent surplus in 2020,” said Walter Stoeppelwerth, chief investment officer at Balanz Capital. Macri’s party “still does not have a spokesman who can generate confidence in the market, and the failure to inject new blood into the economic team is a problem. We are in intensive care and it will remain to be seen how long it will take for the government to regain market confidence.”
Peso Selloff
Even before last week’s selloff, Argentina was having a rough year. After officials predicted strong growth and lower inflation at the beginning of 2018, a mix of bad luck, vague communication and confusing policies put Argentina on track for a recession after a record drought curbed soy output and inflation crimped consumer demand.
Rising U.S. interest rates in April and an emerging market selloff in August added to the peso’s problems. August was the peso’s worst month since the country’s historic debt crisis in 2001. Officials now see the economy contracting 1 percent this year and that estimate is likely to deteriorate further.
Disjointed communication compounded the peso’s pain. Macri’s request was not confirmed by the IMF for much of Wednesday, until Managing Director Christine Lagarde said later in the day she would review the stand-by agreement. Investor concern mounted due to lack of detail about both Macri’s request and the government’s plans to cut its fiscal deficit.
Macri is in a pinch to please investors by cutting spending, while ensuring that the belt-tightening of austerity doesn’t cause social upheaval ahead of next year’s election.
“Prices may stabilize at these battered levels, but the electoral impact of this adjustment will be strong,” said Alejo Costa, BTG Pactual Argentina’s chief strategist. “The government tried to contain the political impact with the export taxes, but either way activity will remain depressed.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France's  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) expects penalties relating to its dispute with U.S. authorities over international sanctions violations to be close to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) which would almost entirely be covered by provisions.
""Societe Generale expects that the amount of the penalties in the U.S. Sanctions Matter will be almost entirely covered by the provision for disputes allocated to this matter,"" the bank said in an update released on Monday.
The bank's provisions set aside to cover penalties related to legal disputes totals 1.43 billion euros.
Societe Generale, which has been dogged for more than a year by a series of costly legal disputes, said it expects the issue to be settled within the coming weeks.
The last case that remains to be settled relates to dollar transfers made on behalf of entities based in countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions.
Over 2017 and 2018, the bank has regularly raised the provisions set aside to cover potential losses related to the settlements. However, this is the first time the bank has given an estimate of the amount a settlement may reach.
In June, it agreed to pay $1.3 billion to authorities in the U.S. and France to end the disputes over transactions made with Libya and over the suspected rigging of Libor, a key interest rate used in contracts worth trillions of dollars globally.
As part of the process to settle the Libor case, the bank's deputy CEO in charge of investment banking activities Didier Valet left in March.

Societe Generale had already paid 963 million euros in mid 2017 to settle another dispute with the Libyan Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund.

LONDON (Reuters) - A private equity fund run by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management (GSAM) has bought a minority stake in multi-strategy hedge fund firm LMR Partners, one source familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The GSAM fund bought a stake of between 10 percent and 20 percent in LMR for an undisclosed sum, the source said.
A spokesman for LMR Partners, which has offices in London, Hong Kong and New York, declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs also declined to comment.
LMR Partners, which uses both computer-driven and discretionary trading styles, has $5 billion in assets under management, its website said.
The GSAM fund is part of its Petershill range of funds, launched in 2007 to take stakes in alternative asset managers. While Petershill I has already closed, GSAM's Petershill II and Petershill PE funds are both still active.
The Petershill funds currently has $4.5 billion of investments in alternative asset managers, with previous investments including macro hedge fund Caxton Associates, credit-focused Knighthead Capital Management and equity-focused Pelham Capital.
Petershill has also previously invested in high-profile British quantitative hedge fund firm Winton Group, among others.
LMR Partners' $2.7 billion LMR Fund Ltd made gains of 2.8 percent in the year to Aug. 10, after returns of 10.2 percent in 2017, data compiled by HSBC showed.

750,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",Danone CEO to sit on Carrefour's healthy food advisory committee,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) -  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Europe's largest retailer, said on Monday that the head of yogurt maker  Danone  (PA:DANO) will sit on a food advisory committee the supermarket group is setting up as it seeks to boost sales of organic products.
Carrefour said in January it would revamp its food range and focus more on organic food as customers demand healthier products, under a global five-year plan to increase group sales and profits.
""The group's ambition is to lead the food transition ... This is a big challenge. We absolutely must prove our new positioning to the customer through very strong, precise and coherent actions,"" CEO Alexandre Bompard told journalists on Monday.
The new food advisory committee will be led by Carrefour's Group Secretary General Laurent Vallée, who in January was tasked to spearhead food transformation across the Carrefour group.
It will include seven people from outside the group including a French chef, a farmer, a cancer researcher, as well as Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber, who has said he wants the world's biggest yogurt maker to play a central role in the revolution sweeping the global food industry.
As more consumers, notably the “Millennial” generation, opt for healthier diets and a more socially responsible way of life, retailers as well as large consumer goods group such as Danone or rival Nestle (S:NESN), have been seeking to adapt.
Danone bought U.S. organic food producer WhiteWave in a $12.5 billion deal, bringing the company more into line with healthier eating trends and its boss will part of a committee that shares best practices and ideas with Carrefour.
Carrefour's five-year overhaul announced in January also entails cutting costs, boosting E-commerce investment and expansion into convenience stores in the face of fierce competition from more agile rivals like Leclerc, and challenges from online retail giants like Amazon (O:AMZN).
Under the plan, Carrefour, which is France's top organic food retailer, targets 5 billion euros in organic food sales by 2022, compared to 1.2 billion generated in 2017.
""Changing lifestyle habits, an increasing focus on health and food quality as well as growing distrust of the food industry in the wake of recent health scandals is propelling fresh and organic food sales higher in France, allowing retailers to benefit from higher prices and strengthen their earnings and margins, amidst a fiercely competitive environment,"" Vincent Gusdorf, senior analyst at Moody's said in a recent note.
In 2017 organic food sales in France rose 17 percent to 8.4 billion euros from 2016, according to organic food agency Agence Bio.
Carrefour also on Monday unveiled Act For Food, a worldwide program to educate customers about its initiatives to tackle issues such as food safety, product origin and relationships with farmers.

In July, Carrefour bought So.Bio, specialized in the distribution of organic products, with revenue of nearly 40 million euros. So.Bio currently has eight stores in South West France. Carrefour will open three new So.Bio stores by early 2019, including one in Paris and one in Toulouse.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The CEO of JD.com Inc (O:JD), Richard Liu, has returned to China, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, days after he was arrested by police in the U.S. city of Minneapolis on suspicion of criminal sexual conduct and later released.
Police said an investigation was ongoing.
JD.com has said that the accusation against Liu, 45, was unsubstantiated. 
A Minnesota-based lawyer for Liu, Earl Gray, said Liu denies any wrongdoing, and added he does not expect his client to be charged, noting that Liu was released without charges or bail, and was allowed to return to China.
""Under these circumstances based on our substantial experience in the criminal justice system in Minnesota charges are highly unlikely in the future to be brought against our client,"" Gray said in an emailed statement. 
Minneapolis police said on Sunday that ""an active investigation"" was under way, although it was possible for the billionaire founder of the firm to leave the United States.
Reuters has not been able to reach Liu for comment.
""We don't know if there will be charges or not because we haven't concluded an investigation,"" John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, told Reuters on Sunday. He declined to provide details of the arrest.
In addition to making Liu the highest-profile Chinese businessperson to be accused publicly of sexual misconduct, the case has raised concerns that loss-making Nasdaq-listed JD.com could face difficulties making decisions due to its unusual governance structure.
The company is backed by Walmart Inc (N:WMT), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and China's Tencent Holdings (HK:0700). 
JD.com's rules require Liu, who holds nearly 80 percent of the company's voting rights, to be present at board meetings for the board to make decisions, although it was not immediately clear if he has to be physically present or could participate by teleconference.
""I'm not aware of any other company that has similar rules,"" said Chris Leahy, co-founder of advisory firm Blackpeak and a corporate governance expert.
""If the board isn't quorate without Richard Liu, if he is unable to attend, and if there are no other provisions that offer a way round that, the company could become ungovernable,"" he said.
The Financial Times, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, reported that the case involved Liu, who is a student in the University of Minnesota's doctor of business administration program, and a Chinese student at the university. 
While the doctoral program primarily takes place in Beijing in partnership with the prestigious Tsinghua University, the students were in the Twin Cities last week as part of their training. According to its website, the program is designed for top-level executives working in China, and the average age of participants is 50.
The complaint against Liu was made just before midnight local time on Friday, and he was released just after 4 p.m. on Saturday, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff website.
University spokeswoman Emma Bauer referred questions to the Minneapolis Police Department.
China's foreign ministry said its consulate in Chicago was closely watching the situation.
""We are currently seeking information and verification from the relevant U.S. departments,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular Beijing news conference on Monday.
SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE
Chinese social media was abuzz over the arrest, with a thread on Liu's police booking photo ranking as the most discussed topic on China's Weibo platform on Monday morning, read more than 250 million times.
JD.com, one of China's tech heavyweights, competes with larger rival  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA), and Liu has a net worth of $7.9 billion, according to Forbes. The company, worth some $45 billion, has seen its stock lose 24 percent of its value this year amid concerns of weakening growth momentum.
The company has been in and out of the red for the past year and last month reported a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million - almost twice market estimates - reflecting increased investment.
Liu built JD.com from scratch. In 1998, he spent 12,000 yuan ($1,760) of his savings to lease a four-square-meter retail space in Beijing's technology hub of Zhongguancun, setting up a firm that would become JD.com. He is also known for his marriage to Chinese internet celebrity Zhang Zetian.
Zhang, described by Chinese media as aged 24, shot to fame while a student in 2009 when a photo of her holding a cup of milk tea went viral, giving her the nickname ""Sister Milk Tea"". She met Liu while studying in the United States and married him in 2015.
In July, a court in Australia denied Liu's efforts to block the release of his name in association with a sexual assault trial in which he was not accused of any wrongdoing, according to a court document.
In that case, Liu had hosted a party in late 2015 at his luxury home in Sydney, after which one of his guests accused another guest of sexually assaulting her at a hotel. The defendant was found guilty of seven offenses, according to a court document. 
Trade in JD.com shares is set to resume on Tuesday as U.S. markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell for a third straight day on Monday, hurt by worries over the escalation of trade disputes between world powers and a deepening sell-off across emerging market currencies.
With U.S. markets closed for Labor Day, trading activity was generally subdued.
European shares were largely flat (STOXX) (GDAXI) (FCHI), although London's blue-chip FTSE rallied almost 1 percent (FTSE) thanks to a weak British pound.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) and Tokyo's blue-chip Nikkei <.N225> shed about 0.7 percent each. 
MSCI's All-Country World Index, (MIWD00000PUS), a gauge of 47 markets, dipped 0.2 percent and the main emerging equity index fell 0.7 percent (MSCIEF), bearing the brunt of global trade fears.
U.S. President Donald Trump said at the weekend there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle with the trade talks.
Worries about U.S. tensions with China were also kept alive by a report last week that Trump had told aides he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday.
That would be a major escalation given the United States has already applied tariffs on $50 billion of exports from China.
""As we head into a new week and month, trade concerns will remain front and center of investors' minds, along with increasing concerns about stability in emerging markets, after the sharp declines seen in Argentina and Turkey’s currency last week,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
There was also bad news on the economic outlook with surveys showing manufacturing activity took a hit from weak orders in August, a sign firms are feeling the pinch from an intensifying global trade war that could derail global growth.
The surveys of purchasing managers showed mounting pressure on factories across Europe and Asia, with data later expected to show the United States is in the same grip. [nL3N1VP2ZY] 
""There are a few existential threats to the world and a broad based trade war is one,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva.
""We're in a scary parallel to the 1920s and 1930s when there was piecemeal protectionism as we are seeing now."" 
Across emerging markets, turbulence continued. 
Turkey's lira led emerging currency losses after data showed inflation spiked to almost 18 percent in August, while the Indonesian rupiah fell  to its lowest levels in 20 years.
The Brazilian real weakened more than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar , while the Iranian rial was reported to have hit a record low against the U.S. currency.
The lira, at the center of emerging market turmoil in recent weeks, fell 1 percent to 6.62 per dollar .
Central bank comments that the inflation outlook showed ""significant risks"" to price stability and that it would adjust its monetary stance at its upcoming meeting on Sept. 13 in line with this view helped contain the losses. 
""This morning's inflation number was very high and the authorities still haven't got a credible strategy to deal with that,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told Reuters that the central bank was independent of government and it would take all necessary steps to combat inflation.
STERLING TROUBLE
Among major currencies, the British pound stood out as the big underperformer, hurt by comments by the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he was ""strongly opposed"" to British proposals on future trade ties after it leaves the EU.
News that British manufacturers had their weakest month in over two years and export orders suffered a rare fall in August exacerbated sterling's fall.
The currency was last down 0.7 percent at $1.2874  and weakened 0.8 percent against the euro (EURGBP=D3) to 90.24 pence, helping lift London's blue-chip FTSE 0.95 percent.

Global trade concerns supported the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's value against a basket of other major currencies, was flat at 95.13 after nearing its highest level since Aug. 27. 
But gains were muted - safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc  and the Japanese yen  were supported against higher-yielding rivals.
In European bond markets, Italian bond yields edged lower (IT10YT=RR) after Fitch Ratings left its credit rating unchanged at BBB on Friday, revising only its outlook to negative. 
Oil prices meanwhile rose, supported by concerns that falling Iranian output will tighten markets once U.S. sanctions bite from November, but gains were limited by higher supply from OPEC and the United States.

Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 63 cents at $78.27 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) was 26 cents higher at $70.05.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Electric Mercedes opens German assault on Tesla,"By Esha Vaish and Laurence Frost
STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz is set to unveil its much-anticipated electric SUV on Tuesday, marking the start of a German onslaught against Tesla's (O:TSLA) dominance of the fast-growing market for premium battery cars.
Daimler-owned (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes, BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi and Porsche divisions are all gunning for the $52 billion Californian upstart, with early publicity efforts emulating its tech-industry halo.
The market for upscale electric cars is Tesla's to lose, with sales of its entry-level Model 3 sedan expected to reach about 50,000 cars this year and almost double that in 2019.
The Mercedes EQC - whose launch program in Stockholm features yoga in a direct appeal to the Millennials who have flocked to Tesla - is the first production model under the carmaker's electric EQ sub-brand. It will be closely followed by similarly hyped debuts for BMW and Audi.
""While Tesla currently has a strong hold on the luxury electric market, I don't think this will be the case after the arrival of the German premium offerings,"" said Wajih Hossenally, an automotive powertrain analyst with IHS Markit.
""Tesla has virtually zero competition - but this will change from 2019 onwards.""
Rival forecaster LMC Automotive agrees, predicting a steady decline in Tesla's share of an exploding electric-car market over the next decade, from today's 12.3 percent to 2.8 percent, even as its absolute sales continue to rise.
The Germans' combined market share will surpass Tesla's to reach 11.8 percent in 2020 before increasing further to about 19 percent three years later, according to its projections.
The new Mercedes, due to reach its first customers next year, will be priced close to the fuel-burning GLC to compete in the same bracket as Tesla's $49,000 Model 3, helped by its hotter-selling SUV form.
An affordable Model Y SUV is slated to join Tesla's high-end Model X crossover and Model S car, but not before 2020-21.

TECH BUZZ
The EQC softens its higher-riding proportions with sporty curves and a distinctive full-width rear light, while the interior resembles that of the Mercedes C-Class - a reminder of economies of scale that electric-only Tesla cannot match.
Well aware that their earlier battery-car offerings have failed to get anything like Tesla's level of public attention, the German brands are doggedly courting Silicon Valley-style buzz for the coming product blitz.
Executives including Mercedes Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche have taken to appearing in jeans and sneakers, responding to a broader tech-industry incursion into areas such as autonomous driving and connected services.
When it came to the EQC launch, Mercedes picked the city of Stockholm for its startup scene and green credentials, then began firing off teasers on Instagram as well as Twitter.
Like Tesla, Mercedes is announcing EQC orders in Norway even before its price. It has amassed more than 2,000 refundable deposits of 20,000 crowns ($2,400) in Europe's biggest electric-car market, where Tesla sold 8,500 vehicles last year.
The launch is the centerpiece of a three-day event that features DJ sets and yoga with a YouTube star - almost literally bending over backwards to telegraph 21st-century kudos.
Audi on Monday began production of its e-Tron SUV ahead of a Sept. 17 sales launch jamboree in San Francisco, just 40 miles from Tesla's Fremont assembly plant. It also plans to begin taking reservations backed by refundable $1,000 deposits.
The e-Tron is due in showrooms early next year, followed in 2020 by two more electric Audis and the Porsche Taycan sports car from its Volkswagen Group stablemate.
WOW FACTOR
Not to be outdone, BMW has hired a Lufthansa cargo jet to fly its electric Vision iNext - still just a concept car - from Munich to Beijing via New York and, of course, San Francisco. Events are planned in all four cities over five days.
In another Tesla-inspired move, the three German carmakers are developing their own network of fast-chargers along major highways in a partnership with Ford (N:F).
While some experts doubt the Germans can ever match the wow factor around Tesla and its founding boss Elon Musk, many also wonder whether they need to.
""German manufacturers have highly desirable, fun-to-drive premium cars in their DNA,"" said Nicolai Mueller, a McKinsey partner based in Cologne. ""That's a very good starting point.""
Tesla used its powerful tech aura to persuade early adopters to pay a premium for an all-electric car from a relative unknown, with no quality track-record or physical dealerships for servicing and support.
But the German carmakers have a century of manufacturing behind them, with sterling brands, well developed global sales networks and an existing customer base in the millions.
BMW's i3 mini and an earlier Audi e-Tron failed to shift large volumes, but the electric-car market has matured since. LMC sees China driving global sales growth above 50 percent annually as the German offensive gets underway in 2019-20.
By then the Model S flagship will be eight years old. Musk, by tweeting then withdrawing plans to take Tesla private, has sharpened doubts about the company's ability to keep expanding and updating its lineup.
""Tesla is potentially facing a product shortfall starting in 2020,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois warned investors in a note last week.
Tyler Martin, a Tesla owner in Tucson, Arizona, said he had yet to decide whether to buy a Model 3 next - after his current Model S suffered from ""build quality"" issues requiring several trips to the repair shop each year.
One big question is whether competitors can offer a viable alternative to Tesla's proprietary fast-charging network, the 28-year-old software entrepreneur said.

If they can, Martin added, ""I would definitely consider another brand.""

Comments about Zara products “are poor and declining” on consumer-review websites Trustpilot and Sitejabber, the analyst wrote in a note previewing owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) SA’s first-half results on Sept. 12.
“We believe the ‘treasure trove’ nature of a Zara shop is still a better experience off-line,” Irwin wrote. While online is driving like-for-like sales growth, that can have a negative impact on gross margin, he also said.
The broker estimates that the Web will represent about 10 percent of Inditex’s sales this year, up from 2.4 percent in 2013. It also expects 2018 to be the sixth consecutive year of Ebit margin decline.
Inditex shares had their worst week in seven years last week, falling 8.7 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) published a scathing report saying the retailer has gone from great to good.
Credit Suisse lowered its price target to 24 euros from 25 euros and maintained its underperform recommendation.

On Monday, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal dismissed an appeal by Moody’s Investors Service Hong Kong Limited in relation to the Securities and Futures Commission’s (SFC) disciplinary action concerning a ""special comment"" report Moody’s published in 2011, the SFC said in a statement.
The case has been watched closely by the financial industry and corporate governance activists as it could redefine the limits on what can be written in reports on public companies and potentially curtail the activities of Hong Kong re
search firms.
Credit ratings agencies have been directly regulated by the SFC since June 2011.
In July 2011 Moody's published a report that raised concerns about corporate governance at 49 Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong.
Following an inquiry into the report, the SFC fined and reprimanded Moody's in November 2014, but Moody's appealed against the action to the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal, which did not uphold all aspects of the SFC’s claims against Moody’s, and slashed the fine.
Moody's later appealed to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal and then the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. [https://tinyurl.com/y7bh7e2h] [https://tinyurl.com/ybrvd6ul]

776,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>","After $40 Billion Exit, Morgan Stanley Says Give Europe a Chance","(Bloomberg) -- No other region has suffered Europe’s massive outflows this year, and that’s exactly why  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says it’s time for investors to take a fresh look at these stocks.
“From a relative perspective, Europe (and European exposure) looks increasingly attractive,” Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Graham Secker, wrote in a report. “Having seen the largest outflows of any region over the last six months, Europe appears unloved and undervalued just as the growth newsflow starts to pick up.”
Investors pulled money from European equity funds for the 25th consecutive week last week, bringing year-to-date outflows to $40 billion, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which cited EPFR Global data. In contrast to U.S. equities, which have been seeing inflows, stocks in the region have suffered under trade and political concerns, with the Italian coalition government’s spending plans providing the latest cause of trader anxiety.
Morgan Stanley agrees that Italy poses the key risk to European markets right now, but says this threat is mostly priced into valuations.
Another reason Morgan Stanley is optimistic about European stocks is the rally it sees coming for value stocks into the end of the year, with few sectors better-placed than banks, a major slice of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The MSCI Europe Value Index is down 6 percent this year, compared to a gain of 2 percent for its growth-peer gauge.
“The underperformance and undervaluation of banks is getting extreme, despite the fact that some of the traditional factors that drive the sector are starting to improve,” the Morgan Stanley strategists said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights expert urged Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday to narrow its ""sweeping"" definition of terrorism to stop governments arbitrarily blocking legitimate opposition groups and dissenting voices.
Fionnuala Ní Aoláin wrote to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg saying Facebook wrongly treats all non-state groups that use violence in pursuit of any goals as terrorist entities.
""The use of such a sweeping definition is particularly worrying in light of a number of governments seeking to stigmatize diverse forms of dissent and opposition (whether peaceful or violent) as terrorism,"" wrote Ní Aoláin, U.N. special rapporteur on protecting human rights while countering terrorism.
Facebook's policy did not take account of rebel armed groups that comply with international humanitarian law, the letter said. She did not give examples, but governments facing armed opposition, such as in Syria, frequently label all their opponents as terrorists, even if other countries do not agree.
A Facebook spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment. 
Ní Aoláin commended ""the important role Facebook plays in offsetting terrorist activity online"", but said it must not unduly interfere in the human rights of its users, and should ensure there is a way to challenge wrong decisions. 
Overly broad and imprecise definitions of terrorism may lead to ""discriminatory implementation, over-censoring and arbitrary denial of access to and use of Facebook's services"", wrote Ní Aoláin, a U.N. Human Rights Council independent expert.
""Moreover, it is unclear how Facebook determines when a person belongs to a particular group and whether the respective group or person are given the opportunity to meaningfully challenge such determination.""
Facebook and other social media firms are increasingly involved in regulation that used to be done by states, and are under pressure from governments to police content disseminated by users, Ní Aoláin said.
Social media firms are already under U.N. scrutiny for allowing users to incite hatred and target minorities. 

Last week, former U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said Facebook had allowed its platform to be used to incite violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, where U.N. experts say a military crackdown had ""genocidal intent"".

The facility will go live in the second quarter of 2019, Zurich-based UBS said Monday in an emailed statement. The bank is undertaking the initiative in partnership with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation’s financial regulator.
“The engine will provide our clients with greater liquidity and increased efficiency in the foreign-exchange markets,” Anthony Hall, UBS’s head of foreign exchange, rates and credit in the Asia-Pacific region, said in the statement.
UBS’s launch may bolster the foreign-exchange trading infrastructure in Singapore, which faces competition from Hong Kong and Tokyo to be the top Asian hub for the asset class. The Swiss bank climbed up one notch to become the world’s second-largest currency trading firm by market share this year, according to a Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc survey.
“The long-term shift of foreign-exchange trading to Singapore from Tokyo is likely to continue as the Asian economies and markets continue to grow,’’ said Koji Fukaya, chief executive officer at FPG Securities Co. in Tokyo.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) will have a new partner in New Zealand after the license holder said it will not renew its two-decade-old deal in a region where an entrenched coffee culture has made it difficult for the world's largest coffee chain to thrive.
Fast-food group Restaurant Brands New Zealand Ltd (NZ:RBD) said in Monday it would let its license deal expire in October, though Starbucks would keep its doors open and frappuccinos flowing under a new licensee, Tahua Capital, which had acquired the license for a price of up to NZ$4.4 million ($2.9 million).
Restaurant Brands said in a statement the cafe chain was ""becoming less relevant to the company's overall direction"" and that it intended to focus on its core business of quick-service restaurant brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut. 
""Starbucks has never delivered its expectation here,"" said Brian Gaynor, head of Auckland-based Milford Asset Management.
""They had aspirations for it a long time ago when they acquired it first, and it's never been achieved because they’re up against local competition from either individual coffee shops or local chains.""
New Zealand has a vibrant coffee scene that has created steep competition for major chains such as Starbucks, which first opened in the country in 1998. 
Small coffee shops selling single origin espresso and drip coffee abound, while national roasting chains such as Mojo Coffee and Fuel Coffee are ubiquitous, and even expanding into China.
Starbucks encountered similar resistance in neighboring Australia where gourmet cafes have thrived in major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne since postwar Italian immigration introduced espresso to the nation in the 1950s.
A decade ago, Starbucks dramatically reduced its presence in Australia, closing 61 of its 85 coffee shops. It now has 34 shops in Sydney, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Melbourne.
Restaurant Brands said the exit from its Starbucks Coffee business, which contributes less than 4 percent of its total sales and profits, was expected to have an impact on the current year's net profit, excluding non-trading items, of about NZ$1.3 million.
It said Tahua Capital, which was established specifically to buy the assets of Starbucks New Zealand, would seek to secure leases for Restaurant Brands' 22 Starbucks stores, and would employ all 300 current Starbucks employees.
The deal was expected to settle in late October, Restaurant Brands said in a statement.

793,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Global stocks still hooked on buybacks; trade war snaring more bulls: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The historic run-up in world shares will continue through 2019, but the outlook for almost half of the major bourses polled by Reuters has slipped, with many now only expected to recoup losses from this year's sell-off.
Following a strong performance in 2017, world shares hit their latest run of new highs this month on solid economic and corporate earnings growth. But rising interest rates and concerns about escalating trade tensions have made the direction of travel more turbulent and trade more volatile.
""We expect markets to remain choppy in the months ahead as investors weigh up the various conflicting influences that are now in play. The volatility that we anticipate will at times be a source of discomfort for investors, but it will also be a source of opportunity,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson Investors.
The consensus from over 300 equity strategists and brokers around the world shows all the indexes polled by Reuters to rise further through to the end of next year, including predictions for the blizzard of records to continue for some of the bourses. 
(Graphic: Reuters global stock markets poll - http://tmsnrt.rs/2nHJiJ9) 
But none of those indexes were forecast to rise more this year than they did in 2017. Predictions for nearly half of those indexes were also tempered in the latest poll, taken Aug 17-30, compared with a survey just three months ago.
Nearly a decade of easy monetary policy, which fueled the current bull run, has resulted in stretched share prices, with the price-to-earnings ratios in a majority of stock indexes already trading above long-term averages.
Strategists have previously said corporate earnings growth should be a result of capital business expenditure and not the current trend of stock buybacks.
Nearly half of 66 strategists who answered a separate question said the switch from share buybacks to substantial business investment is not likely to happen anytime soon.
Only five said it would happen this year, 18 said it would happen next year and 11 said in 2020.
""We maintain that there is clear evidence that funds originally earmarked for capital investment are being redirected to share buybacks, and that this trend is likely to continue for so long as geopolitical and trade-related uncertainties remain elevated,"" noted Robert Phipps, chief investment officer at Per Stirling Capital Management.
""Companies know that they can boost earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding. However, they are unlikely to make long-term capital investments for so long as there is so much uncertainty - particularly trade-related uncertainty - on a global basis.""
In other words, for the U.S. at least, that means that whatever boost to business investment might have been in store from huge corporate tax cuts passed by Congress last year are likely to be offset by the Trump Administration's escalating trade war with China.
When asked, respondents were split on their latest outlook for world stocks compared to the beginning of 2018.
Thirty-eight of 82 strategists said they were more bearish and 37 were more bullish. The remaining seven said they had not changed their view.

Slightly more than half, 28 of 54 respondents who answered a separate question, said it will be more than a year before investors turn in favor of emerging market stocks. 
Twenty-three said it will take anywhere between three months and a year. Only three respondents said it could be within the next three months.

794,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>",Turkey to Set Tone Again for Emerging Markets This Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Events are likely to unfold quickly for emerging markets this week following the battering some currencies suffered in August.
Monday alone sees the release of Turkish inflation data and the unveiling of a new fiscal plan in Argentina. Meanwhile, Brazil will remain on tenterhooks after the country’s top electoral court banned imprisoned Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- who was leading in the polls -- from running in October’s presidential elections.
“The countries with the most acute macro imbalances are suffering the most pain given the challenging external environment,” said Paul Greer, a London-based money manager at Fidelity International, which oversees about $417 billion of assets. “Investors remain concerned about the potential for EM fund outflows following the sharp drawdowns on total returns during August, especially in local-currency markets.”
To add to the jittery backdrop, the U.S. is leaning toward slapping fresh tariffs on Chinese imports as early as this week, affecting a further $200 billion of goods. The yuan, which has lost more than 6 percent against the dollar in the past three months, would extend its decline if Beijing retaliates, according to Natwest.
Traders can also look forward to purchasing managers’ indexes from across emerging markets as well as Chinese trade statistics. All that before Friday’s U.S. monthly payrolls data, which could be key to determining where the dollar heads after it touched a 14-month high in August.

795,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",China Sets Share-Swap Limits for London-Shanghai Stock Link,"(Bloomberg) -- China published proposed rules for the link between stock exchanges in London and Shanghai, outlining how the long-discussed project will work in tandem with the country’s capital controls.
Companies seeking to take part will need to meet thresholds including a minimum value, and there will be limits on how many securities can be issued and how they’ll be traded between markets, according to statements from the China Securities Regulatory Commission and Shanghai Stock Exchange. The system will see listed firms from each nation sell depositary receipts in the other’s country.
The London link is part of the broader effort by Chinese authorities to increase access to the country’s financial system. In the works since at least September 2015, the program will give offshore investors the chance to buy Shanghai-listed companies via the London Stock Exchange. As with other steps to open up their markets, policy makers have set boundaries that keep controls over cross-border money flows in place.
Under the plans published Friday, investors won’t be able to swap their London-listed depositary receipts for company stock for at least six months after a new listing, and conversions will be subject to a quota, the details of which haven’t been made public. Restricting investors’ ability to swap shares in one market for those in the other was one of the conditions Chinese regulators had sought, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.
Among other proposals outlined in Friday’s statements:
The rules are open for public feedback until Sept. 15, the CSRC said.
People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said in April that China aimed to launch the link this year, timing that was reiterated by Premier Li Keqiang during an official visit by the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in July.

The British newspaper reported that Ford planned to end production of Mondeo, Galaxy and S-Max models and focus on more lucrative sport utility vehicles. Ford also plans to cut its number of dealerships, the Times said. 
In July, Ford's chief executive officer, Jim Hackett, said the company planned to spend around $11 billion on a restructuring of its European business. 
Ford lost $73 million in Europe between April and June, and faces additional challenges from Britain's plans to leave the European Union, the Times said. 
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said Ford could lay off as many as 12 percent of its more than 200,000 workers and that the layoffs would largely be concentrated in Europe. 
The Times said Ford's internal restructuring deliberations would last several more months and may result in folding its European business into a joint venture with a rival.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2018 09:16AM ET</span>","Germany dismisses Bild report on VW petrol cars, no indication of fraud so far","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Transport Ministry said on Sunday there was no fresh news in a Bild am Sonntag report that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG) engineers told investigators certain petrol engines in VW, Audi and Porsche vehicles can be used to manipulate emissions tests.
The ministry said in a statement to Reuters that the newspaper report pertained to allegations that the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) had already examined.
There had been no indication so far of any fraud concerning VW petrol-fueled cars, the statement said.
Earlier, a spokesman for Volkswagen - the parent company of Audi and Porsche - said VW would not comment on an ongoing investigation, adding that the company in recent months had held intensive talks with the KBA. 
""There are no new circumstances here,"" he said.
The Munich and Braunschweig prosecutors offices that are involved in probes into VW group brands could not be reached for comment.
Bild said gearboxes and software could be manipulated so that vehicles show lower levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, citing internal documents and witness statements.
VW's emissions scandal has cost the carmaker 27 billion euros ($31.3 billion) in penalties and fines for systematic manipulation of diesel-powered cars to mask excessive pollution levels.
In Europe, vehicles are taxed according to their levels of polluting CO2 emissions. 
VW in 2015 admitted that around 36,000 petrol-fueled cars were also being tested for excessive emissions.
VW had the 36,000 cars checked by a neutral body under supervision by the regulator and found minimal deviation from requirements. The automaker was not required to make any technical changes to those vehicles.
Regulators in the United States blew the whistle on deliberate emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015 after it emerged that the carmaker had developed an engine that failed to conform to pollution standards.
VW used software to detect when a car was being subjected to a regulatory emissions measurement test, and throttled back the engines during the test cycle, masking excessive pollution.
When a car engine was being accelerated and gears changed, VW’s onboard software would check whether the steering wheel was also being used. If the steering wheel angle was not being altered, VW knew a vehicle was strapped to a dynamometer test bench, activating exhaust emission filters.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>","Out of Sorrell's shadow, Mark Read poised for top job at ad giant WPP","(Note strong language in final paragraph)
By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The unassuming Mark Read will embark on the unenviable role of running WPP (L:WPP) this week, tasked with reshaping a group at the center of seismic industry change following the departure of the world's most high profile advertising boss Martin Sorrell. 
Read, a 51-year-old with experience across strategy and digital operations, is expected to be named WPP's second-ever CEO in the coming days after persuading the board he had what it takes to lead the world's biggest advertising company.
Sorrell quit the British group in April following a complaint of personal misconduct, which he denied, and after a year-long sharp downturn in trading sparked by cautious clients and competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and new consultants. 
Read, appointed to run the business as a joint chief operating officer until a permanent CEO was found, told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to remain relevant to clients but that they could evolve their way there, suggesting a review of some assets but no major break up. 
Clients, current and former WPP executives and analysts have told Reuters they also expect a program of evolution not revolution, slowing down the hunt for acquisitions and re-engineering the agencies to provide a more joined up service.
""For any leader coming into any business the most important thing is to have respect,"" Jon Williams, a former chief creative officer at WPP agency Grey, told Reuters. 
""Because of Mark's operational delivery and because he's got a personal relationship with a lot of the business leaders, he's got that respect. He can hit the ground running."" 
Sorrell built the world's biggest advertising and marketing services company by taking over some of the most storied names in the industry - JWT, Grey, Ogilvy and Y&R - and combining them with PR agencies, market research and media planning groups.
Headquartered in London, it now owns some 400 businesses around the world, set up to compete with each other for work. 
That has fallen out of favor with clients, however, as they want fewer teams providing an array of complimentary services, rather than multiple teams and multiple strands of work.
Sorrell had already talked about the need to break down barriers but Read is expected to go further. He and his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott have been asking WPP executives what works and what doesn't since they stepped up in April.
RIGHT HAND MAN
""He's listened, he's gone out of his way to make sure people understand that he wants to be collaborative, that he's a peer,"" the CEO of one WPP agency, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, said. 
""He knows the business as well as anyone, having been at the right hand of Martin all this time. And he knows that the solution to our future is not these acquisitions that keep feeding the growth.""
Read, a father of two young children, strikes a very different pose to Sorrell, who he wrote to asking for a job in 1989. 
Where Sorrell was an outspoken CEO, commenting on everything from the Chinese economy to influencers on Instagram, the softly-spoken Read adopts a lower profile, trying to avoid photographers at the end of the recent annual general meeting. 
Like Sorrell a graduate of Cambridge University and Harvard, Read is described by colleagues as a good listener and delegator, with no obvious ego. When talking to journalists he takes time to think before answering questions.
The chief marketing officer of one of Britain's biggest companies said Read should not be underestimated. 
He relayed how Read, when running WPP digital agency Wunderman, had approached him to explain what he could provide if and when they next put their ad contract out to tender. He stayed in regular touch - a job normally farmed out to more junior staff - and 18 months later Wunderman won the deal. 
""He is an incredibly personable collaborative, non-aggressive individual who prefers to work through his acumen, his intelligence, his intellect, not through his relationship and networks,"" the CMO said.
""He's more shrewd than you may at first realize when you get the soft handshake and mild manner. Don't be fooled.""
Read will need all his acumen to hand when he takes over the top job, perhaps on Tuesday when WPP publishes first-half results, knowing that Sorrell, a large WPP shareholder, will be watching after he launched a new competitor. 
According to those spoken to by Reuters Read will be met by a groundswell of good will. The WPP agency CEO said: ""For the first time since I've been here I got an email from the person in charge of the company that began with: how are you doing? 

""And I was like: holy shit, because he actually wanted to know.""

816,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",U.S. fund managers trim bank stocks on profit worries,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based mutual fund managers worried about the outlook for bank earnings have been trimming financial stocks from their portfolios, although some value-oriented portfolio managers and analysts said they still see attractive opportunities in the sector.
The average U.S. based mutual fund reduced its stake in financial companies by nearly 1.1 percentage points in the second quarter to approximately 14 percent, the largest one-quarter decline since at least 2013, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The move away from banks, insurance companies, and mortgage lenders came as the financial sector has underperformed the broad S&P 500 benchmark index by more than 5 percent since April.
Many fund managers believe banks have already hit peak earnings. One red flag is that the U.S. Treasury yield curve has been flattening as short-term yields rise in anticipation of U.S. interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve while long-term yields fall on worries about economic growth and trade tensions. This situation generally squeezes bank profits.
Some investors worry long-term yields might eventually dip below short-term yields. Such a yield curve inversion that can signal a looming recession.
""The flatter the yield curve the harder it is to make money,"" said Ian McDonald, co-leader of the financials research team at Janus Henderson Investors, which oversees $370.1 billion in assets under management, adding that ""funds are looking around and saying that if we're going to see weaker growth then we need to get out of financials.""
The spread between the yield of two- and 10-year U.S. Treasuries  is trading around its flattest in 11 years. Rising short-term rates raise a bank's borrowing costs, while falling long-term rates limit how much they can charge for loans.
Yet McDonald said large-cap banks like JPMorgan Chase and Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) remain attractive even if the sector overall does not. The major banks have been investing in online platforms and mobile apps, making them more appealing to millennials and less dependent on costly branches, he noted. 
""The U.S. retail banking industry is moving from the post-crisis phase of risk management to the fintech phase of managing customer experience,"" he said. 
Ben Kirby, portfolio manager of the $15.4 billion Thornburg Investment Income Builder fund, said his fund has been moving more into European banks such as  ING Groep  NV (AS:INGA), prompted in part by a recent sell-off in shares following the steep decline of the Turkish lira. The Turkish currency has plunged more than 40 percent this year due to increasing tensions with the United States and concerns that the country's central bank is losing its independence under President Tayyip Erdogan. 
""The U.S. has been the market darling for the last 10 years, and that's led to valuations that are a bit more stretched and an economic cycle that is a bit more mature,"" Kirby said. ""Whereas in Europe it's earlier in the cycle and growth is accelerating more.""
Overall, companies in the S&P 500 financial sector trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 14.5 and are up 2.2 percent for the year to date, according to Thomson Reuters data. The broad S&P 500, by comparison, trades at a trailing P/E of 22.06 and is up nearly 9 percent over the same time. 
Investors have retreated from financials as well, with the Financial Sector Select SPDR, an ETF that tracks financial stocks in the S&P 500, losing $1.7 billion in outflows over the last 4 weeks, according to Lipper data. 
Though banks have stronger balance sheets than at the start of the financial crisis 10 years ago, ""we're having a hard time finding anything to get excited about in financials,"" said Tom Plumb, manager of the $29.7 million Plumb Equity Fund. 
Instead of banks, Plumb has his largest positions in credit-card and payment companies  Visa Inc  (N:V) and Mastercard Inc (N:MA), continue to grow as more retail purchases are made online rather than in physical stores, he said. 
""It's a mistake to get off a big macro secular trend too early,"" he said. 
Kyle Martin, an analyst at Westwood Holdings Group, a Dallas firm with $21.6 billion in assets under management, said that rising interest rates and the flattening yield curve could point to a recession in 2020, meaning financial stocks are less attractive. 
Investment bank  Houlihan Lokey Inc  (N:HLI) looks attractive despite the prospect of declining economic growth given its focus on middle-market mergers and acquisitions, which should see above-average deal activity as the threat from technology disruption grows, he said. 

""Banks are clearly safer than they were 10 years ago,"" he said. ""At the same time, they will see a decline in earnings soon and it's easy for a fund manager to not have those listed on a client statement if we go into another crisis.""

HNA Group's total debt stood at 657.41 billion yuan ($96.25 billion) at the end of the first half, down 10.7 percent or $11.6 billion from the end of 2017.
Despite the reduction, the group's total debt to EBITDA was 21.36 times at the end of the first half.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 08:49PM ET</span>",Einhorn's Greenlight off 25 percent for year; Ackman up double-digits,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund, whose bets on car companies General Motors (N:GM) and Tesla (O:TSLA) both moved against him in August, lost 7.6 percent this month, leaving the fund down 25.1 percent for the year, two investors said on Friday.
Einhorn sent investors his monthly update after the market closed on Friday but gave no specific reason for the fresh losses, people who received it said.
Shares of General Motors, one of Einhorn's largest holdings, fell 3.4 percent.
Greenlight is also one of a handful of hedge funds that took a short position on Tesla - betting that the stock would fall. That took a toll when Tesla founder Elon Musk shocked markets in early August by tweeting that he was mulling taking the company private.
Tesla's stock, after rising and then falling during the month, fueled by Musk's decision to remain a public company after all, ended the month up, hurting short sellers.
Einhorn investors have been losing patience with him for some time and have been pulling money out. August's numbers could prompt more departures at year-end when the manager will next let investors redeem money, one person said.
An Einhorn spokesman declined to comment
At the same time, Daniel Loeb's Third Point, currently pushing Nestle SA (S:NESN)to spin off units and working on getting  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB) to put itself up for sale, posted only tiny gains in August. His Third Point Partners fund inched up 0.1 percent, leaving it up 0.9 percent for the year-to-date, an investor said.
William Ackman, the third in the trio of managers who for many years shared many of same investors, has swung to big gains this year, and his private hedge fund is up roughly 15 percent for the year, an investor said.
His gains have been fueled by strong performances at Automatic Data Processing (O:ADP), Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (N:LOW), one of his more recent investments.

The average hedge fund has fallen roughly half a percent this year, preliminary numbers from Hedge Fund Research show.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended flat while the Dow edged down and the Nasdaq closed higher in light trading on Friday as Canada and the United States concluded trade talks without resolution ahead of the Labor Day weekend.
Capping a low-volume, late-summer week marked by tariff-related volatility, all three major U.S. indexes posted net gains for the period. The indexes were also up for the month of August, with the Nasdaq posting its largest monthly gain since January.
Talks between Canada the United States to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ended on a sour note as the two sides were unable to reach a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
In recent days trade jitters abated as Mexico and the United States reached a bilateral deal, but re-emerged later in the week following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports as soon as next week.
""We may not have a replacement for NAFTA as quickly as we thought,"" said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA in San Antonio. ""That initial optimism that existed at the beginning of the week, that good news scenario is off the table.""

Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) had a fifth consecutive decline following news that fund manager BlackRock voted in favor of replacing Elon Musk with an independent chairman.
Gun maker American Outdoor Brands (O:AOBC) was the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq. The stock soared 43.6 percent after its upbeat earnings report. Peer Sturm Ruger & Co (N:RGR) shares jumped 7.3 percent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CNG) shares extended their loss, dipping 1.8 percent after William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) cut its stake in the burrito chain.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) dropped 2.3 percent after scrapping a plan to sell a Chinese-made small vehicle in the United States due to tariff concerns.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.60-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 05:24PM ET</span>","U.S. to move ahead with Mexico trade pact, keep talking to Canada","By Julie Gordon, Sharay Angulo and Allison Martell
WASHINGTON/TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump notified Congress on Friday of his intent to sign a trade agreement with Mexico after talks with Canada broke up on Friday with no immediate deal to revamp the tri-nation North American Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said U.S. officials would resume talks with their Canadian counterparts next Wednesday with the aim of getting a deal all three nations could sign.
All three countries have stressed the importance of NAFTA, which governs billions of dollars in regional trade and a bilateral deal announced by the United States and Mexico on Monday paved the way for Canada to rejoin the talks this week.
But by Friday the mood had soured, partly on Trump's off-the-record remarks made to Bloomberg News that any trade deal with Canada would be ""totally on our terms"". He later confirmed the comments, which the Toronto Star first reported. 
""At least Canada knows where I stand,"" he later said on Twitter.
Ottawa has stood firm against signing ""just any deal."" 
Canada's lead negotiator and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:30 P.M. Eastern Time on Friday (2030 GMT). 
The Canadian dollar  weakened to C$1.3081 to the U.S. dollar after the Wall Street Journal first reported that the talks had ended on Friday with no agreement. Canadian stocks (GSPTSE) remained 0.5 percent lower.
Global equities were also down following the hawkish turn in Trump's comments on trade.
Lighthizer has refused to budge despite repeated efforts by Freeland to offer some dairy concessions to maintain the Chapter 19 independent trade dispute resolution mechanism in NAFTA, The Globe and Mail reported on Friday. 
However, a spokeswoman for USTR said Canada had made no concessions on agriculture, which includes dairy, but added that negotiations continued.
The United States wants to eliminate Chapter 19, the mechanism that has hindered it from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. Lighthizer said on Monday Mexico had agreed to cut the mechanism. For Ottawa, Chapter 19 is a red line.
But Freeland said earlier on Friday her team is ""not there yet"" in resolving still big differences.
""We're looking for a good deal, not just any deal. And we'll only agree to a deal that is a good deal for Canada,"" Freeland told reporters.
Trump argues Canada's hefty dairy tariffs are hurting U.S. farmers, an important political base for his Republican party. But dairy farmers have great political clout in Canada too, and concessions could hurt the ruling Liberals ahead of a 2019 federal election.

At a speech in North Carolina on Friday Trump took another swipe at Canada. ""I love Canada, but they've taken advantage of our country for many years,"" he said.

830,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 05:06PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Trade Takes Market on a Rollercoaster Ride
There was a burst of optimism about trade in the market during the week, but that didn’t last until the closing bell Friday.
The U.S. announced a bilateral deal with Mexico Monday. But tension built throughout the week as the U.S. announced there was a Friday deadline to bring Canada into a newly-revamped NAFTA.
The U.S. and Canada missed that deadline, but announced that talks would resume next Wednesday, leaving the market facing more wait-and-see trading days.
There was also drama during Friday’s discussions after the Toronto Star reported that Trump told Bloomberg off the record he had no plans to give any concessions at all to Canada.
The president appeared to later confirm that stance in a tweet, saying Canada now knows where he stands.



Trade worries spread beyond North America, though. Trump told Bloomberg he was prepared to withdraw from the WTO if necessary. And he plans to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week, Bloomberg reported.
China’s foreign ministry said Friday that the U.S. putting pressure on Beijing would not work.
2. Retailers See Wild Earnings Swings, Sector Rises
Retail earnings dominated the calendar this week, leading to strong stock movements in the low-volume environment.
The SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) index ended up slightly for the week.
Among big movers, Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) stock plummeted second-quarter revenue and same-store sales missed estimates.
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) stock tumbled despite better-than-expected second quarter revenue and earnings as online sales slowed and the company warned that it is “expecting a non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the third quarter.”
Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock tanked after second-quarter revenue missed expectations and it forecast a 3% to 4% decline in consolidated same-store sales for 2018. But it recovered a lot of lost ground.
And Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) spiked on second-quarter results and strong outlook, but then tumbled in later sessions.
3. Tesla Is Staying Public, Musk Is Still Tweeting
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares started the week with a quick drop and finished it lower as it scrapped plans to go private.
CEO Elon Musk wrote in a blog late on Friday, Aug. 24 that he would not move forward with a plan to take the company private, noting that after speaking with retail and institutional shareholders that “the sentiment, in a nutshell, was ‘please don't do this.’”
Musk surprised the market out of the blue, tweeting he was thinking of taking the company private at $420 per share and had funding secured. The SEC was interested in whether the tweet was designed in away to punish short sellers, according to reports.
But Musk didn’t stay clear of controversy for long. On Sunday, he tweeted about a British diver who was involved in the Thai cave rescue and whom Musk had previously called “a pedo”. Musk replied to a tweet, saying it was curious the man, Vernon Unsworth, didn’t sue him for the remark. Unsworth’s lawyer said in a letter the tweets were “false and defamatory.”
4. Consumer Stays Strong, Housing Still Wobbles
Data out this week illustrated two contrasting segments of the U.S. economy, one stronger and one weaker. Economic indicators on the consumer side remained very strong.
The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence increased to 133.4 this month, compared to a reading of 126.7 forecast by economists. That was its highest level since October 2000.
The University of Michigan's August consumer confidence index was revised up to 96.2 from its preliminary measure of 95.3.
And consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month, matching June’s reading and analyst forecasts.
But weak numbers in housing continued to arrive.
The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, which measures signed contracts for homes where transactions have not yet closed, fell 0.7% to a reading of 106.2 after rising by a revised 1.0% in the previous month. Economists had forecast pending home sales rising 0.3% last month.
5. Oil Finishes Higher in August
Oil closed out the month higher as traders balanced expectations of crude supply losses with the potential of trade wars denting global demand.
China, the world's largest commodity importer, has seen economic growth dwindle since the trade war with the U.S. kicked off, and a further escalation could dent growth, forcing Beijing to rein in crude imports.
Oil prices ended the month nearly 2% higher on bets on renewed global supply shortage as U.S. sanctions on Iran's crude exports are expected to reduce crude from market, underpinning higher crude prices.
Both WTI and Brent crude are expected gain on a potential slump in Iranian exports, although gains in WTI prices will be limited as the refinery maintenance season is set to get underway.
Oil prices were helped earlier in the week by an EIA report showing crude oil stockpiles fell much more than expected."
831,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Reverses Gains to Close Lower as Trade Turmoil Continues,"Investing.com - Stocks closed lower as sentiment was rocked by fears a global trade war could be brewing amid uncertainty about the outcome of U.S.-Canada trade talks, which reportedly are set to resume next week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.09%. The S&P 500 rose 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.26%. The Dow and the S&P 500 ended August up about 2% and 3% respectively, their best performances for the month since 2014.
A successful outcome for U.S.-Canada talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was thrown into doubt, as both countries failed to reach an agreement by the Friday deadline imposed by the Trump administration. But fears were tempered by reports suggesting talks would resume on Wednesday.
Still, President Trump is willing to press ahead with a U.S.-Mexico deal, though is open to including Canada if negotiations are successful, according U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
“Today the President notified the Congress of his intent to sign a trade agreement with Mexico – and Canada, if it is willing – 90 days from now,” Lighthizer said in a statement. “The agreement is the most advanced and high-standard trade agreement in the world.""
Heading into the final round of talks, Canada-U.S. relations were strained as Trump said that a pact with Canada would be on U.S. terms, while Ottawa vowed against accepting ""just any deal.""
The news threw further doubt on whether a global trade war could be averted as the United States and Europe seemingly swerved back onto a collision course after Trump rejected EU's proposal to eliminate tariffs on cars if the U.S. did the same, claiming the offer is ""not good enough.""
Trade tensions were thrust into the spotlight on Thursday, following a report that Trump planned to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, risking retaliation from Beijing.
Industrial heavyweights such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), both of which have huge international exposure, symbolised fears that a global trade war may be in the offing, as both ended the day lower.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, also felt the pressure from rising trade tensions as oil prices settled lower Friday, but posted a monthly gain as falling U.S. supplies and bets on potential a slump in Iranian crude exports have supported sentiment.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 45 cents settle at $69.80 a barrel.
Upbeat economic data, meanwhile, showing an improvement in consumer sentiment had little impact on market direction.
The University of Michigan index was 96.2 in August, above both a previous reading of 95.3, and economists' expectations for a reading of 95.5.
On the corporate news front, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock fell nearly 1% after the beverage giant agreed to buy the U.K. chain Costa Coffee for £3.9 billion ($5.1 billion).

""Chipotle is in the very early stages of beginning to realize its potential,"" the fund manager told Reuters on Friday, adding that he ""loves"" the stock.
Ackman spoke one day after his Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management hedge fund said in a regulatory filing that the firm had cut its holding in Chipotle to 7.4 percent of the company from 10.4 percent. His firm sold 823,357 shares for portfolio management purposes, the fund manager said.
He said the Chipotle position had grown to be more than 20 percent of his roughly $8 billion portfolio as the stock price appreciated and that it needed to be cut back. He has periodically trimmed positions as they became too big.
News of the sale came after the market closed on Thursday and sparked some concerns on Friday that Ackman was possibly losing interest in the company after owning it for almost two years.
Ackman has helped turn the company around, playing a big role in wooing Chipotle's new Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol from Taco Bell.
Since Niccol took over in March, the stock has gained 92 percent through Thursday's close of $483.99.
On Friday the stock lost 1.74 percent to trade at $475.55 late in the session.

Ackman's hedge funds have gained roughly 15 percent so far this year, beating the average hedge fund, which lost roughly half a percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.

(Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC is speaking to consumer industry executives as it seeks to fill a slate of nominees to challenge Campbell Soup Co's board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter.
Third Point, which holds a 5.65 percent stake and has been pushing for a sale of Campbell Soup, is not convinced the company has adequately explored that option, the sources said.
On Thursday, Campbell Soup said it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale down the line, as it focuses on improving its operational performance. 
Food industry veteran Douglas Conant, who was chief executive officer of Campbell Soup for a decade until 2011, and William Perez, a former CEO at Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company who also previously served on Campbell Soup's board, are among the people Loeb is holding discussions with, the sources said.
Third Point is hoping it can replace the entirety of Campbell Soup's 12-member board, the sources said. The hedge fund is expected to finalize its slate in the next two weeks, before a mid-September deadline for board director nominations, according to the sources.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Third Point declined to comment, while Conant and Perez could not be immediately reached for comment.
The company said it does not comment on rumors or speculation and said it considered all options in its now-completed strategic review. ""The Board remains open and committed to evaluating all strategic options to enhance value in the future,"" the company said in a statement.
Campbell Soup shares rose as much as 1.7 percent on Friday and were up 0.7 percent at $39.42 in afternoon trade, giving the company a market value of $11.9 billion. 
""We believe investors are pinning their hopes on Third Point taking a more aggressive activist campaign against the company and the board,"" Stifel analysts wrote in a research note on Thursday. ""Investors should brace for a likely proxy campaign against the board.""
Loeb, who runs the $18 billion Third Point hedge fund, has not commented publicly on his next move after announcing in early August that he views a sale of the 149-year-old maker of soups and snacks as ""the only justifiable outcome"" of the review.
He faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company. However, a board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell Soup to explore a sale more actively. 
Loeb could also nominate George Strawbridge, a Dorrance grandchild who is now working with Loeb and is calling for a sale, as a director, according to the sources. Strawbridge could not be reached for comment. 
Two other Dorrance grandchildren, Mary Alice Malone and Bennett Dorrance, as well as great-grandson Archbold van Beuren, currently sit on Campbell Soup's board. Other directors, including Randall Larrimore and Les Vinney, have served since the early 2000s.
""Loeb will want fresh perspectives from people he can trust,"" said Damien Park, a managing director at Spotlight Advisors, which often advises companies being targeted by activists.
It is not clear who could buy Campbell Soup at this stage. Kraft Heinz Co has considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, sources have told Reuters, but there is no sign that the company has made a new approach.
A MORE DISCIPLINED INVESTOR
    Once known as one of Wall Street's toughest rabble rousers who relished writing humiliating letters to chief executives, Loeb has recently toned down the rhetoric, maturing into a more disciplined investor, say investors who know him.
The last time Loeb ran a proxy contest to challenge a board was at Sotheby's, the art auction house. He settled for three Sotheby’s board seats four years ago, joining the Sotheby’s board himself. 
To stay relevant and continue putting up top performance numbers in his fund - he has delivered an average annual return of 18.3 percent - Loeb has tried new approaches and branching out his business, investors said.
Campbell Soup, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.

Denise Morrison stepped down as CEO abruptly in May after a string of poor results. That same day, the company announced its sweeping review and named Keith McLoughlin as interim CEO. McLoughlin said on Thursday the search for a permanent CEO is continuing.

The parent company of the No.3 U.S. airline will now charge $30 for the first checked bag on the routes, up from $25 previously.
The company said that charges for the second checked bags within the United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Caribbean and Central America will now increase by $5 to $40.
""We are making adjustments to our checked bag fees in select markets - most of which have not been changed for the past eight years,"" United said in a statement.
Rising costs have been a concern for airlines, as high fuel prices and bumps in salaries and benefits for pilots, flight attendants and mechanics have swelled operating expenses.
Smaller rival JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Monday also increased the fee on the first checked bag by $5 to $30, and on the second checked bag by the same amount to $40 on all routes. But not all airlines have yet taken to charging increased fee for ancillary services, partly due to competitive pressures. No.1 U.S. airline  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) will allow basic economy class travelers to bring a full-size carry-on bag free of charge, starting Sept. 5. ""The carry-on bag restriction left us uncompetitive from a product attribute perspective in some markets,"" American Airlines President Robert Isom said on a post-earnings call in July. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the No.4 U.S. airline, said on Friday it would continue to allow passengers to check two bags and change their reservation without the worry of additional fees.  
""Customers come with luggage, it's a part of our business, and Southwest doesn't believe in charging punitive fees for bringing along necessities for travel,"" Southwest spokeswoman Brandy King said in a statement.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Pipeline politics leave Canada's prime minister in peril,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - With one surprise court ruling, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces the risk of contesting next year's election with key pieces of his economic and environmental plans in ruins. 
The Federal Court of Appeal overturned on Thursday the Liberal government's 2016 approval to expand Trans Mountain, a critical pipeline to link Canadian crude with foreign markets, followed hours later by Alberta's tit-for-tat withdrawal from Trudeau’s climate plan. 
The day's events amplified criticism that Trudeau has failed to produce a regulatory system in which oil pipelines stand a chance of approval and undermined the PM's ambitions to reduce emissions.
In short, they left him vulnerable to bleeding disappointed supporters on both his right and left, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus at University of Manitoba. 
""A lot was riding on the energy file,"" Thomas said. ""There is no spin you can put on this that would be positive.""
At the heart of the centrist Trudeau's plans for the economy and environment was a bargain with Alberta, Canada's energy province. The Liberal government approval of Trans Mountain would provide Alberta oil producers with a larger export outlet to the British Columbia coast, and secure Alberta's support of Trudeau's national emissions plan.
Trudeau doubled down in May, agreeing to buy the faltering pipeline project for C$4.5 billion from  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Canada.
But Trudeau's bargain collapsed with the court's rejection and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's exit from the carbon plan. 
Buying a pipeline was always unpopular with progressive voters, said Nik Nanos, head of polling firm Nanos Research. 
""Now they run into double jeopardy politically because they have an issue of whether they can deliver. And it's having a knock-on effect on other issues, like carbon pricing.""
The party, which won a huge 2015 majority, is running close with the opposition Conservatives according to polls, and faces another risk in tough U.S. trade talks.
Trudeau on Friday said he could proceed with a national environment plan without Alberta's support.
His worst scenario would be to shed environment-minded voters to the New Democratic Party and economy-focused supporters to the Conservatives, while other Liberals stay home on voting day expected in October 2019, Nanos said. 
Such a scenario would weaken Trudeau in British Columbia and Quebec, potentially costing a second term, Nanos said.
To be sure, opposition leaders have struggled to connect with voters, making it harder to capitalize, Thomas said.
But there is no quick path either to resolving Trudeau's pipeline-centered problems. The court flagged regulatory agency the National Energy Board (NEB) for wrongly excluding a review of tanker traffic, and criticized Ottawa for failing to meaningfully consider indigenous concerns.
Trudeau could assemble a team to consult First Nations, and direct the NEB to produce a study of tanker traffic, said Richard Masson, executive fellow at the University of Calgary.
Accomplishing that and approving Trans Mountain again before the next campaign would be challenging, at a time when the Liberals are separately legislating tougher regulations for resource projects, Masson said. Appealing to Canada's Supreme Court may be faster, said Robin Junger, a lawyer at McMillan Vantage dealing with environmental and aboriginal issues. 
Trudeau's best hope might be changing the political narrative altogether, Nanos said.

""In an ideal world, the Liberals would knock the pipeline off the news.""

849,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Coca-Cola quickly brews up Costa 'Del Sol' deal with Whitbread,"By Ben Martin, Pamela Barbaglia and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The 3.9 billion-pound ($5.1 billion) sale of the Costa coffee chain to Coca-Cola (N:KO) began brewing when Whitbread's boss Alison Brittain crossed paths with the chief executive of the soft drinks giant at a conference in May.
Brittain, who has led Costa-owner  Whitbread  (L:WTB) since December 2015, didn't know James Quincey before the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Summit in Seattle.
""I hadn't met him before that,"" Brittain said on Friday. ""It has been a very fast deal.""
The deal was codenamed ""Project Del Sol"" - a pun on Spain's Costa del Sol holiday coast - by Coca-Cola and ""Project Crimson"" - an allusion to Costa's red branding - by the Whitbread team, according to a person familiar with the matter.
It completes a years-long streamlining of FTSE 100 leisure group Whitbread that will leave it focused on its Premier Inn hotel chain.
It comes at a time when investor pressure had been mounting on one of Britain's oldest companies and the business had already been actively working on a demerger.
In December 2017, U.S. activist investor Sachem Head disclosed it had built a stake in Whitbread and the following month Reuters reported that the fund was pushing Brittain to consider splitting Costa from Premier Inn.
Elliott, another U.S. activist firm, then emerged as Whitbread's biggest shareholder in April with a stake of more than 6 percent and also began calling for a break-up of the group. The hedge fund was engaging with the leisure group in a ""combative way,"" said a source familiar with the situation. 
DEMERGER PLAN 
Less than a fortnight after Elliott announced its stake and before Brittain met Quincey in Seattle, Whitbread announced it would spin off Costa into a separately listed company in a demerger that was planned to take up to 24 months.
That triggered interest in the coffee chain from potential buyers, Brittain said.
""Costa is a lovely company and therefore there were clearly suitors for that company and we didn't think any of them were wearing the right suit and driving the right car,"" she said, declining to identify the firms.
""We had always determined at the start, when we announced the demerger, that we would not be interested in a sale to financial companies but we would remain open to a strategic buyer such as Coca-Cola who could bring additional value for our shareholders, because of the synergies that they have.""
Coca-Cola will be able to use its distribution network to considerably extend the reach of Costa brand.
While Costa has about 7,000 self-service machines in Britain and about 1,000 overseas, as well as its coffee shops, the U.S. giant has millions of vending machines around the world that it could use to sell Costa products.
Coca-Cola made its first formal approach to Whitbread in late June and the negotiations progressed quickly, with a deal signed at 6.52 on Friday morning, eight minutes before it was announced to the stock market, Brittain said.
She kept pushing for a higher price even after entering exclusive talks with the soft drinks giant and wouldn't surrender to a low-ball bid, a source close to the company said.
The U.S. group's interest in Costa pre-dated the demerger announcement and the fact that Quincey, who took charge of Coca-Cola in May last year, is British would have helped to put the coffee chain on the soft drinks company's radar, the Whitbread boss added.
""They have been scanning for a coffee acquisition and they have been doing work on Costa for quite some time,"" she said.
SHARES JUMP
Whitbread shares closed up 14.3 percent on Friday in London as analysts praised the price tag that Costa had fetched, which values the chain at 16.4 times its latest annual earnings.
Elliott said that it ""congratulates the board of Whitbread on this proposed transaction and looks forward to continuing to engage with them to maximize the value of the remaining businesses.""
Scott Ferguson, managing partner and portfolio manager at Sachem Head, said that his fund was ""very pleased with the transaction and credit management and the board for thoughtfully maximizing value for shareholders.""
The deal brings to an end Whitbread's history as a conglomerate in the leisure sector. 
While the bulk of the proceeds will be returned to shareholders, it will use some of the cash to pay down debt and address its 350 million-pound pension deficit, to give it the flexibility to continue expanding its Premier Inn hotels in the UK and Germany, which will become its main business.
Founded 276 years ago as a brewery by Samuel Whitbread and Godfrey and Thomas Shewell, Whitbread grew into a sprawling group that had interests spanning pubs, fitness clubs, casual dining chains and Costa, which it bought for 19 million pounds in 1995. 
But it has slimmed down in recent years, exiting brewing in 2000 and David Lloyd Leisure clubs, the luxury Marriott hotel brand, TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut between 2006 and 2007.
As well as hotels, its remaining Premier Inn business also runs the Brewers Fayre and Beefeater pub and restaurant brands.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Wonga collapse leaves Britain's other payday lenders in firing line,"By Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) - The collapse of Britain's biggest payday lender Wonga is likely to turn up the heat on its rivals amid a surge in grievances by customers and calls by some politicians for tighter regulation. Britain's poster child of short-term, high-interest loans collapsed into administration on Thursday, only weeks after raising 10 million pounds ($13 million) to help it cope with an increase in compensation claims.
Wonga said the surge in claims was driven by so-called claims management companies, firms that help consumers win compensation from businesses. Wonga had already been struggling following the introduction by regulators in 2015 of a cap on the interest it and others in the industry could charge on loans. 
Allegiant Finance Services, a claims management company focused on payday lending, has seen an increase in business in the past two weeks due to media reports about Wonga's financial woes, its managing director, Jemma Marshall, told Reuters. 
Wonga claims make up around 20 percent of Allegiant's business today, she said, adding she expects the industry's attention to turn to its rivals after Wonga's demise. 
One of the biggest boons for the claims management industry has been mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) - Britain's costliest banking scandal that has seen UK lenders pay out billions of pounds in compensation. 
But a cap on the fees claims management firms can charge in PPI complaints and an approaching August 2019 deadline to submit those claims have driven many to shift their focus toward payday loans, Marshall said. 
""This is just the starting gun for mis-sold credit, and it will define the landscape after PPI,"" she said, adding her company was planning to start managing claims on automatic credit card limit increases and doorstep loans.
The Consumer Finance Association, a trade group representing short-term lenders, said claims management companies were using ""some worrying tactics"" to win business ""that are not always in the best interest of customers."" 
""The collapse of a company does not help people that want to access credit or those that believe they have grounds for a complaint,"" it said in a statement.
COMPLAINTS INCREASE
Wonga is not the only payday lender to be hit by an increase in complaints since 2015. https://tmsnrt.rs/2LIfbKa
Britain's Financial Ombudsman Service, which settles disputes between consumers and financial firms, received 10,979 complaints against payday lenders in the first quarter of this year, a 251 percent increase on the same period last year. 
Casheuronet UK LLC, another large payday lender in Britain that is owned by U.S. firm  Enova International Inc  (N:ENVA) and operates brands including QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket, has also seen a significant increase in complaints since 2015. 
Data published by the firm and the Financial Conduct Authority show the number of complaints it received rose from 9,238 in 2015 to 17,712 a year later and 21,485 in the first half of this year. Wonga said on its website it received 24,814 grievances in the first six months of 2018. 
In its second-quarter results filing, published in July, Enova International said the rise in complaints had resulted in significant costs, and could have a ""material adverse affect"" on its business if it continued. 
Labour lawmaker Stella Creasy this week called for the interest rate cap to be extended to all forms of credit, calling companies like guarantor loan firm  Amigo  Holdings (L:AMGO) and  Provident Financial  (L:PFG) ""legal loan sharks"".
Glen Crawford, CEO of Amigo, said its customers aren't financially vulnerable or over-indebted, and use their loans for considered purchases like buying a car. 
""Amigo has been offering a responsible and affordable mid-cost credit product to people who have been turned away by banks since long before the payday market evolved,"" he said in a statement. 
Provident declined to comment.
In a note on Friday, Fitch Ratings said the payday lending business model that grew rapidly in Britain after the global financial crisis ""appears to be no longer viable"". It expects lenders focused on high-cost, unsecured lending to adapt their business models towards cheaper loans aimed at safer borrowers.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:49PM ET</span>",Founder sues Papa John's board to stop 'irreparable harm',"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The founder and largest shareholder of Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) sued the pizza chain's board and chief executive late on Thursday to stop what he described as ""the irreparable harm"" they are causing the company, according to a court filing.
John Schnatter has been in an escalating battle with the company's board since he stepped down as chairman in July after he apologized for using a racial slur during a media training call.
Schnatter remains a member of the board and holds 30 percent of the company's shares.
Schnatter is suing the board and CEO Steve Ritchie ""to stop the irreparable harm those individuals are causing due to their repeated, and ongoing, breaches of the duties of loyalty and care they owe to the company,"" according to a statement from Schnatter. 
Papa John's said the allegations were without merit.
""John Schnatter will do anything to distract attention from the harm caused by his inappropriate words,"" said the company in a statement. ""He continues to make reckless allegations in his attempt to regain control and serve his own interests."" 
The lawsuit filed was under seal in Delaware's Court of Chancery, and Schnatter asked the court to expedite the case.
On Thursday, the company criticized Schnatter publicly for attending a meeting in July about a potential deal with hamburger chain Wendy's Co (O:WEN) without Ritchie present, as the board had instructed.
A Papa John’s shareholder also filed a lawsuit on Thursday seeking class-action status, accusing the company and Schnatter of securities fraud for concealing his alleged inappropriate workplace conduct, and how its code of ethics was inadequate to prevent it.

Shares of Papa John's were flat at $46.02 on Friday.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",California hospital chain with ties to billionaire files for bankruptcy,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Tom Hals
NEW YORK/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Verity Health System of California Inc, a non-profit operator of six California hospitals managed by billionaire former surgeon Patrick Soon-Shiong's NantWorks LLC, filed for bankruptcy on Friday to help resolve a cash crunch while it seeks a buyer.
The health system's bankruptcy filing follows a series of deals that left it saddled with more than $1 billion in pension liabilities and bond debt. Verity, which serves low-income communities in Los Angeles and San Jose, secured a $185 million loan to help it stay operational through the bankruptcy. 
Verity Chief Executive Officer Richard Adcock told Reuters he expected the operator to remain in bankruptcy protection from creditors for a couple years as it restructures and works with potential buyers.
""We've had over 100 parties formally reach out to us,"" he said of the sale process, which Verity started in July. He said potential suitors include large national operators, and could include deals for individual facilities. 
He emphasized the bankruptcy would allow the operator to maintain patient care while restructuring.
The health system employed more than 6,000 people as of 2017.
Soon-Shiong, who has founded and sold multiple biotech companies and earlier this year invested in the Los Angeles Times and other California newspapers, acquired Verity's management company in 2017 with the goal of helping to revitalize the hospital chain. 
Adcock said Verity will examine all of its contracts, including the management deal with Soon-Shiong.
Verity filed for bankruptcy in the central district of California, Los Angeles division. 
Its hospitals are St. Francis Medical Center and St. Vincent Medical Center in southern California, and O'Connor Hospital, St. Louise Regional Hospital, Seton Medical Center and Seton Medical Center Coastside in northern California. The non-profit also runs a physician network and medical foundation that encompasses urgent care centers and doctors' offices.
Any sale would need approval of a bankruptcy court judge, as well as from regulators.
Verity has been losing close to $175 million per year on a cash flow basis, Adcock said. 
U.S. hospitals are suffering from costs that are rising faster than revenue and the industry is on an unsustainable path, credit rating agency Moody’s said in a report this week.

Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Province of the West, a religious organization, originally owned Verity. In 2015, the Daughters selected hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management LLC to recapitalize the system with an investment of about $250 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks were poised on Friday to end August much as they began the month - under the dark cloud of a potentially worsening trade war.
A closely watched barometer of global equities fell for a second day as a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to step up a trade war with Beijing dampened risk appetite and erased some gains from a rally this week.
Trump is ready to impose tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The White House declined to comment.
Trump in an interview with Bloomberg also threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if ""they don't shape up,"" a move that would further undermine one of the foundations of the modern global trading system.
""It's very hard to see a decisive resuscitation of risk appetite until these tensions are resolved,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson Investors.
""We have learned to under-react to some of the individual headlines because if you try to extrapolate from any of them you could find yourself in big trouble.""
The MSCI All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which measures stocks in 47 countries, shed 0.10 percent for the day, but was set for a 0.6 percent gain for the month.
The modest rise masked a growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The S&P 500, which includes large U.S. companies, is up 3 percent for the month, while the MSCI Emerging Markets index (MSCIEF) is down about the same.
On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) rose 29.53 points, or 0.11 percent, to 26,016.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 4.18 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,905.31 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 29.70 points, or 0.37 percent, to 8,118.06.
Trade anxieties boosted both the dollar, seen as a short-term winner if the United States spends less on imports, and the safe-haven yen. The dollar index (DXY) rose 0.15 percent while the Japanese yen  strengthened 0.07 percent versus the greenback.
The Mexican peso  gained 0.29 percent versus the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar  fell 0.47 percent. Each country is party to the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States.
While Mexico has negotiated a deal with the United States on Monday, U.S. and Canadian officials were making a final push to iron out differences ahead of a Friday deadline set by Trump.
Canadian officials expressed concern that a deal will not be concluded on Friday, Canada's Globe and Mail reported, citing a source familiar with situation. 
EMERGING MARKETS ON EDGE
Emerging market currencies showed needed signs of stability even as they were set to post their fifth straight month of losses in dollar terms. The index of those countries' currencies (MIEM00000CUS) rose 0.06 percent on Friday.
Currencies in two particularly troubled economies, Turkey and Argentina  , strengthened against the dollar.
The Turkish government said it will lower the level of withholding tax on lira bank deposits, while raising it on foreign currency deposits. Meanwhile, in Argentina, investors expect further government spending cuts to be announced on Monday.

In Asia, the Indonesian rupiah  fell to a nearly three-year low and approached levels not seen since the 1990s Asian financial crisis even as the country's central bank said it was ""decisively"" intervening to support the currency. The Indian rupee  hit a record low.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) has agreed to buy coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion to extend its push into healthier drinks and take on the likes of Starbucks and Nestle in the booming global coffee market. 
The purchase from Britain's  Whitbread  (L:WTB) of Costa's almost 4,000 outlets thrusts the world's biggest soda company into one of the few bright spots in the sluggish packaged food and drinks sector.
Paying about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) more than some analysts had expected, Coke will use its distribution network to supercharge Costa's expansion as it chases coffee chain market leader Starbucks (O:SBUX) and its almost 29,000 stores across 77 markets.
Beyond coffee shops, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, a Briton familiar with the UK brand, said Costa would provide an important growth platform ranging from beans to bottled drinks in an attractive category, growing by around 6 percent a year. 
Coke already sells some coffee, such as the Georgia brand in Japan, but lacks a global offering, Quincey said in a blog post https://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/james-quincey-on-costa, highlighting Costa's retail footprint, roastery, supply chain and Costa Express vending system, which the company plans to expand. 
""Coffee is one of the strongest growing categories in the world, and Coca-Cola needs to expand into coffee and hot drinks,"" he said. 
Operating a retail chain marks a new challenge for 132-year-old Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which mostly sells soft drink concentrates to a network of franchised bottlers. 
It will face a fight, as rivals are also bulking up in a fragmented market, keen to attract young people prepared to pay out for barista-made drinks and developing tastes for ever more exotic coffees. 
Nestle (S:NESN), the market leader in packaged coffee, for example, has sealed a $7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks' retail business, while Europe's billionaire Reimann clan has built the JAB empire spanning coffee brands such as Kenco, Douwe Egberts and soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple. 
Bringing Costa shops to the key U.S. market would affect Starbucks, McDonald's - a major Coke customer - and JAB, which owns a string of chains including Peet's and Caribou.
Meanwhile, if Coke were to roll out canned or bottled Costa coffee drinks through its U.S. bottling system, that could upset the dominance of a joint venture between Starbucks and PepsiCo (O:PEP), trade publication Beverage Digest said.
The purchase of the biggest coffee chain behind Starbucks adds to Coca-Cola's drive to diversify away from fizzy drinks and expand its options for increasingly health-conscious consumers, after countries started introducing sugar taxes.
Coke shares were down 0.4 percent in morning trade in New York as investors weighed the benefits of diversification against concerns about profitability. 
""We do think investors will have questions surrounding the retail component of the business and lower operating profit margin versus legacy Coca-Cola,"" said JP Morgan analysts.
Coke did not change its outlook for 2018 or beyond. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.
CAFFEINE HIGH
Whitbread shares closed 14.3 percent higher following news of the deal, which analysts said was priced at a punchy 16.4 times Costa's latest annual earnings.
""Coca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation,"" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). 
""Its global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn’t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention.""
Whitbread had been in the process of demerging Costa from its hotel group Premier Inn, and the sale marks the latest transformation in a business that was established in 1742 as a brewer and which has also owned sports clubs and restaurants. 
Whitbread bought Costa, founded in 1971 in London by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa, for 19 million pounds in 1995. It only had 39 shops then, but now its maroon shop front is one of the most ubiquitous sights on British high streets, with 2,422 outlets in the UK and a further 1,399 in international markets, operated as franchises, joint ventures and wholesale outlets.
Whitbread Chief Executive Alison Brittain said the price tag represented ""a substantial premium"" to what would have been created through a demerger. 
""We were not interested in a sale other than to somebody who had a strategic rationale and therefore would be able to create significantly more value than Costa could create on its own.""
Some of the proceeds will go toward reducing Whitbread's pension deficit and financial debt to ease expansion of the Premier Inn hotel chain in the UK and Germany, but Brittain said a ""significant majority"" of the cash would go to shareholders. 
Brittain also denied Whitbread had been pressured to accelerate the sale by activist investor Elliott and other hedge funds. ""I would imagine they would be as delighted and surprised as anybody else this morning,"" she told reporters. 
Elliott congratulated the board on the deal and said it ""looks forward to continuing to engage with them to maximize the value of the remaining businesses"".
CAFE CULTURE 
The global market for packaged coffee and drinks was worth about $83 billion in 2017, a fraction of the $513 billion market for soft drinks, according to Euromonitor International, but it is growing faster. What is more, sales at coffee shops like Starbucks and Costa are growing even faster, as people increasingly indulge their habit on the go, rather than at home. 
Costa recently expanded into China to try to offset an increasingly saturated market in Britain, where chains such as Starbucks and Caffe Nero vie with thousands of independents.
A burgeoning cafe culture in China provides an encouraging backdrop, but Costa faces intensifying competition there as well. Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in China, plans to almost double that by 2022, while partnering with Chinese tech giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to start delivery services. 
Local rival Luckin also plans to more than double its Chinese store count to 2,000 by the end of 2018.
Rothschild advised Coke on the deal while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) advised Whitbread.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",European shares fall on renewed fear of trade conflict,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell for a second day on Friday on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is planning more tariffs on China, with Europe's STOXX posting its worst monthly performance since February.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) ended the session down 0.8 percent. Germany's DAX (GDAXI), heavier in trade-sensitive industrial stocks, fell 1 percent.
All sectors except one were in negative territory. Sparring over trade between Trump and the European Union weighed on car stocks (SXAP), down 1.6 percent and the worst-performing sector. 
Trump was reported to have rejected an EU offer to eliminate car tariffs, saying its trade policies are ""almost as bad as China"". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU would respond in kind if the U.S. imposed car tariffs. 
""It's very hard to see a decisive resuscitation of risk appetite until these tensions are resolved,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson Investors. 
""We have learned to under-react to some of the individual headlines because if you try to extrapolate from any of them you could find yourself in big trouble.""
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG), and Continental (DE:CONG) were among the biggest weights on the DAX, falling 1.4 to 1.9 percent. 
In contrast,  Whitbread  (L:WTB) soared as much as 19 percent after the UK company agreed to sell its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola (N:KO) for 3.9 billion pounds ($5.1 billion).
Traders said the deal's value exceeded the market's expectations by 500 million to 900 million pounds and was wrapped up more quickly than expected. Most of the cash will be returned to shareholders. 
Sage (L:SGE) tumbled nearly 8 percent, one of the biggest decliners among European stocks, after the British software developer surprised the market by announcing Chief Executive Stephen Kelly would stand down in May next year.
""This will leave a hole and raise further questions about reaching such targets,"" said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. ""This is one we wouldn't be bottom fishing right now."" 
While trade disputes have caused uncertainty and volatility, investors drew comfort from strong earnings. https://reut.rs/2LAe0Mw
""Concerns around trade are not significantly affecting macro and market fundamentals at this stage. There's still a fairly strong global recovery, earnings forecasts remain resilient across the board,"" said Janus Henderson's O'Connor.
""It limits the upside but isn't something that is changing our perception of broader market fundamentals.""
Analysts have, however, adjusted their earnings expectations for autos stocks since the trade war broke out.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Ford kills plan to sell Chinese-made vehicle in the United States,"By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has abruptly killed a plan to sell a Chinese-made small vehicle in the United States because of the prospect of higher U.S. tariffs, the head of the automaker's North American operations said Friday.
The automaker's decision came as U.S. President Donald Trump is escalating a trade battle with China, threatening to impose duties on another $200 billion in Chinese goods. 
The Trump administration has already imposed duties on Chinese-made vehicles of up to 25 percent. Trump is separately evaluating a proposal to impose tariffs on all imported vehicles on national security grounds.
The Chinese-made Focus Active, which Ford calls a crossover, would have been a niche vehicle for the United States, and the decision to abandon plans to launch it in the U.S. market next year will not cost jobs or have a significant impact on the automaker's U.S. sales, Ford North America chief Kumar Galhotra told reporters during a conference call on Friday.
""It basically boils down to how we deploy our resources,"" Galhotra said. Given the prospect of high tariffs, the Focus Active's costs in the U.S. ""would be substantially higher.""
Asked when the decision was taken, Galhotra said, ""we just made it. Literally.""
Plans to build and sell the Focus Active in Europe and China will move ahead, Galhotra said.
Ford's decision to abandon the Focus Active contrasts with the effort by rival General Motors Co (N:GM) to seek an exemption to new, 25 percent U.S. tariffs on its Buick Envision utility vehicle.
The Envision is a larger vehicle than the Focus Active, with a starting price of about $35,000. Ford had not set a U.S. price for the compact Focus Active, but it would have competed in a segment where prices start at around $20,000, leaving less profit margin to absorb additional import duties.
Ford and its rivals also are closely watching the outcome of negotiations toward a revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which continued on Friday. A Ford spokesman declined to comment on proposed changes to NAFTA auto trade rules, and Galhotra did not address them.
Ford in April said it would drop most of its traditional passenger car models for the North American market, and dropped an earlier plan to import Focus sedans from China.
About 95 percent of the vehicles Ford sells in the U.S. are assembled in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, Galhotra said. The company U.S. dealers get the EcoSport small sport utility from India and Transit Connect small vans from Spain.

""At the moment we do not see any significant risk to those products,"" Galhotra said.

874,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",Stocks - Manchester United Shoots to All-Time High Midday; Energy Stocks Struggle,"Investing.com - Shares of soccer club Manchester United rallied to all-time high territory midday, while energy stocks were broadly lower on trade concerns.
Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) stock jumped about 6% at 11:25 AM ET (15:25 GMT) and hit an intraday high of $27.70.
While the team is already struggling three games into the Premier League, with just one win, the performance of the stock has been stellar of late, pushing the enterprise value of the club up around $4.8 billion, which would match it as the world’s most valuable sports franchise with the Dallas Cowboys, according to Forbes.
It’s hard to pinpoint one reason why the stock is spiking today, but shares have been rallying strongly since the beginning of the month.
This could be investors (not supporters) applauding the decision by the team’s hierarchy to rein in summer spending on player transfers, much to the chagrin on manager Jose Mourinho.
Meanwhile, energy stocks were slightly lower across the board, pushing the S&P Energy Sector index down about 0.9%.
Crude oil fell in midday trading as worries about the impact of global trade wars overshadowed concerns about an expected drop in Iranian supply.
Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHGE), off about 2.5%, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), down about 1.5% and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which fell about 1.4%, were among the biggest losers in the index.
On the trade front, investors contended with President Donald Trump’s threat to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and his reported desire to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese goods as early as next week.
In addition, the U.S.-imposed Friday deadline for Canada to join the U.S. and Mexico in a reimagining of NAFTA was approaching."

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in French retailer  Casino  (PA:CASP) sank as much as 15 percent on Friday amid fresh concerns over its debt burden.
This came as U.S. short seller Muddy Waters said on Twitter that one of Casino's subsidiary had not filed its 2017 accounts.
The Muddy Waters tweet carried a link to public records company Infogreffe, which showed the Casino Finance unit did not file its 2017 accounts.
A Casino spokesman however said the delay was merely ""technical"" and that the accounts of the Casino unit were already integrated into Casino 2017 consolidated accounts.
""The accounts will be filed tomorrow and available on Infogreffe next week,"" he said
Casino shares narrowed their losses to 9 percent after the comments.
Casino stock has lost 45 percent so far this year partly on concern over the level of its debt and that of parent company  Rallye  (PA:GENC), whose shares are down 39 percent.
Casino, which had its credit rating cut to junk by Standard & Poor's in March 2016, said in June it aimed to complete 1.5 billion euros of asset sales by early 2019 to reduce its heavy debt burden.
In 2015 Muddy Waters criticized Casino's accounting practices, saying the supermarket retailer was ""dangerously leveraged"" and managed for the short-term.
Muddy Waters said at the time that it was ""short"" on Casino’s shares and credit, namely betting on falls in both assets.

Casino had rejected Muddy Waters' criticism at the time.

877,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 11:00AM ET</span>",Summer is over for investors as global worries build,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors returning from their summer holidays in the coming days are likely to feel a distinct chill in the air as they assess the world economy.
Growth globally of about 4 percent this year has raised hopes that the hangover of the financial crisis has finally lifted, a full 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
But President Donald Trump's relentless ""America First"" trade push is hurting confidence in many countries, rising U.S. interest rates are putting strains on emerging economies and currency problems have hit crisis levels in Argentina and Turkey.
Economic data over the coming days is likely to show how the increase in protectionism is affecting Asia and Europe, and the worries about trade could grow soon.
The Trump administration will take a step toward escalating its trade battle with China on Wednesday when it ends consultations on hitting a further $200 billion worth of Chinese goods with tariffs.
In Britain, lawmakers will return to parliament with many from the ruling Conservative Party determined to force Prime Minister Theresa May to rework her plans for Brexit, just as talks with Brussels hit their crunch point.
Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said her firm has trimmed its forecasts and now expects global economic growth to slow to 3.2 percent by 2020 from 3.8 percent this year.
That will reduce the need for central banks of the rich economies to raise interest rates. 
By contrast their peers in emerging markets will be under pressure to raise rates to stop capital flowing abroad and to shore up their currencies, possibly aggravating the uneven pattern of economic growth around the world.
""However it's not all absolute doom and gloom,"" O'Carroll said. ""We are not forecasting the world economy is going to go into recession in the next few years. It's just going to be slower growth than we've seen in 2017 and in 2018.""
Even in the United States, where Trump's tax cuts have fired up an economy that was already outperforming its peers, some believe growth has now peaked.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Aug. 24 that the Federal Reserve should stop raising rates given the likelihood of an economic slowdown next year, and only weak inflation pressure.
For now, however, the U.S. economy looks like it will help Trump before mid-term elections in November, allowing him to tell voters he is on track to meet his promise of 3 percent annual growth, at least this year.
U.S. payrolls figures on Friday are expected to show further solid job creation, even if they might be distorted by the summer holidays, pushing wage growth back up to an annual 2.8 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
""The United States is on a much stronger trajectory than other economies, not least because of the massive stimulus of the tax package and government spending has ballooned,"" Christoph Balz, an economist with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said.
With the U.S. labor market so tight, a slowdown appeared likely, he said.
TRADE IMPACT
In Germany there are signs that the global trade tensions are having a more noticeable impact. Industrial orders figures for July, due on Thursday, are expected to show only a small rise after falling by the most in nearly a year-and-a-half in June.
The picture in Asia is similar. 
Export orders for Chinese manufacturers shrank for a third month in a row, data showed on Aug. 31, and August trade balance releases from South Korea and Taiwan will be closely watched for the trade war impact, before China's trade figures on Sept. 8.
In Britain, monthly PMI surveys of manufacturing, construction and services for August will give a sense of how companies are coping with the weaker global economy as well as the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
Prime Minister May is hoping to clinch a deal on Britain's future relationship with the European Union in October although officials say the deadline could slip into November.
O'Carroll said October was looking like a key month not only for Brexit but also because the United States will be heading into the final campaigning for the elections on Nov. 6 and Italy's government, where some officials want to break EU spending rules, is likely to be finalizing its fiscal plans.

""I don't think there is going to be much rest now,"" she said. ""It's really going to pick up pace.""

878,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Mortgage bond ratings get harder to decode,"By Joy Wiltermuth and Natalie Harrison
NEW YORK (IFR) - Credit rating opinions on new types of residential mortgage bonds have become increasingly divided, making it harder for investors to gauge their risks.
Ten years since the RMBS sector helped lead to the 2008 financial crash, primary issuance is expected to set a new post-crisis record.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists predict volumes will reach US$75bn by year-end, the highest since 2008. There has already been around US$51bn issued in 2018, they said.
These securities pool home loans from some of the best and also more challenged US homebuyers. Their comeback has been fueled by the buyside looking to get a stake in the current buoyant US housing market.
But there are concerns about the alphabet soup of ratings being applied by agencies. Ratings should help investors judge how safe an investment is, but sometimes it is unclear if the correct one has been applied.
About 40% of the RMBS sold this year came with ""split"" ratings, when deals were vetted by multiple credit agencies, versus around 5% four years ago, according to a recent Fitch Ratings report.
Split ratings can highlight more liberal metrics being used by one rating agency over another.
""Rating agency competition is generally positive for the market by providing a greater number of perspectives for an investor to consider,"" Fitch said. ""That said, a ratings divide makes it more important for RMBS investors to be cognizant of the differences between agencies.""
But that can sometimes be a challenge, especially as ratings models can change - and potentially sting investors in the process.
""A change in rating agency methodology that results in downgrades even when the performance of loans is unchanged, can adversely impact liquidity,"" Neil Aggarwal, senior portfolio manager at Semper Capital, told IFR.
SPLIT RATINGS
With the prevailing issuer-pay model, future rating assignments are always at the whim of the payer.
One concern is that different rating approaches could lead to ratings shopping - when issuers seek the highest ratings at the best price - and skimpier credit buffers to protect investors from losses.
""If investors don't differentiate between ratings, there is a risk that issuers will choose based on rating levels more frequently than they are now,"" said Suzanne Mistretta, a senior director at Fitch Ratings.
For now, and despite past mistakes, ratings from at least one of the three majors - Fitch, Moody's and S&P - are often required for an investor to be able to buy a new issue.
This month Moody's agreed to pay a US$16.25m fine to settle claims that it failed to ensure the accuracy of models it used to rate some US mortgage bonds sold from 2010 to 2013.
S&P paid US$1.5bn three years ago to settle claims that it supplied inaccurate ratings to mortgage bonds in the run-up to the crisis.
S&P completed a second round of revisions to its US RMBS methodology earlier this year, which impacts deals issued in 2009 and later.
Prime deals are expected to see few changes under the new criteria, but weaker collateral deals could see ratings fluctuate one to three notches from the prior model.
""I have to know what the rating agencies are thinking,"" Aggarwal said. ""Any changes can have a tremendous impact on my liquidity and ability to exit a trade.""
LAYERED RISKS
As it stands right now, the market remains a shadow of its former self even with its recent growth. That limits more widespread fallout to the economy if bonds were suddenly downgraded en masse.
In the peak years before the market collapsed, a combined US$2.5trn of RMBS was sold to investors in 2005 and 2006.
But some investors are cautious that risks are bubbling up in the sector, particularly on pools of non-qualified mortgages, often to self-employed borrowers.
Being self-employed is not necessarily a bad thing: recent deals include high FICO borrowers earning good money.
But when these loans are on investment properties, rather than primary residences, the default risk - and potential losses for bond investors - rises.
""I've been waiting for this market to come back for years. I'm extremely excited we're seeing growth and I want it to evolve,"" Paul Norris, head of structured products at Conning, told IFR. ""But I also want to be cautious about what I am buying as the risks have still not been fully understood.""
Underwriting has become more lenient.
Only 12 months of bank statements are often required for non-qualified mortgage loans versus 24 months after the crash, Norris said.
Analyzing cash flowing from a bank account also has its limitations.

""It's hard to know whether everything going through the bank statement is money to repay a mortgage or if it's cash flowing to a business,"" said Norris.

880,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>",U.S. Midterm Election May Be Harbinger for Emerging-Market Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- If history teaches emerging-market investors one thing about U.S. midterms, it’s hang in there, ride out the volatility and wait for the rally.
Since 1990, a strategy of purchasing stocks in MSCI’s emerging-market equity index on Oct. 31 in midterm years and selling 12 months later would have returned an average of 23 percent. In years without midterm elections, stocks gained an average of 9.3 percent over the same period.
Before then, expect a lot of gyrations.
This time around, the grimmer-than-usual political landscape may prove a bonus for emerging-market assets. With the threat of losing his congressional majority, President Donald Trump has an incentive to reach a trade deal with North American allies and make progress in talks with China, according to David Hauner, a cross-asset strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in London. That will probably spur a rally in emerging markets over the next few months as the dollar loses its haven status, he said.
A decline in the dollar could also bode well for developing-nation stocks. Their negative correlation to the greenback is near the strongest in a decade, meaning that any weakening of the U.S. currency will translate into higher emerging-market equity prices.
The closest political parallel to today may be 2002. Seeking to maintain his congressional majority and gear up for reelection, George W. Bush zipped across the country to 15 states in the final five days, firing up crowds at Republican rallies and paving the way for his party to gain additional seats.
Emerging-market equities and bonds rallied in the ensuing 12 months after depreciating during the first half of 2002.
Trump plans to spend 40 days on the road this fall stumping for candidates.
Not everyone’s convinced that Trump will temper his trade rhetoric. John Normand, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s head of cross-asset fundamental strategy in London, said that the president could very well double down on his aggressive approach abroad, escalating his push for higher tariffs on Chinese imports.
But Mona Mahajan, investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York, said the summer volatility in developing-nation assets can only last so long. She expects it to ease before the November elections amid positive signs on trade with Mexico and China.
""President Trump and the administration want to get some wins prior to midterms,"" Mahajan said on Bloomberg TV."
881,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Heavy supply aggravates Brexit jitters in UK bank deals,"By Alice Gledhill
LONDON (IFR) - It was easy to point the finger at Brexit after recent senior euro trades from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) failed to whip up much demand, but timing and heavy competing supply arguably played as much, if not more, of a role. 
RBS Group accrued €1.2bn in orders for its €750m 6.5NC5.5 (Baa2/BBB-/BBB+) on Tuesday, pricing just 3bp inside initial price thoughts at swaps plus 167bp. The outcome recalled last Friday's €750m Barclays five-year (Baa3/BBB/A), which drew a €1.1bn book and landed 5bp inside IPTs at swaps plus 130bp.
UK lenders have been grappling with the implications of an exit from the European Union ever since the referendum in 2016, the outcome of which has left investors wary of performance risk in the near term and their future fundamental trajectory.
""I think the UK (banks') investor base is smaller than for other Northern Europeans, and I think that's been true for a while,"" said one syndicate banker. 
He suggested that for UK-focused banks like Barclays and RBS, €750m rather than €1bn is arguably the best they can hope for.
All five euro-denominated UK seniors since Nationwide's €1bn senior non-preferred in March have been €750m or smaller, and the sector trades cheaply compared to most other European jurisdictions. 
Worryingly, investor appetite is waning just as banks across Europe have to raise billions in loss-absorbing debt to meet regulatory requirements. While dollar issuance is a viable alternative, funding officials cannot rely on that market alone. 
Though UK lenders have taken a large bite out of their targets, there is still some way to go - and spread volatility is only likely to increase as politicians attempt to thrash out a deal in the coming months.
""[UK issuers] are worried about what happens to demand for UK risk as we start to get all this brinkmanship around Brexit as we go later in the year,"" said a second banker. 
""My understanding is that the UK was quite a large driver of demand for the RBS and Barclays deals, so the overall demand itself was quite limited and even then, was dominated by the UK."" 
Domestic investors took 57% of allocations in the RBS deal. Barclays did not disclose distribution statistics. 
FALSE NARRATIVE?
That said, the decision by Barclays to print in a weakening market after heavy supply - and without a particularly generous concession - was perhaps the primary reason for its limited momentum. The bond initially widened 3bp.
""That deal created a narrative that there is a problem with UK risk, and RBS has suffered from that despite the fact that [its deal] was fairly sensibly priced,"" said the second banker. 
Indeed it is not just UK paper that has failed to prove a must-buy. While HSBC France, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Rabobank have all pulled in multi-billion books in recent days, executions for OP Corporate Bank and Banco de Sabadell have looked more challenging, for example. 
Banks have now priced more than €14bn of senior unsecured paper in the past two weeks in the biggest burst of activity since March, leaving investors spoilt for choice. 
""Add to this the Brexit backdrop in the UK and I think it makes holdco senior an easy pass for investors given it's easy to sit around and wait for the next cheap new issue,"" said Lloyd Harris, a fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors.
""There is an imbalance of supply and demand at the moment, and that tends to show up in smaller books in the perceived weaker names or those names that have a story attached to them."" 
HAPPILY OVERWEIGHT
While execution was not plain-sailing, it has been a happier story in the secondary market. Barclays was better bid at 127bp on Friday morning, while RBS was considerably tighter at 155bp.
For all the uncertainties ahead, UK banks are still in decent shape when it comes to key credit metrics, and a stringent regulator has ramped up capitalization levels ahead of other European jurisdictions. 
And while Brexit has clearly weighed on UK bank spreads, other factors specific to the sector such as ring-fencing - the separation of retail and investment banking activities - have also taken their toll as investors digest the changes. 
""Generally, UK banks look quite good at the moment,"" said Harris. ""We're overweight UK banks and happy to be so, I think it's a good opportunity. It would amaze me if there's not a [Brexit] deal."" 
Growing numbers of buyers might come round to that view, particularly if further weakening makes UK valuations too attractive to pass by. The group of accounts that refuses outright to touch UK bank paper is small and fairly static, bankers said. 
""When you do look at the nuts and bolts of the banks, they look pretty good - I wouldn't stay away from any one of the UK banks because I'd be worried there is some imminent collapse ahead,"" said Gregory Turnbull Schwartz, a fund manager at Baillie Gifford.

""But I think a lot of people might have that same view - of holding off for the moment and being prepared for spread widening; and if there is some disruption during the key Brexit time frame, that might be a nice buying opportunity.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British investors increased their equity exposure in August from July's nine-month lows, favoring emerging markets after a shake-out in the sector, but cut UK assets as the risk of a no-deal Brexit grew.
Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 17 UK-based asset managers was conducted Aug. 16-28 as world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) climbed to a six-month high. 
U.S. equities (SPX) (IXIC) also set record highs after a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) raised hopes that a global trade war could be averted.
Most participants completed the poll before the accord was announced, but the mood was still more bullish than it had been in July when trade war concern sapped investor confidence.
""The global economy remains in a period of synchronized economic growth and despite some weakness in the eurozone, continues to gather momentum,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust.
In the poll, British managers raised their global equity exposure to 51.2 percent from 50.4 percent in July. They cut cash by 1.6 percentage points to 4.4 percent, the lowest level in at least five years. 
Mark Shields, investment director for the multi-asset team at Brooks Macdonald, was among those overweighting risk assets: ""Premiums in valuations in the U.S. are warranted in our view given the strong consumer backdrop, earnings momentum and the pace of economic expansion,"" he said.
The U.S. stocks allocation held at last month's 34 percent, the highest in nearly two years. Investors also ramped up their exposure to emerging-market stocks to 18.4 percent from July's 16.3 percent, after a turbulent month.
Emerging-market equities (MSCIEF) are down over 9 percent year-to-date, clobbered by trade war fears and rising U.S. interest rates. Emerging-market currencies sold off again in August as crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified and rising U.S. sanctions risk hit Russia.
The lira  is now down over 40 percent year-to-date, crushed by Turkey's loose monetary and fiscal policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. 
But poll participants who answered a question on the currency's travails were split over whether the lira had troughed. Forty-one 41 percent said it hadn't, a third said it had, and a quarter were undecided.
TIME TO BUY
There was more agreement over whether it was time to buy emerging-market assets. Two-thirds of those who answered that question agreed. 
Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth, noted the assets looked cheap compared with developed- market debt and equities. 
""The recent sell-off represents an attractive new entry level,"" he said, arguing that fears of contagion from Argentina, Brazil and Turkey to other markets was unjustified. 
Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, also saw more positives than negatives for emerging markets in coming months. 
He acknowledged risks in Turkey, Venezuela and Brazil but added: ""We have seen strong profits growth for the EM complex, and better valuations encourage us to look for buying opportunities.""
UK assets were shunned, with sterling hitting a one-year low versus the euro in August as fears over a no-deal Brexit grew.
Investors slashed their UK equity exposure by 3.6 percentage points to 21.2 percent, the lowest level since April 2015. UK bond holdings also fell to 21.5 percent, the lowest since May.

""With Brexit moving ever closer and uncertainty remaining, many UK investors have moved to the side of caution,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum, noting that overseas investors also appeared to be shying away from the UK.

LONDON (Reuters) - European fund managers increased their global equity exposure to seven-month highs in August but slashed holdings of emerging-market debt after a turbulent month of selling for the Turkish lira, Argentine peso and other emerging-market currencies. 
The Reuters monthly asset allocation poll of 19 European asset managers was conducted Aug. 16-30, when world stocks (MIWD00000PUS) rose to their highest in nearly six months and U.S. equities (SPX) reached record highs. But emerging-market equities (MSCIEF) look set to end the month down 3 percent. 
Jan Bopp, investment strategist at Bank J Safra Sarasin, said that since April, U.S. equities had outperformed non-U.S. equities as the U.S.-Chinese trade war set off safe-haven flows, penalizing emerging equities. 
""Tightening global liquidity will continue to challenge emerging market assets and in this environment more sentiment shocks are likely to periodically trigger sell-offs,"" he said. 
Investors increased their overall equity holdings by 1.1 percentage point to 44.9 percent and cut cash levels to 7.4 percent from July's 9 percent. The bond allocation fell 1.1 percentage point to 38.1 percent, the lowest since January 2016. 
Cedric Baron, head of multi asset at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, said he was keeping a slight overweight in equities because earnings momentum remained strong and record share buy-backs were providing strong support, especially in the United States. 
Although the emerging-market equities allocation was effectively unchanged at 14.8 percent, investors slashed emerging-market debt holdings to 12.8 percent from 18.9 percent in July.
Emerging-market currencies sold off in August, with Turkey's lira , Argentina's peso , South Africa's rand , the Brazilian real , China's yuan  and Indian rupee  all feeling the heat. 
""The situation in emerging markets is challenging with weak fundamentals for some countries, high political uncertainty for others and lower liquidity with the (U.S. Federal Reserve) normalization,"" said Guilhem Savry, head of macro and dynamic allocation at Unigestion.
The lira is now down some 41 percent against the dollar year-to-date, plumbing another record low in August. But some 69 percent of poll participants who answered a question on Turkey's currency said it had not yet reached a trough.
""The Turkish economy still faces tough times ahead,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Prime Partners, adding that the measures already announced by the authorities had not yet addressed the real issues. 
""Some capital controls may have to be introduced, a recession is looming, and it could be quite harsh in order to correct imbalances,"" he said.
Given the scale of the shake-out in emerging markets in August, however, 71 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the subject said now was the time to buy.
Nadege Dufosse, head of asset allocation at Candriam, said emerging-market assets had already built in a risk premium for tighter U.S. monetary policy, a stronger dollar and trade war risks.
But Peter van der Welle, a strategist at Robeco, argued that the resurgent dollar, the unresolved China-U.S. trade disputes and volatile commodity prices were obstacles that prevented the unlocking of the value being created.

(Reuters) - U.S. fund managers recommended an increase in cash holdings this month to a three-year high and a cut to equities as persistent concern about a U.S.-China trade war sent stock markets see-sawing, a Reuters poll showed.
Progress in the past week on North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations had led to expectations of further easing of global trade tensions, but the respite for short-term traders was didn't last.
U.S. stocks ended a four-day winning streak in a broad-based sell-off on Thursday after a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to step up his trade war with China.
""The biggest risk to the U.S. and global markets is related to mounting trade tensions. While we believe these will be resolved, the process could take longer than many investors want,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
Average month-to-month allocation changes in Reuters polls are usually slight. The notable change in the latest survey of 12 U.S. fund managers, conducted Aug. 15-30, was the recommended increase in cash to its highest since May 2015.
""With trade still making headlines almost every day, it is best to get into cash and wait for those pockets of opportunities to buy various assets and ignore the buying and selling pressures around at the moment,"" said a fund manager at a large U.S. investment firm.
Equity holdings were cut to the lowest in over a year, but still accounted for 56.6 percent of the average model global portfolio from 56.9 percent in July.
Recommended bond holdings were increased to 35.9 percent from 35.8 percent in July and cash allocations to 4.5 percent from 3.5 percent.

Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 50 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out between Aug. 16-30, when global equities (MIWD00000PUS) rose to their highest in nearly six months.
Unsurprisingly, investors raised their equity allocation to 48.3 percent, the highest level since April. They cut bonds to 38.8 percent and cash to 5.2 percent. 
They also reduced their emerging-market equity holdings to 11 percent from July's 12.2 percent and their emerging-market debt allocation by 1.9 percentage points to 10.2 percent after another sell-off across the complex.
MSCI's benchmark emerging equities index (MSCIEF) is set to end August down over 3 percent, having fallen over 9 percent so far this year. 
Emerging-market currencies also took another pounding, with Argentina's peso , Turkey's lira  and the Indian rupee  all plumbing record lows. Brazil's real , China's yuan  and the South African rand  came under sustained pressure as well.
Yet 63 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the sector said it was time to buy emerging-market assets. 
""As the threat of much higher rates and a much stronger dollar are largely behind us, this general repricing should be seen as an entry point (excluding idiosyncratic situations) for long-term investors,"" said Pascal Blanque, group chief investment officer of Amundi. 
However, Michael Ingram, chief market strategist at WHIreland Wealth Management, remained cautious. He removed overweight emerging-market positions in his model portfolios months ago.
""EM credit spreads have moved up, but are still low on a multi-year basis. Any narrowing faces headwinds from the ongoing tightening of U.S. monetary policy and a firmer dollar,"" he said.
For stocks, he said, earnings momentum still seemed negative and unless there was a broader move by investors from growth to value, they were unlikely to outperform.
MASSIVE LOSSES
Investors were divided over whether the lira had reached a trough after plummeting more than 40 percent year-to-date. Some 45 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the currency said it had not yet bottomed out; 38 percent thought it had. 
""Further massive losses in the value of the lira are almost inevitable if the central bank does not move toward a more restrictive course,"" said Jan Bopp, an investment strategist at Bank J Safra Sarasin. ""But that will only become possible when (President Tayyip) Erdogan realizes that the markets leave him no other choice.""
Other managers argued that poor liquidity over the summer had exaggerated the moves and calmer heads were likely to prevail after the holiday period. 
Elsewhere, investors raised their Japanese equity holdings by 4.8 percentage points to 21.8 percent and their Japanese bond allocation by 2.6 percentage points to 16.7 percent - both the highest in at least five years. 
""We like the valuations and favorable business cycle which supports the Japanese equity market,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma. 
Cedric Baron, head of multi asset at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, added: ""We think Japanese stocks will benefit longer than U.S. and Europe from their local central bank support.""
The Bank of Japan has signaled that it will keep its super-easy monetary policy in place for an extended period. 
The Nikkei <.N225> rose to its highest in over three months in August, lifted by a slight easing in global trade war worries and the yen's depreciation against the dollar.
CROWDED TECH
Asset managers trimmed U.S. equity exposure by 1.2 percentage points to 40.7 percent after raising it for four successive months. 
U.S. stocks reached record highs in August and the S&P 500 (SPX) is set to end the month up 3 percent. The U.S. market was lifted by rallies in Apple (O:AAPL), which reached a $1 trillion stock market valuation, Amazon (O:AMZN) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) .
Global tech stocks have been cited as the most crowded trade for months, but 68 percent of poll participants who answered a question on this did not expect a correction by year-end.
""The U.S. economy continues its progress toward late-cycle, where tech's low labor cost exposure, high margins and high cash balance should be supportive factors,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management.

But Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth, said both U.S. and Asian tech giants had been in bubble territory for several months, and a meaningful correction was likely in the next six months: ""The valuations of some of the large tech stocks are becoming harder to justify.""

887,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 07:18AM ET</span>","From Unilever to Ford, companies in Venezuela cling on by cutting products","By Corina Pons and Tibisay Romero
CARACAS/VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Unilever's factory in the outskirts of the northern Venezuelan city of Valencia once bustled with activity as it produced everything from soap to toothpaste for one of South America's wealthiest economies. 
Now, with Venezuela struggling with a fifth year of recession and its economy wracked by hyperinflation, there are few signs of activity. A handful of workers loiter inside the compound with only the occasional truck passing through its gates. 
The Anglo-Dutch conglomerate has quietly scaled back its output in the crisis-stricken oil-producing nation to a single product - Tio Rico ice cream - produced in Valencia and at another plant in Barquisimeto, some 90 miles (145 km) to the west.
Production of Tio Rico ice cream halted at another factory in the sweltering city of Maracaibo in western Venezuela over a year ago.
""Until last year, we were producing 800 containers of 1,000 liters of ice cream per month,"" said one worker at the Valencia plant, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""Now, we're sending out 40 per month.""
Slashing product portfolios has allowed the handful of multinationals that remain in Venezuela to survive shrinking demand and could pave the way for some to make an exit, according to a dozen advisors to large companies. 
 Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) said it was staying in Venezuela and was focused on strengthening its ice cream unit. A spokesman for the company said its ""production is in line with market demand.""
But the gradual exodus of companies, from cleaning products firm  Clorox Co  (N:CLX) to cereal maker Kellogg Co (N:K), along with diminishing hope for political change, has led to speculation among company advisors that more will follow suit.
That is true more than ever after President Nicolas Maduro announced this month higher corporate taxes and a 60-fold minimum wage increase, advisors say.
On Monday, workers protested at the Venezuelan unit of tire-maker Pirelli after they arrived to find the factory gates locked. It was not immediately clear if the plant was temporarily shut or closing for good. 
""Transnational companies are not putting new money into Venezuela. And if they stay, it is because they found a financial balance to sustain themselves,"" said Luis Vicente Leon a well-known pollster, economist and business adviser. 
""But if this balance is severely disrupted, you will most likely see more companies leaving this market.""
'SIGNIFICANT DECREASE'
Some multinationals have stopped selling some of their best-known products due to currency controls that left them struggling to import raw materials and a ban on price hikes despite inflation projected to reach 1,000,000 percent this year.
Ford Motos Co's (N:F) plant, already operating at severely reduced capacity, scaled back in July to a single model, one of its sport utility vehicles, said union leader Eliecer Cohen.
Ford said in a statement it had no plans to leave Venezuela, but acknowledged that it had ""faced a significant decrease in demand"" in recent months.
General Motors Co (N:GM) left Venezuela last year after a protracted court case with two former auto dealers who ended taking control of the plant as part of a concession dispute.
Consumer goods giant Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) has for more than a year only produced a feminine hygiene product called panty liners after halting its production of sanitary napkins and Q-tips, according to a union representative who asked not be identified. 
Johnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Companies have provided less advance notice about plans to shut down Venezuela operations, in part to minimize potential government blowback, according to business leaders and consultants interviewed by Reuters.
When Clorox Co (N:CLX) and  Kimberly Clark  Corp (N:KMB) closed their operations, top management had already left the country, according to union leaders. 
Kimberly Clark said its operations had suffered from high inflation and difficulty in obtaining raw materials due to currency controls.
Kellogg still had three weeks worth of raw material on hand when it closed operations in May, according to a employee who asked not to be identified. Employees and managers alike were taken by surprised when they arrived at the factory gates to find them padlocked.
The company said at the time that it discontinued operations due to ""economic and social deterioration.""
The plant was taken over by the government. State television days later broadcast images of production being restarted by the governor of the state of Aragua.
Such state administrators often fall behind on paying suppliers, according to business advisors, which is bad news for providers like packaging and cereal box maker  Smurfit Kappa  Group Plc (I:SKG).
Government officials last week occupied Smurfit Kappa's unit on the grounds it was not following labor legislation, was refusing to sell to state-run companies and was charging too much for its products. 
Venezuelan military intelligence arrested two of the company's executives, according to state price control agency Sundde.
Smurfit Kappa denied the allegations and said it was seeking the release of the executives.

Union leaders said one of Smurfit's plants had not been operational since July and had sent its workers home - a strategy of many foreign companies who want to maintain a presence in Venezuela to avoid lengthy processes of obtaining permits if they later decide to return.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 06:23AM ET</span>",Bruised bankers seek consolation prizes after shelved Aramco IPO,"By Saeed Azhar, Hadeel Al Sayegh and Clara Denina 
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks which lost out on big payouts for the work on the shelved listing of oil giant Aramco are lining up for a raft of other projects as Saudi Arabia pursues reforms. 
Banks including JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) worked for months to prepare what would have been the biggest ever stock market debut. But the plan to sell 5 percent of the company for a targeted $100 billion was pulled.
The bankers were paid retainer fees but were expecting around $200 million would be shared among all the banks involved when the deal was done. 
Now, they are pinning their hopes on other projects from a privatization program that is part of Riyadh's economic reform plan to loosen its reliance on oil. Without the funds from the Aramco sale, the government is looking to raise money in other ways, creating new opportunities for the banks, bankers say. 
Teams from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley that worked on the IPO, have been shifted to advise on Aramco' planned acquisition of up to $70 billion in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) (SE:2010), three people familiar with the details of the transaction told Reuters. 
HSBC (L:HSBA), which was also an adviser on the Aramco IPO, is expected to play a role in putting together the debt to fund that purchase, they said.
One of the sources said the issue could exceed the 2016 sovereign bond issue of $17.5 billion, which was a record for the kingdom. Aramco said earlier this month it was in ""very early-stage discussions"" with the kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire the stake in SABIC but has not said how it will finance the deal.
Spokespeople for JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC declined to comment on their role in the Sabic deal. None of those banks have confirmed they were involved in the Aramco IPO.
Other deals are expected to be forthcoming.
""The PIF (sovereign wealth fund) has had to reconsider its budget in the last three months, after finding out that they wouldn’t be getting $100 billion from the Aramco IPO right away,"" said a banker in Saudi Arabia.
""So there’s been a flurry of activity as they look to raise cash in other ways. A lot of these are smaller deals, $1 billion here and there, but all geared toward financing their commitments for big infrastructure projects without slowing down their timelines."" 
The banker did not give details of the other deals. PIF officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
After Reuters reported last week that the Aramco deal had been shelved, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government was committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future.
BANKERS WARY
The bankers are nevertheless wary after the Aramco experience. It highlighted the hurdles of doing business in a country governed by an absolute monarchy where public protest and political parties are banned. It also added to uncertainty after scores of top royals, ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an anti-corruption campaign last November.
The preparation for the listing was launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman two years ago and some bankers had flown to the kingdom hundreds of times to work in the Dhahran camp, a gated compound for the oil group's residents. 
A different source said Aramco had demanded it deal only with the very top bankers.
Another person familiar with the Aramco deal said he had made more than 20 trips to Dhahran over 18 months but with little to show for it. He said his team would ""give the same presentation each time without getting much feedback.""
Bankers also say the fees are modest in comparison to those paid by other countries. 
""The deal flow is huge but there's a worry that the fees coming from these projects are low,"" said a Gulf-based banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity. 
""Saudi Arabia is lower than Hong Kong and Dubai when it comes to fees,"" he said. ""It's all substandard.""
Typical fees for banks doing IPOs in more developed markets are around 1 percent of the overall deal while estimates from bankers and analysts for an Aramco IPO was 0.2 percent.
The 35 banks who worked on Chinese internet giant Alibaba's $21.8 billion float, led by six main underwriters, pocketed an estimated $300 million among them, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
""PLENTY OF DEALS""
Still, the rewards from a privatization that analysts expect to generate ($9 billion to $11 billion) by 2020 are too big for bankers to ignore.
HSBC is already advising Saudi International Petrochemical Company on a potential merger with Sahara Petrochemical, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley, according to disclosures from March. 
U.S. bank  Citigroup  (N:C) obtained a license to conduct capital markets business in Saudi Arabia last year after an absence of almost 13 years.
Moelis is preparing to apply for an advisory license in Saudi Arabia and U.S. boutique investment bank Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017.
The government is also trying to make it easier to do deals, changing the law to allow alternatives to traditional debt finance.
""There are plenty of deals to be made from bigger players looking to consolidate their market position and buy out competitors,"" said Mohammed Fahmi, the Dubai-based co-Head of EFG Hermes Investment Banking.

""Good stories will continue to see a following.""

Citing worries over addiction among children, China’s Ministry of Education said it would adopt measures to limit the time young people spend playing online games. It would also explore the idea of creating an age-appropriate notification system.
The news came after Tencent’s much-hyped video game “Monster Hunter: World” was pulled down from its online store less than a week after its official launch on Aug. 8.
The company reported its first decline in profit for the first time in a decade earlier this month, while its share prices is now down almost 30% from their January peak.

898,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 03:00AM ET</span>",Coca-Cola Digs Into Coffee With $5.1 Billion Costa Purchase,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. agreed to buy the U.K. chain Costa Coffee for 3.9 billion pounds ($5.1 billion), stepping into a battle with Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). as it gains a global brand in hot drinks.
 Whitbread  (LON:WTB) Plc agreed to sell Costa at a price that’s 16 times this year’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the companies said in a statement Friday.
“Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand,” Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said in the statement. “Costa gives us access to this market through a strong coffee platform.”
Makers of soft drinks are branching out as consumers seek alternatives to sugary sodas. Earlier this month, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. agreed to pay $3.2 billion for SodaStream Ltd., which makes carbonated-water dispensers.
Costa outranks Starbucks in the U.K. and is expanding in markets such as China. The company was one of the few big coffee chains up for sale after Nestle and the Reimann family’s investment company JAB both went on an acquisition spree in the segment.
Coke sells coffee under the Georgia brand in Japan and has some other local products for specific markets.
Whitbread bought Costa in 1995 for 19 million pounds. At the time, it had 39 shops; now it has more than 3,800 locations in 32 countries. The company also operates a business of 8,000 self-service machines.
Whitbread said in April that it would spin off Costa as an independent publicly traded company, after pressure from activist investors who said the business should be separate from its hotel operations.
The sale will yield a “substantial premium” to the value that would have been created through a spinoff, Whitbread said. The company will return most of the proceeds to its shareholders, it said.
Bankers from Rothschild advised Coke, while Whitbread used Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn).

In September last year, Reuters reported that the second biggest U.S. ride service company was close to hiring an IPO advisory firm in its first concrete step to become publicly listed.
Lyft has hired Class V Group LLC to work with the management on the process and plans to begin taking pitches from banks starting as early as September, Bloomberg said, citing sources. https://bloom.bg/2NCmGnt
Lyft and Class V Group did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
Lyft has, in the past, defied predictions about when it will launch its IPO.
The ride hailer had raised $600 million in its most recent funding round led by Fidelity Management in June this year, doubling its valuation to $15.1 billion in little over a year. Lyft operates in roughly the same number of U.S. cities as rival Uber, which is also planning to go public next year.
An initial public offering for Lyft would amplify Uber's[UBER.UL] troubles. It would be an opportunistic way for the company, which was valued at $7.5 billion in its last funding round, to capitalize on its larger rival. Fresh capital for Lyft would merely compound the frontrunner's injuries.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>","Japan stocks to rise in 2018 underpinned by corporate profits, U.S. economy: Reuters Poll","By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks are forecast to rise 5 percent over the rest of this year, with stronger corporate profits expected to underpin sentiment, but selling by foreign investors could cap the upside, a Reuters poll found.
In recent weeks, Sino-U.S. trade frictions and a selloff in emerging market currencies have heightened risk aversion, pushing Japanese stocks to one-month lows, as investors flocked to the safe-haven yen. A stronger yen cuts Japanese manufacturers' profits made abroad when repatriated.
But an easing in U.S.-Mexico trade tensions over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provided relief to the market this week.
Although lingering trade frictions could limit the upside, Japanese stocks will move up steadily toward the end of the year but then flatline, according to median estimates from 26 analysts and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past week.
The Nikkei share average is expected to trade at 24,000 at year-end, up 5 percent from Thursday's close of 22,869.50, the median forecast showed. It is also seen trading at 24,000 at mid-2019 and end-2019.
Forecasts for end-2018 ranged from 22,000 to 26,000. They were 19,000 to 27,500 for mid-2019. In the previous poll in June, forecasts ranged from 21,000 to 26,000 for end-December 2018.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week emphasized the central bank's push to raise interest rates despite Trump's criticism of higher borrowing costs.
""We can expect a strong U.S. economy, and the dollar-yen rate is higher than what most Japanese companies have expected this fiscal year. An expected Fed rate hike will likely prop up the dollar against the yen,"" said Jun Kitazawa, an equity strategist at Miki Securities, who forecast the Nikkei to trade at 24,000 at year-end and 25,000 in mid-2019.
""Despite stronger Japanese corporate earnings outlook, Japanese stocks' price-to-earnings ratio has fallen to around 13 times, making them attractive.""
However, analysts say foreign investors' massive sell-off in Japanese equities on concerns about a global trade war could possibly offset some of these positive factors.
""Companies' earnings have been better than expected, but foreigners have sold around a net 8 trillion yen since the beginning of the year,"" said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities.
""So it shows how the market is being supported by the Bank Of Japan's buying of exchange traded funds.""
Exchange data this week showed foreign investors have sold a net 8.03 trillion yen in Japanese cash equities and futures since the beginning of the year.
Ibayashi expects the Nikkei to trade at 22,000 at end-2018 and 24,000 at mid-2019.
EARNINGS
Companies reported an increase of 19 percent in their pretax profits for the April-June period, while analysts expect their annual pretax profits to rise 11.4 percent for the fiscal year ending March 2019, according to Daiwa Securities. Daiwa expects companies to raise their conservative outlooks when they report mid-term results later this year.
For now, most companies base their dollar-yen rate assumptions at an average of 107-108 yen this fiscal year. The dollar traded at about 111.25 yen on Thursday.
""The midterm earnings season this fall will likely serve as a tailwind to Japanese equities. The market may start posting gains in November,"" said Hiroyuki Nakai, an executive fellow at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.
Nakai expects the Nikkei to trade at 24,500 in end-2018.
Market participants also said a strong Japanese economy and upbeat capital spending could lift investors' risk stance.
Japan's economy grew 1.9 percent on an annualized basis in April-June, helped by strong household and business spending, data showed earlier this month.
Capital expenditure rose 1.3 percent, marking the biggest gain since October-December 2016.
""Japanese companies' managers are eager to invest. Machine tool investment data also shows that domestic demand is intact,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. But he warned that Japanese manufacturers could be hit by falling demand from China.
Fujito said the Nikkei could try 23,500 before year-end but sees the benchmark index falling to 22,000 next year. Negative risks include a slowdown in consumption in the wake of a planned tax hike and emerging market weakness, which could offset the U.S. economic boost.
Japan plans to hike sales taxes to 10 percent from 8 percent in 2019.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2018 12:01AM ET</span>",NAFTA trade deal optimism lifts Toronto stocks outlook: Reuters Poll,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Gains in Canada's stock market will pick up over coming months after a modest advance so far this year, a Reuters poll showed, as a potential reduction in trade uncertainty boosts the outlook for its commodity and export-dependent shares.
The Canadian dollar and shares of Canadian auto-parts manufacturers have climbed this week as investors bet an agreement between the United States and Mexico to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement will lead to a trilateral deal that includes Canada.
""A good part of the Canadian market has been depressed because of worries over NAFTA,"" said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corp, adding that these concerns should disappear in a short while.
The trade dispute between the United States and China, which could slow global growth, has also held back Toronto's commodity-linked market. The S&P/TSX composite index (GSPTSE) has gained a little over 1 percent this year, well short of the 9 percent advance for the S&P 500 (SPX).
A February poll was substantially accurate in predicting these shallow gains and where the index would be at end-June.
Investors said the TSX's 30 percent weighting in energy and materials shares could work to its advantage should global trade tensions cool and the U.S. dollar pull back.
""I think that the rolling over of the U.S. dollar will be good for commodities,"" said Steve Palmer, founding partner and chief investment officer at AlphaNorth Asset Management. ""The TSX is heavily weighed in resource stocks, so I expect the TSX to outperform because of that.""
The U.S. dollar (DXY) has retreated as much as 2.6 percent against a basket of other major currencies since reaching a more than one-year high earlier this month.
Given that oil (CLc1), gold , base metals and many other major commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, a weaker greenback could increase demand for those commodities because they become cheaper to buy for holders of other currencies.
The median forecast of the 20-plus portfolio managers and strategists polled was a 3.4 percent increase in the Toronto market from where it closed on Wednesday, to 16,950 by the end of the year.
But the pace of gains for the index, which reached a record high of 16,586.46 in July, is then expected to slow. It is seen at 17,500 by the end of 2019.
One impediment to gains next year could be a slowdown in the domestic economy, which has been burdened by near record levels of household debt and is contending with interest rate hikes from the Bank of Canada.
Money markets expect the central bank, which has raised interest rates four times since July 2017, to do so again in the coming months. 
""Going into 2019 we believe the economic momentum in Canada will continue to slow,"" said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investments. ""A relief rally following a positive conclusion to the NAFTA negotiations may help to drive the market higher, but this will give way to the reality of slower earnings growth.""

Lawyers for Skilling were not immediately available for comment. 
The U.S. Bureau of Prisons records listed Skilling as being at a residential re-entry facility in Houston.
In May 2006, a jury convicted Skilling of 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in maintaining a facade of success as Enron's energy business crumbled.
In 2013, U.S. District Judge Simeon Lake reduced his 24-year jail term to 14 years, accepting a deal struck between prosecutors and Skilling's lawyers to end years of appeals.
Under the deal, more than $40 million of Skilling's fortune, which had been frozen since his conviction in 2006, was to be distributed to victims of Enron's collapse.
Houston-based Enron's 2001 collapse threw thousands out of work, sparked federal probes and prompted Congress to crack down on corporate accounting abuses.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay also was found guilty of multiple counts of conspiracy and fraud. He died of heart failure six weeks after the trial ended, prompting a federal judge to throw out the conviction.
Skilling had been serving his time in a minimum security ""prison camp"" in Montgomery, Alabama, according to a federal database. He was set for release in 2019.

China’s PMI was also in focus as it unexpectedly rose in August.
Citing six people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Trump wants to move ahead with a plan to impose the tariffs as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week. The report came after the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on $16 billion worth of goods on each other. The two countries also slapped each other with a $34 billion worth of imports in July.
The news was cited as headwind for equities, as China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9% and 1.0% respectively by 10:00PM ET (02:00 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also dropped 1.5%.
Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700)’s shares fell as much as 5% on reports that China’s regulators are planning to restrict the number of new online games and the total number of titles.
Meanwhile, official data showed on Friday that growth in China’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly rose in August as the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 51.3. Analysts previously expected the number to drop to 51.0 from July’s 51.2.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below that signals contraction.
The official PMI focuses on large, state-owned companies while another set of private manufacturing PMI readings, due Monday, focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2% as data revealed the country’s unemployment rate rose to 2.5% in July, compared with the median forecast of 2.4%.

908,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",ICBC Profit Rises Most Since '14 Before `Challenging' Period,"(Bloomberg) -- Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. posted its fastest profit growth since September 2014 as margins and asset quality improved, but flagged challenging times ahead as the trade war with the U.S. intensifies.
Net income at the world’s largest lender by assets rose 5.8 percent to 81.6 billion yuan ($11.9 billion) in the quarter ended June from a year earlier, according to an exchange filing Thursday, broadly in line with estimates. China’s five biggest banks have all reported profit growth of at least 5 percent for the latest quarter, and escaped the surge in bad loans that swamped smaller lenders.
While the big five benefited from President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on riskier shadow financing in the first half, analysts are cutting profit forecasts for the rest of this year as the trade war threatens to slow China’s growth. Lenders’ pricing power and capital strength may also be weakened by a renewed push for credit expansion and loosening of monetary policy, as authorities look to sustain the economy.
The second half of this year and 2019 will be challenging for ICBC amid economic uncertainties, and the bank is stress-testing companies exposed to the trade war, Chairman Yi Huiman said at a briefing in Beijing. Still, ICBC aims to maintain stable margins and asset quality, he said.
Net profit of state-owned banks would grow 5.6 percent in the second quarter, analysts led by Shujin Chen at Hua Tai Securities Ltd. wrote in a note dated Aug. 14.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg now predict combined profits at the big five will increase about 5 percent in 2018, less than the 8 percent forecast in March. ICBC and rivals China Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of Communications Co. together control more than a third of China’s $40 trillion in banking assets and posted 4 percent profit growth in 2017.
Investors are pricing in this risk. ICBC declined 1.6 percent to HK$5.71 as of 9:39 a.m. in Hong Kong Friday, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 1.5 percent. Shares of the big banks are trading at an average 0.7 times their estimated book value for 2018, compared with 1.1 times for  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and 1.7 times for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
“Given valuations have dropped from a higher level, it’s more difficult for banks to tap the market for funding,” said Grace Wu, Hong Kong-based senior director at Fitch Ratings. “One of the key constraints holding back the banks from extending another round of stimulus is always the fact that there isn’t enough capital.”
ICBC plans to raise up to 100 billion yuan by selling preferred shares domestically to replenish capital, the lender said in a separate statement late Thursday, adding it may also sell more such stock overseas. ICBC in 2015 completed its first preferred share issuance, raising a total of 80 billion yuan at home and abroad.
Profit Growth
Moreover, directing banks to extend loans to specific sectors hampers their prudential management, Wu said. China’s regulators have taken several steps to free up credit in the past month, and recently ordered lenders to boost support for infrastructure projects, small businesses, agriculture and exporters.
The order to step up lending comes against a backdrop of rising corporate defaults and a surge in bad debt in the second quarter, though most of the increase came from rural lenders.
ICBC plans to dispose of 220 billion yuan of soured loans this year, Yi said. Demand for loans is strong and the lender has “moderately” raised its growth target for 2018, President Gu Shu said at the briefing.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:57PM ET</span>",U.S.-Mexico trade talks may pivot from metals tariffs to quotas,"By Timothy Aeppel and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials are pressing Mexico and possibly Canada to accept a quota plan to replace national security tariffs currently in place on imports of steel and aluminum, people briefed on the negotiations said on Thursday.
Metals tariffs are not directly part of updating the North American Free Trade Agreement as negotiators race toward a Friday deadline. The United States imposed tariffs on metal imports in March, but at the time exempted Canada and Mexico. It extended the tariffs to both countries in June. 
However, all three countries in the NAFTA pact see resolving the issue as part of a larger move to normalize trade relations in the wake of months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have raised costs and snarled supply chains for North American manufacturers and farmers.
The issue is politically fraught since the Trump administration has made rebuilding U.S. basic metal industries a key promise to voters and views trade barriers as a tool to achieve that.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reiterated that view when he traveled to Kentucky last week for a ceremony marking the restart of an aluminum smelter owned by Chicago-based Century Aluminum Co. Century credited the new tariffs, which put duties of 10 percent on aluminum and 25 percent on steel.
Meeting with workers at the factory, Ross said curbs on imports would remain in place long term.
South Korea in March agreed to revise a trade deal that President Donald Trump had heavily criticized. Under the revised deal, in return for being exempted from tariffs, South Korea agreed to a quota that is equal to 70 percent of the annual average Korean steel exports to the United States between 2015-2017.
“In the end, to make sure this is effective, you either have to have a tariff or a quota,"" said Jesse Gary, general counsel for Century. ""South Korea is an example of how the administration is approaching this. That’s our expectation.”
Brazil and Argentina also have accepted metals quotas to avoid tariffs. 
Any deal on the metals tariffs is not expected until after the three sides settle on terms for an updated NAFTA agreement.
“The U.S. and Mexico are discussing a quota-based structure for the steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. and more time is needed,” Dan Ujczo, a U.S. trade lawyer who focuses on Canadian issues, said in a letter to clients this week seen by Reuters. 
He said a deal on tariffs with Mexico, and potentially lifting of tariffs on Canada, is likely to “be announced during the 90-day consultation between the ‘handshake’ and signature” on a NAFTA revision.
A quota system would keep U.S. metal prices high by limiting supply and lead to potential shortages. Any push for quotas faces strong opposition in all three countries. 
Domestic metal producers like Century,  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE)., United States Steel Corp, and ArcelorMittalcould benefit. But Stelco Holdings Inc., based in Canada, would likely suffer.
CANACERO, Mexico’s steel industry association, said on Wednesday that Mexico should seek exclusion from U.S. tariffs on steel imports before completing negotiations on a new NAFTA agreement.
Joseph Galimberti, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, took a similar stance: “Canadian steel producers are hopeful that a 232 exclusion for NAFTA countries will be possible as part of a final trilateral agreement.” Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to impose tariffs on imports deemed a threat to national security.
U.S. importers and manufacturers also want the tariffs to go away but oppose replacing them with quotas.

“We believe that quotas on aluminum and steel will undermine the competitiveness of equipment manufacturers in the United States and jeopardize the benefits of free and fair trade,” said Kip Eideberg, vice president of public affairs and advocacy at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.

910,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Hyundai's Hopes for U.S. Sales Rebound Ride on the Revamped Santa Fe,"(Bloomberg) -- Frank Maione breathed a sigh of relief this month when Hyundai Motor Co. started delivering the redesigned Santa Fe crossover utility vehicle to his Nevada showroom.
A streak of annual Hyundai U.S. sales gains that began in the depths of the 2009 recession came to an abrupt end last year. Deliveries slumped to the lowest in six years, as American consumers raced into sport utility vehicles and snubbed sedans, hurting the South Korean company more than any other major automaker. Sales have kept slipping this year, in no small part due to the dearth of competitive crossover models to choose from.
“The car business is a roller coaster,” said Maione, owner of the Henderson Hyundai Superstore in suburban Las Vegas. “We were riding high for a long time. We’re at the bottom now and on our way back.”
Santa Fe is the third fresh SUV Hyundai is rolling out to the U.S. market this year, following the all-new compact Kona and the redesigned Tucson. The company will round out those offerings with a battery-powered version of the Kona that boasts more range than the base Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 or Chevrolet Bolt.
By the end of this year, about 44 percent Hyundai’s U.S. sales should come from crossovers and SUVs, up from 36 percent in December, said Brian Smith, chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor America. The company still lags behind the U.S. industry, with SUVs and light trucks now making up more than two-thirds of total sales. The automaker plans to keep the fresh product for these segments coming, with a subcompact and an eight-passenger behemoth slated to arrive next year. Its two-year-old Genesis luxury unit also will get its first crossover in 2019.
Late-arriving crossovers have cost Hyundai. Its U.S. sales unit lost 868 billion won ($783 million) last year, compared with a 470 billion won profit in 2012. First-half losses this year widened 60 percent to 391 billion won.
Hyundai shares are down 21 percent this year, adding pressure to an under-the-gun management team that’s promised to announce a revised restructuring plan to boost transparency and shareholder value. An earlier plan was scrapped after backlash from shareholders including billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp., which has a $1 billion stake in various Hyundai Motor Group companies.
Hyundai’s U.S. executives and dealers are seeking more influence as the company tries to right the ship. “The big difference is that in Korea, they distribute cars directly from the manufacturer. They don’t have independent dealers like they do in the U.S.,” Maione said. “They’re struggling to iron out these different viewpoints.’’
Smith, who left Toyota Motor Corp. to join Hyundai 10 months ago, doesn’t dispute this.
Hyundai recently finished staffing up a North American headquarters that will coordinate sales, production, pricing and marketing decisions with less oversight from Korea. “We’ll be making decisions appropriate for North America with speed and with knowledge of the local market that never existed before,” Smith said.
Hyundai’s salad days were back in 2011, when an eye-catching redesign of its Sonata sedan helped push its share of non-luxury sales to an all-time high of 13.8 percent, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at AutoTrader.
But the success was fleeting. Toyota was embroiled in its sudden-acceleration recall crisis at the time, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV were only a couple years removed from bankruptcy. “Hyundai was smart but also very lucky,” Krebs said.
Hyundai built just short of 285,000 sedans in North America last year, down 29 percent from 2013, according to Alan Baum, an industry analyst. The production cutbacks have brought inventory down to be more in line with market demand, so the company has spent an average of about $2,800 per vehicle on incentives so far this year, down from roughly $3,850 in 2017, Krebs said. Fleet sales also have dropped.
Hyundai’s U.S. sales should rise in 2018, despite less discounting, Smith said. The company could even end up outpacing competitors. Industrywide deliveries, to be reported Tuesday, probably ran at an annualized pace, adjusted for seasonal trends, of 16.8 million in August, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 10 analysts. That’s up slightly from a year earlier, when Hurricane Harvey halted sales in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city.
At about the same size as a Subaru Outback, the five-passenger Santa Fe is aimed at small families, and drivers who don’t enjoy maneuvering bigger vehicles through crowded city streets. It’s also packed with safety features including electronic sensors that warn drivers if they’ve left a child or a pet inside a hot car and blind-spot detection that prevents rear doors from opening if a vehicle is passing alongside.
“Our dealers are used to selling on price and value,’’ said Mike O’Brien, head of product planning. “But we made a big decision to standardize these safety features, since no mom or dad wants to choose products that are less safe. It’s changing the way we sell cars.”
Of course, innovation is expensive. And O’Brien acknowledged that as crossovers flood the U.S. market, dealers’ profit margins are already starting to shrink.
“I expect Hyundai to do better with all these new crossovers,” Krebs said. “But there’s no reigniting the roaring success they had back in 2011.”

911,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Britain's FTSE to lag peers as investors fret about no-deal Brexit: Reuters poll,"By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 will take until the end of next year to return close to record levels, according to a Reuters poll, held back in the near-term as investors grapple with the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union with no deal.
The median forecast of 30 analysts, brokers and fund managers polled by Reuters Aug. 17-30 projects the FTSE 100 reaching 7,900 by the end of 2019, just shy of its record high of 7,903.50 hit in May 2018.
In a poll taken three months ago, the panel expected the FTSE 100 to hit 7,900 six months earlier, by the middle of next year.
The latest Reuters survey results suggest the FTSE will end this year up just 1 percent and then gain 1.7 percent in 2019, well below the expected overall rate of inflation. Those gains in percentage terms are also just half of those forecast for the pan-European STOXX 600. [EPOLL/FRDE]
Worries that Britain could fail to reach a deal with Brussels before it leaves the European Union in March 2019 have been a particular pain point for UK equities and sterling this year.
""In the UK the key is clarity on the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations with the EU,"" Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said.
""If there is no clarity by March next year the market will become increasingly volatile if the prospect of No Deal gets closer,"" he added.
In the meantime, that lack of clarity has forced businesses to delay investment decisions while investors have shied away from UK equities.
So far this year UK equities have lost 1.6 percent. That followed two years of gains, fueled by a weak currency since the June 23, 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU. The FTSE 100's large, dollar-earning constituents have benefited from a revenue boost from a weaker pound. 
But allocations to UK equities by fund managers this month had their biggest one-month drop since May 2016, also due to rising worries over a 'no-deal Brexit' scenario, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's August fund manager survey. 
More than a quarter of fund managers are underweight UK equities.
Coupled with the fact the UK market remains cheap compared with euro zone stocks on a forward price-to-earnings basis, some investors see this as an opportunity.
""Brexit poses a lot of challenges to UK companies, but it's certainly not the nail in the coffin,"" said Adam Laird, head of ETF strategy for Northern Europe at Lyxor ETF.
""Remember the UK market has a lot of international exposure, a lot of mining and energy. Investors would be foolish to write it off completely,"" Laird added.

912,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says Iranian Regime May Collapse Because of His Policies,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said the Iranian regime may collapse because of his administration’s policies, including leaving the international nuclear agreement with Tehran negotiated by his predecessor.
“When I came into here, it was a question of when would they take over the Middle East,” Trump said Thursday in an Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “Now it’s a question of will they survive. It’s a big difference in one and a half years.”
The president didn’t elaborate on the comment.
Trump -- encouraged by Iran’s regional foes -- pulled the U.S. from the 2015 international nuclear accord in May, accusing the Islamic Republic of threatening Middle East security as it expands its regional influence. He reimposed sanctions on Iran this month, with Iran’s vital oil industry due to face penalties beginning in November.
Inflation in Iran has surged and its currency weakened, placing added pressure on President Hassan Rouhani as he tries to navigate through the crisis.
Trump has said he’d be willing to meet Iran’s leaders to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal that would avoid sanctions pain. But that offer has been ruled out in Tehran by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. That leaves little room to avoid harsher penalties coming online in early November, as the U.S. seeks to cut Iranian oil sales abroad to as close to zero as possible.

913,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 08:59PM ET</span>",Thrill-seeking runners take sport - and spending - to rural China,"By Christian Shepherd and Stella Qiu
LONGYANGXIA, China (Reuters) - At dawn, high on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, a Buddhist monk in saffron robes chants blessings over limber athletes preparing to run 100 kilometers across sand dunes, rivers and ravines. 
The crowd of sporty, middle-class urbanites had spent thousands of yuan to travel to Longyangxia Reservoir in northwestern Qinghai province for an ""ultramarathon"" - a drastic change from a decade ago, when few Chinese raced even in cities and gear might include jeans and flip-flops. 
Governments and companies in such far-flung mountainous regions have high hopes that this relatively small but fast-growing crowd of trail runners can bring big bucks that will boost business prospects. 
""When I arrived, I thought Longyangxia was quite remote; the scenery was beautiful but it was isolated and economically lagging,"" said Ying Miyan, chairman of China's largest salmon fishery, Qinghai Minze Longyangxia Ecological Aquaculture Co., which is sponsoring the Super Salmon 100km Ultra-Marathon Challenge there.
Longyangxia, a sleepy waterfront town of about 3,000 people, has in the last decade poured more than 1.6 billion yuan ($233 million), much of it from private investment, into bike tracks, scenic areas and refurbished hotels in an attempt to lure sporty travelers.
Ultramarathons, which are many times longer than the traditional 42.2-kilometre marathon, are usually ""trail"" runs, sending racers across countryside terrain. 
Officials in Longyangxia declined to be interviewed. But the Super-Salmon trail race, in its first official year, brought in just over 500 runners, filling the town's lone hotel for 300 yuan per night, with some guests staying for a few days after the event. 
Ying's company provided salmon for the athletes to eat, prize money of up to 15,000 yuan, and presented the male 100km winner with his body weight in salmon as an additional reward.
State media articles have called efforts to use sporting events to attract tourists a success, saying they have brought 10,000 visitors to the lake so far this year, already double the total for 2017.
The National Sports Bureau recognized Longyangxia as a ""sports and leisure specialty town"" in 2017, Qinghai's only town on the bureau's list of 100.
Beijing has called for 1,000 such towns to be created by 2020 in a nationwide drive to develop sustainable industries in the hinterlands, but doubts remain over whether all the projects will pay off.
The benefits to Longyangxia, for instance, are still mostly aspirational; in early August, the town center was a ring of empty buildings and an unoccupied karaoke hall, while the market street was a pile of rubble.
Yu Yanmeng, a race organizer from Beijing-based adventure sport company Xinzhi Exploring Group, said its events rarely make money. But the company hopes that will change as numbers grow.
""These races and sports activities, once they get going, can expand the influence of local tourism and scenery to create a calling card for the city, make them better known and pull up economic growth,"" he said.
BETTING ON CHINA
The growing number of trail races - there were about 250 in the first half of this year, compared with less than 30 in all of 2015 - has also piqued the interest of specialist sports apparel brands that want to tap into the Chinese market.
China net sales at Amer Sports Oyj (HE:AMEAS), which owns the world's biggest trail-running brand, Salomon, rose 23 percent in the first half this year, compared with a gain of 13 percent in 2017.
""Our goal today at Salomon is to catch and to convert all the people that are running today in China (to trail running),"" said Anthony Marguet, China commercial manager at Salomon, adding that he expects the number of trail runners in China, currently about 150,000, to double or triple in the next five years. 
Its premium S/lab trail running shoes, which cost 1,898 yuan, account for 17 percent of its footwear sales in China, but only 3 percent of its global sales, Marguet told Reuters. 
The company sponsors 20 elite athletes in China and more than 30 trail runs every year.
""Passion for fun, cool and distinctive sports is getting higher and higher, and it's driving the (Chinese) market faster we could ever have imagined,"" Stefan Schwartz, Amer's general manager for APAC, said in April.
China's General Administration of Sports forecasts 10 million runners will take part in domestic races annually by 2020, when the size of the industry will exceed 120 billion yuan.
Abroad, Chinese racers will be the fifth-largest nationality at this year's Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, the Tour de France of trail running, which has set up a special welcome party and commentary for them. 
Zhao Fan, Chinese distributor of U.S. trail running shoe-maker Altra Running, expects sales at his store next to Beijing's Olympic Forest Park to double this year. 
As trail running prospers in China, international brands may face competition from local startups, Zhao said. But he added that it would be healthy for the industry. 
LIVING TO RUN
Many trail runners build their lives, and spending habits, around the sport.
He Runyu, an energetic business management professor at Beijing's Science and Technology University, became serious about long-distance running around the same time he gave up meat and drinking. 
He now averages about 10 races a year, just for fun. 
""I need to look forward to it to enjoy it,"" he said. ""You need a place with good scenery that challenges you; every time something new.""
He estimates he spends tens of thousands of yuan every year on running. At the Longyangxia race, he had to drop out with an ankle injury, but put more than 3,000 yuan into the trip.
""Everyone always thinks that running is really cheap. Before I started I thought the same, but I realized running is very expensive,"" he said, adding that the main cost was the travel itself.
When Dou Jianyun, 45, wanted more time for trail running, she took a job in sales at a Beijing-based sportswear startup called Engine Bird.
Dou was one of only three female runners to make it to the finish line for the 100km Longyangxia race. She brought three GPS systems with her to Qinghai and bought new walking poles to guard against injury on the rocky trails. 
""I could still live if I couldn't run, but I would not be happy,"" Dou said.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 08:23PM ET</span>",Limited engagement: Top funds backed gunmaker Ruger board despite no talks,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Funds run by BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard Group backed all directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co Inc (N:RGR) despite the company's rare rejection of talks with the world's top asset managers, disclosures to regulators on Thursday showed.
The votes by the gunmaker's largest investors stood in contrast to support BlackRock and Vanguard gave to a measure calling on Sturm Ruger to report on the safety of its products, which passed over the board's objections at the company's annual meeting on May 9.
Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard would discuss in detail their votes at the meeting. It drew attention amid a nationwide youth-led gun control movement following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February that killed 17 people, one in a decades-long series of shootings at U.S. schools, colleges and workplaces.
Sturm Ruger declined to comment on the filings by the funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. BlackRock holds about 18 percent of shares outstanding, followed by Vanguard, with about 10 percent.
Both fund firms rarely vote against directors, and say critical votes may come only after companies fail to respond to shareholder concerns.
Since July, BlackRock and Vanguard said in separate ""investment stewardship"" reports that they had held talks with other U.S. public companies that make or sell civilian firearms.
Investors and activists with a range of views about gun control said the asset managers' split tickets seemed to reflect an approach designed to appeal to young investors concerned with social issues, without alienating clients who own guns or pushing Sturm Ruger's board too quickly.
The big fund firms ""have to look at sensitivities"" of their clients and business partners, said Brian Rafn, principal of Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee, who described himself as a gun-rights supporter and says the firm voted all its 80,000 or so shares with Sturm Ruger's management.
Eli Kasargod-Staub, co-founder of Majority Action, a group that had campaigned for top funds to vote against Sturm Ruger director Sandra Froman, a past president of the National Rifle Association, called the votes ""a failure of leadership"" by the fund managers.
""The only plausible explanation to me is that they were simply trying to avoid controversy,"" he said.
BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said via email it takes a case-by-case approach to its engagement and voting ""because doing so encourages change over time and promotes responsible business practices that align with the financial interests of our clients.""
In a statement emailed by spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann, Vanguard said that while a company's willingness to engage can affect its voting decisions, corporate moves to improve shareholder value ""may unfold over the course of a few years, rather than a few months.""
Sturm Ruger is unusual in that its executives and directors will not talk with investors directly, at a time both big passive managers have stressed more engagement with companies in their portfolios. Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy at the May meeting said it does not meet with top holders including BlackRock and Vanguard because of fair-disclosure rules, a rare stance.
BlackRock voted against Exxon (NYSE:XOM) directors over similar discussion limits in the past, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this year told CEOs that ""engagement needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value.""
BlackRock and Vanguard said they would contact gunmakers after the Florida shooting. 
Sturm Ruger said previously its directors each won more than 10 million votes at the May 9 meeting. The most votes withheld from any director was 425,763.
Thursday's filings showed funds including BlackRock's iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (P:IJR) and Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund (P:VB) voted for all nine directors, and for the safety report. 
In a July 20 ""investment stewardship"" report BlackRock said it had talks with ""nearly all"" 13 U.S. public gun manufacturers or sellers. The company also said that at one unidentified gunmaker that did not allow shareholder talks, it voted for a safety report.
Vanguard's similar report in mid-August said that during the 12 months ended June 30, it spoke with three gunmakers and supported a shareholder resolution calling for more risk disclosure at a company it did not identify.

Vanguard wrote that in its outreach, ""our objective is not to change what business a company is in or what product it produces, but rather to ensure that the risks of these choices are understood by the market and reflected in the company's long-term value to investors.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares will stage a recovery in what remains of 2018 but fail to push past their January highs, ending the year with a meager gain and with too little momentum to achieve a better performance in 2019, a Reuters poll showed.
European and euro zone indices have largely still not recovered from a correction across global markets in early February when volatility Skyrocketed.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index is expected to reach 400 points by year-end, according to the poll of 30 brokers, fund managers and analysts, up 3.5 percent from Wednesday's close and 2.8 percent higher on the year. 
An index of 50 leading euro zone companies (STOXX50E) is expected to reach 3,575 points by year-end, up 3.4 percent from Wednesday's close and 2.0 percent on the year.
The poll was taken in Aug. 20-28 as U.S. stocks marked the longest-ever bull run, the second-quarter earnings season ended and the tone of trade disputes softened with the U.S. and Mexico reaching an agreement. 
But the forecast was weaker than in a May poll, which saw the STOXX 600 reach 406 points, a reflection of a turbulent summer during which a crisis in Turkey's lira spread across global markets. 
The poll predicted the STOXX 600 won't exceed its late January peak of 403.7 points until 2019, ending that year at 410. 
Despite sharp day-to-day moves in stocks and across indices, the market has not managed to climb convincingly and consistently, and this is likely to continue, investors said.
""We see the volatile, lowish-return, equity market conditions of the year so far as being a good guide to what lies ahead,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset allocation team at Janus Henderson Investors.
Multiplying global trade disputes are weighing on European markets, home to many of the world's top exporting companies heavily reliant on smooth international trade. 
Since the previous poll the U.S. and China have implemented tariffs on $50 billion worth of each others' goods and threatened further levies.
""Many investors were thinking about the Trump administration's economic agenda in quite simplistic terms at the start of the year, loving the tax cuts and ignoring the problems,"" said James Downey, chief investment officer and chief economist at Neptune Investment Management.
""That's changed now the trade war has kicked off and given the markets a bit of a reality check.""
EARNINGS SUPPORT RECOVERY
A still-strong outlook for corporate earnings is likely to help boost the region's stocks into year-end, and euro zone exporters will benefit from the euro's  slide this year.
""Whist economic momentum has been gradually moderating this year, notably in Europe, the corporate outlook remains positive which should support stocks despite political risk stemming from risks of a trade war,"" said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald in London. 
The investment team at Optimums Capital said earnings have not yet peaked in Europe, pointing out the Euro STOXX (STOXXE) is still a way from surpassing its pre-crisis earnings-per-share expectations peak.

""Considering the current phase of the EU's economic cycle, healthy demand, a weakening euro and the fact the ECB will not raise rates until, at least, the second half of next year, there is still room for growth,"" said Diminutions Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at Alpha Trust in Athens.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) shares briefly dipping below the $300 level on Thursday, the electric carmaker ceded its seat as the most shorted U.S. stock to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners.
Tesla short interest in dollars, calculated using the number of shares sold short and the share price, stood at $9.93 billion, on Thursday, just shy of $9.95 billion for Amazon, S3 Partners data showed. 
Analysts said investors were still shorting Tesla shares, or taking positions that amounted to bets the stock would keep declining. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price. 
""While there was some short covering the week after the tweet, there has still not been any significant net Tesla short covering on the Street,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.
""Any traders who have closed down their positions to realize some profits have been replaced by new ones looking for continued price weakness,"" he said.
Tesla shares whipsawed this month after Chief Executive Elon Musk on Aug. 7 tweeted he planned to take the company private, only to abandon the idea by Aug. 24.
Tesla closed down 0.6 percent at $303.15, on Thursday. The stock drifted as low as $288.20 in intra-day trade as recently as Aug. 20, but it has not closed below $300 since July 31. Tesla rose as high as $387.46 following Musk's initial tweet about the going-private plan. 
Since the Aug. 7 tweet, the dollar amount of Tesla shares sold short has dropped by 16 percent, while that for Amazon has climbed by 32 percent, S3 Partners data showed. 
Amazon shares rose above $2,000 for the first time on Thursday and the company is just shy of a $1 trillion market capitalization.
S3's Dusaniwsky, however, said that with Tesla shares near the $300 level, the company could reclaim top spot for the most shorted U.S. stock, where it had stood since early May.
""A $300 Tesla price may be a signal of increased short selling since when Tesla's stock price dipped below $300 per share in March, shares shorted climbed from 30.0 million to 41.6 million in just over two months,"" said Dusaniwsky.

Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Netflix (O:NFLX), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), are some other top shorted U.S. stocks, as some investors have bet the high-flying technology names are due for a pullback.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 07:24PM ET</span>","Despite debt woes, Africa still sees China as best bet for financing","By Joe Bavier and Christian Shepherd
JOHANNESBURG/BEIJING (Reuters) - A wave of African nations looking to restructure debt with China on the eve of a major Beijing summit provides a reality check for the continent, where most countries still view Chinese lending as the best bet to develop their economies.
China has denied engaging in ""debt trap"" diplomacy, but President Xi Jinping is likely to use next week's gathering of African leaders to offer a new round of financing, following a pledge of $60 billion at the last summit three years ago.
Ethiopia and Zambia, heavy borrowers from China, have expressed desire to restructure that debt, while bankers believe Angola and Congo Republic have already done so, though details of such deals are sparse.
The International Monetary Fund says Cameroon, Ghana and others face a high risk of debt distress, as does Djibouti, whose main source of foreign loans is China, the Fund says, and which holds the majority of external debt.
But many countries, even those heavily indebted to China, still say Beijing offers far better terms than Western banks, and that European nations and the United States fail to match its generosity.
""Especially when you go to multilaterals, it takes such a long time,"" Aboubakar Omar Hadi, chairman of the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority, told Reuters.
To develop its Doral Container Terminal, Djibouti borrowed $268 million from seven banks at 9 percent over nine years, he said.
By comparison, its first Chinese loan was $620 million over 20 years at 2.85 percent, and it came with a seven-year grace period.
""Where is America?"" he asked. ""Where is the investment from Europe? We are ready. Why are they leaving the whole continent for China? They have themselves to blame if here they are out of the game.""
MORE LOANS BUT NOT ""FREE MONEY""
Chinese officials have vowed to be more cautious to ensure projects are sustainable.
China's push to cut debt at home, and the cooling of its economy, will affect ""non-urgent projects"", said Yang Baorong, an expert on African debt at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
""The overall trend will not change, but the scale will certainly be different under the current circumstances.""
Chinese-backed infrastructure has not always translated into the kind of economic growth that makes rising debt sustainable and resource-based economies are reeling from a slump in global commodities, said Martyn Davies, managing director of emerging markets and Africa at Deloitte.
""The African states have this naïveté at times that this is somehow free money,"" Davies said.
From 2000 to 2016, China loaned around $125 billion to the continent, data from the China-Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at Washington's Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies shows. 
It is the most significant contributor to high debt risks in three African countries, Congo Republic, Djibouti, and Zambia, CARI said this week. 
In most other nations, traditional donors, multilateral agencies and private creditors held significantly higher portions of debt, it added. The last decade has seen a boom in African Eurobond issuance.
Chinese officials say this year's summit will strengthen Africa's role in Xi's ""Belt and Road"" initiative to link China by sea and land through an infrastructure network with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. 
Beijing has pledged $126 billion for the plan.
""DEBT SUSTAINABILITY"" DISAGREEMENT
China defends continued lending to Africa on the grounds that the continent still needs debt-fueled infrastructure development.
Much of the concern over Chinese debt stems from the different measures of ""debt sustainability"" used by Beijing and African nations versus Western governments and institutions such as the IMF, said Cheng Cheng, a researcher at the Chongyang Institute of Financial Studies at Beijing's Renmin University.
""If you are trying to increase your GDP, a 25 percent debt-to-GDP ratio is not enough for any country,"" he said.
But the debt problem is driving a push to transform financing to more investment over loans, he said.
""New instruments are being used to leverage finance from elsewhere, because the Chinese government has long realized that there is generally the debt problem everywhere.""
China's attraction stems from its ability to offer financing from state-owned enterprises or funds such as the China-Africa Development Fund or its Silk Road fund, besides special purpose vehicles that avoid sovereign debt on balance sheets.
Lubinda Habazoka, president of the Economics Association of Zambia, said that after becoming eligible for heavily-indebted poor country debt forgiveness under the IMF, multilateral agencies advised it to go to the capital markets in future.
""Today, we have found we are spending so much for this debt on capital markets,"" he said. ""The result is it has become very difficult for countries like Zambia to meet payments for interest.""
China's lower and longer-term rates make it more attractive for debt refinancing, but the debt pressure has spurred Zambia to seek renegotiation with Beijing, he said. 

""We thought no, no, China was going to be soft on us. But unfortunately, that's not the case.""

Before working at Saban, Hsu worked as chief operating officer at Sanrio Inc, which owns the hugely popular Hello Kitty franchise. At Saban, Hsu oversaw the development and growth of various brands, including the Power Rangers franchise.
In her new role at Mattel, Hsu will report to Richard Dickson, Mattel's president and chief operating officer.
Mattel has suffered sluggish sales following the bankruptcy of its top customer Toys 'R' Us and has seen top level management changes, including the departure of its chief executive in April.
The new division, titled Global Franchise Management Organization, will look at new commercial ties for the toymaker's brands, as well as focus on digital gaming, live events and strategic partnerships, Mattel said.

Hsu's move comes after toy maker  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) said in May it will buy the entertainment and merchandising franchises for superhero TV show Power Rangers from Saban.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) has publicly criticized founder John Schnatter for attending a meeting in July about a potential deal with a competitor without its CEO, the latest salvo in a feud for control of the company.
Schnatter violated instructions from Papa John's board when he met with hamburger restaurant chain Wendys Co (O:WEN), people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The board had told Schnatter only to meet with the restaurant if Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie was present, said a letter posted by the company on Wednesday from a committee formed to audit Papa John's culture.
Schnatter declined to comment. Wendy's said it does not comment on what it described as rumors or speculation. Papa John's declined further comment.
The committee also said Schnatter ignored the board's directions when he criticized the National Football League over national anthem protests by players last year.
Papa John's has been trying to distance itself from Schnatter, who stepped down as company chairman in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training call. 
""John Schnatter is harming the Company, not helping it, as evidenced by the negative impact his comments and actions have had on our business and that of our franchisees,"" the committee's letter said.
Schnatter remains a member of the board and holds 30 percent of the company's shares. 
The only way Papa John's could remove Schnatter from the board is to hold a special shareholder vote, or propose a slate without him at its annual meeting next year.
Minor Myers, a corporate governance professor at Brooklyn Law School, said that may do little to further separate Papa John's from Schnatter because of his ownership stake.
""He has 30 percent of the stock, shareholders voting include him,"" Myers said.
Schnatter, who is suing the company for documents related to his departure, has said Ritchie should not be CEO and is responsible for its flagging financial performance. He also accused Ritchie's team of sexual misconduct, an allegation the company has denied.
On Thursday, a Papa John’s shareholder filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status, accusing the company and Schnatter of securities fraud for concealing his alleged inappropriate workplace conduct, and how its code of ethics was inadequate to prevent it.
Papa John's and Schnatter declined to comment on the lawsuit.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended their four-day winning streak on Thursday as risk reduction ahead of the long holiday weekend accelerated on growing trade anxieties.
The broad-based sell-off steepened in mid-afternoon following a Bloomberg report that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to impose proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports as early as next week, sooner than many expected. 
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge of investor expectations for near-term volatility, rose to a near two-week high in a low-volume, pre-holiday session, closing at 13.53.
""When you have low volume, it's harder for the market to absorb strong buying or selling pressure,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""We still have (trade) headlines coming out on a daily basis.""
The Bloomberg report coincided with continuing efforts by Canada and the United States to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ahead of a Friday deadline.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares closed at a record high, rising 0.9 percent following news that it would unveil its latest iPhones on Sept. 12.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) stock rose 0.2 percent, closing above $2,000 for the first time and edging the company closer to becoming the second U.S. company after Apple to reach $1 trillion in market value.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 137.65 points, or 0.53 percent, to 25,986.92, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 12.91 points, or 0.44 percent, to 2,901.13 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 21.32 points, or 0.26 percent, to 8,088.36.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, only utilities (SPLRCU) advanced.
 Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) shares dipped 2.1 percent after it announced plans to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units and left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale.
Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) plunged 17.2 percent after the apparel retailer missed quarterly same-store sales estimates.
Discount retailers  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) and  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) were down 15.5 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, after both gave disappointing profit outlooks on margin worries.
In economic news, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, posted a 2 percent year-on-year increase, hitting the central bank's target and boosting the likelihood of additional rate hikes this year.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.36-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 39 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that it was giving  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and four other financial institutions an additional year to submit ""living wills"" detailing how they could be safely dissolved in a crisis.
The Fed, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said Deutsche,  Barclays  PLC (L:BARC),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN) and UBS AG (S:UBSG) would now be required to submit those resolution plans by July 1, 2020. The banks previously were expected to submit plans by July 1, 2019.
Additionally, the regulators said Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) would face a new submission deadline of Dec. 31, 2019. Prudential's latest plan submission had been due at the end of 2018. 
The regulators said the extension would allow them to provide additional feedback to banks and give them more time to prepare the new plans.
The resolution plans, commonly known as living wills, require large banks to detail how they could be unwound in cases of bankruptcy without disrupting the broader financial system. If regulators do not find a plan credible, they could impose restrictions on a bank's activities or even order it to divest.
Typically, banks with over $50 billion in assets have been required to submit plans annually, although regulators have frequently granted extensions in the past. Banks have pushed to move away from the annual schedule, saying the lengthy submissions are onerous.
The Treasury Department recommended regulators extend the evaluation cycle to two years in a June report, while encouraging regulators to limit the submissions to larger banks and providing more transparent feedback.

The delay comes after Deutsche Bank's U.S. subsidiary failed a Fed ""stress test"" in June.

923,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Snaps Win Streak as Trump Reportedly Readies China Tariffs,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed lower as traders fled stocks following a report Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to move ahead with tariffs on China as soon as next week, risking a further escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.53%. The S&P 500 fell 0.44%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.26%. The S&P 500 snapped a five-session winning streak.
President Donald Trump plans to move ahead with tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period concludes next week, Bloomberg reported, citing six people familiar with the matter.
Some sources said, however, Trump had not made his final decision, according to the report.
Still, the news renewed fears of a full-blown U.S.-China trade war, sending stocks spiraling lower, as Beijing has previously vowed to retaliate with countermeasures.
China threatened in July to impose duties on U.S. products worth more than $60 billion if the Trump administration followed through on threats to impose harsher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.
Industrial heavyweights such as 3M (NYSE:MMM), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), all of which have huge exposure to China, fell on the news, pushing the broader averages deeper into the red.
As the U.S.-China trade war looks set to ratchet up a few notches, the U.S.-Canada trade negotiations appear less combative ahead of Friday's deadline.
Canada risks facing tariffs on its auto exports into the U.S. should it fail to join a trade deal struck earlier this week between the U.S. and Mexico, Trump warned earlier this week.
Canada is eager for any agreement on a trade deal with the U.S. to preserve the existing dispute-resolution systems included in North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The provision aims to independently resolve disputes between NAFTA members.
Corporate earnings, meanwhile, which have helped offset investor concerns over trade were mixed.
 Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) stock closed 2% lower, as sales fell short of estimates and the company announced it would sell just two international units and its fresh foods business, despite calls by activists for a complete sale of the company.
Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) stock slumped 17% after second-quarter revenue and same-store sales missed estimates. While Guess (NYSE:GES) stock rallied 5.7% after the company topped earnings expectations and guided sales higher.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, reversed gains despite oil prices settling sharply higher on signs of tightening global supplies.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery gained 1.1% to settle at $70.25 a barrel.
On the economic front, data continued to underline the strength of the U.S. economy as inflation met the Fed's target, while consumer spending remains solid.
In other corporate news, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) stock sank as it cut its bookings forecast for the fiscal year ending in March after announcing a delay to the release of its next Battlefield video game.

924,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 04:35PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Trade Again Calls the Tune
While many traders will be away from the market tomorrow, getting a head start on the Labor Day three-day weekend, that doesn’t necessarily mean the market will be quiet.
Low-volume days can mean some pretty wild swings in stocks, especially at the end of the month.
The big wild card is trade negotiations.
Stocks took a sharp hit in afternoon trading today after a report President Donald Trump has told aides he wants to go ahead and implement tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods next week.
The S&P Materials Sector index, which is sensitive to trade issues, ended down about 1.25% on the day.
At the start of the week, there was lots of optimism in the market about a foreseeable end to North American trade battles when the U.S. struck a bilateral deal with Mexico.
But negotiations with Canada for a trilateral deal that will revise NAFTA are still ongoing.
Trump’s morning tweets will be closely watched tomorrow for anything hinting at a trade deal. If there are no signs, there could be some tense trading on the last day of summer.
2. Amazon Watch Continues
Technology stocks will likely be a factor on how the week ends. They’ve been reasonably strong in recent trading.
Bullish calls by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) helped the Nasdaq Composite close above 8,000 for the first time this week.
In other milestones, Amazon has a chance to become the second U.S. company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization.
Amazon finished up about 0.2% today at $2002.38. It needs to hit $2,053 tomorrow to make the magic number.
3. More Consumer Data on Tap
Following spending numbers that rose as expected today, there will be more figures on the health of the consumer tomorrow.
The University of Michigan will release its final August consumer confidence figures at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the consumer sentiment index came in at 95.5, slightly up from the preliminary figure.
The expectations index is also expected to tick higher from the initial measure to 87.5."

The peso tumbled to a record low, prompting Argentine policy makers to boost rates to 60 percent. In Turkey, a report that the central bank’s deputy governor was set to resign sank the lira. South Africa’s rand volatility soared amid a controversial land reform debate. An expanded foreign-exchange intervention in Brazil brought some relief to both the real and its peers. A little later currencies extended losses as President Donald Trump was said to move ahead with a plan to impose new tariffs on China as soon as next week.
Emerging markets got pummeled again amid concern that Argentina and Turkey’s struggles to restore investor confidence will pressure their economies further -- while embroiling the rest of the developing world. That comes at a really bad time when considering the other challenges that investors face -- the end of an era of cheap money, prospects of a global trade war, American sanctions and deep political uncertainties in places such as Brazil.
“These currencies are infecting emerging markets,” said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging-market debt at AllianceBernstein in New York, referring to the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso. “There will be volatility around headlines and today is one of the negative days.”

933,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Merrill Lynch does about face on fiduciary-era policy,"By Imani Moise
(Reuters) - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp's wealth management arm Merrill Lynch said on Thursday it is reintroducing commissions for its retirement accounts, reversing a policy put in place to comply with Obama-era regulation.
Merrill Lynch, along with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), effectively banned brokerage retirement accounts last June and began moving clients into advisory accounts to prepare for the U.S. Department of Labor’s so-called fiduciary rule meant to curb conflicts of interests for financial advisers.
The fiduciary rule was overturned in March by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. At that time, Merrill executives said the firm would keep the policy in place to serve the best interests of its clients.
The company is now reversing that policy and expects to add a brokerage option back to individual retirement accounts by Oct. 1.
“In response to client feedback, we’re announcing steps today that will provide our clients with greater choice and flexibility, while maintaining our support for a best-interest standard for investment advice across all accounts,” Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, said in a statement.
Advisers may have also felt limited by the policy, according to Frank LaRosa, chief executive of recruiting firm Elite Consulting Partners. 
“The rule that they were implementing had to do with a law that wasn’t even on the book,"" he said. 
When the policy was implemented Merrill Lynch, which manages $2.3 trillion of client assets, had roughly $150 billion of individual retirement accounts in brokerage format. 
Wealth management firms tend to prefer fee-based accounts over commissions because the revenue is more predictable and easier to budget for, LaRosa said. Fees are usually set based on asset levels while commissions swing based on trading volume and market conditions. 

Shortly after the Department of Labor’s rule was overturned, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision proposed a replacement rule that would require brokers to act in the best interest of clients when making investment recommendations for all types of accounts.

LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (L:WPP) will name its unassuming former digital boss Mark Read as its new chief executive, tasked with turning around the world's largest advertising group in the wake of Martin Sorrell's departure, a city source told Reuters. 
Read was seen as the leading internal candidate to become CEO after he spent almost nine years on the board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job in 1989. 
The city source, who declined to be named because the decision is not yet public, said Read would be given the job as long as the two sides have agreed terms. 
Due to publish results next Tuesday, WPP declined to comment. 
Read stepped up to become WPP joint chief operating officer in April after Sorrell, its founder and the world's most famous advertising man, quit after 33 years in charge following a complaint of personal misconduct which he denied. 
He takes over the 16 billion pound company at a difficult time, as the industry goes through a period of unprecedented change as clients seek to save costs by doing some digital marketing themselves and others turn to consultants for advice. 
Others are placing ads directly on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), cutting out the middlemen advertising groups.
The group had outperformed its peers - Omnicom (N:OMC) and IPG (L:IPG) in the United States, France's Publicis (PA:PUBP) and Havas and Japan's Dentsu (T:4324) - for years but lost its way in 2017 with organic growth disappearing. 
Clients have told Reuters they hugely value WPP's work but they want the group to be streamlined. Operating in 112 countries, WPP has 400 separate agencies that provide everything from pure advertising to media planning strategies, data research and PR. 
Those 400 agencies have traditionally competed with each other, meaning clients can deal with multiple different agencies. They now want those agencies to work together to provide a more simplified service. 
Read told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry.
Some moves are already evident - the group is moving its headquarters, has revamped its website to provide a more sleek message and clients and WPP executives have told Reuters they've seen a more collaborative approach from the top.
Married with two young children, Read had been the popular option among senior and junior members of WPP staff spoken to by Reuters. 

News of his pending appointment was first reported by the Financial Times.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The chief executive of  Unilever  (L:ULVR) Paul Polman on Thursday defended the Dutch government's plan to scrap a withholding tax on dividends as good for the Netherlands' economy, despite its unpopularity domestically.
In an interview with national broadcaster NOS, Polman said the tax was a ""double tax"" that was driving some companies to move elsewhere. ""The global tendency is that dividend taxes are going down,"" he told NOS.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte says scrapping the tax will make the Netherlands more attractive for foreign investment. It is set to cost the government around 2 billion euros in lost revenues, however, rather than an initially forecast 1.3 billion euros, which has stirred fresh opposition.
Anglo-Dutch Unilever picked Rotterdam over London for its main headquarters earlier this year. Polman repeated that the Dutch move to scrap the tax, which does not exist in Britain, played a role in the company's decision. 
Rutte survived a no-confidence vote in April over the tax after memos emerged showing Shell (LON:RDSa) and Unilever had both lobbied for the tax cut as he was forming his new government in 2017.
In December, the country's Central Bureau for Statistics estimated that some 20 percent of the country's jobs were created directly or indirectly by multinational companies. 
But several experts this month said the tax cut would make no difference to employment.
Members of parties of Rutte's own coalition said they only accepted the cut as part of the governing pact.
On Friday, Rutte defended the tax again, arguing that there are only a handful of large multinationals in the Netherlands and when one departs, ""it can never be replaced.""

Emerging-market assets tumbled and the dollar rallied as traders sold riskier assets amid turmoil in Argentina and Turkey.
The S&P 500 Index fell to lows of the day after the report on Trump’s trade plan, with industrial stocks among the worst performers. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). led the biggest tech names higher after Warren Buffett said he likes the iPhone maker, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). climbed toward a $1 trillion market valuation. Argentina failed to stem a rout in the peso as the central bank jacked up its benchmark interest rate, already the highest in the world, to 60 percent.
Treasuries edged higher with core European bonds, while Italian and Greek notes slumped. The euro fell after the EU’s chief negotiator warned the bloc must be prepared for a disorderly Brexit. Canada’s dollar weakened after second-quarter growth missed estimates.
Investors showed a bit of caution Thursday amid a slew of risks to the global outlook, not least U.S. trade and foreign policy, and amid speculation the recent run-up in equity prices may have gone too far. After Trump on Wednesday accused China of undermining efforts to pressure North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons, people familiar with the matter said the U.S. president wants to move ahead with a plan to impose tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public-comment period concludes next week.
Telecom shares led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lower. In Asia, Japanese equities pared earlier gains to finish slightly higher and stocks fell in Hong Kong and China. The Australian dollar declined after second-quarter business investment was worse than expected, while New Zealand’s currency slumped as business confidence hit a 10-year low.
Elsewhere, crude broke through $70 a barrel for the first time in a month as shrinking stockpile levels in the U.S. pointed to supply constraints. Emerging-market stocks fell the most in two weeks and currencies declined, with the lira tumbling on a Turkish holiday amid reports the central bank’s deputy governor is set to resign.
These are the main moves in markets:

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the commission also wants to take steps to give more individual investors a shot at companies that have avoided going public for years and is weighing a overhaul of rules intended to protect mom-and-pop investors, the newspaper said. 
Clayton's proposed moves come after Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk unnerved the Wall Street when he announced a go-private deal at $420 a share, saying it would benefit shareholders by removing short-term pressures by hiding the company's financials from the public eye.
Under Clayton, a Donald Trump appointee, the SEC has taken steps to relax rules for issuers, including allowing firms going public to file information confidentially, and is currently discussing easing other compliance rules. 

Earlier this month, Trump asked securities regulators to explore replacing quarterly reporting requirements with half-yearly filings at the urging of executives.

A plan support agreement between Puerto Rico, its Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA), the island's federally created oversight board, bondholders and bond insurance companies that was announced on Thursday would be the first debt adjustment plan to seek court approval.
Puerto Rico has been in bankruptcy court since May 2017 trying to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. A deal with COFINA creditors surfaced earlier this summer.
""The deal provides for more than a 32 percent reduction in COFINA debt, gives Puerto Rico approximately $17.5 billion in debt service savings and enables local retail bondholders in Puerto Rico to receive a significant recovery,"" said Natalie Jaresko, the oversight board's executive director, in a statement.
She added that it paves the way for ""achieving a consensual restructuring of COFINA debt by the end of 2018.""
A coalition of senior COFINA bondholders hailed the deal, which includes investors in senior and junior bonds as well as island residents who bought the debt, as ""a significant milestone for Puerto Rico on its road to economic revitalization.""
The agreement could still face a headwind. In June, a key group of Puerto Rico bondholders who own general obligation debt opposed the proposed COFINA deal. GO and COFINA bondholders have long debated the ownership of Puerto Rico's future sales tax revenue.
Puerto Rico's unsecured creditor committee (UCC), moreover, warned in a court filing that the terms of the COFINA deal would result in a $28 billion deficit under the commonwealth's most recent fiscal plan. 
In a court motion filed on Aug. 13, the UCC, which represented the commonwealth in negotiating the COFINA settlement framework, states that these issues must be solved before the committee supports any plan of adjustment for COFINA.
Puerto Rico's fiscal board, meanwhile, expects to again revise the commonwealth's fiscal plan, which was last certified on June 29. It is unknown whether this revision will address the issues raised by the UCC.

NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) -  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) said on Thursday it plans to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units and left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale, following a months-long review and pressure from a hedge fund to sell itself outright.
It is not clear if the plan will appease activist investor Dan Loeb, whose Third Point LLC announced a 5.65 percent stake on Aug. 9 and immediately pressed for a sale of the entire company to a competitor as ""the only justifiable outcome.""
If dissatisfied, Loeb could escalate his attack into a proxy fight and nominate a slate of directors within the next few weeks to be voted on at Campbell's annual meeting later this year, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. Third Point declined comment on Thursday. 
Campbell's Interim Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin said the board considered the option of a complete sale during its review and ended the process ""with a completely open mind."" 
Selling the two smaller units could make Campbell a more attractive takeover target by turning its focus back to its core soup and salty snacks businesses.
""The board concluded that this current plan right now is the best one to maximize value,"" McLoughlin told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. ""Having said that, the board remains open to alternatives that could create more value for the shareholder.""
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) would not buy the company and said it is ""very hard to offer a significant premium for a packaged goods company."" 
On a conference call with analysts McLoughlin sidestepped questions about investor pressure for a sale and declined to comment on whether any activists, such as Loeb's Third Point, would be given board seats.
Shares of Campbell, which has a market value of about $12 billion, fell 2.6 percent to $38.95 shortly after midday.
Alongside the results of its review, Campbell also forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2019 below Wall Street's average estimate, as its costs continue to rise.
NEW STRATEGY 
The 149-year-old company which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
Campbell's latest foray into fresh food has faltered while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt while costs are increasing. Its shares have fallen by a third over the past two years.
The company said on Thursday it would use the proceeds of the unit sales to reduce its debt and also increased its cost savings target by $150 million to $945 million by the end of fiscal 2022. 
Retreating from the international and fresh-food businesses marks a reverse from the strategy of former Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who wanted Campbell to have a wide-ranging portfolio with a focus on health and well-being.
Morrison stepped down abruptly in May after a string of poor results. On the same day, the company announced its sweeping review and named McLoughlin as interim CEO.
""Simply put, we lost focus,"" said McLoughlin on Thursday. ""We aggressively pursued the important consumer mega-trend of health and well-being without having clarity on our source of uniqueness ... and we depended too much on M&A, to shape our business strategy,"" he said.
Campbell is still looking for a new permanent CEO. McLoughlin said on Thursday he was not a candidate to take the job. The company also said it was rescheduling its annual investor day from October to spring next year.
OUT WITH OVERSEAS, FRESH 
The two businesses put up for sale currently bring in about $2.1 billion in annual sales, about a quarter of Campbell's overall revenue.
Campbell International includes Australian biscuits brand Arnott’s and the Kelsen Group, along with the company’s manufacturing operations in Indonesia and Malaysia and its businesses in Hong Kong and Japan. 
Campbell Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the company’s refrigerated soup business.
The company has hired  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Centerview Partners to sell the units. 
Under Morrison, Campbell arranged its products into three parts in 2015, setting up the new Campbell Fresh business. The unit was meant to tap into consumers' booming appetite for healthier foods but the business struggled, resulting in a two-year decline in organic sales.
FAMILY BUSINESS 
Historically, the company has resisted big changes, being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago.
Dorrance's grandchildren Mary Alice Malone, who raises horses in Pennsylvania, and her brother Bennett Dorrance, a real estate developer in Arizona, between them control 33 percent of Campbell's shares. They have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself. 
In the past, the family has been able to rely on supportive, long-term shareholders. But in the past few months - most notably in the second quarter of 2018, when the company announced its review - a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures, including a sale. 
For fiscal 2019, Campbell forecast earnings per share of between $2.45 and $2.53 for fiscal 2019, not including the effect of the planned unit sales, below Wall Street's average estimate of $2.69, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 25 cents, just ahead of the Wall Street's average estimate of 24 cents.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>","Buffett says Berkshire buying own stock, more Apple","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), on Thursday said the conglomerate has bought back its own stock for the first time since 2012 and has added a ""little"" to its already huge stake in Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Buffett also said investors are better off owning a basket of stocks than 30-year bonds and other fixed-income securities as a strong U.S. economy bolsters corporate profits despite higher costs from tariffs, which have also affected Berkshire.
""I don't know when to buy stocks, but I know whether to buy stocks,"" Buffett, celebrating his 88th birthday, said on CNBC television.
""Business is good across the board,"" he added. ""It was good two years ago, it keeps getting better.""
Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and invests in companies such as Apple,  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO).
A buy-back policy announced on July 17 gave Buffett, who has gone 2-1/2 years since a major acquisition, a new way to deploy Berkshire's $111.1 billion of cash and equivalents.
Berkshire said the policy would free Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger to repurchase stock when the price was below Berkshire's ""intrinsic value,"" a determination that would be made ""conservatively.""
Berkshire's old policy forbade buybacks unless the price exceeded 1.2 times book value per share. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company recently traded at around a 1.45 times multiple. 
Buffett said ""we've bought back a little"" stock since the change, and that he and Munger need ""a big enough discount"" to ensure that long-term shareholders are better off.
Berkshire has also bought ""just a little"" more Apple stock since June 30, he said, when it had a 252 million share stake now worth more than $56 billion.
Buffett is also a happy Apple customer.
He said he uses his iPad ""a lot,"" and that the iPhone is ""enormously underpriced"" even when it costs $1,000, given how indispensable it has become for so many people.
Buffett was speaking from the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan, where he planned to eat lunch with the person who in June agreed to pay $3,300,100 at an annual charity auction.

Proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco charity that serves people who are poor, homeless or battling substance abuse. The winning bid was the third-highest in 19 years of auctions, which have raised $29.6 million.

973,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>",Housing funds for Puerto Ricans who fled Hurricane Maria must end: U.S. judge,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - More than a thousand Puerto Rican families who fled Hurricane Maria will get two more weeks of U.S.-funded housing in hotels and motels across the country but will then need to fend for themselves, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman in Worcester, Massachusetts, rejected an advocacy group's request to stop federal officials from cutting off the aid to people who fled the massive September 2017 storm that killed almost 3,000 people and destroyed homes and infrastructure across the island.
Lawyers for a group of Puerto Ricans pursuing the lawsuit argued that the Federal Emergency Management Agency's decision to terminate aid violated their due process rights. They also said FEMA's support was unequal compared to how it aided victims of other U.S. hurricanes in 2017.
The judge rejected their request to require FEMA to continue providing aid to evacuees until they obtained temporary or permanent housing. He told the agency to continue to pay so the evacuees can remain until Sept. 14.
He said the evacuees failed to establish that they were entitled to continued benefits under the federal statute governing FEMA aid.
""While this is the result that I am compelled to find, it is not necessarily the right result,"" Hillman wrote. He added that he could only apply the law and not require FEMA ""to do that which in a humanitarian and caring world should be done.""
FEMA spokeswoman Dasha Castillo said the agency was aware of the ruling and was notifying participating hotels that the aid program was being extended.
LatinoJustice PRLDEF, an advocacy organization that represented the Puerto Ricans in the case, said it is considering its options.
Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico with winds close to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour) on Sept. 20, 2017, causing an estimated $90 billion in damage to the already economically struggling U.S. territory.
A study commissioned by the territory's government and released on Tuesday found that the storm caused about 2,975 deaths, not 64 as counted previously.
Critics have said the federal government responded poorly to the disaster. They contend President Donald Trump's administration viewed Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens, a claim it denies.
According to FEMA, 1,038 families displaced by Maria as of Thursday were receiving aid under a program that pays for hotel lodging. Since its launch, the program has helped 7,032 families.

FEMA had planned to end the program on June 30 but courts had blocked it.

After saying that  Google’s secretive self-driving car project  could be worth $175 billion — already a $100 billion uptick from its previous valuation — the bank now believes that once the automotive unit starts its ride-hailing service this year, Alphabet’s stock could surge 20% to $1,515 per share.
""Given the continued strong core fundamentals and growing Waymo visibility, we adjust our GOOGL price target calculation and raise our price target to $1,515 (from $1,325), which represents ~20% upside,"" analyst Brian Nowak said in a note to clients Wednesday.
""Our model and new valuation methodology more fully incorporate Waymo, as we see the launch of Waymo's ride-hailing service by year-end as a potential catalyst for value realization.”
The bank also says its price target increase is because there’s more profit left to be juiced from Google’s billions of users across the globe using its core services like search, YouTube, Maps and more.
""We remain bullish on the core GOOGL business as we believe GOOGL is still in the early innings of monetizing its seven +1 billion user platforms and that it is investing to build new monetization opportunities such as YouTube subscriptions, Maps, and hardware.""
Of course, there’s still plenty standing between Waymo and fare collection. Human drivers are regularly taking over for the computer,  The Information reported this week, and the beta program has received numerous complaints from those in its suburban Phoenix test zone.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Auction battle looms for Comcast and Fox as Sky bidding deadline nears,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's takeover regulator could take the rare step of intervening in the battle between Comcast and Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky next month by staging an auction for the broadcaster to bring the drawn-out bidding war to an end.
The Takeover Panel has the power to instigate a formal auction process for London-listed Sky (L:SKYB) to help resolve its future if two competing bids that have not been declared final remain on the table for the company on Sept. 22, according to Britain's takeover code. 
There have only been three British takeover situations since 2007 that have involved auctions handled by the regulator, including the 6.2 billion-pound ($8.1 billion) sale of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus to India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), according to analysis by Reuters.
A fourth battle ended just before an auction was due to start when Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) abandoned its takeover attempt of gas explorer Cove Energy in 2012, allowing Thailand's PTT Exploration & Production to clinch a $1.9 billion deal. That marked the last time the Panel invoked the auction procedure.
Cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA) currently leads Rupert Murdoch's Fox (O:FOXA) in the fight for Sky with a 14.75 pound a share offer last month that values the broadcaster at 25.9 billion pounds and has been recommended by the pay-television group's independent directors. 
That trumped the 14 pound a share offer made by Fox earlier in July for the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own, and is 37 percent above Fox's original 10.75 pound a share bid. 
Sky's shares currently trade at 15.44 pounds. 
Under the current timetable for a deal, which can be changed by the Panel, Fox and Comcast are free to lift their bids at any point up until the Sept. 22 deadline. 
If neither suitor has admitted defeat by then, the regulator can step in and start an auction. The Panel did not comment.
The aim of an auction is to bring a protracted bidding war to a close by giving the suitors an opportunity to submit revised offers in an orderly process managed by the Panel, which remains neutral. But it can also serve to drive up the price that the successful suitor ultimately pays. 
""I hope it goes to an auction,"" said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund is a top-20 shareholder in Sky. ""Every day I look at that price and think: 'Why is it not at 18 pounds?'""
BATTLE FOR CORUS
In 2007, there were concerns that Tata overpaid for Corus after it became embroiled in a lengthy fight for the steelmaker with Brazilian firm Companhia Siderurgica Nacional.
The Panel eventually stepped in and ran an auction that went for nine rounds over the course of about eight hours and finished in the early hours of a Wednesday morning. Tata emerged the winner with a 608 pence a share offer, a third higher than its original 455 pence bid.
Tata's expensive foray into British steelmaking later proved problematic for the Indian group after overcapacity in Europe plunged the UK's steel industry into crisis in 2015.
It subsequently agreed a deal to create a European steel joint venture with Germany's ThyssenKrupp (DE:TKAG) earlier this year to help their operations withstand the pressures facing the industry. 
Since the Corus sale, the Panel has tweaked the rules governing auctions so that unless the bidders and target agree an alternative procedure, the regulator runs a five-round process over five consecutive business days.
The suitors can announce revised offers by 5pm each day up until the fifth day, after which no new bids are allowed and the offers become final. The auction ends earlier than the fifth day if there is a round that draws no new offers.
The Sky battle is one part of a much broader consolidation sweeping the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) force the world's traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace.
Fox's existing 39 percent shareholding in Sky is part of a host of TV and film assets that Murdoch's group has agreed to sell to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS) for about $71 billion.
Comcast was also vying to buy those Fox assets until it dropped out of that battle in July to focus on taking control of Sky.

Cars in the European Union must comply with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) from September, but Volkswagen has only gained regulatory clearance for seven of its 14 main model lines.
""The new tests are more cumbersome and take two to three times longer than in the past, even limited edition models need to be tested separately,"" Volkswagen's Thomas Zahn said in a call with journalists on Thursday.
""The coming months will be challenging for us,"" said Zahn, head of sales and marketing for Volkswagen passenger cars.
Volkswagen's top-selling Golf model is among the vehicles still waiting to be cleared by authorities, Zahn said.
He said he expected the Golf to pass the WLTP standards by the end of September.
Shipments of cars are expected to slow down in September and October, but pick up again in the final two months of the year.
""We expect very strong deliveries in December,"" Zahn said.
Carmakers including Daimler, Volkswagen and supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) have cut profit expectations, blaming a slowdown in global sales triggered in part by delays getting vehicles certified to the new standard.
Analysts at Evercore ISI said the WLTP delays at the VW brand appear to be under control since the carmaker has not resorted to heavy discounting to keep sales flowing. 

Nonetheless delays will cause profitability of the brand to drop to around 2 percent in the third quarter, from 5.5 percent in the second quarter, Evercore said in a note on Thursday.

Shares were trading a shade higher at $2,000.95 in premarket trade on Thursday, putting the company’s market capitalization just shy of $975 billion.
The stock would have to hit $2053 to reach the $1 trillion market cap.
Morgan Stanley boosted its price target to $2,500 from $1,800 on Wednesday. It is the highest target out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
At a $2,500 stock price, Amazon would have a market valuation of about $1.2 trillion.
""We have increasing confidence that Amazon's rapidly growing, increasingly large, high margin revenue streams (advertising, AWS, subscriptions) will drive higher profitability and continued upward estimate revisions,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak.
Amazon shares are up 65% so far this year vs. the S&P 500's 8% gain. Over the past 12 months, Amazon has gained a whopping 103%, while the S&P 500 has returned 18%.
Earlier this month, Apple was the first company to break through the $1 trillion market cap level, doing so on August 2.
Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are also in the $1 trillion conversation, with market caps in the range of $850 billion.
The likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon, Apple, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google, who make up Wall Street’s so-called 'FAANG' stocks, have propelled stock markets to record highs in 2018, with the Nasdaq reaching the 8,000-point milestone for the first time this week.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Savvy European utilities shield themselves from higher carbon costs,"By Vera Eckert and Nina Chestney
FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - The surging costs of carbon permits have caused some of Europe's biggest utilities to lock in purchases in advance, while nuclear and hydro firms are benefiting from the knock-on effect on power prices.
Carbon permits traded under the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS) have become the best performing commodity this year, almost trebling in price to over 21 euros ($25) a ton since January on the back of stronger energy prices and measures to reduce supply.
The ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis which dragged prices down to lows of 2-3 euros a ton.
Now at 10-year highs, stronger carbon prices make it more expensive for European utilities to burn fossil fuels, encouraging a shift to cleaner energy sources.
Prices are expected to keep rising, according to a Reuters survey of analysts last month.
Market participants can hedge their exposure to rising prices by buying enough carbon permits when the price is low to cover their future emissions output.
If they have a surplus, they can sell them back to the market and make a profit when the price rises. If they don't have enough, they would have to buy more at a higher price. 
""Higher carbon prices mean higher costs for all European utilities, unless of course they hedged or stockpiled allowances,"" said French energy consultant Hibault Laconde.
One such company is coal-heavy German generator RWE (DE:RWEG), which said it had protected itself against power price volatility by selling fuels, as opposed to selling power production, and simultaneously buying enough emissions permits.
""Our CO2 position is already financially hedged until the end of 2022 and we have also taken steps beyond 2022,"" chief financial officer Markus Krebber said during recent half-year earnings calls with analysts.
COAL
Coal plants have benefited for years from low carbon prices which kept operational costs down. 
Many old German coal plants could be operated at low overheads and they were the price setters in the wholesale market for thermal generation.
RWE's hedging strategy involves nuclear and brown coal-generated power being sold usually up to three years in advance and hard coal and gas-fired ones closer to production.
Rival Uniper (DE:UN01) said it sold the bulk of its hydroelectric output next year. The rise in carbon prices will force inefficient coal plants out of the market, chief financial officer Christopher Delbrueck said this week.
Berlin-based Aurora Energy Research said German producers of coal from locally-mined lignite, a heavily polluting brown coal, such as Leag, EPH and RWE, had reason to worry.
The carbon price rise to 21 euros from 6 euros a year ago could have produced additional costs of 2.3 billion euros, according to Aurora analyst Hanns Koenig.
In coal-reliant Poland, the country's four major state producers are historically heavily exposed to coal generation.
Tauron's chief executive has called the EU carbon price a quasi-ecological tax.
""This is not a comfortable situation for us. Because of the CO2 policy, energy could become a luxury good,"" he was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP at the weekend.
POWER PRICE GAINS
For companies producing electricity from low-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric plants, higher carbon prices are welcomed.
The wholesale price of power reflects the cost of buying carbon permits and fuels. Coal and gas prices have risen this year due to Chinese demand, a cold winter and a heatwave across Europe. The benchmark German power price is at a six-and-a-half year high.
France's EDF (PA:EDF), which has a generation fleet made up of 77 percent nuclear and 10 percent renewables, should produce more competitive electricity in interconnected European markets.
""The higher CO2 prices are a huge jackpot for EDF as they drive up wholesale power market prices ... This is the case for all nuclear and hydro power producers,"" said Nicolas Goldberg, energy specialist at Columbus Consulting.
A spokesman for Swedish utility Vattenfall said price rises supported its strategy of becoming less reliant on fossil fuels.
""If current price developments continue, we expect a gradual decrease in profitability of coal-fired assets. However, our diversified portfolio with a significant (combined heat and power) share is rather robust to such developments,"" he added.
Germany's Uniper, which has inherited the thermal and hydro plants of former parent E.ON (DE:EONGn), said it had factored in significant price increases for carbon, coal and gas-fired power in the coming years.
""That will give our earnings a boost from 2020/21,"" CFO Delbrueck said.
Germany's E.ON is focusing on low-carbon power, grids and retail activities, and is left with nuclear power production only in Germany and Sweden, where it also operates hydropower.
Czech nuclear, coal and renewable generator CEZ (PR:CEZP) has sold over 77 percent of its expected 2019 output, benefiting from a higher share of nuclear than pure coal generators.
Some analysts say a carbon price around 20-30 euros could encourage more utilities to switch to lower carbon fuels. 
Gas-fired power generation becomes more competitive at a carbon price of round 20 euros a ton. 
However, margins for gas-fired plants are still mostly negative, despite a cleaner carbon record, as high oil and gas prices mean high purchasing costs for generators vis-à-vis coal.
Uniper's Delbrueck said it should be closer to 30 euros to get a stronger fuel switch.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",China's solar subsidy cuts erode the impact of Trump tariffs,"By Nichola Groom
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A move by China to slash subsidies for domestic solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices and eroding the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff on solar equipment imports, according to industry officials.
That's good news for U.S. companies that purchase and install imported solar panels, including Inovateus Solar and Pine Gate Renewables, which had expected that the protectionist policy would raise their costs and slow their business.
The falling prices, however, will hurt panel manufacturers including China’s Jinko Solar [JKSAA.UL] and Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS, which had announced hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. solar manufacturing investments in the expectation that tariffs would boost their profits.
Trump announced a 30-percent levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in an escalating global trade war that he says is aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers and other businesses rebound from years of decline. Critics say the tariffs could backfire by hurting other domestic industries that depend on imports.
The prospect of solar tariffs initially sent U.S. panel prices soaring, making domestic manufacturing more profitable and drawing a handful of new investments. But the tax on imports cooled the red-hot pace of U.S. solar installations by raising panel costs.
The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The solar panel market shifted in June after China - the world’s top solar installer and a major critic of the Trump tariff - announced a plan to cut the amount of installed solar capacity this year nearly in half by cutting subsidies for such projects. While the move could undermine the effectiveness of Trump's tariffs on panels, China's National Development and Reform Commission has said the subsidy cuts were motivated mainly by domestic concerns about the industry's rapid growth.
Surging solar capacity has left China struggling to build sufficient transmission infrastructure to link projects to the electrical grid, and the finance ministry has scrambled to find billions of yuan in subsidies owed to new projects. 
The subsidy reductions forced Chinese panel makers to find new buyers on the export market. The increased global supply has driven down the cost of buying a panel in the United States to about 40 cents a watt from 45 cents shortly after the tariff, according to pricing data from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. The research firm said prices could fall to about 30 cents by the end of 2019 – less than they were before the administration began considering a tariff in 2017.
""It's becoming a buyer's market again,"" said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive of U.S. developer Intersect Power, a solar project developer founded in 2016 that has plans to purchase large volumes of panels starting in 2019.
The unexpected price declines are eroding the effectiveness of the tariff in boosting manufacturing profits and could completely offset its initial market impact by November, said Paul Strigler, a vice president with Esplanade Capital, a Boston-based investment firm that has a fund dedicated to solar energy investments.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not respond to a request for comment. The four-year tariff on solar modules steps down by 5 percentage points a year before expiring in 2022.
The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), a trade group representing both solar developers and panel manufacturers, opposed the tariffs as a net loss of industry jobs and revenue. The falling prices mitigate some of the pain but still amount to a drag on growth, said SEIA spokesman Dan Whitten.
""It may be less bad than it could have been, but it's still not nearly as good as it should be,"" he said.
BRIGHTER OUTLOOK FOR DEVELOPERS
Utility-scale solar developers including Cyprus Creek Renewables and Southern Current told Reuters earlier this year that the higher panel prices caused by the tariff had forced them to cancel or freeze plans for more than $2.5 billion in projects – a figure that topped new investments announced by manufacturing firms that benefitted from the tariffs.
Many installers are now feeling more optimistic.
South Bend, Indiana-based Inovateus Solar, for example, said lower panel prices had helped it close a deal in June to develop a 6 megawatt system for the city of Pratt, Kansas and to revive hiring plans.
""The drop in panel prices has really helped stimulate more activity,"" Inovateus co-founder TJ Kanczuzewski said in an interview.
The lower prices have also helped the economics of projects already in the pipeline, especially those with marginal prospects for a payoff, said Ben Catt, chief development officer of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Pine Gate Renewables.
Cypress Creek said the decline has yet to resuscitate its shelved projects for 2018, but the company said it expects panel prices to keep falling, potentially helping projects next year.
""Ramping construction up and down is not something that happens overnight,"" said Cypress Creek's director of government affairs, Hewitt Strange.
Southern Current did not respond to requests for comment.
Colin Smith, an analyst for Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, said he expects the U.S. utility-scale solar market to expand between 2020 and 2023 because of the falling price of panels, instead of remaining flat as the firm had forecast earlier this year. 
""The market has become comfortable again,” Smith said.
MANUFACTURING 'MORE CHALLENGING' 
Panel manufacturers that announced U.S. expansions in response to the tariffs - including China’s Jinko Solar, California-based SunPower Corp and Canada's Heliene - said they still planned to move forward with planned investments.
But the falling prices are forcing them to operate at a lower margin, they said, to compete against foreign rivals who benefit from lower labor and material costs. 
""It makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging,"" SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner said in an interview.
SunPower earlier this year agreed to take over the Oregon factory of troubled SolarWorld Americas - one of the companies that sought the tariffs. The deal is expected to close before the end of the third quarter, SunPower said. The facility is capable of producing nearly a gigawatt of solar cells and modules a year, or enough energy to power about 700,000 homes.
Jinko's investor relations director, Sebastian Liu, called the price collapse a normal fluctuation and said the firm was ""making reasonable margins"" thanks to a focus on higher efficiency products and lower costs for polysilicon, solar's key raw material. He said Jinko will begin producing panels at a U.S. facility in Florida in the fourth quarter of this year.
Heliene President Martin Pochtaruk said his company had weathered such price drops before and would do so again as it works toward opening its Minnesota factory next month. Heliene took over the facility in May of 2017 and has invested $21.5 million to get it up and running. The company expects to produce 140 MW of panels there a year.
Heliene said it would focus on cost cuts to compensate for falling prices.

""It is of course stressing"" Pochtaruk said of the sudden market shift, but also ""business as usual"" in a volatile sector.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - United Airlines (N:UAL) on Thursday will announce three new daily routes to Europe as the third largest U.S. carrier eyes higher-paying business travelers on transatlantic flights. 
The increase in transatlantic capacity comes as part of a broader company strategy that includes growing the margin-rich business-class service, Patrick Quayle, United’s vice president of international network, said in a telephone interview from Montreal. 
""We're eyeing the business traveler, and Europe is doing very well for us,"" Quayle said without offering further details.
United's larger rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) are also adding flights to Europe next year, even as they scale back 2018 growth plans to preserve passenger fares in the face of soaring fuel costs.
Earlier this year, United cut its 2018 plans for capacity growth to a rate of between 4.5 percent and 5 percent. It had previously forecast a range of between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent. 
In 2019, United will add summer service from Newark, New Jersey, to Prague and Naples, and year-round flights from San Francisco to Amsterdam, the carrier said in the release.

The blue-chip Dow futures fell 71 points, or 0.27%, by 6:57 AM ET (10:57 GMT), the S&P 500 futures lost 5 points, or 0.18%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 16 points, or 0.20%.
Wall Street looked set to take a break on Thursday after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both closed a day earlier at record highs for a fourth consecutive session.
Stocks have been supported by the fact that U.S. and Canadian leaders have expressed optimism that they could reach new NAFTA deal by a Friday deadline as negotiators prepared to talk through the night, although Canada warned that a number of tricky issues remained.
Under pressure, Canada rejoined the talks to modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday after Mexico and the U.S. announced a bilateral deal on Monday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has set a Friday deadline for the three countries to reach an in-principle agreement.
Assuming renegotiation with Canada and Mexico is successful, the U.S. plans to tackle trade with Europe next and traders received positive news on that front on Thursday as a report from Politico said that the European Union was willing to scrap car tariffs in its U.S. trade deal.
With developments advancing between the NAFTA countries amid hopes for a rapid resolution and trade between Europe and the U.S. expected to follow suit, investors refocused Thursday to see if any more news materializes in what would be the next step on the trade front: the ongoing spat between the U.S. and China.
U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods are expected to take effect later next month with Beijing warning the Trump administration to back down.
Investors fear an escalating trade war between the world's two biggest economies could hit global growth and damage sentiment.
On the economic agenda, market participants looked ahead to more data on the state of the U.S. consumer with personal income and spending data for July set for release at 8:30AM ET.
Economists expect personal income to rise 0.3% over the prior month, while spending is forecast to gain 0.4%, according to estimates.
The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation metric, core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), is also set for release in the morning.
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that the core PCE price index inched up 0.2% last month. On an annualized basis, core PCE prices are expected to rise 2%, matching the Fed’s inflation target.
Weekly initial jobless claims numbers come at the same time, with economists predicting a small rise from the previous week.
While waiting for the data, the dollar managed to break four consecutive sessions of losses against rival currencies. At 6:58 AM ET (10:58 GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was up 0.06% at 94.52.
In company news,  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) stock sank more than 4% in pre-market trade on Thursday after the company reported mixed quarterly results and announced it would sell its international businesses and Fresh refrigerated-foods unit, following a months-long strategic review and pressure from hedge fund investors to sell the whole company.

In May, Nestle said it planned to eliminate up to 500 information technology jobs in Switzerland as it shifts work to an existing tech hub in Spain and other locations.
Following consultations, the company has now determined that it will keep around 150 IT employees in Switzerland, compared to the 100 originally announced in May, and will extend the reorganization plan into the second half of 2020. 
""Nestle understands this is a difficult time for its employees and is fully committed to mitigate the social impact of the reorganization, which will now be implemented,"" the group said in a statement. ""The company and the employees representatives are currently negotiating a social plan.""
These efforts include limiting layoffs through early retirements, as well as providing Swiss employees the opportunity to apply to 200 open spots in Barcelona and Milan, and providing them with outplacement support.
""Nestle is in ongoing discussions with third parties and partners, who have expressed an interest in possibly recruiting its IT employees,"" the Vevey-based group added.

Under pressure from activist shareholder Daniel Loeb to increase investor returns, Nestle has been keeping a close eye on costs.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 05:36AM ET</span>",Winter ahead: China private equity industry faces turbulence after debt clampdown,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's private equity industry is cooling, with fundraising on course for one of its worst years since the global financial crisis and returns under pressure, hurt by tighter domestic liquidity following Beijing's war on debt and Sino-U.S. trade tensions. 
Industry players have raised $19.7 billion in yuan and foreign-currency funds so far this year, according to data provider Preqin, compared with an average $46.5 billion per year raised since 2010. The figures include venture capital as well as growth and later-stage private equity funds.
Yuan-denominated funds have been hit particularly hard, with fundraising running at $6.9 billion, or a little over a tenth of the full-year number for 2017. 
A fundraising slowdown in Asia's biggest private equity market could narrow investors' exit options, impact deals and disrupt companies' funding plans.
Liquidity in China has tightened as an escalating trade conflict between Washington and Beijing has stoked market volatility. That comes as China's multi-year deleveraging program has weighed on banks, insurers and trust firms who are the main investors, or limited partners (LPs), in private equity funds. 
""For yuan-denominated funds, indeed some of the industry's previous fundraising channels, money from banks for example, are getting more difficult or have simply disappeared after the new asset management regulations came out,"" said Wei Ke, a partner at investment bank China Renaissance’s Huaxing Growth Capital.
""Such doors are basically shut,"" he added, referring to China's new restrictions on banks' wealth management products and how they can invest.
China's onshore traded stocks have lost a total market value of 8.24 trillion yuan ($1.21 trillion) since March 22, when Donald Trump unveiled tariff plans for Chinese exports. 
Wealthy individuals and enterprises have also seen their assets shrink due to market wobbles and are therefore less keen or less able to invest, said Lily Liu, founder of Greater China private equity recruiter The Fathoms Group. 
""So far we are seeing LPs becoming more cautious and their investments more restricted due to the policy environment,"" she said. ""The only funds that can survive would be the more professional and specialized ones.""
As a result, some of the funds had to cut back on their fundraising targets, Liu added, without naming the funds. 
""BRUTAL WINTER"" 
The drop in fundraising comes as venture capital and private equity investments in Chinese companies reached an all-time high. As of Aug. 29, such investments totaled $56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Companies, especially tech startups such as Ant Financial Services Group [ANTFIN.UL] and Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, have been embracing ever-bigger valuations at an unprecedented pace.
The shrinking pool of dry powder could eventually hurt investment returns, some investors and analysts said., 
Between 70 percent and 90 percent of the funds operating now would not be able to realize their desired returns, according to a report by Chinese research firm Fuhang, which looked into onshore yuan-based funds and investments. 
Fuhang predicted that China's deleveraging and liquidity squeeze would continue until at least 2020.
""In the next three years, investments or capital in the primary market will experience a brutal winter,"" said the report. 
TOP FUNDS GAIN
As uncertainties grow, investors who still need to allocate their capital are staying with funds that have a proven performance track record. 
The biggest China-based fund raised this year is a 10 billion yuan logistics focused fund under Asia's largest warehouse operator, Global Logistic Properties (GLP), according to Preqin.
YF Capital, backed by  Alibaba  (N:BABA) founder Jack Ma, closed the biggest dollar fund at $2.5 billion, the data showed.
A few mega funds yet to close could, however, still give a boost to the disappointing volume this year.
Sequoia Capital China, the local arm of the Silicon Valley-based venture capital giant, is close to raising 15 billion yuan in its fifth yuan-denominated China-focused fund, the largest of its kind.
And Hillhouse Capital, an investment house that reaped good returns from its earlier bets on Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and JD.Com Inc (O:JD), has also received commitments of over $10 billion for its third pan-Asia dollar fund, industry sources have said.
""A lot of sophisticated LPs we've seen are only investing in two to three funds or maximum five funds, consolidating their resources into certain funds they feel (that) have the ability to generate the returns,"" said Nisa Leung, managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners. 

""The trend will be more and more prevalent.""

1007,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>","Bezos, Buffett Bet On a $250 Billion Unclaimed Internet Market","(Bloomberg) -- India’s long-neglected retail market is turning into one of the world’s hottest thanks to Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and a frenzy of billion-dollar dealmaking.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. just wrapped up a $16 billion agreement for control of the country’s leading e-commerce player, Flipkart Online Services Pvt., while Bezos’ Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). negotiates deals with a large supermarket chain and an investment in a prominent retail conglomerate, according to local media. This week, Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) agreed to acquire a stake in the company behind digital payments leader Paytm.
Why the sudden interest in India? The new optimism is fueled by rising standards of living, increases in smartphone usage and cheap data plans that are boosting internet penetration across the nation. Perhaps most important, India is the last big retail market still up for grabs, with an internet economy projected to double to $250 billion by 2020.
""It’s a race for leadership,” said Anil Kumar, the Bangalore-based chief executive officer at researcher RedSeer Consulting. ""There’s far more action in India compared with stable markets like China and the U.S.""
Online sales grew 23 percent last year and are up 40 percent so far in 2018, according to RedSeer. The organized retail market is under-penetrated, leading to tie-ups between online and offline players, and driving unprecedented levels of investments, Kumar said.

India’s vast retail industry has no parallel other than, perhaps, China. But unlike the Chinese market, dominated by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., India is relatively open and largely unconquered, offering global players vast opportunity to grow.
India is now the world’s fastest growing major economy, and per capita incomes have been climbing steadily. According to a Forrester Research Inc. report earlier this month, the South Asian country is the world’s fastest growing e-commerce market.
Amazon and Flipkart have cornered about three-quarters of the online Indian retail market, but other big players are getting aggressive. That’s meant heavily discounted offerings for consumers, although the substantial investments have crimped profitability.
When Walmart announced the Flipkart deal earlier this year, S&P Global Ratings changed its outlook on the U.S. retailer to negative, saying that Flipkart was poised to generate losses in the next few years.
“The appeal of retail lies in the population of India, the aspirations of India, the consumption power of India,” said Kishore Biyani, the billionaire chief executive of Mumbai-based retail conglomerate Future Group, which runs the 2,000-plus store Future Retail Ltd., including the country’s largest departmental chain.
Biyani said his group’s online revenues are nearing $150 million. He and others predict that India’s retail industry will have a unique combination of online and offline tie-ups.
Future Group is reported to have had negotiations about a stake sale with Amazon as well as Alibaba executives. Biyani refused to directly comment, simply saying he too is looking to “crack a deal like everybody else.” Amazon declined to comment and Alibaba didn’t respond to a request for comment.
India’s Reliance Industries Ltd. is also fine-tuning its own e-commerce thrust by creating a hybrid online-offline retail platform.
So far, retailers have only scratched the surface by roping in high-income customers in India’s large metropolitan cities. Rural areas and small cities offer fresh opportunity. The retail battle for Indian consumers will be on display again in early November during the festival of Diwali, India’s version of Christmas and Thanksgiving combined.
Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive officer of the Alibaba-backed e-commerce company Paytm Mall, says he ultimately sees wide-ranging impact from the billions pouring into the industry. He predicts that small mom-and-pop shops will soon be armed with retail technology as well as cloud and payments products.
Sharma is also the founder of One97 which runs the Paytm digital payments app. Berkshire Hathaway this week invested in One97, becoming the latest global player to bet that digital payments will surge as India’s increasingly affluent consumers shop online.
“Indian retail will get digitized at an unprecedented scale,"" Sharma said. ""Its every nook and cranny will get altered.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock market gains came to a grinding halt on Thursday, held back by concern that China will be left behind as the United States reaches trade agreements with other North American countries and Europe. 
Stock markets and major government bond yields rose in recent weeks on hopes that a global trade war could be averted, particularly with the leaders of the United States and Canada optimistic they could reach new North American Trade Agreement by Friday.
But with tariffs beginning to hurt the Chinese economy, Asian stocks lost some of their gains and European shares followed suit on Thursday on concerns over trade relations between the world's two largest economies. 
""In all honestly, the NAFTA situation probably reflects a desire to get the agreement over the line before elections in Mexico and the mid-term vote in the U.S.,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, an FX broker. 
""It doesn't mean the U.S. will look for a quick solution with China. There's still a long way to run with these trade situations, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more tariffs on more goods before it gets better."" 
A pan-European stock index dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, dragging the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, off a five-month high. 
Earlier, a Reuters poll showed activity among China's manufacturers probably slowed for the third straight month in August.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.3 percent, with broad gains across the region offset by losses in China.
The Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.9 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.8 percent. 
""Investors are relatively pessimistic and cautious for now amid low levels of trading volume, as there are still concerns over the development of the Sino-U.S. trade spat,"" said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities.
U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods are expected to take effect next month.
BREXIT BOOST
The British pound extended its gains against the euro after recording its biggest gain in seven months on Wednesday. The gains came as European Union negotiator Michel Barnier signaled an more accommodative stance toward London in ongoing talks.
""It is a slight change in tone from Barnier and a sign that the EU is very aware of the Brexit deadline and they don't want a no-deal Brexit any more than we do,"" said Erlam of OANDA. 
EMERGING TROUBLES
Yet another emerging market currency is under scrutiny, this time Argentina's, after the country asked the International Monetary Fund for early assistance, alarming investors and hurting the peso and the country's bond prices.
The IMF said it was studying the request from Argentina to speed up disbursement of the $50 billion loan.
The Argentinian peso dropped more than 7 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline since the currency was allowed to float in December 2015. 
Yields on Argentina's 100-year bond issued last year rose to its highest level yet at 9.859 percent overnight. 
The peso's plunge came after a currency crisis hit Turkey earlier in the month, sparking worries about all emerging markets. The Turkish lira retreated to a two-week low after Moody's on Wednesday downgraded 20 Turkish banks.
In commodities, Brent crude futures extended gains and was up 0.35 percent to $77.40 per barrel. U.S. crude futures climbed 0.37 percent to $69.77 per barrel.

Oil contracts had risen more than 1 percent on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories and as U.S. sanctions reduced Iranian crude shipments.

Investors are watching for signs of a possible U.S.-led fine, which would be another big hit to the bank, which has seen its shares fall by more than a fifth over the past six months as the scandal has unraveled.
""We are following this case very closely,"" Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Marshall Billingslea, told Danish daily Berlingske.
He declined to confirm whether U.S. authorities had started an investigation into Danske Bank, which is being probed in both Denmark and Estonia.
""But we have a close cooperation with the authorities here in Denmark, as well as in Estonia,"" he told the newspaper.
A Danske spokesman declined to comment on a potential dialogue between the bank and U.S. authorities.
""It is completely natural that there is interest for the case in Estonia from different authorities, including the U.S.,"" he said in an emailed comment to Reuters, adding that the bank is making information available to authorities if needed.
The bank has admitted to flaws in its anti-money laundering controls in Estonia and has launched its own investigation, the results of which are expected in September.
Estonian and Danish prosecutors have started criminal investigations concerning transactions worth billions of Danish crowns that might have been part of criminal money laundering.
While the bank does not have a banking license in the United States, it has a bond program in dollars and its Estonian branch saw U.S. dollar customer flows, which could heighten interest among U.S. regulators. 

For now, analysts on average put estimates for potential fines at roughly 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million).

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell back on Thursday, tracking a decline in Asian trading as weakness in Chinese markets eclipsed optimism that a NAFTA deal could be struck by Friday's deadline.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended early losses to 0.5 percent by 0830 GMT, while Germany's DAX (GDAXI), which is sensitive to China due to its prominence as a German export market, dropped 0.9 percent. 
Chinese stocks fell after a Reuters poll showed activity in the factory sector likely slowed for the third straight month in August amid uncertainty over an escalating trade war with the United States.
In Europe, trade-sensitive mining stocks (SXPP) tumbled 1.3 percent and autos (SXAP) fell 0.7 percent. 
""It's a balancing act with on the one hand relatively positive momentum behind NAFTA, but when the focus turns to China and trade war it doesn't seem like an end is in sight because any escalation plays to Trump's rhetoric of how he's protecting U.S. prosperity and jobs,"" said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips Investment Management. 
Earnings reports caused some sharp moves in individual stocks.
Shares in Europe's largest property company Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (AS:URW) fell 5 percent even though the company reported a boost to profits from its acquisition of Australian shopping centre giant Westfield.
Traders said a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note weighed on the stock after analysts at the U.S. bank downgraded their view on the European property industry to ""in-line"" from ""attractive"".
""For almost every property stock in Europe we expect a lower total return profile compared to what it has been delivering,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. 
They also said rising inflation and bond yields would increase differentiation in the sector and leverage would become more of a focus.
UK commercial property firm Intu (L:INTUP) fell 3.6 percent after Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underweight from equal-weight, and peer  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) fell 4.1 percent.  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM) lost 3.8 percent after a Morgan Stanley downgrade.
Real estate (SX86P) was Europe's worst-performing sector, down 1.3 percent.
Shares in Swedish radiation therapy gear maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) fell 6.6 percent after it reported an unexpected drop in first-quarter operating profit.
 Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) was a rare gainer, up 3.1 percent after the French conglomerate stuck to its full year outlook for rising profitability as its telecoms division improved.
The prospect of Bouygues Telecom gaining market share sent shares in rival  Iliad  (PA:ILD), a telecoms disrupter offering cut-price contracts, tumbling 6.4 percent.
Bringing up the rear was Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) which sank a further 8.1 percent, hitting its lowest in more than nine years and taking its year-to-date losses to 51 percent. 
GAM shares have sold off sharply since the firm suspended a top director and suspended, then liquidated, some bond funds. 
Overall in Europe, escalating trade disputes have driven cyclical mining and autos sectors down this year while healthcare and technology take the lead. 

With the second-quarter earnings season drawing to a close, companies in the MSCI Europe index (MIPO00000PEU) have delivered 10.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth in euro terms.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 05:03AM ET</span>","Activist Elliott argues Sky is worth over $34 billion, UK regulator says","By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Elliott believes Walt Disney’s (N:DIS) deal to buy assets from Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) has valued Sky (L:SKYB) at more than $34 billion, higher than any of the current offers for the British broadcaster, Britain’s takeover regulator disclosed on Wednesday.
Sky is at center of a bidding battle between Rupert Murdoch’s Fox, which already owns 39 percent of the pay-television company, and U.S. cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA). 
 Disney  has also agreed to a separate deal to buy TV and film assets from Fox, including its Sky shareholding, for about $71 billion. Disney was forced to raise the price it is paying for the Fox businesses in June to $38 a share after Comcast also tried to gate-crash that deal. 
Comcast currently has the upper-hand in the fight for Sky after it offered 14.75 pounds a share for the broadcaster last month, trumping a sweetened 14 pounds a share bid that Fox made earlier in July.
But Elliott, which owns a 4.3 percent stake in Sky, and hedge funds Davidson Kempner and Farallon Capital have argued that Sky is worth at least 15.01 pounds a share in the wake of Disney’s improved offer for the Fox assets, British regulator the Takeover Panel said on Wednesday. 
That would value Sky as a whole at about 26.4 billion pounds ($34.3 billion), according to Reuters calculations.
Elliott and the two other funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
At issue is the price Disney might be forced to offer to take full control of Sky. This is set by the Panel and essentially puts a floor under Sky’s shares, which closed at 15.44 pounds on Wednesday in London.
The Panel ruled in April that Disney would have to buy Sky if its deal for the Fox assets completes before either Fox or Comcast have managed to take control of the British broadcaster.
REGULATOR CHALLENGED
In the wake of Disney’s improved offer for the Fox businesses in June, the Panel decided in July that any compulsory offer for Sky should be priced at 14 pounds a share. That ruling was then reviewed and upheld by the Takeover Appeal Board, an independent body, earlier this month after “several interested parties” lodged appeals against the decision.
The Panel and the Takeover Appeal Board identified the challengers on Wednesday, disclosing for the first time that Elliott, Davidson Kempner and Farallon had unsuccessfully argued for a mandatory Disney offer of no lower than 15.01 pounds a share.
Sky’s independent directors had contended that the level of any mandatory Disney offer be set at 14.59 pounds a share, the Panel and the Appeal Board said. 
Meanwhile, Fox had believed the compulsory Disney offer should have been fixed at 12.50 pounds a share but had accepted the regulator's original ruling of 14 pounds, according to the Panel and the Appeal Board. 
They added that Disney, which had also not challenged the Panel's decision, had put a 12.50 pound a share price tag on the 39 percent Sky stake when it revised its offer for the Fox assets.
The disclosure of the different parties’ valuations is significant because the battle for Sky is not over. 

Both Fox and Comcast have until Sept. 22 to lift their offers for the pay-TV group if they decide to do so. If Sky’s future is not resolved by then, the Panel has the power to intervene and run a formal auction to bring the bidding war to an end.

Net income in the quarter ended June rose 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 81.6 billion yuan ($11.9 billion), according to an exchange filing Thursday. China’s five biggest banks have all reported profit growth of at least 5 percent for the latest quarter.
While the big five benefited from President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on riskier shadow financing in the first half, analysts are cutting profit forecasts for the rest of this year as an intensifying trade war with the U.S. threatens to slow China’s growth. Lenders’ pricing power and capital strength may also be weakened by a renewed push for credit expansion and loosening of monetary policy, as authorities look to sustain the economy.

1021,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 30, 2018 01:00AM ET</span>",Trump Tariffs Are Roadblock for Companies Hoping to Grow in U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- The maker of Sylvania light bulbs wants to expand its U.S. manufacturing and add American jobs, just as Donald Trump advocates. But the president’s tariffs are getting in the way.
LEDVANCE LLC said proposed duties on imported LED components are putting at risk efforts to shift production from China to plants in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, states where a $10 million upgrade last year means bulbs can be made four times faster and shipped more quickly to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and other customers that want U.S.-made goods.
The company is among hundreds of U.S. firms asking for relief from tariffs, which are meant to address a trade deficit with China and allegations of intellectual property theft. The White House says the economy is strong enough to absorb the impact of tariffs, and the long-term payoff will make the short-term pain of higher duties worthwhile.
Many businesses say the tariffs will increase their costs, forcing them to raise prices for consumers and even consider moving manufacturing offshore.
“The administration wants U.S. production, they want U.S. manufacturing, and in this particular case, they’re driving the exact opposite effect,” said Jennifer Dolin, regulatory affairs manager for Wilmington, Massachusetts-based LEDVANCE.
$200 Billion
Trump has imposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese imports and identified an additional $200 billion in goods targeted for duties of as much as 25 percent, ranging from chemicals and seafood to vacuums and bicycles. Those duties could take effect after a comment period ends Sept. 6.
Dolin and about 350 individuals from U.S. companies, trade associations and other entities testified this month in six days of hearings on the duties, with most asking that products be spared. But there’s little evidence that tensions between Washington and Beijing will ease up and allow the White House to scrap tariffs.
Speaking to reporters during his announcement Monday of a preliminary agreement with Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump said he is rejecting overtures from China to negotiate as he tries for a less “one-sided” trade policy. “It’s just not the right time to talk right now,” he said.
Reverse Ratio
LEDVANCE, which was sold last year to a Chinese investment consortium and has operations in more than 140 countries, makes Sylvania incandescent, halogen, fluorescent and LED light bulbs. The company produces about 30 percent of its LED bulbs in the U.S. and 70 percent in China. But after upgrading plants in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, and Versailles, Kentucky, it planned to reverse that ratio and more than double production in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, Dolin said.
The company converted traditional production lines in the U.S. to make LED bulbs, preserving the jobs of 200 workers and adding 20 new posts. The two facilities and supporting distribution centers employ about 650, she said.
Components imported from China to make LED bulbs are among the $200 billion in goods targeted for duties, and those parts are mostly made in China with limited other options to obtain them, Dolin said. While the duties would add costs to U.S. production, there are no additional tariffs on finished bulbs imported from China, she said.
Increasing Costs
LEDVANCE is asking the administration to either remove the tariffs on the components, impose duties on imported bulbs, or both. The company’s U.S. factories could ramp up production if tariffs on imported bulbs boost demand for its American-made products, Dolin testified last week in Washington.
The company doesn’t think the administration intends to disadvantage U.S. manufacturing and just wants “a level playing field so that U.S. production is not more expensive than buying straight from China,” she said.
Some company executives also say Trump’s tariffs are increasing the cost of manufacturing in the U.S. But they’re reluctant to speak publicly because of the backlash firms such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). have received for moving some production overseas.
Trump has fired off angry tweets about the motorcycle manufacturer and even backed a boycott after the company announced in June it’s shifting some production to sidestep tariffs from the European Union in retaliation for Trump’s separate duties on steel and aluminum imports.
1,000 Jobs
Trump’s tariffs also could affect plans announced by China-based Wanhua Group to build a $1.2 billion chemical complex in Louisiana that the company estimates would create more than 1,000 jobs directly and indirectly in Louisiana, Texas and Pennsylvania.
The list of $200 billion in goods targeted for tariffs includes aniline, which the company plans to import from China to make methylenediphenyl diisocyanate, or MDI, James Newport, general manufacturing site manager for Wanhua Chemical US Operations LLC, testified last week. It’s a chemical used primarily for foam insulation for residential and commercial construction, he said.
Newport declined to discuss the status of the project, announced last year and expected to open by 2021, as well as what impact the tariffs may have. But the company has asked to have chemical feedstock products removed from the tariff list and said its investment plans achieve Trump’s goals of bringing manufacturing to the U.S. and addressing the trade gap with China.
“What we’re doing in our company is exactly what the administration is encouraging to happen,” Newport testified."

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's largest ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing has suspended its carpooling service after a passenger was killed, and is likely to face tighter oversight that will squeeze driver numbers and extend customer waiting times.
The incident, which follows a similar grisly killing by a Didi driver in May, triggered public and government backlash - and created an opening for rival services to chip away at Didi's dominance in China, industry analysts say.
""There is certainly room for others to serve the market, and such incidents expose an apparent weakness in Didi's business model: aggressive expansion without adequate control of the integrity of the drivers on their platform,"" said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd.
Didi founder Cheng Wei and President Jean Liu issued a lengthy and deeply apologetic letter late on Tuesday, saying ""our vanity overtook our original beliefs."" It was a humbling move for a Chinese company celebrated as a homegrown ""unicorn"" in state media.
The company controls 90 percent of the Chinese ride share market, according to a Bain report in May. Didi says it makes 10 billion trips a year. 
Valued at $56 billion in a fundraising round last year, Didi is trying to expand globally and is considering a giant initial public offering as early as next year. It bought rival Uber's China business in 2016.
But now it may need to tap the brakes. This week, regulators in major cities, including Beijing, Chongqing, Dongguan, Guangzhou and Shanghai, ordered company officials to suspend drivers without proper operating licenses and stop new registrations for unqualified drivers, government statements and local media said. 
Tougher safety measures and driver screenings are likely, analysts said. Already, Didi says it rejects tens of thousands of unqualified driver applications every day.
Didi had already faced mounting public frustration over waiting times and concerns that it had not done enough after the May killing. Drivers complained that working for the company had become less lucrative.
In a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday, the company said it would ""do everything we can technologically and institutionally to prevent crime,"" adding that it uses technology to improve efficiency. 
It added that based on an eight-hour day, its drivers made 6,000 to 7,000 yuan ($873-$1,018) per month, roughly three times the 2,120 yuan minimum wage in Beijing.
In 2016, the official Beijing Youth Daily newspaper reported that drivers earned more than 10,000 yuan per month at the height of the subsidy war between Didi and Uber, which made them popular employers at the time. 
There are more than 80 businesses with licenses to operate in what the Bain report said is a $30 billion Chinese ride-hailing sector, which includes Tencent-backed (HK:0700) Meituan Dianping, CAR Inc and Geely Holding Group's CaoCao Car.
Meituan and five other companies either declined to comment or did not respond. CaoCao Car said in a statement it only hired full-time drivers and used no privately owned cars. 
Signs were already emerging last year that hailing a ride with Didi was getting harder. In June 2017, average driver response rates fell 13 to 40 percent in some densely populated areas across China's largest cities compared with a year earlier, according to data Didi sent to Reuters in January.
Didi declined to provide updated numbers, or data on wait times. However, domestic media reports this year include complaints over long wait times.
Li Qiangzhi of the state-backed China Academy of Information and Communications Technology told the China News Service this month that between March and July the number of ride calls accepted by all Beijing ride-hailing service drivers fell 22 percent, while the time to respond to a call was 3.4 times longer on average. 
REGULATORY BACKLASH
Didi's popularity in China has amplified the outcry and passenger frustrations.
In China, the number of rides per day on Didi's platform rose to 20 million from 14 million after its deal with Uber in 2016. 
That year, the government imposed stricter regulations, such as a rule in some places requiring drivers to have a permit to work and live in the city where they drive, which excludes the large pool of migrant workers. 
Didi said Wednesday it supports 30 million drivers, and rides have surged to over 30 million a day. 
The sudden regulatory scrutiny in the five days since the killing could signal a shift for Didi and the industry. 
""Chinese technology companies have a culture of moving fast and breaking things, and while Didi got a free pass from the regulator for the first incident ... it is unlikely to get off scot-free the second time,"" Richard Windsor, a technology analyst, wrote on his Radio Free Mobile blog. 
Transport officials in Dongguan, in southern China, told Didi that it had far more drivers operating in the city than the total number of ride-hailing drivers registered there, The Paper, an online news site, reported. 
""There are still a large number of drivers and vehicles that do not have the regulatory qualification to operate,"" it cited Dongguan transport officials as saying. 
DRIVER GRUMBLING
Didi is also contending with dissatisfaction among drivers, with at least eight strikes in different cities across China in the past year, local media have reported. 
Some of the strikes protested how much Didi collects from drivers, while others were over fines drivers had to pay after regulatory changes, the reports said. 
Like passengers, drivers have other companies to choose from.
Four Didi drivers in Beijing told Reuters the company had in recent months persuaded them to obtain a certificate to register their cars as vehicles used for ride-hailing, an unpopular step. 
""If we register our car, the car is forced to be scrapped after eight years. No one actually wants to get a certificate,"" said one, surnamed Zhang. 
Those four, as well as three other current or former Didi drivers, said they were frustrated with Didi's cancellation of subsidies after the deal with Uber.
Even changes such as stricter dress standards for drivers in its premier service made life harder, they said. 

""Last week, some people complained that my car is smelly. Didi then lowered my rate and cut 600 yuan ($87) out of my earnings. That means I did one week for nothing,"" said one Beijing driver, surnamed Yang.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>","Australia's TPG Telecom, Vodafone unite to take on rivals","By Tom Westbrook
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's  TPG Telecom Ltd  (AX:TPM) agreed a merger with  Vodafone  Group's (L:VOD) Australian business on Wednesday, easing competition in the cut-throat sector and buying scale to take on bigger rivals Telstra Corp Ltd (AX:TLS) and Optus.
It combines Australia's third- and fourth-largest telecom firms into a larger third player holding TPG's fiber network and Vodafone's mobile system, sending shares on both sides of the deal soaring.
The tie-up, to be called TPG, comes as Australia's telco sector faces upheaval from the rollout of a government-owned broadband wholesaler, which has dented internet profitability and driven intense price competition in the mobile market.
""When you combine the fixed and mobile assets, the new TPG would be in a proper position to deal with Optus ... and a full-fleged telecom operation,"" Bernstein analyst Samuel Chen told Reuters by phone.
It would also represent a ""last chance"" for Vodafone, which has struggled with network reliability issues since entering Australia in 1993, to make a serious bid for market share, he added. 
The complex transaction hands TPG shareholders 49.9 percent of a new entity, which the companies say will have an implied enterprise value of A$15 billion ($11 billion). The rest is split evenly between Vodafone's two Australian owners, Vodafone Group and Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) (AX:HTA). 
Shares in TPG jumped 15 percent to a near two-year high in early trade, while tightly-held Hutchison shares soared 48 percent to their highest price in 11 years. Telstra stock rose 2.5 percent and the broader market (AXJO) rose 0.2 percent. 
The companies promised synergies without quantifying them and said they would prepare a joint bid to buy 5G spectrum at a government auction in November.
""This merger creates the size, scale and financial strength for us to compete with the incumbents,"" TPG Chief Executive Officer David Teoh told investors on a conference call.
Vodafone Hutchison Australia Chief Executive Officer Inaki Berroeta said: ""We do mobile, they do fixed ... ultimately this combination is around synergies in the technology.""
Vodafone Group, Teoh and Hutchison would retain their holdings in the new company for at least two years, Vodafone said.
Berroeta would run the new company with Teoh as chairman, TPG Telecom and Vodafone Hutchison Australia said in a joint statement. 
TPG's board unanimously backed the merger, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and the companies said they hoped to complete it next year.

As part of the deal, TPG said it also would spin out its Singapore mobile business, separating it from the new merged company.

1024,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>",Emerging-Market Wobbles to Test Whether Asia Really Is Safer,"(Bloomberg) -- While Asia proved to be relatively stable through the Turkey-led emerging market sell-off this month, the region has its own vulnerabilities with the junk-bond market shaping up as a key area to watch.
The amount of such debt coming due in dollars from Asian issuers, excluding financial firms, will rise over the next three years to a record $24.2 billion in 2021. With global investors eyeing higher U.S. interest rates as the Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs, Asia’s riskier companies will face pressure to offer juicier yields to lock in fresh funding.
Risks across the region vary from heavy debt piles in China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore to current account deficits in Indonesia, India and the Philippines.
Junk bonds are just one of a number of vulnerabilities investors will need to watch out for as the prospect of further interest-rate increases in the U.S. and the end of quantitative easing in Europe draw curtains on an era of easy money. Here are some others:
Under Water
Jitters have spread beyond junk securities to high-grade Asian corporate notes. The average price for investment-grade dollar notes in the region has stayed below 100 cents on the dollar since early April, an ICE BofAML index shows -- that’s a longer period below par than stretches that preceded debt-market pain during financial crises in 1997 and 2008 and the 2013 Taper Tantrum.
Credit Stress
Another worry stems from the sheer volume of debt in Asia’s developing economies.
""We believe the bigger vulnerability for Asia in coming months stems from domestic credit stress and evaporating market liquidity -- not balance of payments or currency pressures -- and the economies most exposed are China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia,"" Robert Subbaraman, Singapore-based head of emerging markets economics at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note earlier this month.
Household Debt
Consumers are also racking up the bills, with South Korea most at risk of seeing budget-busting households fall underwater.
Sovereign Debt
Governments have run up their tabs, too. Much of developing Asia is attempting to tackle ambitious infrastructure plans -- billions of dollars’ worth of road and rail to connect rural areas with thriving urban centers. While credit ratings firms have generally been supportive, balance sheet strains are starting to show.
In Southeast Asia, the Philippines remains in the cross hairs with President Rodrigo Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” program applying pressure on the peso, which is down more than 6 percent this year against the dollar. Indonesia has just pledged a record spending year for 2019 while claiming that higher revenue will shrink the swollen budget deficit.
Trade Tensions
Bigger bills aren’t the only concern. Simmering trade tensions between the U.S. and China are also a threat for smaller export-oriented economies including South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia, along with financial hubs Singapore and Hong Kong.
A protracted trade war between the U.S. and China would reverberate. Fluctuations in China’s economy or financial markets now have up to three times the impact around Asia than they did before the global financial crisis, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Singapore and Hong Kong also play key trade hub roles that leave them exposed to the trade-war jitters.
Current Accounts
Asia’s current-account positions are broadly in strong shape, but there are weak links. India, Indonesia and the Philippines are the three deficit nations feeling the most strain from the emerging-market sell-off. While their domestic conditions vary and their deficits remain relatively narrow, they face more Fed interest-rate hikes, a brewing trade war and enduring emerging-market anxieties.
Foreign Exposure
Indonesia has a particular need to calm investors, given that the proportion of its stocks and bonds held by foreign investors is higher than peers in the region. As a rule of thumb, the more foreign ownership, the more vulnerability to a reversal in market sentiment.
Even if Asia does indeed boast better growth prospects and beefier buffers, its hefty weighting in many emerging-market benchmarks leaves it exposed to a broader sell-off.
""Since Asia takes up 75 percent of the MSCI emerging market index, if people sell EM, they are going to naturally sell some Asia along with that -- whether or not they actually feel negative about Asia per se,"" Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg Television recently.

Canada rejoined the NAFTA negotiations on Thursday after U.S. and Mexico announced a bilateral trade deal earlier this week.
Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the talks with the U.S. were at a “very intense moment” and that she is looking for compromises that were “win-win” for both sides.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed Canada “very much want to make the deal.”
“They want to be part of the deal,” Trump said of Canada. “We gave until Friday and I think we are probably on track. We’ll see what happens,” he told reporters at the White House, adding that “it probably won’t be good at all if they don’t.”
“Our officials are meeting now and will be meeting until very late tonight. Possibly they’ll be meeting all night long,” Freeland told reporters after a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. “This is a very intense moment in the negotiations and we’re trying to get a lot of things done very quickly.”
In Asia, the Shanghai Composite and the SZSE Component were 0.4% and 0.5% lower by 10:00PM ET (02:00 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were also down 0.3%.
""Recent NAFTA negotiations have helped clear some of the uncertainty the markets had been feeling, leading to hopes U.S.-China trade tensions will take a turn for the better,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.2% after data from the Ministry of Economy showed the country’s retail sales rose 1.5% in July from a year earlier, compared to the general consensus of a 1.2% increase.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",Chinese property developers opt to 'wait and see' as failed land auctions climb,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Last year China's more aggressive property developers were willing to pay whatever it took to secure land banks, but today China is seeing a surge in failed land auctions.
The trend has been especially noticeable in bigger cities since July as developers face reduced liquidity and thinning margins due to a prolonged tightening of government policy and a weaker macroeconomic environment.
On a single day this month, Jinan, a second-tier city in China's northeastern Shandong province, saw eight plots of land go unsold at auction, 10 parcels change hands at the reserve price and one plot sold for a premium of less than 4 percent.
Three days earlier on August 10, the second-tier city of Taiyuan in northern Shanxi province aborted eight auctions in what was expected to be its largest land sale in years, as bidding prices for two parcels failed to meet the minimum requirement and there were no bids for the other plots.
These were not isolated incidents.
The number of failed land auctions more than doubled in the first seven months of this year to 796 from a year earlier, according to realtor Centaline, with major cities recording the highest number since 2015, and smaller cities posting a record.
Research from Chinese investment bank CICC showed the proportion of failed auctions climbed to 9.4 percent in the first three weeks of August, compared to 7.3 percent over the whole of July.
""It shows that the land market is regaining its senses, but for sure it doesn't signal a depression because many corporates are still willing to buy land, just that they're faced with many limitations,"" said Yan Yuejin, a research director at real estate services company E-House China (HK:2048).
Yan added that the number of failed auctions also illustrated a gap between market demand and local governments' sale conditions and prices - which are set at bull market levels.
Despite the spike in the number of failed land auctions, property investment growth accelerated in July at its quickest pace in nearly two years, official data showed, and as local governments sold more land to tame property prices, giving developers more choice.
Some analysts say land sales data may not be up to date because of a lag between when transactions are completed and local governments record receiving the funds.
""China's economic data is artificial and doesn't give real references; the number of failed auctions tells you about the real market sentiment,"" said a chief financial officer of a major developer who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""The major cause is the bleak market outlook shared among the industry,"" he said, a far cry from the days of ""land king"" developers willing to splash out vast sums.
Developers said local government regulations put in place early last year, including effectively capping the initial sale price of new homes and a requirement to build housing to rent rather than sell, was threatening their cashflow and margins.
""Another developer bought a land parcel in Xiamen last year for 38,000 yuan per square meter. We bought one this year for only 25,000, said a finance officer at a Shenzhen-based developer, who declined to identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
""It's important not to buy at a high premium so we can keep the gearing and margins,"" said the officer. ""Failed auctions in July definitely hurt sentiment, and because of the trade tension between China and the United States, we stopped buying land in April. We will wait and see until October,"" he added, pointing to uncertainties in the macro-economic environment that could further dampen China's economic growth, and hence the property market.
Many major developers including state-owned China Overseas Land & Investment (HK:0688) and CIFI Holdings (HK:0884) have also slowed their land purchases, but are ready to get back into the market if they see bargains in the second half.
For that reason, economists and developers said land purchases could tick up in the fourth quarter.
""After the drop in bidder number and land premium, there should be (buying) opportunities in the second half,"" China Overseas Land chairman and CEO Yan Jianguo told an earnings conference last week.
CIFI chairman Lin Zhong said while he expected to buy less land in the second half, he forecast a larger portion would come from public auctions, rather than acquisitions in the secondary market, a trend that developers had increasingly adopted over the past two years as small players ran into liquidity issues and sold land.

""Some primary land prices have become more rational than secondary land,"" he said.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Korea detente revives North Korean leader's bullet train dreams,"By Ju-min Park and Jane Chung
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's ruling family has long dreamed of a state-of-the-art rail system linking its major cities with each other and the wider world. 
Now, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is looking to capitalize on an easing in international tensions with his isolated regime to advance plans for a high-speed rail network to rival those in Europe and neighboring South Korea.
Kim has instructed officials to seek partnerships with countries such as South Korea and France, according to a South Korean broker with knowledge of the matter and a senior North Korean diplomat.
Engineers and consultants in South Korea say they are also drawing up plans for possible rail projects with the North.
Both Koreas see new railways as a key that could unlock regional trade and tourism, connecting the Korean peninsula with Russia, China and beyond.
The prospect has boosted shares in Hyundai Rotem (KS:064350) and other South Korean train and rail companies since the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade in April.
But plans face numerous hurdles, not least wide-ranging sanctions on doing business in North Korea over its pursuit of nuclear weapons in defiance of the United Nations, and the country's unstable electricity infrastructure.
Officials in both Koreas hope rail projects might be exempt from U.N. sanctions under a provision allowing some ""non-commercial public utility infrastructure"". 
FRENCH CONNECTION 
A senior North Korean diplomat told the French senate in June the country would like to partner with France on railway construction, specifically naming  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), the maker of the iconic TGV bullet train, and French national railway operator SNCF, as potential partners.
""There are subjects and fields that aren’t impacted by sanctions,"" said Kim Yong Il, North Korea's chief delegate at UNESCO in Paris, according to a previously unreported transcript of his remarks.
South Korea adopted Alstom's technology for its KTX bullet trains introduced in 2004. The system is about six times faster than the North's aging rail networks. 
But it's far from clear how infrastructure would be defined under the United Nations sanctions, and the French rail operators told Reuters they had no plans to team up with North Korea.
""Given the international context surrounding North Korea, such cooperation is not conceivable, which is what SNCF communicated,"" a spokeswoman said.
Alstom said it does not ""maintain contact or discussions with any of the country's representatives"".
The Dutch mission at the United Nations, which chairs the sanctions committee on North Korea, did not have immediate comment, while the North Korea mission did not return calls for comment.
LONG-HELD DREAM FOR KIM
A month before his death in 1994, Kim's grandfather and founding leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, said a railway connecting two Koreas, China and Russia could generate North Korea $1.5 billion annually from transporting commodities.
Kim Jong Un publicly expressed admiration for South Korea's railways during a summit in April. Kim told South Korean President Moon Jae-in that his sister and delegation were in awe of South Korea's bullet trains, which they traveled in to get to the Pyeongchang Olympics in February.
In May, foreign journalists took 12 hours to travel roughly 415 km (258 miles) by train to watch the demolition of North Korea's nuclear test site in Punggye-ri, averaging just 35 km/h. The same distance would take about 2.5 hours by South Korea's KTX.
A bullet train system in North Korea could take at least five years to build and cost up to $20 billion, according to experts and railway executives. 
Seoul and Pyongyang have discussed trans-Korean rail networks since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000. 
A December 2015 North Korean investment brochure, seen by Reuters, says Pyongyang aims to build an ""international rapid transit railway"" to promote its special economic zone in the western city of Sinuiju bordering China.
The plan included converting some of the rail line to the capital into a ""high-speed railway system,"" according to the brochure.
In a statement carried by state media in 2015, Kim said a high-speed railway should be built between Pyongyang and a new international airport near the capital.
Kim also has more ambitious plans to build a high-speed railway linking Pyongyang to South Korea and China, a South Korean businessman said, citing North Korean officials charged with economic development. 
""Kim is eyeing foreign currency earnings from ticket sales, and officials are pursuing a multinational consortium under his instruction,"" said the businessman, who asked not to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. 
RISKY, BUT POTENTIAL MONEY-SPINNER
Seoul, too, has seen potential benefits from such a tie-up. In 2015, a state-run railway association estimated trans-Korean railways linking the peninsula to China and Russia could halve the time to transport freight, and generate substantial transit fees for the South.
""In the past, the inter-Korean rail project was simply linking disconnected lines but now it's about working on practical ways to modernize rails, operate them and create economic value,"" Ahn Byung-min, a member of the South Korea's presidential committee on economic cooperation with the North, told Reuters.
But a bullet train for the North has not been discussed in early talks with Pyongyang, Ahn said.
""Realistically, it will only come up later on the agenda because it involves a lot of money and complicated logistics.""
South Korea is budgeting 504 billion won ($450 million) next year for cross-border economic projects such as the modernization of North Korea's roads and railways, up 46 percent from this year. It did not provide a breakdown for railways.
Seol Young-man, chief executive of Korea Engineering & Construction, told Reuters his firm is working on a high-speed railway and highway pitch for the South Korean government.
""We have to be prepared and ready to take initiative in competing against China and Russia in rebuilding North Korea's rails and working with Kim Jong Un on economic cooperation,"" Seol said.
A joint Chinese project to build hydro power stations in North Korea's border region, as well as Russia's rail project to transport Russian coal to a North Korean port have both received U.N. sanction exemptions.
But many risks remain in doing business with North Korea, including its secrecy and chronic power shortages, said Lee Chul, former president of South Korea's state-run railroad operator.

""For railroad cooperation between South and North Korea, we thought it would be really good to understand the North's railroad conditions,"" said Lee, who met North Korean officials in 2006 to discuss restoring inter-Korean railways. ""But North Korea considered it almost like military secrets and wouldn't let us see.""

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online army of skeptics and amateur sleuths that has spent years promoting bets against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc senses an opportunity to renew pressure on the electric carmaker after the failure of Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to take it private.
A go-private deal at $420 a share announced by Musk in an Aug. 7 tweet would have wiped out short bets against Tesla and hidden the company's financials from the public eye. 
But Musk's abrupt Friday announcement that he was dropping his plan and media reports of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into his tweets have galvanized Tesla bears.
""It's such a ridiculous situation,"" said Brodie Ferguson, a 25-year-old Canadian whose interest in Tesla stems from watching videos about Musk's other engineering ventures.
""It's ... energized our skepticism,"" Ferguson, who said he has a bearish options position on Tesla shares, told Reuters via Twitter. 
Ferguson is only one of thousands of Tesla bears who use Twitter to crowdsource financial data, photos, satellite imagery and video footage of Tesla facilities to shed light on the company's production and sales figures to support their view that the stock is overvalued.
A spokesman for Tesla declined to comment on short-sellers, who are often dubbed ""haters"" by Musk's supporters on Twitter.
Unlike Wall Street's most famous short-sellers such as Jim Chanos and David Einhorn, this community is mostly retail investors and hobbyist shoe-leather investigators who coalesce around Twitter feeds like @TeslaCharts and $TSLAQ FinTwit.
“A lot of the people in this bear community for Tesla are just ordinary folks,"" said @Latrilife, a Twitter user and small business owner who said he has a bearish options position.
@Latrilife, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters he started to scrutinize Tesla's car production, distribution and sales after Musk refused to answer analysts' questions about profit potential and capital requirements on a conference call earlier this year. Musk later apologized.
To keep tabs on Tesla inventory, @Latrilife monitors California lots where he said Tesla cars are kept before being shipped to distribution centers and posts the footage on Twitter.
Tesla has said it has various lots in California where it keeps cars before delivering them to distribution outlets.
Others use drones to gather footage of Tesla production facilities, scour Tesla's financial filings and pore over Musk's statements for inconsistencies.
Musk's Aug. 7 tweet that he had ""funding secured"" for the deal and a subsequent New York Times interview in which he described his critics as ""smartish"" sparked a frenzy of online lampoons of the 47-year-old billionaire CEO.
Short-sellers said all eyes will now be on mounting litigation against Tesla, the progress of the SEC probe, and Tesla's cash flow and debt. 
East Coast-based small business owner Paul Shust, who told Reuters he uses information posted on $TSLAQ FinTwit and has an options bets against Tesla, said he was so upset by Musk's Aug. 7 tweet that he wrote to SEC Commissioner Kara Stein that day, according to an email seen by Reuters.
Stein's office did not respond to a request for comment. The SEC has not commented on Musk's tweets.
Loss-making Tesla told investors earlier this month that it expects to show a profit in the third and fourth quarters and has reiterated that it does not plan to seek new capital from shareholders, something Wall Street analysts have questioned.
NO SHORT SQUEEZE
Wall Street is broadly divided on Tesla. Of 27 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 have hold ratings on the stock, nine recommend buying and eight recommend selling. 
Tesla is the most short-sold stock in the United States, with investors betting around $10.18 billion that the company's shares will fall, according to financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners. 
Short-sellers borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference.
Musk has mocked short-sellers and called some of their allegations lies, while also saying their hostility has taken a toll on him and the company.
""The biggest risk short-sellers pose to Elon and the stock price is putting information out there,"" said Paul Huettner, who works for a Chicago-based advisory firm and said he took out options betting against Tesla after it missed its Model 3 production targets last year.
He focuses on crowdsourcing information on departures of Tesla executives and litigation relating to the company. 
""No short-seller is preventing Elon from building cars,"" Huettner added.
Short-sellers are not alone in scrutinizing Tesla. Analysts at Switzerland's UBS hired engineers to pull apart a Tesla Model 3 to understand its production costs. The bank currently has a ""sell"" rating on the stock. 

While Tesla shares spiked the day of Musk's Aug. 7 tweet, they have since fallen around 9 percent as concerns grow over Musk's leadership. The dip has generated more than $942 million in paper profits for short-sellers, according to S3 Partners.

(Reuters) - Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) forecast current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Wednesday, as the cloud-software maker invests heavily to boost sales and fend off rising competition.
San Francisco-based Salesforce has been reaping the benefits of a trend of companies increasingly turning to cloud-based services, but faces stiff competition from Microsoft's Dynamics 365, which competes with Salesforce's flagship Sales Cloud offering, and from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). 
Asked about the company’s forecast for the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins highlighted the company’s $21 billion in remaining performance obligation, which represents future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized. That figure was up 36 percent year-to-year. 
“Wall Street can focus on Wall Street,” Hawkins told Reuters on a call Wednesday afternoon. “What we focus on is strong economics.” 
The company forecast third-quarter profit between 49 cents and 50 cents per share, and revenue of $3.36 billion to $3.37 billion.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 54 cents and revenue of $3.35 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The company's shares fell more than 3 percent in trading after the bell. 
""Investors want to see two things: more growth and how they are going to handle increased competition,"" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments, an investment advisory service. 
Salesforce has been boosting its research and development expenditures, as well as marketing and sales, increasing its operating expenses 27 percent to $2.32 billion in the second quarter.
Revenue from its flagship product, Sales Cloud, rose 12.7 percent to $1 billion, a record for a quarter.
The company's unearned revenue, a key metric used to measure future business for subscription-based software vendors, rose 24 percent to $5.88 billion. Analysts on average expected $5.91 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.
Salesforce posted revenue of $3.28 billion for the second quarter, up 27 percent from $2.58 billion a year ago. That beat analysts’ estimates of $3.23 billion.
Salesforce accounted for about 20 percent of the 2017 global customer relationship management software market, up from 18.1 percent in 2016, according to research firm IDC. 
Oracle is the company's closest rival with 7.1 percent while Germany's SAP is next with 6.5 percent. 
Microsoft's Dynamics enterprise software is also emerging as a major competitor after nearly tripling its market share to 4 percent in 2017.
""We're in an enviable position right now as the market leader,” said Keith Block, the company's long-time chief operating officer who was named co-CEO earlier this month.
Net income rose to $299 million, or 39 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, from $46 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 47 cents per share.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unit of European lender  Banco Santander  SA (MC:SAN) has agreed to settle claims by a U.S. consumer watchdog that it misled drivers about the costs of loans and the coverage of related insurance policies, said three people with direct knowledge of the settlement. 
 Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc  (N:SC), an affiliate of the Spanish banking group, allowed borrowers to make interest-only monthly payments without explaining that doing so would increase the total cost of the loan, the people familiar with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) sanction said this week. 
The lender also failed to explain to customers how an insurance policy known as ""guaranteed auto protection"" (GAP) would not always cover the costs of replacing a car that was destroyed in an accident.
Santander Consumer has agreed to pay a fine and strengthen its consumer protections, said the sources. Reuters could not ascertain the size of the fine.
A spokeswoman for Santander Consumer declined to comment on any possible settlement but said the lender has in recent months improved its consumer protection controls. A spokesman for the CFPB said the agency does not comment on enforcement actions.
Santander Consumer stopped offering its own GAP insurance product last year and the lender regularly reviews its disclosures to consumers, said spokeswoman Raschelle Burton.
The CFPB settlement, which could be announced as soon as on Wednesday, closes an investigation begun more than a year ago by Richard Cordray, the Obama-era CFPB chief who had been poised to sue the bank, Reuters reported last year. 
Mick Mulvaney, U.S. President Donald Trump's budget chief who has served as the head of the CFPB since November, continued with the probe and ultimately decided to settle, the sources said. 
SUBPRIME BORROWERS
Santander Consumer is a leading provider of high-cost auto finance loans to low credit or ""subprime"" borrowers.
More than 70 percent of its customers are subprime borrowers who typically pay double-digit interest rates for car-buying credit, according to U.S. regulatory filings and research from credit rating agency Experian.
Drivers could lower their monthly payments by about 40 percent under Santander's Temporary Reduction in Payment Plan (TRIPP), which allowed them to pay interest only for a time. But the CFPB found that the lender did not explain how interest-only payments would actually expand the life and cost of the loan. 
The lender marketed the product aggressively, the CFPB found, leading more than 10 percent of Santander borrowers to tap the program within a year of a car purchase, according to a Santander investor presentation.
Many borrowers who turned to Santander Consumer for GAP insurance were surprised to find that there was a cap to the total amount of coverage, the CFPB also found.
Americans are borrowing more to buy a car and taking longer to pay back that loan, according to credit bureau Experian.
The total amount of auto debt outstanding has increased 53 percent in the last five years to $1.24 trillion, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with much of that packaged up as asset-backed securities.

The FAANG group of momentum stocks also got a boost from Morgan Stanley's price target increases for Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL). 
Amazon's stock gained 3.4 percent, leading the consumer discretionary sector's (SPLRCD) advance, as the company edged closer to becoming the second U.S. company, after Apple, to reach $1 trillion in market value.
The remaining FAANG stocks,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), closed slightly lower. 
Canada appeared to be taking a more conciliatory approach to its ongoing talks with the United States aimed at salvaging the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), days after Washington said it had struck a deal with Mexico.
""The trade situation is adding to the rally as opposed to being a headwind as it's been for the past couple of months,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
As the summer nears its end, light trading volume that sometimes plagues the market seems to have worked in its favor.
""Historically, light volume in August has generally contributed to a weak month in terms of performance,"" Hellwig said. ""But favorable fundamentals in the last couple of weeks have reversed that pattern."" 
Among the economic fundamentals, the Commerce Department released its second reading of second-quarter GDP, showing the U.S. economy grew at an upwardly-revised annual rate of 4.2 percent in the quarter, its best performance in nearly four years. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 60.55 points, or 0.23 percent, to 26,124.57, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.52 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,914.04 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 79.65 points, or 0.99 percent, to 8,109.69.
Eight of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory, with the largest percentage gains coming from the consumer discretionary and technology (SPLRCT) sectors.
Restaurant operator  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) extended its rally, and was up 5.5 percent after rejecting a $17.6 billion buy-out bid from a Chinese consortium.
Among losers, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (N:DKS) fell 2.2 percent following an underwhelming earnings report, a drop in same-store sales driven by tighter gun controls and a decline in  Under Armour  (N:UAA) sales. 
Shares of  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) dropped 6.5 percent after posting disappointing second quarter results and providing a lackluster forecast.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 61 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 24 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.63 billion shares, compared to the 6.12 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1038,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 04:48PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Gets Its Favorite Number
The Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation will likely be the most-anticipated economic number out before the bell tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Personal consumption and expenditures, excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index, is expected to have risen by 0.2% in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June. Year on year, economists forecast a 2% rise.
The core PCE price index is widely regarded as the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. If it comes in hotter than expected, it could raise expectations for an interest-rate hike in December.
Traders are already pricing in a 100% chance of a rate rise in September. The core PCE price index is released as part of the personal income and spending numbers. Both are expected to have risen in July, month on month.
Weekly initial jobless claims numbers come at the same time, with economists predicting a small rise from the previous week.
2.  Campbell Soup  Starting the Fight of the Fall?
Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) reports earnings tomorrow, but more importantly it will also report on the results of its strategic review.
Activist investor Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, wants the company to put itself up for sale. But that’s not what the company plans to announce, according to a report in the New York Post.
That could set the stage for a proxy battle for the fate of the company that analysts are calling the “fight of the fall,” according to Reuters.
Shares sank yesterday after the Post report, but finished today higher.
For those investors keeping score at home, the company is expected to earn 24 cents per share for the most recent quarter, on sales of $2.25 billion.
3. Dollar Stores Release Results
Elsewhere on the earnings calendar are more numbers from the retail sector.
Rival discount stores Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG) both weigh in before the bell.
Those numbers will give investors an idea of how the low-cost retail segment is performing in an economy running at a 4.2% pace of growth with very high levels of consumer confidence.
Analysts expect Dollar Tree to post a profit of $1.16 per share on sales of about $5.5 billion. The company has missed earnings estimates the last two quarters. Dollar General is forecast to post a profit of $1.49 per share on sales of about $6.4 billion.
Over the last three months, Dollar General shares have been the clear winner, rising about 11%. Shares of Dollar Tree are down slightly over the same time period.
Also reporting earnings are Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) and Michaels Stores (NASDAQ:MIK)."
1039,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 04:34PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Closes Above 2,900 for First Time on Tech, Trade Optimism","Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed above 2,900 for the first time Wednesday on optimism over U.S-Canada talks and soaring tech stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.23%. The S&P 500 rose 0.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.99%.
Fresh from successfully clinching a bilateral agreement with Mexico earlier this week, the United States appears to be inching tentatively closer toward a further trade agreement, this time with Canada.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that it may be possible to reach a compromise on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ahead of President Donald Trump's Friday deadline, but tempered expectations somewhat, claiming the deal had to be ""right"" for Canada.
Earlier Wednesday, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland also expressed optimism, although conceded that a ""huge amount"" of work was needed to resolve issues.
Canada is eager for any revamp of NAFTA to preserve the existing dispute-resolution systems, NAFTA’s Chapter 19. The provision allows a NAFTA member's appeal to be heard by an independent third party made up of trade experts from both disputing countries.
Canada sees Chapter 19 as a vital tool to protect its businesses from the threat of U.S. tariffs. The U.S., meanwhile, has demanded that Canada open up its protected dairy industry.
In a sign of optimism over a potential U.S.-Canada deal, dairy-sensitive names rose. Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) ended the day up 1.75%.
Also supporting the record-setting day for the broader averages was a rally in tech stocks, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as both were boosted by upbeat research notes from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Amazon was also helped by reports the e-commerce giant plans to launch its own ad-supported over-the-top (OTT) streaming service that offers free content to viewers, rivalling a similar service offered by  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU).
Energy stocks, meanwhile, pushed the broader market higher as oil prices settled at three-week highs after U.S. crude inventories fell more-than-expected and Iranian crude exports dropped.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery gained 1.4% to settle at $69.51 a barrel.
Adding to the upside momentum was upbeat U.S. economic data, reaffirming the economy remains on solid footing.
Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2% annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said Wednesday in its penultimate estimate, beating economists' forecast of 4.0% and ahead of the preliminary reading of 4.1% seen last month.
On the corporate earnings front, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock slumped after comparable sales and revenue fell short of expectations.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) stock closed flat despite the company’s fiscal third-quarter results beating on both the top and bottom lines. While Box (NYSE:BOX) stock sank 11% as the company forecast a wider-than-expected loss per share for the third quarter.

 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) and Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",Sinclair countersues Tribune Media over failed tie-up,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (O:SBGI) on Wednesday filed a counterclaim to a lawsuit by  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO) seeking $1 billion for what Tribune said was a breach of contract over a proposed merger.
Tribune terminated its $3.9 billion sale to Sinclair on Aug. 9 and filed a lawsuit, saying the rival TV-station owner mishandled efforts to get the transaction approved by taking too long and being too aggressive in its dealings with regulators.
In its counterclaim in Delaware Court of Chancery, Sinclair rejected Tribune's allegations and suggested the companies had been very close to winning U.S. Department of Justice approval. The deal was scuttled when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took the unusual step of referring it to an administrative judge for review and questioned Sinclair's candor over the planned sale of some stations.
Sinclair's lawsuit said Tribune had pursued a ""deliberate effort to exploit and capitalize on an unfavorable and unexpected reaction from the FCC to capture a windfall for Tribune.""
Tribune said Sinclair's counterclaim ""is entirely meritless and simply an attempt to distract from its own significant legal exposure resulting from its persistent violations of Tribune’s contractual rights."" 
Sinclair Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley said in a statement the company ""fully complied with our obligations under the merger agreement and worked tirelessly to close the transaction. The company looks forward to vigorously defending against Tribune's claims and pursuing our own claim.""
Sinclair announced in May 2017 that it had agreed to buy Tribune's 42 television stations in 33 U.S. markets and cable network WGN America, a move that would allow it to reach about 70 percent of U.S. households.
Sinclair said FCC chairman Ajit Pai raising ""serious concerns"" about the deal in July was ""a stunning and wholly unexpected announcement.""
Pai told the FCC inspector general in a report released on Monday that he called Sinclair's general counsel the following day to provide the company an opportunity to withdraw the merger application before it was referred for a hearing.
Sinclair said Tribune had omitted ""an inconvenient truth"" - that the companies reached an agreement-in-principle with the Justice Department in mid-July and were on track to get approval before an Aug. 8 deadline.

Sinclair also said it had told Tribune it would agree to extend the merger agreement by three months and later suggested an additional six months to try to obtain FCC consent, but did not win agreement from Tribune.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","EPA should revoke Monsanto weed killer approval, groups tell U.S. court","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Environmental groups argued in federal appeals court on Wednesday the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency failed to analyze the risks  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) Monsanto's dicamba-based weed killer posed to nearby crops before approving it in 2016.
The groups, which filed a lawsuit in February, want the court to force the EPA to vacate its approval of XtendiMax, arguing it not only harms nearby crops and plants but wildlife as well. It is not clear whether the court has the authority to revoke an EPA approval.
The United States has faced a weed-killer crisis caused by the new formulations of dicamba-based herbicides, which farmers and weed experts say have harmed crops because they evaporate and drift away from where they are applied.
""The EPA's declaration that XtendiMax would have no effect on plants and animals was arbitrary and capricious,"" Paul Achitoff, a lawyer for non-profit Earthjustice told a three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle during a hearing.
The arguments come at a critical time for  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) and other agrochemical companies that developed dicamba-based products, such as BASF SE's (DE:BASFn) Engenia and DowDuPont Inc's (N:DWDP) FeXapan. The EPA is currently deciding whether to renew dicamba's sales license, which expires on Nov. 8, for the next growing season. 
Monsanto, a unit of Bayer, urged the court to dismiss the lawsuit.
Dicamba is used in part to destroy weeds that have become resistant to glyphosate, another herbicide developed by Monsanto. Monsanto denies crop damage was caused by XtendiMax and says drift occurred because farmers illegally applied older dicamba formulations or failed to follow instructions.
Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann during an analyst call last week said his company was in discussions with the EPA about the sales license renewal and expects the agency to decide by October. 
Environmental groups, including the National Family Farm Coalition, Center for Food Safety, Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America, say the EPA failed to conduct its own analysis and instead relied on statements by Monsanto executives and lawyers.
The EPA in 2016 approved new XtendiMax uses for soybean and cotton fields, concluding dicamba would have ""no effect"" on animals or their habitat. 
But U.S. Appeals Court Judge William Fletcher questioned whether the EPA indeed relied on sufficient studies to make its decision.

""After all, you guys turned out to be wrong,"" Fletcher said, referring to the more than 3 million acres, or 4 percent of the U.S. soybean crop, that was destroyed by dicamba drift during the 2017 planting season, according to a university study.

The U.S.-listed $436 million ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, known by its ticker MJ, has taken in about $22 million in August, putting it on track for the largest monthly inflow since February. That asset growth has been fueled by a 35 percent surge in the fund’s price since Aug. 14.
Pot stocks have been soaring amid Canada’s pending legalization of recreational cannabis on Oct. 17 and growing speculation that other industries will buy in. For example, Tilray Inc., a Canadian marijuana pharmaceutical maker, has more than tripled since it started trading on July 18.
A major boost for cannabis shares came two weeks ago, when alcohol giant Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ). invested $3.8 billion in Canadian marijuana maker Canopy Growth Corp., the biggest deal yet in the burgeoning industry. Since the move was announced on Aug. 15, the BI Canada Cannabis Competitive Peers index has gained more than 30 percent, including 3.7 percent Wednesday.
“This reinforces the interest among large consumer companies in partnering with cannabis producers,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea. “It also signifies the confidence that consumer companies have for the continued rise in consumer demand for legal cannabis-infused beverages in Canada, but also eventually in the U.S. and in international markets.”
Last week, BNN Bloomberg TV reported that the global liquor giant  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc is seeking a cannabis partner, raising market speculation over who that may be. Molson Coors Canada Inc. also announced a joint venture with Hydropothecary Corp. to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages.
However, while the U.S.-listed fund is going strong, a Canada-listed counterpart is struggling. The $703 billion Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF, ticker HMMJ, is on track for its biggest month of outflows since it began trading in April 2017, with $6.1 million leaving the fund this month, including $5.1 million on Tuesday alone."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A major global stock index jumped to 5-1/2-month highs on Wednesday as optimism on the potential for U.S. trade deals cleared the path for technology stocks to resume their leadership mantle.
Talks to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) hinge on Canada after Monday's deal between the other parties to that pact, the United States and Mexico. 
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.39 percent (MIWD00000PUS) as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq U.S. stock indexes hit all-time highs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 87.04 points, or 0.33 percent, to 26,151.06, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.96 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,914.48 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 69.34 points, or 0.86 percent, to 8,099.38. 
Aberdeen Standard Investments head of global strategy Andrew Milligan said investor optimism was tinged with caution. He noted there it was hard to predict U.S. trade negotiations which could make markets choppy.
""It is an erratic rally,"" he said. ""We need a bit more fuel to the fire.""
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to proceed with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it did not come on board with revised trade terms. But a trade deal without Canada might not win approval from the U.S. Congress.
""The final decisions are unlikely until 2019 at the earliest,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a note to clients.
Still, familiar leaders from this long bull market run resumed their leadership role, with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) among those lifting Wall Street indexes higher.
The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade concerns, turned negative after early gains. An index of the U.S. currency against several trading partners (DXY) fell 0.12 percent. The Mexican peso  gained 0.44 percent versus the greenback, while the Canadian dollar  rose 0.05 percent.
CHINA TARIFF DEADLINE
Elsewhere in the global trade conflict, a deadline for public comment on Trump's increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods was less than a week away on Sept. 5. The White House has said it wants to settle NAFTA before negotiating with China.
""There's a big debate taking place among investors: is Trump hoping to reach agreement with all the big players to demonstrate what a successful negotiator he is, or is he trying to make sure he's got agreement with NAFTA and the EU and therefore can turn all the firepower on to China?"" said Milligan.
Emerging market stocks (MSCIEF) rose 0.10 percent, but remained under pressure from weakening currencies. An index of those countries' currencies (MIEM00000CUS) fell 0.29 percent in dollar terms.
Turkey's lira  extended losses, down 2.08 percent against the dollar, a two-week low, as concern grew about the effects of the country's currency crisis, and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak was quoted as saying he did not see a risk to the economy.
Dollar-denominated Turkish bank bonds also fell after Moody's sounded the alarm over the sector.
Oil prices rose about 1 percent, supported by a drawdown in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles and news of falling Iranian crude shipments as U.S. sanctions deterred buyers. 

U.S. crude  rose 1.31 percent to $69.43 per barrel and Brent  was last at $77.03, up 1.42 percent on the day.

The Aurus Senat four-seater sedan was presented to reporters as the latest addition to the nascent Cortege range of Russian-made vehicles championed by Putin. The series is also expected to include a minivan, offroad vehicle and motorcycle. 
The limousine, also built under the Aurus brand, had its first public outing in May when Putin used it instead of his usual Mercedes at his inauguration for a new presidential term, sending a patriotic message of Russian self-sufficiency.
Russia has been trying reduce its dependence on imported goods and technology, a drive that has gathered speed since Russia was hit by Western sanctions.
The Aurus series is produced by a Russian research institute known by the acronym NAMI in partnership with Russian carmaker  Sollers  (MM:SVAV).
Industry Minister Denis Manturov, who took part in Wednesday's unveiling, said contracts for commercial orders of Aurus cars would be signed from next month, the RIA news agency reported.
He said about 120 Aurus vehicles would be produced next year, adding that the off-road vehicle was expected to enter serial production by the beginning of 2020, RIA reported. 
Manturov said an electric Aurus motorbike would enter serial production no sooner than 2020. 

The limousine is intended to become the heir to the Russian-made ZIL sedans that for decades transported Soviet leaders.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday as optimism over talks between the United States and Canada reinvigorated risk appetite, though the FTSE came under pressure from a rise in sterling.
The STOXX 600 index (STOXX) ended the session up 0.3 percent. 
The United States and Mexico agreed on Monday to overhaul the NAFTA trade association, while investors waited to see if Canada would accept a revised deal.
Canada and the U.S. are set to tackle their issues in talks on Wednesday.
However, some market watchers were cautious in their expectations, given the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
""The agreement between the U.S. and Mexico has not put worries about President Trump’s trade policy to bed. The deal is more protectionist than the status quo, and Canada is not included,"" economists at Capital Economics said in a note.
""Despite the U.S. compromising a bit with Mexico, we are not holding out much hope of a ceasefire with China any time soon.""
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) came under pressure from a rise in sterling, however, and ended the session down 0.7 percent. 
Comments from the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier that the bloc was prepared to offer Britain an unprecedentedly close relationship after it quits the EU sent the currency higher, in turn weighing on the FTSE 100 and its predominantly dollar-earning constituents.
Among individual stocks, Germany's RTL (DE:RRTL) gained more than 2 percent after reporting forecast-beating growth in second quarter revenues and core earnings.
Shares in Spain's  Inditex  (MC:ITX), however, dropped 5.7 percent after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rated the Zara owner ""underweight"" for the first time.
France's  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) was also under pressure, losing more than 6 percent. One trader cited competition between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the French company on mobile payments in Asia. 
 Micro Focus  (L:MCRO), the British software company, added 2.9 percent after it started a share buy-back program.

Among small caps, Sinclair Pharma (L:SPH) surged around 35 percent after agreeing to an offer from China’s Huadoing.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Big banks win dismissal in U.S. of bond rigging lawsuit,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit by investors that accused nine big banks of rigging the roughly $9 trillion government agency bond market from 2005 to 2015.
In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan said the investors failed to show they were injured by conducting any specific transactions in U.S. dollar-denominated supranational, sub-sovereign and agency bonds that were tainted by the alleged collusion.
Investors led by the Iron Workers Pension Plan of Western Pennsylvania and the Sheet Metal Workers Pension Plan of Northern California said the banks used chatrooms and other means to share pricing data and coordinate trading to boost profit, infecting ""each and every"" transaction.
The defendants included  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  SA (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Credit Agricole  SA (PA:CAGR),  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA), Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604), Royal Bank of Canada (TO:RY) and  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD).
Dan Brockett, a lawyer for the investors, said his clients plan to amend their complaint.
He also said Ramos' decision, which is dated Aug. 24, does not affect  Deutsche Bank  AG's (DE:DBKGn) and Bank of America Corp's (N:BAC) respective $48.5 million and $17 million settlements in the case in August 2017.
Ramos preliminarily approved those settlements in March.
The federal court in Manhattan is home to a wide array of private litigation accusing banks of conspiring to rig various financial markets, interest rate benchmarks and commodities.

The case is In re: SSA Bonds Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-03711.

The S&P Info Tech Sector index was up about 0.88% at 11:45 AM ET (15:45 GMT). The Nasdaq Composite gained about 0.8%, the strongest of the three major indices.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) was on of the biggest gainers in the S&P Info Tech index, rising about 2%.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) kept its overweight rating on the stock and boosted the price target to $2,500 from $1,850, according to several published reports. That would make Amazon worth about $1.2 trillion in market cap.

The facilities in Oslo, Aalesund and Tromsoe were opened in 2015 and 2016 in a global pilot program to test customers' appetite for alternatives to IKEA's large out-of-town stores.
IKEA now plans to cut costs in Norway by some 10 percent to help boost profits, although employees at the three sites being shut were offered jobs at its other stores, the company added.
As part of a three-year program to renew itself, IKEA said it would improve online offerings and shorten delivery times to boost appeal to customers.

Paulo on Wednesday. 
The report said the airline confirmed the firings but would not give an exact number. A LATAM Airlines spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
However, the union representing LATAM employees posted news of the firings on its website on Wednesday, saying employee terminations would become effective next week. A representative for the union said its president was not immediately available for comment. 
LATAM has been struggling in recent years, following a merger with Brazilian airline TAM in 2012 that has yet to boost profits and due to increasing competition in South American markets that has pushed the airline to pursue a low-cost model for its domestic flights.
Regional airlines have also faced rising fuel prices and weakening local currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. 

LATAM posted a net loss of $114 million in its most recent quarter, in line with its biggest competitors in South America. Brazilian airlines  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (SA:GOLL4), as well as Colombia's Avianca Holdings S.A (CN:AVT_p), all posted net losses in the same period.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>","Gun policy, Under Armour weakness hit Dick's Sporting sales","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Dick's Sporting Goods (N:DKS) reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales on Wednesday and forecast further declines this year, hit by tighter gun controls and a drop in  Under Armour  sales.
Shares in the company fell as much as 10 percent after it posted a 1.9 percent drop in same-store sales, bigger than analysts' average estimate of a 0.62 percent dip.
Dick's was one of the first retailers to stop selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines as well as bar the sale of guns to people under age 21 following a massacre at a Florida high school in February.
The company had predicted that its hunting guns business would be pressurized by the change in policy but said the move should also attract more people to its stores.
Dick's said on Wednesday it expected annual same-store sales to decline by 3 percent to 4 percent, compared with a 0.3 percent decline in 2017.
Chief Executive Officer Edward Stack said Under Armour sales fell as a result of the sports apparel maker's decision to expand distribution to a broader range of stores. 
Shares in Under Armour Inc (N:UAA), for whom Dick's 700 stores have played a major role in efforts to challenge Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and  Nike  (N:NKE), fell 6 percent to $19.66.
""We had expected comp weakness in hunting and electronics, as well as continued pressure in Under Armour and less benefit from store maturation, but these trends caused more pressure than anticipated,"" Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said.
Still, Dick's said it expects these headwinds to subside and is confident that its sales trajectory will improve next year. It raised its earnings per share forecast for the year ending February 2019 to between $3.02 and $3.20 versus an earlier forecast of $2.92 to $3.12.
""The improvement in the U.S. athletic market should overcome the weakness in hunting, electronics, and Under Armour as we get into 2019,"" Feldman added.
The company's net income rose 6 percent to $119.40 million, or $1.20 per share. Analysts had estimated $1.06 per share.

Net sales inched up nearly 1 percent to $2.18 billion, below the average Wall Street estimate of $2.24 billion.

1096,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 10:11AM ET</span>",Melt-Up on the Mind as U.S. Stock Gains Near Euphoric Levels,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks took the stairs during the six-month slog back from February’s market correction. Signs are mounting that investors expect them to ride the elevator even higher.
The S&P 500 Index, which was up 0.1 percent as of 9:51 a.m. in New York, has rallied 3 percent in the past two weeks alone, reaching an all-time high and popping above 2,900 for the first time. The surge has taken it within a whisker of overbought territory -- harking back to January when market euphoria pushed global equities into technically stretched waters, and then a violent correction.
Market strategists don’t expect a repeat. Wall Street’s biggest cohort of bulls has ratcheted up estimates for where stocks end the year, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Weeden & Co. now expecting the S&P 500 to hit 3,000 -- 3.5 percent higher than Tuesday’s close. That’d give the equity benchmark a 12 percent gain for the year.
The buy-side might play a major role in those predictions coming true.
The correlation between the S&P 500 and an index of hedge funds is near its weakest in the past five years, a sign that buy-side investors might feel pressure to boost their exposure to risk assets to avoid being left further behind.
Melt-Up, Redux
The ratio of bearish option bets to bullish ones is waning as the S&P 500 keeps churning out records. That implies investors may be loading up on derivatives as way to make up for lost ground should 2018 deliver a year-end rally similar to last year’s, when stocks closed with a 6.1 percent fourth-quarter surge.
And the dynamic playing out in the options market might just be getting started.
“Melt-up protection, that tends to happen really when you start to see new highs in the S&P,” said Maneesh Deshpande, head of U.S. equity and global derivatives strategy at Barclays. “Now we’re just getting there, so in my opinion I think the next few weeks are going to be key as we break out, that’s when you start to see a scramble.”
Buoyant appetite for call options may offer one explanation for why the Cboe Volatility Index, also known as the VIX or Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose in tandem with equities in recent sessions. A similar situation preceded the record spike in volatility earlier this year that abruptly ended the previous stretch of all-time highs for U.S. stocks. However, key differences suggest a precise repeat of that episode isn’t in the offing.
Positive Positioning
Other asset classes show speculators think markets will keep dancing to the risk-on beat. The weekly commitment of traders report points to significant bets that U.S. implied equity volatility and gold -- which tend to rise in periods of stress -- will fall, and that Treasury yields will rise.
Erin Browne, head of asset allocation for UBS Asset Management, explained why this fixed-income positioning helps contribute to a “pretty good backdrop” for risk assets.
“It makes it hard for global rates to materially break out to the upside given the fact that you have the Fed, which is now really going to have the debate, the discussion of when we get neutral, the ECB and the BOJ not being a positive catalyst for higher rates, and the market pretty short duration right now,” she said in an interview.
The speed of the advance in global equities over the past two weeks points to “some complacency in markets,” she warned, but even this seems largely justified given the improvement in the underlying economics and the low level of realized volatility.
Convergence
U.S. equities have pulled away from their global peers, but the rest of the world has started to narrow the gap.
Bright-eyed investors have cause to cheer a de-escalation of risk to the global economy that’s helped foster a rebound in overseas equities. Chinese policymakers have moved to push back against a potential disorderly depreciation of the yuan, Mexico and the U.S. have made progress on trade negotiations and the European economic surprise index has broken into positive territory for the first time since February.
Stateside, that’s helped materials, energy, and industrials -- cyclical sectors tied to global growth -- outperform over the past two weeks. All in all, it’s better for the sustainability of an advance for U.S. stocks to be in a flock rather than flying solo.
TINA Lives On
Even so, lingering external risks abroad and elevated expectations for the domestic economy mean the U.S. bull market -- now the longest on record -- has its fair share of detractors.
Early indicators show Chinese industrial activity continues to weaken. Italian debt still faces selling pressure ahead of a budget showdown with the European Union. Turkey’s problems haven’t disappeared, and the Brazilian real sank to its lowest level since January 2016.
David Bianco, chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset Management, thinks the next 5 percent move in U.S. stocks will be to the downside, citing those reasons.
“Dollar upside risk remains as the U.S. Federal Reserve intends to hike despite risks abroad,” he wrote in a note to investors.
There are also some signs investors still think stocks are the only game in town, with brokerage commissions falling even as U.S. stocks climb, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merill Lynch. That implies retail investors are holding onto stocks at or near records instead of chasing the rising returns from short-term debt.
That’s a troubling development for Jared Woodard, global investment strategist at BofA. “U.S. bull market is polarized (U.S. versus RoW), narrow (Faang versus rest), and deflationary (commissions) -- hardly a cause for celebration.”
Skepticism is warranted, according Cantor Fitzgerald global chief market strategist Peter Cecchini, but it’s tough to stand in the way of a market that’s steamrolling bears.
“The bottom line: market participants appear not to be buying arguments of peak earnings and care little about valuation (with the S&P trading at 2.2x revenue),” he writes. “Our stance must evolve with what U.S. equity market price action is telling us: i.e. - don’t fight the tape!”

1097,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Short Bets on World’s Biggest Tech Stocks Surge to $37 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Short positions against the so-called FAANG group of the largest U.S. technology stocks have surged by more than 40 percent in the past year as investors bet against some of the biggest drivers of the global bull market.
Bearish investors have shorted about $37 billion worth of stocks in the group, which comprises  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., up 42 percent from a year ago. Amazon leads the way with almost $10 billion in short interest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Aug. 28 from financial analytics firm S3 Partners LLC.
“Tech stocks have had a large run-up in price this year,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, said in an email. “The greater the rise, the greater the fall so they are being targeted as the stocks to short. With the bull market possibly entering the backstretch, portfolio managers are bracing for a selloff and increasing their overall market short exposure.”
Investors are piling into FAANG shorts as U.S. stocks continue to breach new records, with the Nasdaq Composite Index surging above 8,000 for the first time Tuesday. The group has accounted for 48 percent of the index’s advance this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tech companies overall make up half of the 10 largest short-interest positions in the world, with Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. at the top of the list with almost $19 billion worth of stocks short. That is more than double the 19 percent weighting the sector has in the MSCI All-Country World Index of the world’s largest developed and developing market stocks.
One of the biggest non-tech positions on the list is Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., which has become a magnet for bearish bets as founder Elon Musk briefly considered taking the electric car maker private before pulling the plug on the idea. Insurer Ping An Insurance Co. of China Ltd. is the highest-ranked non-tech name in the group, the data show.
Here’s why investors may be souring on some of the most successful market plays of the past few years:
Alphabet (+18 percent stock gain YTD)
Bears are on alert with Google now trying to get back into China, almost 10 years after exiting the world’s second-largest economy over political censorship concerns. The parent of Google and the rest of the FAANG cohort have already seen selloffs this year as investors questioned the persistent rally in the shares, as well as increasing privacy and censorship concerns that have arisen amid an investigation into possible Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
Alibaba (+3 percent)
It’s been an up-and-down year for Alibaba, with the stock little changed as the Chinese e-commerce giant has pulled back its presence in Silicon Valley amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Currently Alibaba’s focus includes its Ele.me food delivery platform, which competes against Tencent-backed rival Meituan Dianping. Both are incurring big losses as they fight for market share in China.
Ping An Insurance (-7 percent)
Insurance stocks in China have been under pressure this year as premium income has dropped and regulators move to curb financial risks, leaving an opening for bearish investors looking for further downside. In an August interview after the insurer reported its latest earnings, Ping An’s Chief Insurance Business Officer Lee Yuan Siong argued the company’s stock still doesn’t completely reflect the value of its technology segment, or its integrated financial services, which have helped the company dominate in China.
Tesla (+0 percent)
Where to start? Volatile electric car maker Tesla has been a lightning rod for bears all year, with Elon Musk clashing with analysts and short sellers while spending long hours at the factory struggling to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan. Then Musk ignited a firestorm this month when he tweeted his plan to take the company private -- before scrapping the whole idea weeks later. It’s got investors and analysts questioning Musk’s health and stability, and the SEC probing his actions. In spite of all that, Tesla stock remains flat for the year.
Dang, turns out even Hitler was shorting Tesla stock … https://t.co/RLM1VQ5O3K
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 5, 2018
Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 4, 2018
Netflix (+92 percent)
Netflix looks like a prime target for short sellers with the streaming service still one of the top performers in the S&P 500 this year even after second-quarter earnings disappointed as net subscriber additions missed forecasts. The company “burns cash like a drunken sailor,” Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in a July interview. Pachter has a sell rating and $125 price target for Netflix -- a third of the stock’s current $368.49 level.
Facebook (+0 percent)
Shares of the social media giant look vulnerable as users have grown disenchanted with the platform amid public scandals over privacy and content. Facebook warned in July sales growth will continue to slow through the rest of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, endured two days of grilling before Congress in April on the company’s privacy standards.
Amazon (+65 percent)
Shorts may be targeting the online retail giant because of its long-term success, as the stock has more than tripled over the past three years. While sales in the most recent quarter came in slightly below estimates, Amazon’s profitability has improved, generating more income in the first half of 2018 than the previous seven quarters combined. The company has also had to withstand frequent Twitter attacks from President Donald Trump.
Apple (+30 percent)
Short sellers may be betting the world’s largest company, which hit a $1 trillion market cap in August, will continue to struggle with plateauing global demand for smartphones as iPhone unit sales missed estimates last quarter while beating on price. Apple is looking to services and accessories for future growth as iPhone prices appear to have hit a ceiling.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (+29 percent)
Markets have soured on Microsoft recently with the stock suffering its longest losing streak in a year in August as it detected and seized web domains created by cyber-attackers linked to the Russian military. Microsoft surged to a record in July after its latest earnings report and forecasts boosted confidence it will be able to increase cloud sales and squeeze more profit while also cutting into Amazon’s lead.
Takeda Pharmaceutical (-28 percent)
Short-sellers are keeping a close eye on the 237-year-old drugmaker as it seeks approvals from regulators around the world to complete its $62 billion acquisition of U.K.-listed  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP), the biggest-ever overseas deal by a Japanese company. A small but vocal opposition group among shareholders has also voiced concerns over the risks the purchase poses to Takeda’s dividend and credit ratings.

BOSTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The family that controls  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) looks to be on a collision course this week with new hedge fund investors pushing for the company to sell itself, heralding a potential proxy fight industry analysts have labeled the ""fight of the fall.""
The soup and snack company is set to report the results of a strategic review on Thursday, but has shown no sign that it will put itself on the block, as recommended by activist investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC earlier this month. 
If no sale process is planned, Loeb could escalate his attack and nominate a slate of directors within the next few weeks to be voted on at Campbell's annual meeting later this year, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Loeb and Campbell Soup, which has a market value of about $12 billion, declined comment.
GRAPHIC - New investors make bets on Campbell in second quarter: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MZF5h9
The Camden, New Jersey-based company has been struggling with falling profit as younger consumers drift away from Campbell's namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies. Its share price is down by a third over the past two years. 
Wall Street has questioned the success of its acquisitions of juice and smoothie maker Bolthouse Farms and salty snack maker Snyder's-Lance. Chief Executive Denise Morrison, who headed Campbell for seven years, left as the company announced poor quarterly results on May 18. 
On that day, the company said it would conduct a review of all its business plans and portfolio of brands to find ways to improve its financial performance. 
""Everything is on the table. There are no sacred cows,"" Interim CEO Keith McLoughlin told investors at the time. The result of the review will be announced on Thursday. 
Historically, the company has resisted bigger changes, being effectively controlled by the heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and went on to run the company a century ago.
Dorrance's grandchildren Mary Alice Malone, who raises horses in Pennsylvania, and her brother Bennett Dorrance, a real estate developer in Arizona, have fended off periodic calls over three decades for the company to sell itself, and have shown no sign of changing their minds this year. 
Malone and Dorrance, who between them control 33 percent of Campbell's shares, could not be reached for comment. 
Archbold van Beuren, John Dorrance's great-grandson who is Campbell's third-biggest holder with 8.6 percent of its shares, also could not be reached for comment. 
In the past, the family has been able to rely on supportive, long-term shareholders. But in the past few months - most notably in the second quarter of 2018, when the company announced its wide-ranging review - a number of hedge fund investors have bought positions and are looking for more sweeping measures, including a sale.
""Everyone's dream is for the company to give up looking for a permanent CEO and put the company up for sale,"" said one investor not permitted to speak publicly. If that does not happen, the investor said the best course would be for the company to sell Bolthouse Farms, name a new CEO, and talk with Loeb ""about putting two or three new people on the board.""
NEW HEDGE FUND HOLDERS 
Steven Schonfeld's Schonfeld Group Holdings and Jamie Zimmerman's Litespeed Management made big new purchases of Campbell Soup shares during the second quarter, filings show. Och-Ziff, now known as OZ Management, and Hudson Bay Capital Management also bought shares. The hedge funds declined to comment.
""There has clearly been a lot of crowding into Campbell stock by event-driven investors"" seeking to make money off share price moves around corporate events like a sale, said Simnan Abbas, a managing director at investment data firm Symmetric.io. That crowding ""does not happen all the time and has changed the makeup of the shareholder base pretty significantly.""
Campbell's new hedge fund investors are likely allies for Loeb, who in August joined forces with another of Dorrance's grandchildren, George Strawbridge Jr., in calling for a sale. 
Loeb's $18 billion fund is now Campbell's fifth-largest investor. It and Strawbridge between them hold 8.4 percent of Campbell's shares.
Despite the increased pressure for change, Campbell's board shows little sign of shifting course dramatically. It recently turned away at least one company that approached it about buying parts of its portfolio, a person familiar with the matter said. It has, however, weighed selling off brands including its Arnott’s Australian cookie business, another person familiar with the matter said.
As hedge fund investors move in, longstanding shareholders such as trust company Bessemer Trust and mutual fund company Fidelity Investments have pared back their holdings, according to filings. Neither company would say why they cut their stakes. 
That means Malone and Dorrance could face more demanding and outspoken investors at this year's annual meeting, if not an outright proxy fight.
""This company has really slowed down since 2016 and I don't see a major way for them to innovate quickly,"" said investor David Dreman whose Dreman Value Management bought shares several years ago. ""How can a company with a diversified product line in a low-growth industry turn itself around quickly?""

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2018 07:56AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hyundai to ship China-made cars to Southeast Asia amid erratic sales recovery,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Norihiko Shirouzu
SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) plans to ship China-made cars to Southeast Asia, its China joint venture and two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, as a plunge in Chinese sales has left much of its massive local manufacturing capacity idled.
Hyundai once ranked third by China sales alongside affiliate Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270). But just as it opened its fifth factory in the country last year, a diplomatic dispute saw Chinese consumers turn against South Korean goods, damaging Hyundai's sales and brand image.
Diplomatic ties have since normalized but Hyundai's recovery has been erratic. The automaker booked China sales of 30,018 cars in July, down 40 percent from July last year and its lowest monthly total since the 2008 global financial crisis. Yet sales for January-July are up 17 percent.
""A China recovery will take time. Hyundai needs a survival plan,"" said one of the people with direct knowledge of Hyundai's China operations, who were not authorized to speak to the media and so declined to be identified.
The experience exposed South Korean companies' reliance on the Chinese market, pushing the Seoul government to court counterparts in Southeast Asia where the number of Korean cars is paltry compared with those of neighboring Japan.
""Hyundai is considering (exporting China-made vehicles) to emerging markets such as Southeast Asia,"" the person said. ""Europe may also be a consideration.""
Most vehicles foreign automakers build in China with local joint-venture partners are destined for the domestic market. Among those that export China-made vehicles, General Motors Co (GM) (N:GM) ships to the United States and Volkswagen AG (VW) (DE:VOWG_p) plans to export to Southeast Asia.
Zhao Jun, a spokesman at Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co - Hyundai's Chinese joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group Co Ltd (BAIC) - confirmed the export plan.
""Yes, we plan to export cars to Southeast Asia. The earliest could be the end of this year,"" Zhao said. The automaker will decide on models depending on local demand, he said.
Hyundai did not have immediate comment.
SEA TARIFFS
China was once the biggest market for Hyundai-Kia, whose local production was exceeded only by VW and GM. Yet their data showed a market share of 4.4 percent compared with 8.1 percent before the diplomatic spat, and as high as 10.5 percent in 2012.
Exacerbating Hyundai's plight is the increasing popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) - a segment in which the automaker has relatively few models - as well as heightened price competitiveness of domestic rivals. 
Hyundai recently replaced the head of its China venture and gave its research-and-development vice chairman the added responsibility of overseeing China product development. It aims to sell 900,000 cars in China this year versus 785,000 last year, however the target is almost half of its 1.65 million vehicle capacity.
Should it export from China to Southeast Asia, it may avoid tariffs of up to 78 percent in Vietnam, for instance, on cars built in South Korea versus 50 percent for those made in China.
It was unclear what impact any export plans would have on Hyundai's current Southeast Asia strategy, under which it is considering building a factory in Vietnam or Indonesia. 
South Korea's trade minister said, to help reduce dependence on China as well as the United States, the government would support firms expanding in Indonesia, where Korean automakers' market share is 0.1 percent versus Japan's 98.6 percent.
Across ASEAN, sales of South Korean cars are growing, with those of Hyundai-Kia rising 26 percent on year to 71,847 cars in January-June in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, showed data from LMC Automotive.

The data provider forecast overall vehicle sales in those five countries to grow 5 percent to 3.29 million vehicles this year from 2017, reaching 3.41 million vehicles in 2019.

Since taking the helm in April, Christian Sewing has announced plans to cut the lender's global equities business, as well as U.S. bond trading and its business that serves hedge funds.
Speaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt, Sewing said this should not be seen as a sign of retrenchment. 
""Our global ambitions will not be up for debate under my leadership,"" he said, adding a raft of political crises around the world made it important that Deutsche Bank supported its customers in their global business.
""I am quite convinced that this global position is just as important for our economy today as it was after the fall of the (Berlin) Wall.""
In times of tension between Europe and the United States, Sewing said he believed it would be ""too risky"" to leave the role of financing and risk management up to a few non-European banks.
Deutsche Bank is trying to bounce back from three consecutive years of losses and has had a run of negative headlines, including an abrupt management reshuffle, a downgrade by credit rating agency Standard & Poor's and failing the U.S. Federal Reserve's stress test.
Sewing said Germany's largest lender did not have ambitions to return to its status as a world market leader, as it was prior to the global financial crisis.
""It would be wrong to say we wanted to be number 1, 2 or 3. Of course we can't,"" he said. Instead the aim is to keep its top positions in certain businesses, such as payment transactions, euro and dollar clearing, and foreign exchange trading.
For this reason, Deutsche Bank needs to remain active in investment banking, he said.
Sewing's main aim is to restore profitability at the bank and he said the company needed to make ""clear progress"" on this in the next 12-18 months.
Sewing said he expected the pressure for banks to consolidate to increase as the sector faces the tougher regulation, digitalization and changes in customer behavior.
""Europe doesn't need as many banks as possible. It especially needs strong banks,"" he said.

He declined to comment on speculation that Deutsche Bank could merge with local rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).

As per the complaint, certain design features of Mahindra's off-road utility vehicle ROXOR infringed intellectual property rights of Fiat's Jeep design, Mahindra said in a statement.
Mahindra said the complaint was ""without merit.""
The company and its unit Mahindra Automotive North America have filed a public interest statement with the trade commission and have begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it had executed with Fiat in 2009. 
Mahindra is also seeking an injunction against Fiat from proceeding with the complaint, it added. 
Fiat had not made a monetary claim in the complaint but has sought a permanent restrain over Mahindra Automotive from importing any parts or components into the U.S. that infringe upon its intellectual property rights, the statement from Mahindra said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Fast-food chain operator  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) has rejected a $17.6 billion buyout offer from a consortium led by Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group, quashing what would have been one of Asia's biggest deals this year, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The Hillhouse-led consortium, which included regional investment house Baring Private Equity Asia, expressed an interest to offer $46 per share, or nearly 24 percent above Tuesday's closing price, for the biggest fast-food chain in China, the people said.
Global investment house KKR & Co (N:KKR) and Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp were also part of the consortium, one of the people added.
The consortium is not expected to take any immediate action and could just back off from pursuing the bid, that person said. 
Hillhouse had been tapping lenders to finance the deal, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing sources. 
Yum China was spun off from Yum Brands! Inc (N:YUM) in 2016 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China with over 8,100 restaurants in more than 1,200 cities. 
The offer did not include detailed terms or the structure of the investor consortium, and the board decided it provided no extra value or strategy for the business, said one of the people, who requested anonymity as the information is confidential.
The $46 per share offer values Yum China at 13 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), slightly higher than McDonald's Corp multiple of (N:MCD) 12.6 but lower than Domino's Pizza Inc's (N:DPZ) 20.8 times.
Yum China did not ask for a higher offer in its letter of rejection, two of the people said.
Yum China said it would not comment on rumours or market speculation, but a representative said the company had potential to grow to 20,000 stores over the long term. Baring declined to comment. Hillhouse, KKR and CIC did not respond to requests for comment.
Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital and Ant Financial Services Group bought a minority stake in Yum China for $460 million as part of the spin-off deal in September 2016. Both are still shareholders in the company. 
Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera who is also the independent chairman of the Yum China board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Primavera got two Yum China board seats after the spin-off.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the rejection, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.
Shares of Yum China rose as much as 12 percent on Tuesday before closing 3.86 percent higher.
In addition to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, Yum China also runs Chinese fast-food chain First East Dawning and hotpot restaurant Little Sheep, which it acquired in 2012.
Yum was the first major Western fast-food company to enter China, opening a KFC store in central Beijing in 1987. Parent Yum Brands! currently collects 3 percent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut China sales as royalties. 
Former Yum China chairman and CEO Sam Su, who was pivotal in the company's expansion in the world's second-largest economy, now serves as an operating partner at Hillhouse, although one of the people said he was not involved in the proposed buyout.

The company's second-quarter net income increased 13 percent year-on-year but Pizza Hut continued to face challenges in China's competitive casual dining space, its CEO said on Aug. 1.

Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co [GEELY.UL], one of China's five biggest automakers, and the owner of Sweden's Volvo Cars, is building the facility in the eastern port city of Ningbo where it already operates an assembly plant, as per the sources and information from a Geely-owned construction bidding procurement website.
The new capacity will enable Geely (HK:0175) to produce roughly 250,000 more cars a year in Ningbo and add larger cars to its small-car-focused lineup, as well as ramp up launches at its new brand Lynk & Co.
Geely was once known for cheaper, copycat designs but has assumed upmarket aspirations after the Volvo deal. The capacity increase underscores its ambitions as well as the shift in customer preferences toward bigger vehicles in China, the world's biggest auto market.

The plant will have two assembly lines. According to information on the Geely-owned website, the automaker plans to spend 3.4 billion yuan ($498.31 million) for one of them. The overall investment planned for the plant was not immediately known.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A government panel has recommended that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (J&J) pay compensation of at least $28,500 to each Indian patient who suffered from artificial hip implants the U.S. healthcare firm recalled eight years ago.
The ASR hip implants were recalled in 2010, after data suggested they failed at a higher-than-expected rate. In 2013, the firm agreed to pay nearly $2.5 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits from those in the United States who said they were injured by the implants. (http://reut.rs/I20AZB)
In India, J&J paid $2 million to patients for repeat surgeries and about $250,000 in related diagnostic costs under its ASR reimbursement program, but the panel criticized the company for offering no compensation.
""The fact remains that no compensation ever has been made by the firm in India to any patient,"" the panel said in a 118-page report released late on Tuesday. 
The panel was set up by the federal health ministry, which has said it is reviewing the report.
In a statement, J&J said its unit did not have access to data on patients who received implants because of patient confidentiality regulations, but it had given ""top priority"" to supporting ASR patients.
""The company has always put the health and safety of ASR patients first in everything we do,"" it said.
About 93,000 people worldwide received ASR implants, the panel said, about 4,700 of them in India. 
Metal hip implant systems such as ASR were designed to be more durable than a traditional metal-on-plastic ball-and-socket design. But many Indian patients suffered adverse reactions from the implant, the panel said.
It also criticized J&J for being ""evasive"" in sharing information on ASR's design with it. Only in 2015, five years after the ASR recall, did the company run newspaper notices in India about the move.
""(This) shows the negligent behavior of the firm to reach out to the affected patients,"" the panel said, calling for periodic advertisements to raise patient awareness about the implants.
J&J denied the panel's assessment, saying its unit had not been evasive and had ""fully cooperated with the expert committee in their investigation"".
The panel findings, first reported by Indian media last week, have sparked a public relations crisis for the U.S.-based company, which has also faced criticism from patient rights activists.

J&J ""has the responsibility to track patients, make them aware of the adverse effects and compensate them,"" said Oommen C. Kurian, a health researcher at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.

China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker was crippled in April when the United States banned American firms from selling it parts, saying the company broke an agreement to discipline executives who had conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
The ban, which became a source of friction in Sino-U.S. trade talks, was lifted in July after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties, allowing the firm to resume business. 
""As of today, the main operating business has resumed completely. The production mission for August has resumed to normal and R&D is resuming rapidly,"" the Securities Times newspaper quoted Chairman Li Zixue as saying at a shareholder meeting at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen on Tuesday. 
ZTE confirmed the comments to Reuters on Wednesday. 
As part of the settlement deal with Washington, ZTE, which relies on U.S. suppliers for core components, also overhauled its management team and appointed a new chief executive and chairman.
""We can definitely say the company is still in the front line in the communications industry,"" CEO Xu Ziyang said at the meeting. 
""Our orders have been great and are in line with that of July and August last year,"" he said, adding that the company hoped to see its network operating business resume a normal growth path in 2019.
ZTE also aimed to beef up research and development, in particular for key components such as chips, and strengthen ties with third-party chip makers in a bid to control risks, he said. 
In July, ZTE flagged the impact of the U.S. supplier ban when it said it expected to report a first-half net loss of 7.0-9.0 billion yuan ($1.1 billion-$1.3 billion) versus a profit of 2.3 billion yuan a year earlier. 
The company is due to report its earnings on Thursday.
ZTE's Hong Kong-listed shares were up more than 3 percent on Wednesday, outpacing a flat broader market. The firm lost about $3 billion in market value when trading of its shares resumed in June after a two-month suspension.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Advisory firm CamberView Partners agreed to sell itself to boutique investment bank  PJT Partners Inc  (N:PJT) on Tuesday in a deal that comes as public companies seek help defending against activist investors demanding corporate changes.
PJT Partners, founded by former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) veteran investment banker Paul J. Taubman, said it will pay $165 million to acquire the six-year-old advisory firm run by Abe Friedman. Of that amount, PJT will pay $100 million in the form of Class A common stock and partnership units and $65 million in cash.
The deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter and PJT, which employs more than 500 people, plans to keep all of CamberView's 40 professionals, the companies said. Corsair Capital, CamberView's biggest investor, will become a shareholder in PJT Partners.
""CamberView's deep experience and expertise in shareholder and governance matters significantly expands our ability to serve clients,"" Taubman said in a statement.
PJT advises companies on mergers and acquisitions as well as restructuring and capital raising. With the merger it is positioning itself to offer activism defense banking services and advice to companies, a niche market currently dominated by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Evercore and Lazard.
The two are joining forces at a time when more corporations are being pressured by investors to perform better and want help to defend against so-called activist investors, who often demand changes ranging from sale processes to share buybacks.
During the first half of 2018 a record 145 new campaigns were launched targeting 136 companies and activist investors won 119 board seats, marking a 75 percent increase from the year before, according to  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) data.
Some of the year’s most prominent activist campaigns include Elliott's agitating at Nielsen Holdings PLC (N:NLSN), Jana Partners's planning to seek board seats at Pinnacle Foods Inc (N:PF) before it sold itself to Conagra Brands Inc (N:CAG) and Third Point’s call for soup maker  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) to sell itself.
Taubman, one of Wall Street's top deal makers, left Morgan Stanley six years ago and took his company public in 2015. This year, PJT's share price has jumped roughly 30 percent.
This is not the first time PJT has pursued acquisitions. In 2014, Taubman agreed to merge his investment banking advisory firm with the advisory businesses of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (N:BX).
Law firm Simpson Thacher represented CamberView while Weil, Gotshal & Manges represented PJT Partners.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 08:34PM ET</span>",Canada rejoins NAFTA talks as U.S. autos tariff details emerge,"By Julie Gordon and Sharay Angulo
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada's top trade negotiator praised Mexico's trade concessions on autos and labor rights on Tuesday as she rejoined NAFTA talks, while U.S. lawmakers warned that a bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade deal would struggle to win approval in Congress.
Automotive executives and other sources also told Reuters on Tuesday that the bilateral U.S.-Mexico deal announced on Monday allows President Donald Trump to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports of Mexican-made passenger vehicles and auto parts above certain volumes.
If Trump proceeds with the tariffs now under consideration based on national security concerns, Mexican duty-free exports of cars and sport-utility vehicles to the United States would be capped at 2.4 million vehicles annually. Volumes above that level would be subject to tariffs, auto industry officials and other sources said.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said that Mexico's ""difficult"" concessions to the United States on Monday would pave the way for productive talks this week as all three countries race toward a Friday deadline for a deal to modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. 
""These concessions are really going to be important for workers in Canada and the United States,"" she told reporters after meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
Freeland, who later met with Mexican officials on Tuesday evening, said she is due to dig into detailed discussions with Lighthizer on Wednesday. 
Trump warned on Monday he could proceed with a deal with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with the revised trade terms. 
After being sidelined from the talks for more than two months, Freeland will be under pressure to accept terms the United States and Mexico worked out on a trade deal announced on Monday.
One of the main sticking points for Canada in the revised deal is the U.S. effort to dump the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism that hinders the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. Lighthizer said on Monday that Mexico had agreed to eliminate the mechanism.
Other hurdles include intellectual property rights, such as the U.S.-Mexico 10-year data exclusivity for biologic drug makers and extensions of copyright protections to 75 years from 50, all higher thresholds than Canada has previously supported.
Dan Ujczo, a Columbus, Ohio-based trade lawyer who focuses on U.S.-Canada issues, said it would be hard for Freeland to win concessions from Lighthizer on these issues.
""I think he's going to sit there with his arms folded a lot,"" Ujczo added.
Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told Mexican television on Tuesday the three sides would work for a three-way deal. ""We are now going to devote long hours to the negotiation with Canada,"" he said.
Negotiations among the three partners, whose mutual trade totals more than $1.2 trillion annually, have dragged on for more than a year, putting pressure on the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Both currencies gained against the U.S. dollar on Monday, but the peso weakened on Tuesday. 
If a deal is not reached with Canada, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the Trump administration intends to proceed with a separate trade agreement with Mexico. 
The Mexican government has also taken that position, even as it says it wants a trilateral deal. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is keen to sign the agreement before leaving office at the end of November.
Some lawmakers said however, that a bilateral pact could lose the benefits of U.S. ""fast-track"" negotiating authority, which calls for a trilateral deal.
A trilateral deal would need only 51 votes in the Senate, while a bilateral pact would need a far more difficult 60-vote threshold, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said. If Republicans retain 51 of the Senate's 100 seats in November elections, they could approve a new NAFTA agreement next year without the support of Democrats. 
Canada's main stock index opened higher on Tuesday on hopes for a NAFTA trade deal, before ending lower. U.S. stocks edged to record highs for a third consecutive session.
Trump said he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Canada did not join its neighbors and warned he expected concessions on Canada's dairy protections.
Canada's dairy farmers operate under a protectionist system that manages supplies and prices, and imposes high tariffs to limit imports. U.S. demands have ranged from ending those tariffs to scrapping a pricing system for milk ingredients that hurt U.S. exports of milk proteins. 
""It seems like a pretty steep challenge to now resolve these issues in three days,"" said David Wines, a Manitoba dairy farmer and vice president of industry group Dairy Farmers of Canada.
If talks with Canada are not wrapped up by Friday, Trump plans to notify Congress that he intends to sign a deal with Mexico, but would be open to Canada joining, Lighthizer told reporters on Monday.

The White House has said Trump will sign the deal 90 days after notification. Congress needs to approve it in a process that will take several months, extending well into 2019.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina relaunched a one-year-old agreement between the government, companies and workers on Tuesday to drive competition and spur development in the Vaca Muerta shale play, the government said in a statement.
The original agreement, signed just over a year ago, sought to boost production by incentivizing competition among oil and gas drillers in the region. The government is now looking to bring in other business sectors like construction and mid-stream service providers.
""We are not going to stop until we export $30 billion in gas and oil from Vaca Muerta,"" President Mauricio Macri told employees of state-controlled energy company YPF during a meeting with them in the southwestern province of Nequen.
Argentina is trying to double production in the region, aiming to pump 260 million cubic meters of gas daily within five years, the government said in the statement. Of that, 100 million cubic meters per day would be destined for international markets, according to the government's plans.
YPF presented its proposal to small and medium-sized businesses involved in the oil and gas supply chain earlier this year, in an effort to drive competition, the statement said.
""We want to increase production by 100 to 130 fractures per month, which can be achieved by working with unions and supply companies,"" YPF President Miguel Gutierrez said.
YPF, with its partners, has invested $8.4 billion in the region. It is the leading investor in Vaca Muerta, one of the largest non-conventional oil and gas formations in the world. 

In June, companies in Vaca Muerta increased oil production by 5 percent compared with the same month last year. Gas production increased 8.2 percent over the same period, according to data from the Energy Ministry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) founder John Schnatter, who is trying to regain control of the pizza chain after resigning as chairman in July, accused Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie's ""inner circle"" of sexual misconduct, an allegation the company denied on Tuesday.
In a letter to franchisees on Monday and published on Schnatter's website savepapajohns.com, Schnatter said Papa John's human resources department had evidence of harassment and intimidation but he did not provide evidence himself.
""Once again, John Schnatter is making untrue and disparaging statements in a self-serving attempt to distract from the damaging impact his own words and actions have had on the company and our stakeholders,"" the company said in a statement.
Ritchie, who was previously Papa John's president, took over as CEO in January after Schnatter had come under fire for criticizing the National Football League's leadership over national anthem protests by players. Schnatter stepped down as chairman following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training call.
""The company's HR department has detailed evidence of sexual misconduct, harassment and intimidation by virtually everyone in Steve's inner circle, and relating to board members as well,"" Schnatter's letter said.
Schnatter, who owns 30 percent of the company, wrote that the board agreed with him that Ritchie ""needed to go"" as CEO because of the company's financial decline. The board asked Schnatter to become executive chairman in June, the letter said. Schnatter had once supported Ritchie as CEO.
Papa John's said in its response that the board ""at no time"" had asked Schnatter to become executive chairman. ""In fact, the company has taken multiple steps to separate itself from him.""
Ritchie could not immediately be reached for comment.
Schnatter last month sued Papa John's, saying it had not produced documents related to his departure from the company. Schnatter founded the company in 1984.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 05:22PM ET</span>",U.S. banking regulator kicks off low-income lending rules rewrite,"By Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal regulator said on Tuesday it is seeking input on rewriting decades-old rules aimed at encouraging bank lending in low-income communities.
The move by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to seek public comment is an initial step by regulators to rewrite the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules, which banks say have become outdated since they were last updated in the 1990s. 
The rules are aimed at preventing discriminatory lending and so-called redlining by requiring banks to extend mortgages and other types of credit to low-income communities where they take deposits. 
Regulators regularly grade banks on their compliance, and lenders that do not make the grade face limits on their ability to expand through mergers, acquisitions or adding new branches until issues are addressed.
Banks say that the rules overlook technology that allows customers to apply for loans and transfer funds via a mobile app regardless of physical location or hour restrictions.
The Trump administration, which is looking across industries for places to trim regulations, has pushed for a more relaxed approach to the CRA rules.
The OCC shares responsibility for enforcing CRA rules with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve, which did not sign off on Tuesday's consultation.
But both agencies have expressed interest in rewriting the rules. The OCC plans to share responses with the other regulators after a 75-day open period for comment, it said on Tuesday. 
Comptroller Joseph Otting, a former banker, has identified updating CRA regulations as a top priority, and the Treasury Department has similarly said bank regulators should look for ways to modernize the rules.
""Stakeholders of all kinds have spoken up, calling the current regulatory framework for the CRA outdated, complex, and cumbersome,"" Otting said in a statement on Tuesday. 
The OCC is considering expanding the types of bank activity that would qualify under the rules and potentially broadening the geographic areas where a bank can do business and still comply with CRA, in a nod to the rise of digital banking.
""Current CRA rules make it harder for [community bankers] to serve their communities, which makes today’s OCC action both timely and necessary,"" Rob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement.
""The current framework is holding back investment in communities the law is intended to serve, while failing to account for significant innovations in the banking sector, including the opportunities presented by mobile technologies.""

Consumer and fair-lending groups agree the rules could be modernized, but are wary of any changes that could lower standards and hurt minorities' fair access to credit.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 05:09PM ET</span>",U.S. energy companies fume over rejected steel tariff exemptions,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department recently granted a tariff exemption to oil major  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) for its imports of 4.5-inch Japanese steel tubes for oil exploration. 
But the department rejected a similar request from Borusan Mannesmann Pipe to exclude 4.5-inch steel pipes imported from Turkey for casing used to line new oil wells.
The reason: multiple U.S. steelmakers objected to Borusan's application, arguing they could supply the product, according to the department. Chevron drew no such objections. 
When U.S. President Donald Trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported steel this spring, his administration allowed companies to apply for exemptions if needed metals were not available in sufficient quality, quantity or in a reasonable time.
But the process for seeking relief is proving slow and controversial as a deluge of applications has buried the small staff initially assigned to the task, prompting the department to hire dozens of extra contract workers. The limited number of decisions made so far are drawing protests from rejected applicants and sparking disputes between U.S. steel mills and importers of products from their foreign competitors.
Commerce has received more than 37,000 exemption requests, far more than it planned to handle. Although 130 employees and contractors are now evaluating the applications, the agency had only ruled on 2,871 of those requests as of August 20. 
The department has so far approved 1,780 of the applications and denied 1,091. Separately, the department turned back more than 6,000 requests for what it called ""filing errors"" by applicants, who can fix and resubmit their requests.
Rejected applicants have criticized the department for taking sometimes misleading objections by domestic suppliers at face value and for not allowing importers a chance to rebut their arguments.
""The Commerce Department is now hard-pressed to spend more than a few minutes reviewing each application,"" said Bernd Janzen, a partner in Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, which is working with companies pursuing tariff exclusions.
Commerce acknowledged its staffing issues and said it has requested permission from Congress to reallocate $5 million of its own funds to accelerate the review process. Congress has so far only approved a reallocation of $2 million, the agency said.
""We will continue to run behind unless we are allowed to divert more Commerce resources to the process,"" the department said in a statement to Reuters.
The agency is also revising its evaluation process.
""The Department fully acknowledges that the information provided in an objection may not be correct,"" the agency said.
Twenty exemptions have been approved over the objections from U.S. steelmakers, a sign that its process is ""balanced, fair and transparent,"" the department said.
SUPPLIER OBJECTIONS
Companies seeking exemptions have complained that Commerce provides little detail on the rationale for denying applications beyond boilerplate language that the product a company wants to import is available from a U.S. supplier.
Joel Johnson, chief executive of Borusan Mannesmann Pipe, a U.S. subsidiary of a Turkish steelmaker, said the department did not explain how it came to reject its application.
""We don't know for sure why they denied us, but we did have objections from our competitors who also make pipe,"" said Johnson, adding that letters of support from its suppliers did not appear to influence the decision. 
Borusan expects to see its operating cost climb by $25 million to $35 million annually as a result of the tariffs.
Borusan's parent company will supply steel for  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Inc's Gulf Coast Express pipeline, a $1.75 billion project to move natural gas from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Kinder, the second-largest North American pipeline operator, has submitted its own request to avoid the tariff on the Borusan order but has not yet received a ruling. 
The Trump administration recently said it would double tariffs on steel from Turkey, adding between $60 million to $80 million to the cost of Kinder Morgan's pipeline, analysts for Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote this month.
U.S. Steel, which objected to Borusan's request, said it only commented on requests for products it can make.
""We stand ready to assist both new and longstanding customers"" who are hit by tariffs, spokeswoman Meghan Cox said in a written statement.
$40 MILLION 'TAX'
After another pipeline operator, Plains All American, had its application denied, the company asked Commerce for an analysis from the International Trade Administration to explain the decision. None has been provided, incoming Chief Executive Officer Willie Chiang said at a congressional hearing called by Washington state Representative Dave Reichert last month.
The Commerce Department said it does not disclose such internal analyses because they are ""predecisional.""
Chiang called the rejection a ""$40 million tax"" on its Texas oil pipeline project, which is anticipated to cost about $1.1 billion. Steel pipe makes up about 20 percent of the cost of a pipeline.
Last month, Chiang pressed the issue before a U.S. House of Representatives panel, calling the reviews ""flawed"" because they rely heavily on steel-industry objections that aren't given enough scrutiny. His company also had scant time to counter objections filed by steelmakers, he said, which are sometimes filed at the last minute.
Only three steel mills in the world can make the pipe Plains will use for its 550-mile Cactus pipeline, the company has said. Berg Steel, which filed an objection to Plains' application, said it could make alternate products to meet Plains' needs.
Berg did not respond to a request for comment. 
Plains said the pipe U.S. manufacturers suggested using is created through a different process that in some cases would either double the number of girth welds or increase the welding seams by 30 percent. Additional welding seems could raise the likelihood of cracks or failures. 
""Decisions on product specifications should be made by companies, not government trade officials,"" he said.
Plains All American has resubmitted its request for an exclusion. 
Heat Transfer Tubular Products - a Conroe, Texas-based private company that supplies steel tubing for oil-refinery equipment - had several applications rejected based on what vice president of sales Janese Sokulski called faulty objections from other U.S. companies. 
Webco Industries Inc, a competitor of Heat Transfer's, argued in its written objection that it could make similar products in the United States. Webco did not respond to a request for comment. 
Even if Webco were to make the products, Sokulski said, she would not be able to buy them because the company is a competitor.

""They would never sell it to us,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq edged up to record closing highs for the third consecutive session as investors struggled over whether to take profits following a rally on positive developments in trade disputes which have vexed the markets.
Following a United States-Mexico agreement Monday to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), focus shifted to Canada, with its top trade negotiator joining her Mexican and U.S. counterparts in Washington in a bid to remain in the trilateral pact. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed marginally higher in a late summer, low-volume session of back-and-forth trading as investors debated whether to cash in or ride the market's momentum.
""My vote is on the side of momentum,"" said Jim Bell, president, chief investment officer at Bell Investment Advisors in Oakland, California. ""Business leaders are quite confident. They're irritated by the trade challenges but it looks to me as if all systems are go.""
Technology companies led the advance, offset by declines in energy (SPNY), telecom (SPLRCL) and materials (SPLRCM) sectors, among others.
Luxury retailer Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised its full-year profit forecast. The stock closed up 1.0 percent.
Sears Holding Corp (O:SHLD) stock surged by 12.6 percent as its Auto Center partnership with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) expanded, its services now available nationwide. The partnership was first announced in May. 
 Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) rose 3.9 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that the fast food operator rejected a buyout.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 14.38 points, or 0.06 percent, to 26,064.02, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.78 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,897.52 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 12.14 points, or 0.15 percent, to 8,030.04.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, four ended the session in positive territory, with real estate <.SPLRCR> and technology posting the biggest percentage gains. 
Among losers, shares of  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) sank 5.0 percent after the electronics retailer reported a drop in online sales growth and provided underwhelming third-quarter profit guidance.
 Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) closed 2.1 percent lower after a New York Post report that the soup maker does not plan to sell itself.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) stock extended its decline, falling 2.3 percent in the wake of Chief Executive Elon Musk's decision to abandon his take-private scheme. Separately, broker Canaccord Genuity said it expects the electric automaker to miss its Model 3 production targets.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 100 new highs and 27 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.58 billion shares, compared with the 6.18 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 04:56PM ET</span>",Ex-CEO sues Barnes & Noble over ouster linked to alleged harassment,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc (N:BKS) was sued on Tuesday by a former chief executive officer who said the largest U.S. bookstore chain falsely accused him of violating its sexual harassment policy before firing him after 14 months on the job.
In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Demos Parneros accused Barnes & Noble of breach of contract and defamation over his sudden July 3 termination without severance.
Parneros accused founder Leonard Riggio, who owns more than 19 percent of Barnes & Noble, of engineering his firing after turning on him when an unnamed bookseller withdrew a takeover bid for the New York-based company in early June.
He also said Barnes & Noble falsely accused him of mistreating then-Chief Financial Officer Allen Lindstrom, who Parneros considered a ""poor performer"" on business-related matters, according to the complaint. Lindstrom and two others now share the CEO role.
Lindstrom was not immediately available to comment. 
In a statement, Barnes & Noble's board of directors called Parneros' lawsuit ""an attempt to extort money from the company by a CEO who was terminated for sexual harassment, bullying behavior and other violations of company policies.""
The board said Riggio ""upholds the highest standards of integrity and decency,"" and called Parneros' allegations about him ""replete with lies and mischaracterizations.""
Parneros said he had not violated company policies and ""always conducted himself in a professional manner.""
He is seeking more than $4 million of severance, plus other compensatory and punitive damages. Parneros' lawyer, Debra Raskin, declined to elaborate on the complaint.
Barnes & Noble has been struggling with years of falling sales and foot traffic as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other rivals take away business.
Parneros joined in late 2016 as chief operating officer, after 28 years at  Staples Inc  (NASDAQ:SPLS), and succeeded Riggio as CEO six months later.
According to the complaint, Riggio became ""extremely upset"" when the takeover bid fell through, believing it denied him a ""graceful exit"" from the company.
The complaint said Riggio stopped returning Parneros' phone calls and texts, while continuing to meet with other executives, despite there being ""no suggestion"" Parneros was at fault.
But Parneros said Riggio told him on July 2 he would be ""fired for cause for violating the sexual harassment policy and cited his interactions with an executive assistant and purported mistreatment of Allen Lindstrom.""
Barnes & Noble's announcement of Parneros' termination said it was for ""violations of the company's policies,"" and not disagreement over its financial practices.
The complaint said Barnes & Noble's ""defamatory statements have caused Parneros significant injury.""

The case is Parneros v Barnes & Noble Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-07834.

1145,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 04:23PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Will Pending Home Sales Buck the Housing Trend Again?
Economic indicators are likely to have the most influence on the market tomorrow, with more data on the of-late struggling housing sector arriving.
The National Association of Realtors reports its pending home sales figures for July at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
Sales are expected to have risen 0.3%, compared with a 0.9% rise in June, according to economists.
Pending home sales were one of the few recent bright spots when it comes to housing numbers, rising more than expected in the last report.
The second measure of second-quarter GDP will be reported at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), but little change is expected from the advance measure of 4.1%.
Core PCE prices for the quarter are expected to stay at the previously measured rise of 2%.
2. Jack Daniels Reports Numbers; Retail Earnings Continue
Liquor company Brown-Forman (NYSE:BFb) reports earnings before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analysts are looking for the maker of Jack Daniels and Herradura tequila to report earnings of 39 cents a share on sales of about $761 million for the quarter.
What may be of most interest to Wall Street, though, is whether the company has anything to say on the conference call about investing in or expanding into the cannabis business.
Cannabis stocks have been rallying since beverage company Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), which owns Corona beer, said it would invest a further $4 billion in  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC), Canada’s top cannabis producer.
Brown-Forman said late last year it was looking at the sector, but did not outline any specific plans.
Among retailers reporting results ahead of trading are Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), Chicos FAS (NYSE:CHS) and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO).
3. Oil Inventories Should Give Market More Direction
It’s been a push-and-pull week for oil prices so far, but tomorrow’s weekly government inventory data should give oil and energy stock traders a little more definitive direction.
The EIA is expected to report U.S. crude stockpiles fell by just 686,000 barrels last week, well below the 5.836 million barrel decline in the prior week at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Distillate stocks, which include heating oil, and gasoline inventories are expected to show an increase in weekly inventories, but lower than the build seen the previous week.
There are persistent concerns in the energy market about what will happen to supply when U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports go into effect in November.
But the global market isn't likely to see pressure when that happens, as other OPEC members would raise output, Pimco said.
""It's estimated that upwards of 1 million barrels of daily output won't be available on the market. But other OPEC members are liable to increase their output by some 750,000 barrels,"" Pimco added."

1147,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",White House investigating Google after Trump accuses it of bias,"By Ginger Gibson and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Google's search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding ""fair media"" coverage of him, vowing to address the situation without providing evidence or giving details of action he might take. 
Trump's attack against the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit follows a string of grievances against technology companies, including social media  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which he has accused of silencing conservative voices, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which he has said is hurting small businesses and benefiting from a favorable deal with the U.S. Postal Services. He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage.
Google denied any political bias, saying in a statement that its search engine is ""not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.""
Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for ""Trump News"" were ""rigged"" against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.
""I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,"" Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.""
Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.
Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google. 
Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was ""taking a look"" at Google, saying the administration would do ""some investigation and some analysis,"" without providing further details.
Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.
Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws. The Federal Communications Commission ceded jurisdiction over regulating online communications when it repealed its net neutrality rules.
U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution: ""If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond."" 
Shares of Alphabet fell 0.8 percent to $1,245.86.
TRUMP'S CRITICISM OF MEDIA
While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company's algorithms.
The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search. 
Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump's most frequent targets, often appear first in search results. 
Trump's accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S. Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech. Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons. Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter's chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5. Earlier this month, Alphabet's YouTube joined Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter.

1154,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",The Treasury Yield Curve Is Finally Going Mainstream,"(Bloomberg) -- The Treasuries yield curve is getting its 15 minutes of fame, though the drama surrounding it might bomb as a reality TV show.
While the thinning gap between short- and long-dated yields may seem a tough pitch for a general audience, it’s proving to be compelling viewing beyond the bond-nerd community: The term ""yield curve"" is trending, with a spike in Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches around 8 a.m. Tuesday in New York. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis have observed a similar trend, noting in a blog post Monday that the 2- to 10-year spread has taken over from the perennial favorite, the consumer price index, as its most popular data series.
The curve is drawing mainstream attention as it pushes to the flattest levels since 2007. The concern is that an inverted curve -- where long-term yields sink below short-term yields -- has been a reliable precursor to recession. U.S. central bank officials have highlighted other potential explanations, such as strong global demand for Treasuries. But some have gone so far as to say that the risk of inversion should guide monetary policy.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday became the latest senior official to weigh in on the curve, securing it yet another foothold in its climb up the rankings of market indicators. However, he also downplayed the significance of the flattening, and took the opportunity to give a vote of confidence to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who’s been a target of presidential criticism as the central bank plows on with policy tightening.
Even as the curve gains a higher profile, it’s unlikely to have much impact on behavior outside the professional investor community, said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist and founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He points out that the yield curve is just one of many indicators that the Fed consults, and another is equity-market performance.
And with equities benchmarks setting new highs, the yield curve’s downbeat message may not hold the spotlight.
“The S&P 500’s making news every night, whereas the yield curve isn’t.”"

Moxie, the official soft drink of the state of Maine, was invented two years before Coke in 1884 and counted President Calvin Coolidge and Boston Red Sox great Ted Williams among its patrons.
Both the companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018.
There will be no change in the distribution and the brand will become part of Coke's venturing and emerging brands, said Lauren Thompson, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola.
CCNNE, which is an independent franchise bottler of Coca-Cola, bought Moxie over a decade ago.
""The acquisition will provide the Moxie brand with the resources needed to evolve for a new generation of drinkers."" CCNNE's spokesman Nick Martin said.

TORONTO (Reuters) -   Thomson Reuters  Corp  (TO:TRI) (N:TRI) on Tuesday launched a $9 billion share buyback, sending its shares higher, and said it would complete the sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk unit to Blackstone Group LP (N:BX) on Oct. 1.
Shares in Thomson Reuters, which had been suspended prior to the announcement, were trading at C$58.03, up 3.6 percent at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT) in Toronto, having earlier hit C$58.50 after trading recommenced, their highest level since the deal was announced on Jan. 30.
The tender offer, which expires on Oct. 2, has been priced at $42 to $47 per share, an 11.5 percent premium to the stock's average price over the past 20 trading days, the company said in a statement. Thomson Reuters' U.S.-listed shares were trading at $44.94, up 3.9 percent at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT).
The news and information provider had previously said it expected to complete the deal, which values the business at about $20 billion, in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The company reiterated its guidance that it will receive about $17 billion in gross proceeds when the deal closes, out of which it plans to return $10 billion to shareholders. 
As part of that process, the company said up to $9 billion will be returned to shareholders through a tender offer for shares which commences on Tuesday.
From the remainder of the proceeds, the company said it will redeem $4 billion of debt, keep $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet and use $1 billion to cover expenses related to the transaction.

Thomson Reuters said Woodbridge, the Thomson family's investment company, would participate in the buy back and retain a 64 percent ownership in the company.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>","Slowing online sales hurt Best Buy's second quarter, shares drop","By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) on Tuesday reported a drop in quarterly online sales growth and offered a profit forecast for the current quarter that fell short of analyst estimates, sending its shares down more than 5 percent in afternoon trading.
Chief Executive Hubert Joly in a conference call cited a maturing online consumer electronics business for declining web sales growth and said rising transportation costs may pressure current quarter earnings.
Best Buy shares, which have risen over 20 percent since the start of the year, fell as much as 8.4 percent on Tuesday.
The stock price decline was fueled by a combination of factors like a slowdown in online sales, the impact of future expense plans and investor fears the recent strength in performance may not be sustainable, Jason Benowitz, analyst and senior portfolio manager at The Roosevelt Investment Group said.
""Investors fear that (Best Buy) could be vulnerable to further digital disruption or any signs of a peak as the tax cut stimulus fades and the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy late in the economic cycle,"" he said.
The U.S. consumer electronics retailer said in a statement that domestic online sales rose 10.1 percent in its second quarter ended Aug. 4. That compared with 12 percent in the first quarter and 31.2 percent in the same period a year ago.
Best Buy's third-quarter profit forecast also disappointed some investors. The retailer said it expects adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents to 84 cents, lower than analyst estimates of 92 cents per share.
Joly said on the conference call that consumer electronics is a more mature category online, in discussing the slow uptick in online sales in the second quarter.
""Consumer (electronics) is one of the first categories that started to move online. So the overall penetration is higher than in other categories,"" Joly said. 
The company's investments in making its stores more competitive are bringing more shoppers to its brick-and-mortar locations for products like appliances and large screen televisions, he added.
Joly said higher transportation costs could pressure profits in the third quarter. However, he added investors should find comfort after the retailer raised its annual sales and earnings guidance.
Moody's lead retail analyst Charlie O'Shea agreed with Joly.
""I think it is important to look at the whole picture with Best Buy and not pieces, more people are shopping at their stores, their overall performance this quarter is strong and that is something the street needs to understand,"" O'Shea said.
Online sales make up 15 percent of the company's total domestic sales and represented a 15 percent share of the U.S. consumer electronics market as of March. The company has doubled its web business in the past five years.
The retailer expects full-year comparable sales to grow 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent versus its original guidance of flat to 2 percent. It also revised its earnings outlook upward to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 from $4.80 to $5.00 per share.
The company said it expects a dip in its third quarter operating income, consistent with its expectations from the start of the year.
The company's online sales and profit forecast for the current quarter overshadowed second quarter sales and profit performance helped by a strong economy. 
Excluding charges, Best Buy earned 91 cents per share in its second quarter. Analysts expected 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose to $9.38 billion, beating estimates of $9.28 billion.

Earlier this month, the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer said it would buy health services provider GreatCall Inc for $800 million in cash, its largest acquisition ever, hoping to sell health-related products and services to an aging U.S. population.

1159,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",The Record $35 Billion Selloff Pulling Down Japan's Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s shaping up to be the biggest exodus in more than three decades.
Foreigners have dumped a net 3.9 trillion yen ($34.7 billion) in Japanese equities so far this year, according to data from Japan Exchange Group Inc. that runs through Aug. 17. That’s on course to be the largest annual selloff since 1987, the year of Wall Street’s famous Black Monday market crash.
Overseas investors are fleeing as the world’s second-largest stock market limps through 2018, buffeted by everything from concerns about trade wars to the impact of next year’s sales-tax increase. The benchmark Topix index has lost almost 5 percent this year for one of the worst performances among developed markets tracked by Bloomberg.
“I’m not surprised they were selling,” said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management Co., who points out that, as well as those factors, strong corporate earnings have prompted U.S. investors to stick to their home market. “But the extent” of the selloff “surprised me.”
Foreign investors tend to unload Japanese stocks when the yen is gaining, as that weighs on the profit outlooks of the country’s exporters. While the currency trades in the 111 per dollar range, not too far from where it started the year, there were bouts of strengthening in between. By March, for example, the yen had risen to 104.56 per dollar amid the global equity rout earlier in the year. And since mid-July, when it weakened beyond 113, it has appreciated again.
And that has had an impact. Overseas investors offloaded a net 447 billion yen over the three weeks through Aug. 17, pushing net selling for this year to a level that’s on course to be the second-highest since the bourse started keeping records in 1982, according to data on the value of equities traded on the Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges.
Investors Wrong
Some commentators say that overseas investors are making a mistake -- again.
“Global investors are wrong,” said Martin Malone, a strategist at Mint Partners in London and a long-term bull on Japanese equities. “They missed the stellar returns over 2015-2018,” he said. “If global investors jump in with $20-$30 billion, then the Nikkei could fly.”
For sure, the selling in 2018 has come as the Topix rose to lofty heights. As recently as January, the index traded at its highest in more than a quarter century. But foreign investors didn’t capitalize on at least some of the rally since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to power in 2012 in which the Topix more than doubled. While they were strong buyers in 2013 and 2014, they were net sellers over the following two years.
Stealth Tapering?
Others note a perceived change in behavior by one of the domestic supporters of the country’s market. The Bank of Japan, which has aimed to spend about 6 trillion yen on Japanese stocks in the form of exchange-traded funds, has been slowing its purchases of ETFs this year, and steps such as that, some commentators say, are affecting sentiment.
“While the BOJ has not necessarily admitted it, the market feels that they are altering policy,” said Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies Group. And “political risk has climbed.”
Kathy Matsui, chief Japan equity strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., points to several other reasons for foreigners’ departure, including uncertainty about the global growth outlook, particularly for China and emerging markets, trade tensions, some mixed Japanese economic data, and concerns about the sustainability of companies’ profit growth.
But she predicts that overseas investors will return to the market before too long. Matsui cites Abe’s likely victory in the September Liberal Democratic Party presidential election as one reason for optimism. Other potential catalysts include the possibility of upward earnings revisions and increased buybacks and dividends, she said.
“We anticipate some foreign interest in Japan to resume by year-end,” Matsui said."

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>","Tiffany's results beat estimates, profit outlook up","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co's (N:TIF) results topped Wall Street estimates on Tuesday as a heavy advertising spend drew in both affluent and more price-conscious shoppers to its stores in the Americas and China, prompting the chain to raise its annual profit forecast.
Shares of the company initially rose as much as 6.5 percent to $138.4, although they handed back much of those gains after the company said a renovation of its flagship New York store would eat into earnings this year.
Tiffany's still expected full-year profit to reach $4.65 to $4.80 per share, up from $4.50-$4.70 earlier, underscoring the success of a turnaround under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo and easing any concerns over the impact of U.S-China trade tensions on a business with a big Asian connection. 
Bogliolo has poured more money into technology and marketing, luring social-media celebrities such as Kendall Jenner to endorse the brand and enhance the feel and shopping experience at its outlets.
He has increased the chain's focus on less expensive fashion jewelry while also launching high-end everyday home items such as $350 gold straws and $1,500 gold paper clips. 
Selling, general and administrative costs rose 20 percent to $497.6 million but the company's gross margins were also up - at 64 percent from 62.5 percent a year earlier.
""The Tiffany brand is getting it's mojo back with US consumers,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.
Tiffany traditionally benefits from tourist spending in the United States with the Fifth Avenue store made famous by Audrey Hepburn generating almost 10 percent of annual sales. This time, however, it underlined that the gains both in North America and China were driven by spending by affluent locals. 
Net sales in the Americas, which accounts for nearly half of total sales, rose 8 percent to $475 million. Sales in Asia Pacific grew 28 percent.
""We are encouraged by the momentum in the business globally and across product categories, which suggest that investments are nicely driving the business, despite ongoing volatility in tourist flows and foreign exchange,"" RBC analysts said. 
Bogliolo told Reuters he believed the success of its platinum and diamond collection Paper Flowers - priced between $2,500 and $75,000 - had supported sales of other items in the same price category. 
Tiffany's same-store sales rose 7 percent excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, above expectations of an increase of 5.73 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company's net sales of $1.08 billion topped the consensus estimate of $1.04 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.17 per share, above estimates of $1.01 per share.
The company said it had factored in a 7 cent per share impact on earnings from the renovation of the New York store, but analysts said nerves over the potential risks to business had spurred some profit-taking on a 25 percent rise in shares this year.
""The only thing I can think of is that the market is spooked by this big renovation coming up. The stock also dropped the day it was announced,"" said retail sector research analyst Jane Hali.
""The store accounts for less than 10 percent of the global business but it could affect the North America business.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Jet Airways Ltd (NS:JET) on Tuesday set out to reassure investors it was taking measures to cut costs and boost revenue, a day after the beleaguered airline reported its second consecutive quarterly loss. 
Jet, part-owned by Etihad Airways, has been facing financial difficulties but has said it is confident it can slash costs and keep flying, dismissing reports it had told staff it was running out of cash. 
India is the world's fastest-growing aviation market, but rising fuel prices, a weaker rupee and price competition has pulled down airline profitability. InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (NS:INGL), operator of the country's leading carrier IndiGo, reported a 97 percent plunge in profit last month.
""The Indian aviation sector, although witnessing steady and robust traffic growth, has been passing through a tough phase,"" Jet's CEO Vinay Dube told analysts on a call. 
""Airlines have been unable to pass through this increased cost to consumers by increasing fares,"" Dube said, adding the industry could not sustain such low fares in the long run especially with fuel prices rising.
Shares in Jet tanked earlier this month after it deferred its earnings as the audit committee had not signed off on them ""pending closure of certain matters"".
Dube said the company and its auditors were not in disagreement over the financial results, and that Jet's account with its lenders was ""standard"" - indicating there had been no delay in meeting loan obligations. 
Jet, on Tuesday, also said it would invest in its business, cut costs in excess of 20 billion rupees ($285 million) in two years, and planned to raise funds by selling a stake in its frequent flyer program.
Some of the savings will come by reducing its maintenance and interest costs, sales and distribution expenses and rationalizing its fleet.
The company expects to save about 3.7 billion rupees this year on maintenance costs and expects a reduction of 6.5 billion rupees starting Jan. 1, 2019, Jet's chief financial officer Amit Agarwal told analysts. 
The airline owns about 16 wide-body aircraft worth between $750-$800 million, on which it has debt of about $280 million, and it intends to do a sale and leaseback on a portion of this fleet, Agarwal said. 
Jet raised $300 million during the quarter from banks and through lease incentives to meet its operational and interest expenses and pay down some debt, he said. The airline's net debt as of June 30 was 73.64 billion rupees.
It also plans to add 11 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft to its fleet this fiscal year, which it says are 15-18 percent more fuel efficient. Jet has placed a firm order for a total of 225 such aircraft.
The airline posted a loss of 13.23 billion rupees for the quarter ended June, compared with a profit of 535 million rupees a year earlier, despite a 6.4 percent jump in its revenue.

The rise in Brent prices had a negative impact of more than 6 billion rupees in the quarter and foreign exchange losses amounted to 3.44 billion rupees, Agarwal said.

The service is part of new Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol's plan to turnaround the burrito chain that has had its reputation and stock price take a hit from a series of food safety lapses.
Chipotle said diners would get free delivery on any order of $10 or more for a limited time, with delivery available in at over 1,800 Chipotle restaurants that DoorDash currently serves.
Analysts say another recent food safety incident at a Chipotle outlet in Ohio could also keep diners away from the restaurants.
Chipotle said the delivery option would be made available nationwide through its app and website, with DoorDash as the last mile delivery partner.
Niccol has also begun testing a loyalty program and new menu items as part of his turnaround efforts.

1183,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",10 unicorn tech startups had major exits last quarter — and the biggest was worth $53 billion,"The startup market has reached a point of maturity, with more and more startups seeing their valuations explode thanks to fruitful initial public offerings and acquisitions, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Views from the Valley report, published last week.
Despite a name that indicated uniqueness, quite a few startups are unicorns — private companies valued at $1 billion or more. In recent months, the number of unicorns has nearly tripled, rising from 54 at the beginning of 2017 to 158 in the second quarter of 2018, according to the report. 
But as the market gets more mature, the number of new unicorns is decelerating. Between 2014 and 2016, there was an average of 15 to 16 new unicorns each quarter. Now, there is an average of 5 to 6, though Q2 2018 only saw one new unicorn: the gaming communication software company Discord, which was last valued at $1.6 billion. 
Meanwhile, more and more of these $1 billion+ companies have seen big exits in the last few months, both through IPO and acquisition. 
In Q2 2018, 10 of these unicorn tech startups had major exits. These were the biggest exits, according to Goldman Sachs: 
The Stockholm, Sweden-based music streaming platform Spotify  went public in April at a valuation of $29.5 billion — $10 billion more than its last funding round, which valued the company at $19 billion. 
When the e-signature and transaction company DocuSign  went public in April, it was valued around $4.5 billion, far above its last funding round, which valued it at $3 billion. 
When the Czech cybersecurity company Avast Software went public in May, it was valued at around £2.4 billion, or $3.08 billion. Its last funding round valued the company at $1 billion."

""We are happy to report strong top- and bottom-line results for the second quarter that exceeded our expectations,"" CEO Hubert Joly said in the earnings release.

Deloitte said it had also launched legal services in Britain, moving onto turf of traditional law firms.

The nation’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell for a fifth day after Luigi Di Maio said in an interview with a local newspaper that the government may break the bloc’s 3 percent deficit pledge if that’s what’s needed to increase investment spending and boost the economy.
With Italy preparing to unveil its budget next month, tensions between the EU and the nation’s populist administration have unnerved investors who fear the country is on a collision course over its fiscal plans.Tuesday’s decline in Italian bonds pushed the yield on the 10-year notes up by four basis points to 3.21 percent, edging toward the 3.44 percent high seen in May as the euroskeptic administration’s ascent to power in Rome led to a meltdown in the country’s bond market. Continuing tensions since then have caused Italy to become the epicenter of euro-area financial volatility.
“We just have the ongoing concerns and comments as Italy prepares the budget,” said Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “We are testing the recent highs again in 10-year yields so the biggest near-term risk is we trade through there and potentially push the range back up toward 3.50 percent.”
In the run-up to the budget, banks including  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA have recommended cutting exposure to the nation’s assets. Italy’s coalition government is set to come up with public-finance and economic-growth targets by Sept. 27, with a draft budgetary plan to be submitted to the European Commission by Oct. 15.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a six-month high on Tuesday, lifted by investor optimism that a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement will go some way to averting a global trade war. 
Investors expect Canada too will agree to the new terms to preserve a three-nation pact, while U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone and the two leaders ""strongly supported ongoing discussions"" on trade, according to the White House. 
European and Asian shares followed Wall Street's lead, inching to multi-month highs after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes surged to fresh records on Monday led by gains in technology stocks. 
The dollar slipped to a four-week low and implied volatility across currencies and equity markets also eased, as investors took on greater risk appetite. Emerging market stocks hit their highest since Aug. 9.
""Global trade tensions have undoubtedly been the most significant source of risk in 2018,"" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.
""The U.S.–Mexico deal seemed to boost confidence that the trade war is moving closer to an end, and the next question is who's next to close a deal with Trump?"" he said.
MSCI's benchmark world share index followed on from Monday's best performance in over four months, rising 0.15 percent, while MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5 percent. 
A pan-European share index rose 0.3 percent for a third straight day of gains. Auto stocks continued to rally, adding 1.3 percent after enjoying their best day in a month on Monday - German carmakers rely on smooth trade between Mexico and the United States to sell Mexican-assembled vehicles into U.S. markets.
However, some analysts were cautious about the rally. Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, noted markets were assuming already that Canada would join the new U.S.-Mexico deal, but said: ""it is not a zero risk process"".
""If Canada does not join, then getting the agreement of (U.S.) Congress will be trickier, as fast-track authorization probably will not hold,"" he said. 
Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have been a drag on investor sentiment for much of the year despite solid economic fundamentals and two robust quarters of corporate earnings.
And the toughest battle in the trade war - with China - still looms. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough, as another round of tariffs came into effect. 
The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Monday that Chinese steel wheels exports were heavily subsidized and that it could impose duties on the product.
Chinese stocks were steady to weaker, though Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.6 percent.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said the trade deal was not necessarily positive for the outcome of talks with China, though they said risks of a generalized global trade war had abated somewhat.
""Despite this, Asia-Pacific equities including HK/China should benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar and risk-on moves,"" they added.
The dollar paused near one-month lows against a basket of currencies and the euro was near a one-month top at $1.1680. The greenback's index has retreated from near 14-month highs and its losses accelerated last week after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell disappointed dollar bulls by signaling only a gradual pace of rate rises, 
U.S. economic data - with consumer confidence figures due later in the day and the latest estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product expected on Wednesday - could determine the dollar's further moves.
But its pullback has offered some respite to battered emerging and commodity-reliant currencies. South Africa's rand has pulled off two-year lows hit earlier this month  There are exceptions, however. The Turkish lira fell another 1.5 percent against the dollar, adding to Monday's 2 percent fall as concerns have not abated about Turkey's rift with Washington and its monetary policies.  Italian borrowing costs too rose to three-month highs after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the country's public deficit could exceed the European Union's ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year.

""Asia Pacific has recovered and the U.S. also shows a good development,"" he said.

IWC, which is known for its Pilot's watches and its Da Vinci and Portugieser collections, invested 42 million Swiss francs ($42.2 million) in the new site that now has 238 staff but capacity for up to 400.
The brand is also pushing its ecommerce activities, expanding its online boutique to all of Europe in September after first launching it in the United States last year.

1208,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Ex-Temasek Executive Warns Debt Deal Won't Fix Noble Group,"(Bloomberg) -- Noble Group Ltd.’s foes aren’t going away. Less than 24 hours after the commodity trader won shareholder approval for its $3.5 billion debt-for-equity deal, long-standing critic Michael Dee said the revamped company will struggle to recover and shouldn’t be allowed to list shares in Singapore.
“I really don’t believe that we’re going to be in any different situation,” Dee, a former senior managing director at Singapore state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “The interest rate on the debt is way too high for a commodity trader,” he said.
Noble Group took a major step toward restructuring on Monday as shareholders backed the deal, paving the way for the trader to seek approval from senior creditors, as well as from courts in England and Bermuda for schemes of arrangement. Along with Iceberg Research, Dee’s been one of the company’s most vocal adversaries as it lost billions, defaulted and faced criticism of its accounts, which it’s rejected. Dee has also been critical of Singapore’s regulators, who’ve stood by their actions as the crisis unfolded.
The hedge funds backing the restructuring are “going to exit stage left, right, front and center, top and bottom: they’re not long-term holders, they’re making a trade,” Dee told Haidi Lun and Rishaad Salamat. “What will happen after this is that there’ll be a lot of hype, a lot of people will come out and try to push the line that this is going to be a New Noble, very successful, that it is going to go back up to its great grandeur and glory. It’s not.”
A spokesperson for Noble Group declined to comment on the remarks from Dee, who’s also a former regional chief executive officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Bonds Gain
The restructuring circular outlined New Noble’s planned borrowings, including up to $1.7 billion in bonds, in addition to trade finance. Interest rates on the bonds ranged from 5 to 10 percent, with some rising over time. Some have payable-in-kind terms, while others are pay-if-you-can in cash or payable-in-kind. That means unpaid interest would become part of the principal, it said.
Dee highlighted the notes’ terms. “It’s very telling that in the new debt they’re going to issue, they’re going to have a ‘PIK’ structure,” he said.
Under the plan, 70 percent of the equity in a revamped company will go to creditors, 10 percent to management, and the rest to shareholders, while the debt burden will be halved. On Tuesday, Noble Group’s shares initially rallied, then sank 13 percent, while its 2018 bonds touched a five-month high.
“I have to call a spade a spade,” Dee said on the regulators’ role overseeing Noble Group. “This has been a complete catastrophic meltdown.”
In the city-state, Singapore Exchange Ltd. has front-line responsibility for maintaining fair, orderly and transparent markets, backed by up the de facto central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Both have defended their roles as Noble Group imploded, most recently in remarks in response to comments from retail investors who’ve lost money.
SGX’s Actions
As Noble’s troubles mounted, SGX said it’s had frequent contact with the company, queried it for more detail on results, and requested that Noble appoint an independent financial adviser to assess the debt-for-equity plan. A spokesperson has said the exchange is committed to holding issuers and professionals responsible for their actions and opinions, and if there’s any evidence of wrongdoing, it’ll be referred to the appropriate authorities.
More than 86 percent of senior creditors back the rescue, and Chairman Paul Brough told the shareholder meeting the restructuring should be complete in two to three months. In a statement, Brough said it’s critical the restructuring be wrapped up “as soon as possible” to enable the group to operate with a sustainable capital structure and to capitalize on opportunities in Asia.
Noble also faces opposition from Iceberg Research, the group that first published critiques of the accounting in 2015, claiming profits were overstated. Led by a former employee Arnaud Vagner, Iceberg is now trying to organize a fresh legal challenge to the restructuring. Dee said he has no relationship with Iceberg, with the two arriving at similar findings independently.
Noble Group has consistently rejected Iceberg’s claims, and it’s pursuing a lawsuit against Vagner. At the shareholder meeting, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jackaman said the company was ready to defend itself vigorously against potential legal challenges.
“There should be a full, forensic accounting done to determine: ‘Am I right, or is the company right? Is Iceberg right, or is the management right?’” Dee said. “Let’s find out, let’s actually do that with somebody who’s truly independent.”

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Tesla's U-turn puts it back at square one on cash,"By Kate Duguid and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elon Musk's take-private plans for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc have evaporated, but the company's looming debt needs remain. 
With a debt load of about $10.5 billion and the possibility of an impending cash shortfall, Wall Street expects the luxury electric carmaker may need to raise funds before long. 
Tesla Chief Executive Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion take-private deal, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and may draw regulatory scrutiny.
None of that has done anything to help it with a looming issue: cash. 
Tesla, which has had just one quarter of positive free cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2013, has $1.3 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. Meanwhile it has just $1.3 billion of cash on hand after backing out $942 million of customer deposits on cars. 
With analysts forecasting a slowed, but continued, cash burn in the second half of 2018, Tesla may need to borrow up to $2 billion by the end of the year to stay afloat. 
In response to a request for comment, a Tesla representative referred to Musk's statement on the company's second-quarter earnings call when he said the company planned to pay its convertible debt with internally generated cash flow. 
DEBT RAISING
The most likely option, according to analysts, is a convertible debt issue. Musk has historically favored convertible bonds to raise capital, and Tesla and its SolarCity unit each have three issues of convertible senior notes, worth a total of $4.2 billion. 
Convertibles give owners the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price. They allow holders to benefit from a rising share price, while also offering bond-like protection if it falls. 
The one challenge of using more convertible debt, however, is ""that it drives more short sellers to your stock. And Musk does not want that,"" said Jeffrey Osborne, senior research analyst, Cowen Inc.
Frequently, convertible bond owners will hedge their positions by selling the underlying stock short. Moreover, the dilution caused by conversion could also pressure a stock, drawing the interest of short sellers.
Of the $1.3 billion Tesla has coming due in the next 12 months, $230 million is from a SolarCity convertible due on Nov. 1, and another $920 million from a Tesla convertible due on March 1, 2019. Tesla's shares, at $319.27, are a long way from the $560.64 needed to convert the SolarCity debt but have traded above the $359.87 March 2019 debt conversion price. 
Musk could also choose to offer convertible bond investors the opportunity to exchange their debt for equity below either or both strike prices, although that could require some assurances on the company's fundamentals.
Tesla's mountain of debt: https://reut.rs/2Mwlh5z
STRAIGHT DEBT
Tesla could issue straight debt akin to the 5.3 percent coupon junk bond coming due in 2025. That bond however, is trading well below par at 87.13 cents on the dollar, and so it would be unlikely that Tesla could get the sort of favorable terms they secured in their last offering. 
Krishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, which is among Tesla's top 10 bondholders, said that the level of scrutiny Musk would have to go through ""would be meaningfully higher in any new issuance."" 
EQUITY
Equity markets have historically been friendly to Tesla, however Musk said, on the company's second-quarter earnings call, that he would not tap them for cash. ""We'll not be raising any equity at any point... I have no expectation of doing so; do not plan to do so.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an investigation into Musk for potentially misleading investors when he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" for a $420 a share take-private deal, according to media reports. 
LEASE/ASSET-BACKED SECURITY DEAL 
Tesla could securitize automotive leases backed by drivers' monthly payments as it did earlier this year when it sold $546 million of bonds backed by leases on Model S and Model X cars. 
There are two problems with issuing new asset-backed securities. 
The first is that old vehicles may not sell for as much as expected given the increasing competition Tesla is facing in the electric vehicle space. Second, leases as a percentage of vehicles sold have fallen dramatically as it is not possible to lease a Model 3 sedan. While roughly 20 percent to 30 percent of Model S and Model Xs were leased, the Model 3 must be paid for in cash.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 09:42PM ET</span>",FCC report found no 'favoritism' on proposed Sinclair deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's inspector general said there was no evidence of impropriety relating to the proposed, and now defunct, merger of Sinclair Broadcast Group (O:SBGI) and  Tribune Media Co  (N:TRCO), concluding FCC Chairman Ajit Pai had not shown bias in favor of the deal.
According to its report released on Monday, the Office of Inspector General said there was ""no evidence, nor even the suggestion, of impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism toward Sinclair, or lack of impartiality related to the proposed Sinclair-Tribune merger.""
U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Frank Pallone, Democrats, asked the FCC inspector general last November to probe whether Pai was biased in favor of Sinclair, which had sought approval of a $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune. Sinclair announced on May 8, 2017, that it wanted to buy Tribune's 42 television stations in 33 U.S. markets and cable network WGN America.
Cummings and Pallone cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a 2016 Politico news report that Donald Trump's presidential campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable media coverage.
Pai said in a statement on Monday that he was pleased with the finding, adding that the suggestion that he favored any one company was ""absurd."" He could not immediately be reached for comment beyond the statement.
Pallone said in a statement that the report provided the ""first detailed responses to Congress’ questions. Beyond that, questions remain regarding the Chairman’s personal communications, which the IG noted were beyond his reach, and his conversations with Jared Kushner and (White House Counsel) Don McGahn."" 
The Sinclair deal was scuttled this month after the Republican-led FCC expressed opposition to the deal, questioning Sinclair's candor over the planned sale of some stations.
In December 2016 Politico reported, citing remarks by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now a White House senior adviser, that Trump's campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to try to secure better media coverage.
The Inspector General's report cited an email from Kushner to Pai on May 5, 2017, with the message, “Just tried you – had a quick thing to run by you” and indicated that phone records for that date showed a call from a blocked number at 10:03 a.m. The message was sent three days before the Sinclair deal was announced. 
The Inspector General's report said that Pai had said he could not recall that conversation.
The White House did not have an immediate comment on the report. 
The report also said that White House Counsel Don McGahn called Pai in July 2018 to make a ""status inquiry"" regarding the Sinclair deal. 
Pai disclosed the call from McGahn in testimony earlier this month before a U.S. Senate panel. He said it came around the same time he issued a July 16 statement that said he had “serious concerns” about the proposed takeover and proposed referring the matter to an administrative law judge.
Pai said McGahn did not express a view on the merger, but had seen a news report “and wanted to know what ... the action was.”
The Inspector General's report also said that days before taking office, President-Elect Trump discussed with Pai the ""legal framework"" of AT&T Inc's (N:T) proposal to buy media company Time-Warner. 
The report said Pai told the Inspector General that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss Pai's possible appointment to the SEC chairmanship. 

AT&T, which successfully fought off an effort by the Justice Department to kill the deal, declined to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday urged stock and options exchanges to work together with industry members to complete a long-overdue trading data base the regulator needs to police the market. 
The SEC ordered the exchanges, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to create the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) six years ago. The repository will allow the regulator to track all trades from their inception, pinpointing buyers, sellers, exchanges and brokers involved. 
But due to numerous delays, the project is now expected to be rolled out in phases starting in November and ending in November 2022, well after the original timeline of November 2017 to November 2019.
Exchanges and FINRA are creating the system along with Thesys, the firm picked to build the database.
A representative of the exchanges and FINRA working on the project was not immediately available for comment. 
If industry members continue to work together to get the project completed as quickly as possible, the SEC's trading and markets division said it would not recommend penalizing firms for not complying with the earlier deadlines.
Current holdups revolve around the technical specifications industry members need to begin sending data to the CAT, as well as adequate protections against hackers. It is also not clear who will pay for the project.
The idea of the CAT, which one former SEC commissioner likened to a Hubble Space Telescope for the securities markets, was born in 2008 and gained urgency after the May 2010 ""flash crash,"" when the stock market lost more than $1 trillion in minutes, before quickly rebounding.

It took regulators seven months to come up with an explanation through a hodgepodge of data sources, and five more years to realize that a trader in his parents' basement in London played a big role.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 06:26PM ET</span>","Tesla, Elon Musk win dismissal of lawsuit over Model 3 production","By Jonathan Stempel and Alexandria Sage
(Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed a securities fraud lawsuit in which Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) shareholders accused the electric car company and Chief Executive Elon Musk of misleading them about the progress of production of its Model 3 vehicle.
In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said that while shareholders claimed that Tesla fell short of its production goals, ""federal securities laws do not punish companies for failing to achieve their targets.""
Breyer said the shareholders have until Sept. 28 to amend their complaint. Their lawyer, Laurence Rosen, did not respond to a request for comment.
The case is separate from lawsuits accusing Tesla and Musk of scheming to hurt short-sellers through Musk's Aug. 7 tweets about taking the Palo Alto, California-based company private, and that funding had been ""secured.""
Musk abandoned that proposal late Friday night.
Tesla formally launched the Model 3 in July 2017, touting it as a vehicle for the masses, and attracted deposits from more than 500,000 potential customers.
But shareholders said Musk knew Tesla was ""woefully unprepared"" to meet its production goal of 5,000 Model 3s per week, and that Tesla's share price was inflated until after the company finally cut its production target last November.
Belief in the Model 3 had helped propel Tesla's share price 62 percent higher in the 1-1/2 years after the Palo Alto, California-based company unveiled it in March 2016.
But the judge said shareholders failed to show that Tesla needed to be clearer that Model 3 production could fall short.
The company eventually blamed its production shortfall on ""bottlenecks"" at its battery factory outside Reno, Nevada and its assembly plant in Fremont, California.
""Plaintiffs are correct that defendants' qualifications would not have been meaningful if defendants had known that it was impossible for Tesla to meet its stated production goals, not merely highly unlikely,"" Breyer wrote. ""The facts plaintiffs have put forth do not tend to establish that this was the case.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breyer's decision is dated Aug. 24.

The case is Wochos v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-05828.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 04:51PM ET</span>","S&P 500, Nasdaq hit new highs on U.S.-Mexico trade deal","By Stephen Culp
(Reuters) - A broad-based rally pushed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record-high closes for the second straight session on Monday as a trade agreement reached between the United States and Mexico buoyed investor sentiment. 
Technology stocks led the Nasdaq above the 8,000 mark for the first time and the sector provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500.
A senior U.S. trade official announced a deal with Mexico to replace the North American Trade Agreement and said talks with Canada were expected to begin immediately.
The upbeat trade outlook was further boosted by news that Washington was pressuring the European Union to accelerate tariff talks.
Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have been a drag on investor sentiment for much of the year despite solid economic fundamentals and two robust quarters of corporate earnings.
""It takes a long time for people to come out of the concerns related to those thousand-point down days and feel a little bit more comfortable,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. ""And the trade concerns and the tariffs, that played a part in it, that's what held it back.
""People are feeling a little bit more positive,"" Pavlik added. 
Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, said he was optimistic about the trade deal. Shares of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) were up 3.2 percent while General Motors (N:GM) rose 4.8 percent.
Tariff-sensitive companies  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) were up 1.2 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, leading the industrial sector's advance and pulling the Dow higher. 
The Mexico-focused iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (N:EWW) was up 2.1 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 259.29 points, or 1.01 percent, to 26,049.64, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 22.05 points, or 0.77 percent, to 2,896.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 71.92 points, or 0.91 percent, to 8,017.90.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, nine ended the session in positive territory, with the biggest percentage gains in materials (SPLRCM), financials (SPNY) and industrials (SPLRCI).
Defensive utilities (SPLRCU) and real estate <.SPLRCR> sectors were the only percentage losers. 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) stock dipped 1.1 percent, paring earlier losses following news that Chief Executive Elon Musk was scrapping his scheme to take the electric automaker private.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) was the biggest percentage loser in the S&P 500, down 4.8 percent after Wedbush downgraded the burrito chain's shares.
Luxury retailer Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF) ended the session down 1.3 percent ahead of its second-quarter earnings report expected early on Tuesday. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 159 new highs and 31 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.19 billion shares, compared with the 6.27 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1225,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Trade Ball in Canada’s Court
Following today’s strong market performance across the board, investors will be looking for any updates to further progress in U.S. trade deals.
With the U.S. and Mexico agreeing to a deal, the pressure is now on Canada, whose participation in a new trilateral deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is not guaranteed.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he planned to talk to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau soon, according to Reuters, which means that news on progress or tweets from Trump could swing the markets at any time.
In addition, Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto could also talk to Trudeau. Both sides met Sunday and expressed support of the three-party agreement.China remains the wild card, as Trump downplayed a near-term progress in the ongoing trade battles between the world’s top two economies.
2. Can  Best Buy  Keep Its Rally Going?
Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) reports earnings before the bell, with shareholders hoping it can keep the retail rally going.
Despite the talk about Amazon’s dominance in all things retail, any talk of Best Buy’s demise would be greatly exaggerated as far as the stock market is concerned.
Wall Street analysts are predicting a rise in sales and profit from the year-ago period.
And investors have piled into Best Buy shares recently. The stock is up about 20% in the last three months.
Compare that with the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT), which is up about 10.5%, and the overall S&P 500, which gained about 8% over the same time period.
Also in retail, investors will get earnings from Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF).
3. Slight Drop in Consumer Confidence Expected
Along with retailer results, the market will get the latest figures on consumer confidence on Tuesday.
The Conference Board will release its consumer confidence measure at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the index for August dipped slightly from July to 126.8. The index has been above 120 for more than a year.
At 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), the goods trade balance for July arrives, with economists predicting a slight widening of the deficit. At the same time the preliminary numbers for August wholesale inventories come out.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.01%. The S&P 500 rose 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.91%.
President Donald Trump announced his administration had reached a bilateral deal with Mexico, reducing investor fears somewhat over the prospect of a global trade war, despite concerns that Canada could be booted from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if the country fails to make concessions.
""By saying Canada could be left out, the US is threatening to take a tough line in those talks,"" CIBC said in a note to clients. ""The scenario poses uncertainty for the Canadian economy, and could prompt Bank of Canada to hold off on a rate rise early next month.""
The deal, which Trump prosed calling the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement, brings Trump a step closer to overhauling NAFTA, a name he said had a ""bad connotation"" for the United States.
In a sign of improved sentiment on trade, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), which are trade bellwethers because of their large international exposure, saw their shares end the day up sharply.
Shares of farming companies, meanwhile, also rallied following the deal as Trump said Mexican officials promised the country would start buying as much U.S. farm product as possible.
Fertilizer producers Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) rose 3.3% and 1.7%, respectively, and seed giant DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) rose 2.3%.
Financials, mostly banks, rose sharply as U.S. bond yields rose, brushing off somewhat dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday, when he stressed that rate hikes would continue at a gradual pace.
Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks, boosting their net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
Rallying energy stocks also supported the move higher in the broader market, as oil prices added to gains from last week despite an uptick in production from major oil producers.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery added 15 cents to settle at $68.87 a barrel.
On the corporate news front, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock came under pressure after the company scrapped plans to go private, raising further investor doubt over the accuracy of Musk's recent claim in a tweet that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share.
""We expect [Tesla] shares to be under pressure in the near term as investors question the go-private process and the outcome of staying public,"" Baird said.

1243,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 03:53PM ET</span>","Aegon, Transamerica in $97.6 million SEC settlement for misleading investors","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Four Transamerica entities will pay $97.6 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that they sold investments that were supposedly based on quantitative models but which did not work as intended, the regulator said on Monday.
The settlement with the units of Netherlands-based  Aegon  NV (AS:AEGN) includes a $36.3 million civil fine plus $61.3 million of disgorged sums and interest, all of which will be returned to investors.
It resolves claims against Aegon USA Investment Management LLC, Transamerica Asset Management Inc, Transamerica Capital Inc and Transamerica Financial Advisors Inc over 15 mutual funds, variable life investments, variable annuities and separately managed account strategies sold from July 2011 to June 2015.
The defendants did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Aegon has said it managed $982 billion of revenue-generating investments in 2017.
According to the SEC, the quantitative models had been developed by a junior analyst with no experience in portfolio management or formal training in financial modeling.
It said employees knew in advance of errors by the analyst, citing internal emails that said ""we take the hit if he screws it up.""
The SEC said Transamerica stopped using the models upon finding numerous errors, but failed to tell investors.
Transamerica's conduct subjected investors to ""significant hidden risks and deprived them of the ability to make informed investment decisions,"" said C. Dabney O'Riordan, co-chief of the SEC enforcement division's asset management unit.
Aegon spokesman Dick Schiethart said in a phone interview that the company reported the errors to the SEC and cooperated fully. The company set aside $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for a settlement.
Bradley Beman, Aegon USA Investment Management's former global chief investment officer, and Kevin Giles, its former director of new initiatives, were fined a respective $65,000 and $25,000 to settle related charges.
Jonathan Harris, a lawyer for Beman, said in a statement ""there was no intent and no personal benefit to Mr. Beman,"" and that the analyst did not report to Beman.

Giles' lawyer Thomas Newkirk declined to comment. Beman and Giles also did not admit or deny wrongdoing.

1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",ETF Buyers Scoop Up Cheap Chinese Stocks Amid Fresh Tariff Hopes,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors poured cash into the largest exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese stocks last week at a pace unseen in over three years as officials held talks on the trade dispute between China and the U.S.
The $4.7 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, known by its ticker FXI, took in more than $415 million over the five days, the most since May 2015. The fund tracks large-cap stocks, and its three biggest holdings are China Construction Bank Corp., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
Monday marks the final day of hearings on the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, which may already be “baked into most market expectations,” Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters.
There were signs Monday, though, that the optimism may be overdone. After last week’s talks between U.S. and Chinese officials concluded, President Donald Trump declined to comment on any progress, fueling speculation that the discussions did not go well.
Another China-focused fund, the $745 million Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF, or ASHR, took in $46 million on Aug. 23, the largest one-day inflow in more than two years.
Bargain Buyers
There also was some aggressive buying of call options in FXI and ASHR last week, as sentiment pushed China stocks lower and created a buying opportunity, said Christian Fromhertz, founder and chief executive officer of the trader education firm Tribeca Trade Group.
Earnings from internet behemoths like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent may have also carved out an entry point for bargain buyers. Alibaba shares whipsawed after the company posted results, which came after a rout in tech stocks that featured Tencent’s biggest profit drop in a decade.
Investors in FXI could have done some “buy the news” trading after Tencent’s report, according to Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading Institutional Services.
“There’s relief earnings is over, which has them buying,” Lutz said."
1247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Fed Paper Questions ‘This Time Is Different’ Yield Curve Theory,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has bad news for those declaring “this time is different” on yield curve inversion: adjusting for altered term premium doesn’t help much.
Policy makers and market participants alike are watching as the gap between short- and longer-term rates narrows. Historically, recession has followed such inversions, though it’s unclear why that relationship exists.
Some, including former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, have suggested that depressed term premium -- the bonus investors require to take on the added risk of holding longer-dated bonds -- could mean the curve’s flattening doesn’t herald a downturn this time around. The logic is that if long rates are lower thanks to government bond-buying programs and other structural factors, the curve could invert with just mildly restrictive monetary policy. In the past, it took very restrictive Fed policy to push short rates above the long end of the curve. Against today’s changed backdrop, an inversion could be a less potent predictor of recession.
But San Francisco Fed research advisers Michael Bauer and Thomas Mertens push back on that theory. By subtracting out an estimate of the term premium, they obtain an “expectations only” spread between short- and longer-dated securities. By separating the two drivers, they find that inversion signals high recession risk whether it stems from a low term premium or low short-rate expectations holding down long-term rates.
“We do not find an empirical basis for adjustments based on the term premium,” they write in a research paper.
It’s “plausible” that long-term rates are lower because the Fed’s crisis-era bond buying program, they allow. But there are two big ifs. First, it isn’t clear how much of an effect bond buying has had on rates. Second, low term premiums may have contributed to overheating in the past, so even if quantitative easing is the cause, the result could still be heightened recession risk.
“There is no clear evidence in the data that ‘this time is different’ or that forecasters should ignore part of the current yield curve flattening because of the presumed macro-financial effects of QE,” the researchers write.
It isn’t all bad news. Today’s flattening yield curve “provides no sign of an impending recession,” they write. The most reliable summary recession predictor, by their analysis, is the 10-year-three-month spread, which remains nearly 1 percentage point away from inversion.
Bauer and Mertens are also careful to note that correlation is not causation: because it’s not clear what ties inversions and recessions, “great caution is therefore warranted in interpreting the predictive evidence.”"

The German carmaker was ordered by the United States Department of Justice to deliver three annual reports examining its violations to Larry Thompson, a former deputy U.S. attorney general, after it was caught manipulating pollution tests.
Thompson is now acting as an Independent Compliance Auditor (ICA) as part of a plea agreement reached after U.S. authorities blew the whistle on Volkswagen's excessive diesel pollution on Sept. 18, 2015. 
""With respect to the VW defendants' assertions of privilege and work product, the ICA has disagreed with some of the VW defendants' assertions,"" Thompson's interim report said on Monday.
""The VW defendants have promised further improvements in their provision of information, and increased the frequency of discussions with the ICA regarding this topic.""
Thompson's role is to ensure VW's systems conform to new compliance standards.
In 2017, the ICA identified 176 ""corrective actions"" to be taken by Volkswagen and a further 240, in 2018, the report said without providing further detail. 
Since 2015, Volkswagen has insisted that its diesel cheating was the work of low level executives.
But earlier this year, Rupert Stadler, the chief executive of VW's premium brand Audi, was remanded in custody for potential obstruction of justice related to an emissions probe, and U.S. authorities have filed criminal charges against former VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn.
Both executives deny wrongdoing.
Since 2015, prosecutors in Braunschweig, near where VW is headquartered, have identified 39 suspects for their involvement in an emissions cheating scandal and have also investigated other companies including Daimler auto supplier Bosch for separate emissions issues.
Braunschweig prosecutors are also investigating Volkswagen's current chairman and chief executive to see whether VW executives informed markets in a timely manner about the financial fallout from the scandal. Volkswagen has said its management has not violated disclosure rules.
Hiltrud Werner, VW's board member for integrity and legal affairs, said the carmaker was working steadily to adapt its systems and code of conduct to learn from the crisis.
Volkswagen wants to put integrity on an equal footing with world class profitability and manufacturing world class vehicles, a task that will take until 2025, she said.
""We face a marathon ahead of us to implement this,"" Werner said.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 12:19PM ET</span>",Autos lead European equity gains on NAFTA deal optimism,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European auto shares surged more than 2 percent on Monday as news of a U.S.-Mexico agreement on NAFTA added to the bullish sentiment generated by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell's market-friendly speech.
A British public holiday thinned trading volumes across the region but European markets opened broadly firmer after Powell late last week affirmed the U.S. central bank's current gradual pace of rate hikes. The comments sent Wall Street to record highs on Friday. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) closed 0.5 percent higher, as the U.S. S&P500 and Nasdaq added to gains, after a Mexican source said the two countries had reached agreement in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump had suggested earlier on Monday that the United States and Mexico were close to a ""big deal"".
The euro stocks index (STOXXE) as well as Germany's DAX (GDAXI) touched 2-1/2-week highs, with the former closing 0.9 percent higher and the latter riding 1.2 percent higher on the back of the auto rally.
Car shares enjoyed their best day in a month (SXAP) with gains of 2.2 percent. German carmakers, especially, rely on smooth trade between Mexico and the U.S. to sell vehicles made in Mexican plants into the U.S. market.
""The biggest risks the market were discounting were trade wars, so any reduction in trade war risk such as NAFTA talks or even Trump trying to find bilateral deals, has pushed U.S. shares to new records and will support markets,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities and portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Milan.
BMW (DE:BMWG), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Porsche  and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) rose 2.5 to 3.0 percent. 
However, also in auto news, the Germany-listed shares of U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (TG:TSLA) fell almost 4 percent on the Tradegate exchange. Tesla's U.S. shares dipped around 3.3 percent after Chief Executive Elon Musk called off a bid to take the company private.
Outside trade-driven moves, Metro (DE:B4B) shares surged 13.3 percent after Ceconomy (DE:CECG) announced it may join family-owned Haniel in selling a stake in the German retailer to an investor group led by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky.
 Lundin Petroleum  (ST:LUPE) shares climbed 3.5 percent after Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) increased its resource estimate for the Johan Sverdrup oilfield, in which Lundin has a 22.6 percent stake. 
Equinor, which has a 40 percent stake in the field, gained 1.2 percent.
The easing of trade tensions should be good news for the STOXX 600 (STOXX) which is down 1.2 percent year-to-date due to political developments in Italy and Turkey. There was also good news on the data front on Monday, with a robust German business sentiment survey adding to signs of an improving euro zone outlook.
But while companies have delivered 10.9 percent year-on-year growth in second-quarter earnings, valuations are low given risks such as Italy's budget, which will be thrashed out in September.
""Europe is one of the cheapest markets in the world, there is for sure a risk premium implied in the valuation,"" said Banor SIM's Meda.
Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) underperformed rivals, rising just 0.3 percent.

""The only cloud on the horizon is Italy,"" Meda added. ""The feeling I have is nobody has any will to take any risk in the next couple of weeks before we get more clarity on the budget.""

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 11:53AM ET</span>",Australia inquiry finds pension funds broke rules,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Initial findings from a powerful inquiry into Australia's financial sector strongly criticized pension funds run by National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank for regulatory breaches including overcharging customers and failing to act in their best interest. 
The findings from the Royal Commission, released late Friday, said some banks acted in an ""ethically unsound"" manner with a disregard for regulators and the law, and also criticized two of the country's financial watchdogs.
CBA declined to comment. NAB responded on Saturday saying it disagreed with some of the inquiry's findings and would address them in a response to the Royal Commission's closing submissions by Aug. 31. It did not provide details on which parts of the findings it disagreed with.
""We take our obligations to uphold the law seriously. Where we get it wrong, we expect to be held accountable,"" NAB said in an emailed statement.
""We are also focused on earning the trust and respect of or customers every day, and when we do not live up to their expectations we will make it right.""
The Royal Commission inquiry into financial services misconduct began earlier this year and this month shone a spotlight on the country's A$2.6 trillion ($1.90 trillion) superannuation or pension funds, many of which are owned by the country's largest banks.
The Royal Commission is expected to submit an initial report to the government by the end of September but the probe has already rattled financial investors and led to senior management shake-up and CEO resignations.
Over the past few weeks, the Royal Commission has revealed examples of major breaches of responsibility by institutions that hold workers' retirement accounts including dishonorable conduct, charging dead customers fees and lax senior management oversight.
On Friday, the counsel assisting the inquiry listed a series of breaches by the National Australia Bank saying senior officials demonstrated ""a lack of insight into the problems"" and ""an unwillingness to acknowledge problems with the behavior of entities for which they were responsible.""
The problems included fees for no service, failure to be open and transparent with the regulator and failure to assess whether it should refund fees, among others.
""Assessed as a whole, it is submitted that this behavior indicates a disregard on the part of the NAB Group for members of the relevant superannuation funds, for regulators and for the law,"" the 223-page report noted. 
The findings also listed a string of regulatory breaches by the CBA, while AMP and IOOF were not spared either. 
Friday's report criticized regulators too. 
It said the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority was reluctant to commence court proceedings against erring lenders. The statement also raised questions over the Australian Securities & Investment Commission's (ASIC) competence as an effective conduct regulator.
ASIC has not commenced any civil penalty proceedings against banks for fees for no service, the findings noted.
""It has not yet turned its mind to the question of what profits the banks and AMP have derived from receiving money, without providing service, and having only been required to remediate customers.""
Neither APRA nor ASIC were immediately available for comment.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi king tipped the scale against Aramco IPO plans,"LONDON (Reuters) - The king spoke, and a $2 trillion dream went up in smoke.
For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prepared to place up to 5 percent of its national oil company on the stock market. Officials talked up the Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) with international exchanges, global banks and U.S. President Donald Trump.
The planned listing was to be the cornerstone of the kingdom’s promised economic overhaul and, at a targeted $100 billion, the biggest IPO ever. It was the brainchild of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir apparent of the world's largest oil exporter.
But after months of setbacks, the international and domestic legs of the IPO were pulled.
The reason: the prince's father King Salman stepped in to shelve it, three sources with ties to government insiders told Reuters. 
The decision came after the king met with family members, bankers, and senior oil executives, including a former Aramco CEO, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity. Those consultations took place during Ramadan, which ended in the middle of June. 
The king's interlocutors told him that the IPO, far from helping the kingdom, would undermine it. Their main concern was that an IPO would bring full public disclosure of Aramco's financial details, the sources said. 
In late June, the king sent a message to his diwan, or administrative office, demanding that the IPO be called off, the three sources said. The king's decision is final, a second source said. 
""Whenever he says 'no', there is no budging,"" the source said. 
After Reuters reported last week that the deal had been shelved, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government was committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future.
A senior Saudi official referred Reuters to that statement and repeated that the government, Aramco’s shareholder, was working toward an IPO when conditions were right.
""We are surprised that despite this statement, that the Government continues actively to plan for the IPO, Reuters persists in asking questions alleging that plans are halted.""
""Aramco’s shareholder is the Government of Saudi Arabia. His majesty, King Salman, has delegated management of the IPO to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince, and a Committee which includes the Ministers for Energy, Finance and Economy. Therefore, decisions around the nature and timing of the IPO, will be decided by the Committee for the Government’s approval,"" the official said.
In a country ruled for decades by the Al Saud dynasty, it is not surprising that the king ultimately decides. But the shelving of the Aramco IPO is a major blow to the prince's Vision 2030 reform program, which aims to fundamentally transform Saudi Arabia's oil-dependent, state-driven economy.
It suggests the king is keeping the new unilateral power of the young prince - accrued soon after his father's accession to the throne in January 2015 - in check.
It also raises doubts about Riyadh's management of the IPO process and commitment to making the economy more transparent, some investors say. 
TAKING THE REINS
While King Salman has the final say on policy, he has given great authority to his son, who is known as MbS.
After assuming powers as defense minister and chief of the royal court in January 2015, MbS launched a war in Yemen, adopted a more assertive stance toward arch-rival Iran, and implemented a diplomatic and trade boycott of Qatar.
Taking the reins of a powerful new economic council, he set out to tighten state spending, grow the private sector and win foreign investment.
The king also allowed him to push through high-profile social reforms including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the deeply conservative Muslim country.
MbS entered the line of succession in April 2015, replacing an uncle as deputy crown prince. Two years later, he was elevated to crown prince in a palace coup that removed his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the interior minister.
The king has intervened at times. 
Most notably, when MbS gave the impression last year that Riyadh endorsed the Trump administration’s still nebulous Middle East peace plan, including U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the king made a public correction. 
At the Arab League summit in April, he reaffirmed Riyadh's commitment to the Arab and Muslim identity of Jerusalem following an uproar in the Islamic world.  
""The king is obsessed with the idea of how history will judge him. Will he be the king who sold Aramco, who sold Palestine?"" the second source said. 
GRINDING TO A HALT
It is not clear exactly which of the IPO arguments prompted King Salman to make the decisive call on Aramco.
But industry experts and sources previously told Reuters that preparations had been slowing for months for at least two reasons: scepticism about MbS's public declaration in 2016 that the sale would give the whole company a value of $2 trillion valuation, and concern about the legal risks and tough disclosure requirements associated with a foreign listing.
By April, Aramco stopped paying some of the banks working on the deal their retainer fee, three banking sources told Reuters. This is usually a fixed fee to ensure advisors do not lose out completely if the deal falters. An Aramco official declined to comment.
Then, while the king was deliberating, in mid-June, the banks, including JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), were invited to pitch for something different.
They were instead asked to present proposals for Aramco's acquisition of a stake in petrochemicals giant SABIC from the sovereign wealth fund PIF, a banking source said.
That was an initial sign that plans for the listing were stalling and that Riyadh was looking to raise funds elsewhere, the banking sources said. 
The senior Saudi official said that Aramco's interest in acquiring a stake in SABIC was in line with its objective of being the world's leading energy and integrated chemicals business, and did not alter the government's intent to list Aramco. 
""Transferring SABIC’s ownership from the PIF to Saudi Aramco will enable PIF to boost strategies and governance and enhance PIF’s investment portfolio,"" the official said.
""Such a strategic acquisition would necessarily have an impact on the timeline, but not the intent, of an IPO (of Aramco)."" 
Spokeswomen for JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on whether their banks have any role in the SABIC deal.
BLOW TO AGENDA
Saudi Arabia can still generate cash from alternative sources and move ahead with other reforms. But MbS had promised the listing would help create a culture of openness in the secretive kingdom.
As well as raising concerns about that commitment to transparency, the shelved IPO contributes to a sense of unpredictability after scores of top royals, ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an anti-corruption campaign last November.
The sources said that even though the king's decision was a blow to the prince's agenda, he is still the favorite son and heir with a major influence on policy.
Rather, they say, it suggests the king wants to show that he will be the deciding voice for the foreseeable future.

In June, Walmart announced it sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to Advent, partially exiting an underperforming business and taking a non-cash charge of roughly $4.5 billion.
Advent is deploying the money in three installments, the document released last week showed. The first two capital raises will total 750 million reais each. The first was already completed and the second is expected for next year. The remaining amount will be invested by 2021, the document said.
Patrice Etlin, a managing partner at Advent International in Brazil, said in June that the private equity firm would invest billions of reais to convert unprofitable hypermarkets into cash-and-carry wholesale stores. New store openings are not in Advent's plans.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 10:49AM ET</span>",Tesla shares dip 3 percent after Musk abandons buyout,"By Joshua Franklin and Sonam Rai
(Reuters) - Shares in Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) fell just under 3 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk abandoned his plan to take the electric carmaker private, with analysts saying the company needed new blood among senior management to prop up its standing with investors. 
The billionaire entrepreneur said in a blog post late on Friday that consultations, done with the help of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), had shown most of Tesla's existing shareholders opposed the deal that he proposed on Twitter three weeks ago to widespread shock on Wall Street.
""We are hopeful that ... the past 17 days will lead the Board down the path to bringing on a more operational CEO or at a minimum a COO,"" Cowen and Co analysts said in a note to clients. 
Tesla's shares, already down nearly 15 percent from a peak on Aug. 7 when Musk tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" for a buyout at $420 a share, initially fell more than 5 percent in European and premarket trading in New York. 
They recovered, however, to stand down just 2.8 percent lower at $314 by 8.30 e.t..
Notes from Wall Street analysts questioned Musk's credibility going forward in the face of a possible investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the factual accuracy of an Aug. 7 tweet that funding for the buyout deal was ""secured"".
""Musk's involvement in the company is critical, but now more than ever a solid #2 - someone with strong operational background that can help Tesla move from ideas to execution - is crucial,"" analyst Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets wrote in a client note.
Tesla said on Sunday it was not searching for a chief operating officer.
""While we are always looking for highly talented executives (...) there is no active COO search,"" a spokesman said by email. 
With Musk's idea for a buyout backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund now off the table, attention was zeroing in on Tesla's efforts to become profitable, its cash reserves and what steps Musk could take to raise fresh capital.
Tesla had $2.78 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, after a record $718 million loss. 
In early August, before the buyout plan was made public, Tesla reiterated a forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, under normal accounting rules, and Musk said the company would not need to raise more cash. 
A Tesla spokesman on Sunday also referred back to those previous comments.
""With its long term mission intact but short term growth shaky, serious gaps in execution skills and a board under pressure for not assuming its duties, now may be the time for third parties to get involved, be it from technology or even oil,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois told clients.
One of Tesla's biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals.
Monday's fall would still leave shares in the company 27 percent above a low of $244.59 hit on April 2, a day before the electric carmaker released its production and Model 3 deliveries report for the first quarter.
TAPPING CAPITAL MARKETS 
Investors in Tesla's bonds and convertible debt had also already shown skepticism that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize, unconvinced by Musk's tweet or subsequent blog post in which he could only make the case for going private and not list clear backing. 
Analysts have suggested a capital raise may be required soon to boost investor confidence but investment bankers who are not working for the company said over the weekend it would also contradict Musk's promise that Tesla is adequately funded.
This week would also be an inopportune time for a capital raising, given that many bankers and investors are away ahead of the Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday. 
""We see the company raising $2 billion in 4Q18, through convertible debt, which may prove a challenge if there still is an ongoing SEC case open,"" Cowen and Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a client note. 
The high price investors have put on Tesla's shares has allowed Musk to expand U.S. production, invest in building out a vehicle charging network and start work on new models including a small sport utility vehicle, a new Roadster and a semi-truck even as the company burned cash.

Tesla earlier this year announced plans to build a battery and vehicle assembly complex in China. Musk said earlier this month that the company's ""default plan"" would be to fund that expansion by borrowing money from Chinese banks.

Retail sales are forecast to reach 1.28 million units, compared with 1.26 million a year ago.
The sales are expected to gain with no large disruptions from storms this year, said Thomas King, senior vice president of JD Power's data and analytics division.
Last year, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall during the end of August, affecting Labor Day sales events, JD Power and LMC said.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 16.8 million vehicles, up from 16.5 million units in the same month in 2017, they said.
The forecast is based on the first 16 selling days of the month.
""The auto industry still faces a prolonged and elevated level of trade risk, but overall sales are holding steady,"" said Jeff Schuster, president of Americas Operations and Global Vehicle Forecasts at LMC Automotive.
The consultants said average incentive spending per vehicle to date in August is $3,744, down from $3,886. The decline in incentive spending continues to be driven by reduced spending on cars, down $448, while spending on trucks and SUVs is up $22.
LMC raised its 2018 forecast for total light-vehicle sales to 17.2 million, or 20,000 vehicles higher than 2017.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",German antitrust watchdog plans action on Facebook this year,"By Douglas Busvine
BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's antitrust watchdog expects to take first steps this year in its probe against Facebook (O:FB) after finding that the social media giant abused its market dominance to gather data on people without their knowledge or consent.
The probe is being closely watched in Europe amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the extensive use of targeted ads by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States. 
The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services - and its online tracking of people who aren't even members.
""We are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,"" cartel office President Andreas Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take ""first steps"" this year. He declined to elaborate.
The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones. 
Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily.
Facebook responded earlier this year to the cartel office's request for information, and the authority was reviewing whether new features - such as a ""clear history"" option announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May - would address its concerns.
""We need to establish whether this affects our investigation and addresses our concerns,"" Mundt said.
Separately, Mundt confirmed comments he made in a newspaper interview earlier this month that he may launch an investigation into the e-commerce industry under new powers that enable the cartel office to launch sector-wide probes.
The focus would be on so-called ""hybrid"" platforms such as U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon (O:AMZN) that sell their own products and services, but that also host third-party traders.
""Our question is: what is the relationship between the platform, which itself is a very powerful trader, and the traders who use the platform?"" said Mundt. He added that Amazon was the best-known of the e-commerce platforms but his interest in the matter extended to other players.
The cartel office would not be looking at suspected tax evasion by third-party traders on e-commerce platforms - an issue that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has vowed to tackle - saying this was a matter for economic policy makers.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Turkey's economic pain felt as far as Tennessee,"By Megan Davies and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkey's currency crisis has roiled emerging-markets investors far and wide, including the U.S. state of Tennessee, where the state's retirement system is the biggest institutional holder in a Turkey exchange-traded fund (ETF). 
The Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System (TCRS), which manages a retirement plan for public employees statewide, was the largest institutional shareholder in the U.S.-based iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (O:TUR), according to Thomson Reuters data based on public filings as of June 30, with more than with 880,000 shares valued at around $19 million as of Friday's value.
The Turkey ETF has lost around half its value for the year to date, hit by worries about Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's influence over monetary policy and a worsening diplomatic rift with the United States. The lira (TRYUSD=R) is down more than 37 percent this year and the country's BIST 100 stock index (XU100) is down around 22 percent.
It was a reversal from the prior year, when the Turkey ETF generated a total return of nearly 38 percent in 2017, including dividends, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""It is a obviously a frustrating situation and it's a real shame what's happening in the country,"" Michael Brakebill, TCRS's chief investment officer, said in an interview on Friday. 
Still, the investment was a small part of the fund, which at the end of its fiscal year on June 30 had a value estimated at $49.7 billion and an annual return of 8.19 percent, according to data the fund provided.
""We own thousands of things and there are going to be a bunch that will go wrong and this is one of those,"" said Brakebill.
TCRS invested in the iShares Turkey fund in 2012, it said. 
The retirement system had a strategy of building up a passive portfolio of single-country ETFs so it could exclude countries that ranked poorly on third-party indexes of corruption and democracy. That meant excluding the largest emerging market, China, according to one of the fund's investment reports.
The portfolio weights individual country ETFs by their market size relative to the overall benchmark. TCRS said it did not take an active position, either positively or negatively, on Turkey.
""This particular incident doesn't make us rethink the strategy,"" said Brakebill. ""It is part and parcel with what we walk through in the risks involved with emerging markets.""

In a separate email, Brakebill added that with a rapidly growing population of 80 million, Turkey embodies the ""potentials and risks of emerging market investments,"" although he said the retirement system had been ""disappointed"" with its investments in the country.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2018 05:29AM ET</span>","World stocks at highest in over two weeks, China's yuan firms","By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets rose to their highest level in more than two weeks on Monday as reassuring comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve chief, an easing in trade war jitters and a bid by China's central bank to stabilize the yuan lifted risk appetite.
A stronger-than-expected German business sentiment survey added to the upbeat mood in Europe, with stock markets in Paris and Frankfurt up 0.4 percent each (GDAXI) (FCHI). British markets were closed for a public holiday. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 1.1 percent and Japan's blue-chip Nikkei closed at a 10-week high (N225). 
That left the MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, at its highest level since Aug. 9.
Comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday affirming that the U.S. central bank was sticking with its strategy of gradual rate hikes to protect economic growth sparked a rally in stocks that gathered pace as a new week swung into gear. 
Helping to brighten the mood, U.S. and Mexican trade negotiators are seen as close to reaching a common position on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo saying on Sunday talks have ""continued to make progress"".
The talks will resume on Monday and a positive outcome is expected to ease concerns about an escalation in global trade tensions. 
""The (NAFTA) talks add to the sense that while the U.S. is still bogged down in its trade conflict with China, it is perhaps more willing to compromise elsewhere such as with Mexico and the EU,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX and emerging market research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
""It's decreasing the risk of a global trade war.""
MSCI World stock index: https://reut.rs/2Nkf2Ow
YUAN ON FIRMER GROUND
A strengthening in the Chinese yuan, one causality of heightened trade tensions, also boosted sentiment in world markets.
The yuan hit a 2-1/2-week high versus the dollar  after China's central bank revived a ""counter-cyclical factor"" in its daily fixing to support the currency, arresting a record 10-week slide that has rattled global markets and irritated Washington.
The announcement was seen as the latest signal from the People's Bank of China that is not comfortable with further depreciation in the yuan which could spark capital outflows from the cooling economy.
A firmer tone in the currency helped lift Chinese shares to two-week highs, with the Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) closing up 1.9 percent.
The move also raised hopes that a yuan recovery could boost companies with significant dollar-denominated costs, such as airlines. China Southern Airlines (SS:600029) gained 4.5 percent and Air China (SS:601111) rose 3.25 percent.
""China just seems to be stabilizing its currency and we're getting used to that fact now, so we're not looking at an ever-weaker CNY, which could raise issues,"" said Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, adding that ""it reduces the scope for outflows"". 
ALL GO
On Friday, the S&P 500 index (SPX) and Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) hit record highs, following Powell's comments. The gains cemented the S&P's longest-running bull market, as defined by some investors.
S&P 500 E-mini futures (ESc1) touched a record high of 2,885 during the Asia session, and were last up 0.25 percent at 2,883.75. 
In Europe, data on Monday showed German business morale improved by much more than expected in August, suggesting that concerns about a global trade war among company executives in Europe's largest economy have eased.
The Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index jumped to 103.8 after 101.7 in the previous month.
That added to the upbeat tone in equity markets but weighed on safe-haven German bond yields, which rose to more than two-week highs (DE10YT=RR).
""We have low volumes today, but the biggest risks the market were discounting were trade wars, so any reduction in trade war risk such as NAFTA talks or even Trump trying to find bilateral deals with everyone, has pushed U.S. shares to new records and will support markets,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities and a portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Italy.
""The global economy is on track, there's less trade war risk, the only cloud on the horizon is Italy,"" Meda added, referring to upcoming budget talks in the weeks ahead. 
In currency markets, the dollar steadied against its peers.
The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was broadly flat at 95.180, after slipping more than 0.5 percent in the previous session.
The euro was little changed at $1.1609 (EUR=EBS) after going as high as $1.1654, its strongest since Aug. 2, while hopes of progress in U.S./ Mexican NAFTA talks lifted the Mexican peso 0.8 percent to 18.78 per dollar .

Oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) fell, while gold edged lower as the dollar recovered .

Musk said in a blog post on Friday that his decision to abandon a proposed $72 billion buyout was motivated by existing Tesla shareholders. Instead, he plans to focus on increasing production of the Model 3 and becoming profitable, he wrote.
“Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company...I knew the process of going private would be challenging, but it’s clear that it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated. This is a problem because we absolutely must stay focused on ramping (up the) Model 3 and becoming profitable,” Musk said.
Tesla lost a record $718 million in the second quarter, leaving it with $2.78 billion in cash. Tesla has forecast that it would achieve a profit in the third and fourth quarters, but key to that is increasing production of its latest model. The company has struggled to produce and deliver its vehicles on time.
On August 7 Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” for a buyout at $420 a share, prompting many to wonder whether or not he had the money and if he violated securities laws.
Both Musk and Tesla face investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the accuracy of Musk’s tweet.

The central bank tightened its payment-to-income ratio rules for fixed-rate mortgages to mitigate potential risks from interest rate changes, a move that Moody's said also helped banks weather a potential rise in interest rates.

China’s yuan was in focus as the People’s Bank of China said banks would resume using the “counter-cyclical” factor when calculating the yuan’s daily reference rate to prevent the currency from falling further amid escalated trade tension with the U.S.
China had suspended use of the factor in January, when regulators became more comfortable with the yuan’s strength after several months of gains against the dollar.
The yuan has slid more than 6% against the greenback since mid-June.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming last Friday was cited as supportive as he said that ""further, gradual"" rate hikes were likely in the future, noting the economy is ""strong"" and able to withstand tighter monetary policy. His comments came after President Donald Trump said earlier this month that he was “not thrilled” with the Fed’s decision to hike rates.

1309,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",China's Best-Performing Bank Stock May Have More Room to Rise,"(Bloomberg) -- President Xi Jinping’s push to spur lending in his economy stands to benefit Postal Savings Bank of China Ltd., whose ubiquitous green-fronted outlets have been luring deposits across the nation.
This branch network, the widest in the world, has become a source of cheap funds for the lender, ensuring it’s better placed than rivals amid the government’s crackdown on riskier financing. Postal Bank is China’s best-performing financial stock this year, and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg say its shares could rise an average 26 percent from the current HK$4.55.
“The valuation of Postal Bank is still pretty reasonable after the rally, therefore investors remain pretty bullish about the stock,” said Liao Chenkai, a Shanghai-based analyst with Capital Securities Corp. The bank’s net interest income will keep growing this year as regulators encourage lending and demand for corporate loans will continue, he said.
Postal Bank’s profit is forecast to rise 16 percent in 2018, twice as fast as its five largest state rivals. The bank had 8.4 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) in deposits as of March 31, of which less than half were extended as loans, compared with 70 percent for China’s banking sector. Meanwhile, its bad-debt ratio stood at 0.7 percent, compared with 1.75 percent for the entire industry.
Postal Bank also seems more fairly valued now, after falling about 19 percent from its June high. The correction was triggered by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., which downgraded the stock citing its high valuation. That has narrowed the price-to-book ratio versus Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s largest lender.
All this gives the bank room to boost lending. China’s financial regulators have taken several steps to free up credit in the past month and recently ordered the nation’s lenders to boost credit support for infrastructure projects, small businesses, agriculture and exporters, as economic growth slows and concerns rise about the trade standoff with the U.S.
Postal Bank’s outlook will depend on its earnings -- due Tuesday -- and progress on its capital raising, said Chen Shujin, an analyst at Huatai Securities Co. The Beijing-based bank in 2017 announced plans to sell shares on the mainland, less than a year after raising $7.6 billion from an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Its core tier-1 capital adequacy ratio was 8.85 percent at end-March, lower than other large state banks.
“We anticipate share prices of China banks will rebound in the short-term after announcing solid second-quarter operating figures,” CCB International’s analyst Lawrence Chen wrote in a note this month. He predicts Postal Bank’s profit will increase 15 percent and has an “outperform” rating on the stock.
Postal Bank has more than 40,000 outlets nationwide and over 550 million retail customers. The stock has gained 12 percent in Hong Kong this year, compared with an average 11 percent drop for all Hong Kong-listed Chinese banks.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Musk's U-turn on Tesla deal could intensify his legal, regulatory woes","By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk's decision to abruptly abandon a plan to take his electric carmaker private will not resolve his mounting regulatory and legal woes, and may even make them worse, some securities lawyers said.
Explaining his reversal in a late-night blog post on Friday, the billionaire CEO said that taking the company private “would be even more time-consuming and distracting than initially anticipated,” and that “most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.”
It was on Aug. 7 that Musk first surprised investors with his plan by tweeting that he had “funding secured” for a go-private deal, which would have had a value of $72 billion. In a separate tweet, he wrote: “Investor support is confirmed."" [L2N1VG01J]  
Musk and Tesla are facing investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the truthfulness of the CEO'S Aug. 7 tweets, according to an Aug. 8 report by the Wall Street Journal.
The SEC declined to confirm that report to Reuters. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.
""The SEC will continue its investigation until it's satisfied that it is on top of the facts,"" said Stephen Crimmins, an attorney with Murphy & McGonigle who spent 14 years at the SEC, where he prosecuted hundreds of securities cases. 
""What happened on Friday will be of interest to the SEC because it will allow them to probe whether Musk's pulling back from the go-private somehow indicates that he did not have a reasonable basis for his statement. They will be asking questions of him and others involved in the decision as to why he reversed course.""
Musk has stuck to his original statement that he believed a deal was possible, and one person familiar with the discussions told Reuters that Musk was serious about taking the carmaker private.
But acting in good faith may not be enough to help Musk escape the regulator's gaze.
U.S. securities law requires public company executives to have a “reasonable basis” on which to make representations to the investing public, and that would likely be the focus of an SEC probe, said three securities lawyers. 
It remains unclear what Musk meant by “funding secured.” In an Aug. 13 statement, Musk said that he left a July 31 meeting with the managing director of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund “with no question that a deal ... could be closed.”
The Saudi fund had earlier acquired a just-below 5 percent stake in Tesla on the open market. But the fund has made no comment on whether it had promised to back a much larger Tesla go-private deal. 
'FUNDING SECURED'
Musk said on Friday he believed there was plenty of potential funding to take the company private, but he did not provide any further details to bolster his ""funding secured"" assertion.
Teresa Goody, CEO of law firm Goody Counsel and a former SEC attorney, said Musk's statement on Friday appeared to undermine his Aug. 7 tweet that investor support was confirmed. 
She also raised concerns about a second comment Musk made on Friday, where he said it had become apparent that compliance restrictions would prevent many of Tesla's institutional shareholders from holding private Tesla equity.
Both statements are likely to raise further questions among SEC officials as to whether Musk had performed sufficient due diligence to have had a reasonable basis for his Aug. 7 tweets, she said.
Another statement in the blog that could catch the eye of SEC officials is Musk's reference to his discussion with Tesla's board on Thursday, during which both parties decided not to pursue the deal, said M. Ridgway Barker, a partner and chair of the corporate finance practice at law firm Withersworldwide.
Such discussions are unlikely to be subject to legal privilege and the SEC could subpoena minutes of the meeting, he said.

“If the board discussion included that the deal is not financeable, or prohibitively expensive, that is going to cast further doubt over Musk’s claims,” he said.

1311,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",‘I Was Cheated’: Tales From the Collapse of a Commodity Giant,"(Bloomberg) -- Francis Tay feels cheated.
The former Singapore civil servant says he’s lost almost S$50,000 ($36,600) in the implosion of Noble Group Ltd., the commodity trading giant. He also says shareholders like him have been let down by regulators whose job it is to protect them from the sort of crisis that’s brought the company to the brink.
Yet, the 71-year-old says he still plans to vote in favor of a debt-for-equity restructuring at a shareholder meeting in Singapore on Monday that will hand control to senior creditors, diluting existing stockholders. He sees no other option. Chairman Paul Brough paints the deal as do-or-die, and it already has the backing of the biggest investors, including founder Richard Elman.
“I was cheated of my hard-earned savings,” said Tay, who still owns a small amount of shares. “How can a giant company collapse?” he said in an interview earlier this month in the run-up to the shareholder vote, adding: “What message does that send to the world about Singapore’s reputation?”
Tay and other retail investors have been among the hardest hit, although institutional investors as well as buyers of the company’s bonds when they were issued have also seen steep losses. Noble Group has shredded billions in value since 2015 as the once $12-billion company was reduced to a rump by untenable debt, losses and allegations it deceived investors with accounting tricks. The Singapore-listed trader, which has always defended the integrity of its accounts, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Orderly and Transparent
As Noble’s troubles mounted, the role of Singapore’s regulators has come under scrutiny. In addition to running the exchange, Singapore Exchange Ltd. has front-line oversight and responsibility for maintaining fair, orderly and transparent markets as well as following up with companies to investigate allegations of irregularities. It’s backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the de facto central bank of a city state that’s also a global financial center with a hard-earned reputation for probity.
In the case of Noble Group, allegations have come thick and fast, led by Iceberg Research, which says profits were inflated. The group -- whose claims are rejected by Noble -- is led by Arnaud Vagner, a former credit analyst at Noble in Hong Kong, where the trader was based before it moved to London, who recently dropped his self-imposed cloak of anonymity.
‘Policeman Without a Gun’
“The SGX is a policeman without a gun,” said Tay. “Layman investors like us only have access to on-the-surface information, such as company releases or news reports.”
The SGX defended itself by setting out a summary of the actions it’s taken over the past three years as Noble suffered blow after blow. The tally includes frequent contact with the company, queries for more detail on its results and its demand that Noble appoint an independent financial adviser to assess the debt-for-equity plan that Tay and others are about to vote on.
“Questions ought to be asked about whether the SGX board has adequately prioritized investor protection,” said Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor of accounting who specializes in corporate governance at the National University of Singapore Business School. There are also questions on whether the board has given sufficient resources to SGX RegCo, he says, referring to the arm of the SGX that discharges its regulatory functions.
Audits and Review
After Iceberg’s first report, “we required the issuer to appoint a Singapore auditor to do an independent review, and took a series of actions to ensure the issuer’s auditor addressed the issues of concern in every single year-end audit since FY2015,” an SGX spokesperson said. “Notwithstanding that both the audits and review were clean, we continue to do our part to investigate matters that are within our remit. We are committed to holding issuers and professionals responsible for their actions and opinions. If there is any evidence of wrongdoing, we will refer it to the appropriate authorities.”
The SGX spokesperson added: “In terms of whether our resources are adequate, we are accountable to both the SGX RegCo board and the MAS.”
It’s the second time that a major trading company based in the city state has run into trouble. Olam International Ltd., one of the world’s largest food commodities traders, came under attack from Muddy Waters LLC in 2012. The short-seller raised doubts about its finances, compared it to failed energy trader Enron Corp. and it said ran a high-risk of failure. The trader dismissed the claims but after a rout in its shares, Temasek Holdings Pte., the state-owned Singaporean investment fund, eventually took a controlling stake in May 2014.
Core Requirements
Noble’s case posed challenges for local regulators as the company is incorporated in Bermuda, according to Mak. That means “many of the core corporate governance requirements relating to director duties and shareholder rights in the Singapore Companies Act would not apply,” he said. As the saga has unfolded, Noble has always parried the claims made by Iceberg and consistently defended its actions.
“MAS will thoroughly investigate potential breaches of the law that have been referred to us by SGX, should SGX’s investigations uncover breaches of the law,” an MAS spokesperson said. “MAS will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action if our own investigations uncover any violations of our regulations.”
Other investors have been bruised too. “The hole is too big, they need a strong injection of money,” said S. Nallakaruppan, who works in the finance industry and counts himself as fortunate that he sold most, but not all, of his Noble Group shares in 2016. Like Tay, he plans to vote in favor of the restructuring.
At the special general meeting, shareholders will vote on the plan, which hands 70 percent of the equity in a revamped company to senior creditors, 10 percent to management and the rest to existing shareholders, with about half of the debt written off. Brough has said that, should the proposal founder, the company may be forced to enter administration or file for bankruptcy.
Lisa Ng, an administrative manager in the finance sector, says she lost about 90 percent of her investment in Noble, or at least S$5,000. She says she won’t attend the SGM because she considers her shares a write-off. Selling them would cost her more in fees than what she’d now recover, she said.
“I do wish that I had gotten out when Iceberg had come out with its critique of Noble’s accounting,” the 61-year-old said. “I thought that Noble, being a blue-chip share, wouldn’t be like what they claimed.”

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2018 11:15AM ET</span>",Chinese authorities say Didi bears 'unshirkable responsibility' for passenger's death,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's police and transport ministry said on Sunday the country's largest ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing had ""unshirkable responsibility"" for a ride-sharing passenger being raped and killed by a driver in the eastern city of Wenzhou.
The company met with both ministries in Beijing and the nearby port city of Tianjin and ordered to carry out a complete reform of its platform to ensure safety standards, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
A Didi representative said the company felt deeply responsible and would complete by Sept 1 a new compliance operation to be inspected by the ministries and the public, according to Xinhua.
Earlier on Sunday, Didi Chuxing said it would suspend its Hitch carpooling service from Aug. 27 due ""disappointing mistakes"" while the company reevaluated the product's business model.
Huang Jieli, Hitch's general manager, and the company's vice president for customer services, Huang Jinhong, have been removed from their positions, Didi's statement said. 
The suspected murder of a 20-year-old woman, who Wenzhou police identified only with the surname Zhao, is the latest in a series of violent crimes that have fueled safety concerns about the service.
Zhao got into a Hitch carpool vehicle at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT) on Friday, and sent a message to a friend at around 2 p.m. seeking help before losing contact, according to a local police statement.
A 27-year-old driver named Zhong was detained at about 4 a.m. on Saturday and confessed to raping and killing the passenger, the local police statement said, adding that the victim's body had been recovered and an investigation was continuing.
Didi said on Sunday that the suspect had no prior criminal record, had provided authentic documentation and passed a facial recognition test before starting work.
But the company said on Saturday there was a prior complaint made against the driver on Thursday by a passenger who alleged the driver took them to a remote place and then followed the passenger after she got out of the car.
""The incident shows the many deficiencies with our customer service processes, especially the failure to act swiftly on the previous passenger’s complaint and the cumbersome and rigid process of information sharing with the police,"" the company said in the statement.
The Hitch carpool service has run over 1 billion trips in the past three years, the company said. Didi is the biggest ride-sharing firm globally by number of trips.
STATE MEDIA CRITICISM
China's state-backed media criticized Didi's safety record on Sunday, while celebrities took to social media and pledged to delete the application.
""You've had so many incidents,"" an unnamed family member of Zhao was quoted as saying in the Qianjiang Evening news, an official Zhejiang province publication.
""What are you going to do about your safety and service problems?"" 
Wang Chuanjun, a famous Chinese actor, on Sunday shared a screenshot of his phone as he prepared to delete the application. His post was shared over 58 thousand times on China's Twitter-like Weibo and the hashtag ""Wang Chuanjun uninstalls Didi"" had been viewed nearly 9 million times by the evening. 
China's official Xinhua News agency criticized Didi for not doing more to prevent such incidents and said the company should face legal punishment if it failed to put customer's safety first.
Didi has increased its safety measures for Hitch after the murder of a flight attendant during a Hitch ride in May sparked outrage. These included limiting Hitch drivers to only picking up passengers of the same sex during early morning and late evening hours.

Coli, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.
The meat carries an ""EST. 86R"" label inside the USDA mark of inspection and a use-by date of Sept. 5, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said this week in a statement. It was shipped from Cargill's facility in Fort Morgan, Colorado, to warehouses in California and Colorado, FSIS said.
E. Coli bacteria can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps, and in some rare cases it can develop into a life-threatening type of kidney failure.
FSIS said the problem was discovered on Aug. 22 when the company inspected its records and found the beef might have been associated with a product presumed positive for E. Coli.
The company then notified FSIS, the inspection service said, adding in its statement that there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to these products being eaten.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2018 02:24PM ET</span>",Tesla CEO Musk drops pursuit of $72 billion take-private deal,"By Alexandria Sage and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said late on Friday he would heed shareholder concerns and no longer pursue a $72 billion deal to take the luxury electric car maker private, abandoning an idea that stunned investors and drew regulatory scrutiny.
The decision to leave Tesla as a publicly listed company raises new questions about its future. Tesla shares have been trading well below their Aug. 7 levels, when Musk announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, as investors wondered what this meant for Musk's ability to steer the company to profitability. 
Musk and Tesla also face a series of investor lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of Musk's tweet that funding for the deal was ""secured.""
Musk said on Friday that his belief that there is more than enough funding to take the company private was reinforced during the process, but said he abandoned the bid based on feedback from shareholders and because the effort was proving to be more time-consuming and distracting than anticipated.
""Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was 'please don’t do this,'"" Musk wrote in a blog post.
Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, said previously that he envisioned taking the company private without the standard method of a leveraged buyout, in which all the other shareholders would cash out and the deal would be funded primarily with new debt.
Musk estimated that two-thirds of Tesla shareholders would have chosen an option of ""rolling"" their stakes into a private company. That would significantly reduce the amount of money needed for the deal and avoid further burdening Tesla, which has a debt pile of $11 billion and negative cash flow.
However, Musk said on Friday that a number of institutional shareholders explained that they have internal compliance issues that limit how much they can invest in a private company. He also said there was no proven path for most retail investors to own shares were Tesla to go private.
That contrasts sharply with an Aug. 7 tweet, when Musk said: ""investor support is confirmed.""
T. Rowe Price Group, Fidelity Investments and Scotland’s Baillie Gifford, which are top Tesla shareholders, declined to comment.
Musk also said previously that Saudi Arabia’s PIF, which bought a stake in Tesla earlier this year of just under 5 percent, could help fund the cash portion of the deal, though sources close to the sovereign wealth fund had played down that prospect. PIF is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc, Reuters reported last Sunday.
Six members of Tesla's board of directors said in a separate statement that they were informed on Thursday by Musk that he was abandoning his take-private bid. The board then disbanded a special committee of three directors it had set up to evaluate any offer that Musk submitted. 
""We fully support Elon as he continues to lead the company moving forward,"" the board said.
However, some corporate governance experts said Musk's handling of the take-private bid could pressure the board to assert its independence and consider ways to rein him in by, for example, bringing in a chief operating officer.
""They have someone in charge who has raised serious doubts in the financial and public community about his ability to take the company forward. This will make it harder to invest"" in Tesla, said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware.
SHORT SELLERS EMBOLDENED
In explaining his reasons to take Tesla private earlier this month, Musk cited pressure from short sellers - investors who look to profit on bets that a company's stock will decline.
Some short sellers were emboldened by his U-turn. Christopher Irons, founder of investigative research website quoththeravenresearch.com, said it showed Musk was nowhere near as close to taking the company private as he had claimed.
""Personally, I'm going to look to see how the stock opens on Monday. If it does not drop precipitously based on this, I will personally view it as an opportunity to add to my short position,"" said Irons, whose out-of-the money put options make money if Tesla's stock declines.
Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, which has been shorting Tesla, said on Saturday: ""The corporate governance disaster that is Tesla continues. Keep in mind that Musk informed the board on Thursday, according to his Friday night post."" 
Tesla shares closed at $322.82 on Friday.
One of Tesla's biggest challenges is ramping up production of its latest vehicle, the Model 3, which is critical to its profitability goals. 
Musk has said repeatedly since April that Tesla has no need to raise new capital and has promised the company will be profitable and cash-flow positive in the third and fourth quarters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 stock index clinched its longest bull-market run on Friday, closing above its previous January high, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell affirmed the U.S. central bank's current pace of rate hikes.
The S&P had last reached a new closing high on Jan. 26, then retreated more than 10 percent, a correction that lasted until Feb. 8. Friday's new closing high confirmed that the index's bull run remained intact.
Speaking at a research symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said the Fed's gradual interest rate hikes were the best way to protect the economic recovery, maintain strong job growth and keep inflation under control. His comments did little to change market expectations of a rate hike in September and perhaps again in December.
Investors said they were reassured that Powell's comments stayed in line with previous commentary from the Fed regarding policy. Economic data also boosted sentiment. 
New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in July and shipments growth held firm, the Commerce Department said.
""That's what the markets wanted to hear,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. ""The economic data and strong environment as a whole is the basis, and (Powell) didn't get in the way.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 133.37 points, or 0.52 percent, to 25,790.35, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 17.71 points, or 0.62 percent, to 2,874.69 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 67.52 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,945.98.
For the week, the Dow added 0.47 percent, the S&P gained 0.87 percent, and the Nasdaq increased 1.66 percent.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) also advanced 0.5 percent to reach a new closing high.
A dip in the dollar (DXY) after Powell's comments helped lift materials and energy stocks as the prices of oil and metals rose. The S&P 500 materials sector (SPLRCM) jumped 1.2 percent, the biggest percentage gain among the 11 major S&P sectors. [O/R] [MET/L]
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) shares rose 5.8 percent to add the most gains to the S&P 500 after SunTrust Robinson Humphrey upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy"" and projected that third-quarter subscriber growth would match or beat Wall Street estimates.
 Autodesk Inc  (O:ADSK) shares leaped 15.3 percent, the greatest percentage gain among S&P 500 stocks, after the software maker's quarterly results beat estimates.
Shares of Gap Inc (N:GPS) and  Foot Locker  Inc (N:FL) sank 8.6 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, after the two retailers posted disappointing same-store sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 150 new highs and 31 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.43 billion shares, compared to the 6.28 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1335,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 04:32PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week:
1. Powell Sticks to Gradual Hike Script
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday gave Wall Street an even clearer glimpse into how the Fed plans to proceed for the rest of the year.
Powell, speaking at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium, commented on balancing moving too fast on rates and hurting the expansion and moving too slow and risking the economy overheating.
And with all said and done, he still likes a gradual pace of rate hikes, which likely means two more this year.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC's approach to taking seriously both of these risks,” he said.
Still, some hoping for the Fed to ease off the hikes, especially next year, were heartened by some dovish remarks on inflation.
“(W)e have seen no clear sign of an acceleration above 2 percent (inflation), and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating,” Powell said. “This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually closer to the FOMC's rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued.”
The Fed chief spoke two days after the minutes of the last FOMC meeting arrived, which also supported the forecast of two more 2018 rate hikes.
""Relative to the forecast prepared for the June meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending,"" the minutes said.
But there was some discussion of how trade was weighing on growth and an escalating trade war could, some argue, give the Fed an excuse to pause in the plan to keep raising rates regularly.
2. Housing Data Still Disappointing
Housing numbers continue to give the market pause. It’s recently been the part of the economy waving the most red flags.
Data on existing home sales released by the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed a surprise drop.
Existing home sales fell 0.7% in July from the previous month to an annualized pace of 5.34 million units. Economists had forecast a 0.6% increase to an annualized pace of 5.44 million.
Sales are now 1.5% below a year ago and have fallen on an annual basis for five-straight months, according to NAR.
Next, new home sales fell short, dropping to a nine-month low in July.
New home sales fell 1.7% last month to an adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units. Economists expected a rise to 645,000 units.



3. Oil’s Gains Push Energy Stocks Higher
Oil prices had a strong up week, which in turn boosted energy stocks.
The S&P Energy Sector index rose more than 2% this week, in a much stronger showing than the S&P 500.
Helping sentiment on oil were signs of falling Iranian crude output ahead of U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic's crude exports, expected to take effect in November.
Jefferies on Friday, citing third-party reports, said Iranian tanker loadings are already down by around 700,000 barrels a day in the first half of August from the prior month.
Meanwhile, inventories of U.S. crude fell by 5.836 million barrels for the week ended Aug. 17, confounding expectations for a draw of 1.497 million barrels, according to data, released Wednesday, from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
4.  Target  Leads Solid Retail Earnings
Among active stocks this week, retail earnings still grabbed plenty of headlines.
Target (NYSE:TGT) stock soared Wednesday as its second-quarter revenue, earnings and same-store sales beat consensus and the company raised its full-year guidance.
The same day, shares of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) climbed higher, despite the company’s cautious guidance. Investors focused on its turnaround plan instead.
Lowe's said it will shutter all of its Orchard Supply Hardware stores and also cut inventory in an effort to become a leaner competitor against  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
And on Tuesday,  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) bucked the trend for weak housing numbers. The stock jumped as the company reported fiscal third-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
5. Trump Predicts Market Crash if He’s Ousted
Washington also had its impact on Wall Street this week, as investors digested convictions of two of President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was convicted on eight of 18 counts in his fraud trial, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on the other 10.
And Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, saying that he paid off two women for the purpose of influencing an election at the behest of Trump. The White House denied any wrongdoing by Trump.
In an interview with Fox News, Trump said his impeachment would be disastrous for the economy and the stock market.
""I tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash, I think everybody would be very poor,"" Trump said."
1336,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 04:32PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P 500 Closes at Record High as Powell's Dovish Tilt Triggers Rally,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed at an all-time highs Friday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's upbeat assessment of the economy and ongoing support for gradual rates hikes triggered a wave of buying.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.52%. The S&P 500 rose 0.62%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.86%.
Powell, in support of the Fed's glacial approach to tightening, underlined two risks facing the economy. He said too fast a pace of tightening could ""needlessly"" undermine economy growth, while too slow a pace would risk the economy overheating.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the [Federal Open Market Committee’s] approach to taking seriously both of these risks.” Powell said in speech at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Powell's speech put the risk of a more hawkish Fed in the rearview mirror, stoking investor appetite for risker assets like stocks and helping limit the drag from worries over President Donald Trump's legal issues and the China-U.S. trade war.
The U.S.-China trade war came to the fore this week as a meeting between the two nations on trade ended with little progress amid a further escalation in trade.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods just after midnight ET Thursday, prompting China to respond with in-kind measures against U.S. goods.
Corporate earnings, which has helped to offset trade jitters, were mixed. But that did little to weigh on the broader market.
Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock slumped 8.6% as the retailer reported a steeper-than-expected decline in same-store sales. HP (NYSE:HPQ) fell 2% despite reporting above-consensus earnings, while Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) notched a 14% gain after posting earnings that topped estimates.
Rising energy stocks underpinned the move higher in the broader market, as oil prices snapped a 7-week losing streak amid signs of falling Iranian crude output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery gained 1.3% to settle at $68.72 a barrel.
The broader averages, meanwhile, shrugged off a weaker-than-expected core durable goods orders, as the underlying data showed capital expenditure remained solid.
The Commerce Department said on Friday core durable goods orders fell 0.2% last month, missing economists' forecast for a 0.5% rise. But non-defense ex-air orders grew 1.4%, above economists' estimates.
""The (headline number) 1.7% decline was driven by a huge dive in the always choppy aircraft component, a segment in which orders go with a long lag towards actual activity. Core capital goods (non-defense ex aircraft) saw orders up a healthy 1.4%, continuing their nice uptrend and signaling gains in business investment spending,"" CIBC said.
On the corporate news front, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock rose 6.0% after SunTrust Robinson Humphrey upgraded its rating on the stock to ""buy"" and estimated that third-quarter subscriber growth would match or beat Wall Street estimates.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Macy’s (NYSE:M) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

1339,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Powell Doctrine Emerges as Fed Chief Debuts at Jackson Hole,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell laid out a doctrine of basing monetary policy on evidence from the economy alongside theoretical models as the foundation of his young tenure as Federal Reserve chairman, with the U.S. central bank entering a crucial period in the business cycle.
In his first speech as Fed chief at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell defended his a gradualist approach and, in the process, hardened expectations for a September interest-rate increase. He stressed that estimates of how the economy works -- like those followed by Ph.D. economists on the Fed staff -- were at best “hazy” navigational guides. As a result, they need to be tested by close observation of real economic data.
“What I do see here is an affirmation of the Powell Doctrine: We’ve got a framework of the way the world works, we have these estimates, but they are subject to imprecision,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc in New York. “He is going to talk a little plainer, acknowledge uncertainty, and fashion a policy around that.”
Shifting Stars
Powell used the term “shifting stars” several times in his speech Friday at the Kansas City Fed’s annual policy symposium in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park, referring to the guideposts in economic models often symbolized with an asterisk, or “star.”
The Federal Open Market Committee’s job, as Powell defined it, is to be aware of how these estimates are changing and not take them as set in stone. The chairman reminded his audience of central bankers and economists that if the Fed stubbornly tried to defend a previous estimate for full employment -- a term economists refer to as U-star -- the cost would be 1.6 million jobs.
“He is crystal clear here that while he understands that all those economic principals are important, he is not going to let current estimates of those things be the dominant driver of interest rates,” said Robert Martin, executive director at UBS Securities LLC and a former Fed board staff economist. “This is the same message we got from his press conferences. He is going to let policy be governed by the current state of the economy.”
Investors have fully priced in a rate increase next month and see an above-60 percent probability of another move by the Fed’s meeting in December.
Strong Performance
The Fed chairman said he expected the economy’s “strong performance will continue” and as a result the Fed’s “gradual process of normalization remains appropriate.”
The word “normalization” is significant in that it signals the central bank, even with the economy now in its 10th year of expansion, is still returning policy to something more consistent with a neutral interest rate, or one that doesn’t slow or stimulate the economy.
Even so, the policy has attracted the ire of President Donald Trump, who nominated Powell to the top Fed job and has since complained about his rate hikes.
Powell’s discussion of the challenges of monetary policy at a time of uncertainty is an introduction to his chairmanship and how different it will be from his predecessors.
Under chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, the case for holding off on rate hikes was simple as the unemployment rate declined from a devastating peak of 10 percent in 2009 with an economy still scarred by the financial crisis.
Powell took over from Yellen in February in the midst of a mature expansion that was given a big boost by Republican tax cuts and a higher federal spending. Unemployment stood at 3.9 percent in July, well below 4.5 percent that the Fed sees as consistent with full employment in the longer run. Still, central bankers have shown patience, raising rates at a careful pace while inflation has slowly moved higher.
Policy Mistake
Powell said the FOMC must balance the threat of moving too fast and shortening the expansion, or moving too slowly and allowing for overheating.
“I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach to taking seriously both of these risks,” Powell said. While unemployment is low, “there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating.”
“This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually,” Powell said. “If the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate.”
The fulcrum of Powell’s policy is straight out of modern economic theory -- keeping inflation expectations low and stable. Measures of what the public expects longer-run inflation to be can be somewhat hazy, but most gauges show them at low and stable rates. If they ever broke free, the Fed would act aggressively.
“I am confident that the FOMC would resolutely ‘do whatever it takes’ should inflation expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten,” Powell said.
“The takeaway for policy management under Powell is that you may want to be cautious about moving preemptively when you don’t know what the structure of the economy is and what the distribution of risks are,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC. “But once the dangers start to manifest themselves, you move very aggressively, rather than conservatively.”

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is laying off more than 600 workers as it grapples with a slowdown in its mortgage business, a bank spokesman said on Friday. 
The fourth-largest U.S. bank has given 60 days notice to 638 mortgage employees across the country, Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in an emailed statement, with cuts concentrated in Orlando, Florida; Ranch Cordova, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""After carefully evaluating market conditions and consumer needs, we are reducing to better align with current volumes,"" Goyda said.
Wells Fargo has been making sporadic cuts to its mortgage workforce as part of a bid to rein in costs. These layoffs are the largest so far this year.
The home lending business has struggled as rising interest rates hurt refinancing demand. Wells Fargo's mortgage banking income fell 33 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. 
The latest cuts were mainly to retail fulfillment and servicing jobs, Goyda said, reflecting a continued slump in application volumes. 
Analysts have said such moves address overcapacity and will improve the bank's efficiency. 
Wells Fargo has vowed to cut $4 billion in costs by 2020 in order to grow profits as it operates under a punitive asset cap levied by the Federal Reserve.

The Orlando Sentinel reported the layoffs on Thursday.

(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday said it would push for foreign postal carriers to pay the U.S. Postal Service more to deliver small parcels within the United States, taking up a longtime complaint by Amazon.com (O:AMZN), UPS (N:UPS) and others who have alleged the current system is unfair.
The State Department also said it would push foreign postal services to furnish data that would help customs officials detect opioids and other illegal shipments entering the United States. That task could also add to their costs.
If successful, the effort would benefit U.S. merchants and shippers who say they are undercut by foreign postal services' access to low rates. U.S. shoppers could see higher bills for foreign goods ordered online.
The move may face pushback during meetings next month of the United Nation's Universal Postal Union, from countries like China and Brazil, which already face price hikes for mail to Europe and the United States.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on ""terminal dues,"" or rates one country's postal service pays another for finishing an international delivery.
""The current system of terminal dues distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the shipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates,"" the memo said.
It added that the U.S. Secretary of State ""shall include recommendations for future action, including the possibility of adopting self-declared rates,"" if insufficient progress is made with the Universal Postal Union.
The policy makes Trump a surprise ally of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, which he has accused of turning the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) into its ""delivery boy.""
Amazon did not return a request for comment. UPS called the administration's actions ""a positive step"" toward addressing ""longstanding imbalances in the global postal market.""
Those companies and industry groups have sought White House meetings since last year to attack arcane postal agreements they say make it cheaper to air-mail goods to Los Angeles from Beijing than from New York.
Others say the issue is not so simple. USPS claims to save money on outbound shipments thanks to the Universal Postal Union's exchange system, and rates for countries such as China have already been negotiated to rise by 2021 to a significant percentage of USPS's costs, the same rate USPS pays other countries.
Mighty Mug CEO Jayme Smaldone, who has found merchants in China cheaply shipping knock-offs of his products directly to U.S. consumers, said, ""This isn’t something that should be phased out over years. This is something that's gone on for long enough.""

It was not clear if the memorandum followed recommendations, not yet made public, of the postal task force Trump set up this year to examine USPS's business.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 03:51PM ET</span>",Papa John’s taps investment banks amid pressure from founder: sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Papa John’s International Inc (O:PZZA), the world’s third-largest pizza delivery company, has hired Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) to help find ways to stabilize the restaurant chain, which has come under pressure from its founder John Schnatter, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of Papa John’s, resigned as chairman in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call. He is trying to regain control of the company, which has adopted a so-called poison pill to fend off any potential hostile takeover bid. The banks are at still at the early stage of working with Papa John’s to assess its options, and there is no wider exploration of strategic alternatives or sale process currently underway, the sources said. 
The pizza chain has attracted some takeover interest from other companies and private equity firms following Schnatter's departure, and the banks will assist the company if there is an acquisition offer to consider in the future, one of the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Papa John’s, Lazard and Bank of America declined to comment. Schnatter could be not immediately be reached for comment. 
Papa John's shares jumped as much as 5.5 percent to $45.07 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $1.4 billion.
Earlier this month, Papa John's posted a second-quarter comparable sales decline of 6.1 percent and cut its sales forecast, citing fallout from the company's split with Schnatter. Negative publicity surrounding Schnatter depressed July traffic in North America, the company said at the time, noting that it was hard to predict how long and how badly that would affect sales. Papa John's has more than 5,000 locations worldwide, mostly franchised restaurants. 
Papa John's Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie vowed earlier this month to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter's image from company promotions. Two franchisee associations working with the company have expressed support for its strategy.

Ritchie, who was previously Papa John’s president, took over as CEO in January after Schnatter came under fire in November for criticizing the National Football League’s leadership over national anthem protests by its players.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Volkswagen CEO received memorandum about emissions cheating fallout: NDR,"FRANKFURT/HAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess was given a memorandum warning the carmaker might face legal action in the U.S. over the use of cheating software in cars just days before the scandal broke, a public broadcaster reported on Friday.
A former Volkswagen employee told the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office that he wrote a so-called ""one-pager"" on Sept. 13, 2015, saying that Volkswagen had lost all credibility with U.S. authorities and was about to be charged, German public broadcaster NDR reported.
The employee further testified that he gave the document to Diess in person on Sept. 14, 2015, NDR said. U.S. regulators exposed VW's cheating on Sept. 18, 2015.
Volkswagen has said the scandal has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines.
Volkswagen's senior management, which has denied wrongdoing, is being investigated by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near where Volkswagen is headquartered, to see whether the company violated disclosure rules.
Diess, who was VW's brand chief at the time, became chief executive of Volkswagen Group in April this year.
The Braunschweig prosecutor's office was not immediately available for comment on Friday. A spokesman for Volkswagen said in e-mailed comments that the group was only recently given access to documents in the case, adding this had so far not led to new findings.
He added it was inappropriate to use individual statements from the files and to comment on those, adding Diess, Volkswagen supervisory board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn would not comment in light of the ongoing investigation.
German magazine Der Spiegel last week reported that Diess was present at a meeting on July 27, 2015 when senior engineers and executives discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators, who were threatening to ban VW cars because of excessive pollution levels.
In a defense document filed with the Braunschweig court in February and seen by Reuters, Volkswagen said that Poetsch, who was VW's chief financial officer at the time, on Sept. 14, 2015 believed the potential financial risk from regulatory penalties tied to emissions would be about 150 million euros ($172 million).
VW said in its legal defense document that because the internal estimate was so small, VW felt potential costs could be covered by already accrued legal provisions, and that no additional disclosure about the potential fallout to shareholders was needed.

The company said that the documents unsealed by prosecutors have not changed its stance that management acted responsibly in its disclosure, and that it was not foreseeable at that time that U.S. authorities would impose an ""unprecedented"" fine.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>","Hedge funds seek review of market data fees, 'pickles' and all","By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The two main hedge fund trade groups have joined a growing chorus of stock market participants asking U.S. regulators to reign in ""unreasonable"" data fees charged by some exchanges, which they said restrict trading and harm competition.
The Managed Funds Association and the Alternative Investment Management Association, in a petition dated Aug. 22, asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a full review of market data costs and to require exchanges to be more transparent about the fees they charge.
They said hedge fund managers trading on behalf of pension plans, charitable organizations and other institutional investors have experienced a continual increase in market data fees as exchanges alter licensing terms, create new fee categories, and recategorize and unbundle fees. 
""Our members have likened the practice to ordering a hamburger which used to cost $20, but now costs $7 for the bun, $15 for the beef patty, $3 per fixing and $1 per condiment, for an overall total cost of $33 (with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup and mustard),"" the petition said.
SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said the commission would hold an industry roundtable on the issue at some point in the near future, but no date has been announced.
Data revenue has been growing for exchange operators, including New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) (N:ICE) and Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ). 
ICE Chief Executive Jeff Sprecher has disputed the idea that exchange data is a growth area. 
""You can still read people that write articles that somehow equity exchange data is going up or that somehow there is pricing power in that area and not robust competition. The reality is that that's been in long-term decline,"" Sprecher said on an Aug. 2 earnings call with analysts.
Calls for a review of rules around data fees and the exchanges' ability to raise them without first getting SEC approval or industry comment have increased in recent years. 
In December, a group of 24 market participants asked the SEC to review exchange data fees. The group included Vanguard Group; the brokerage arms of  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and UBS Group (S:UBSG); market makers Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial (O:VIRT), and retail brokers  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), and Fidelity, 
Trade Group Healthy Markets also petitioned the SEC in January ""to reduce conflicts of interest, market complexity, and costs related to the provision of equity market data.""

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","UK auditors, watchdog to discuss curbs on Big Four market share","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top accountants will meet with competition regulators next week to discuss limiting the ""Big Four"" auditors' market share after lawmakers called for them to be broken up.
Lawmakers have accused EY, KPMG, Deloitte and PwC of being an ""oligopoly"" that checks the books of nearly all the 350 leading companies in Britain, with smaller rivals barely having a look in.
After the collapse of outsourcer Carillion in January, a parliamentary committee said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) should consider breaking up the Big Four into more audit firms, and detaching audit arms from consulting services.
Faced with this, accounting industry officials began thrashing out proposals for limiting how many big company audits the Big Four should be allowed to conduct, Reuters reported in June.
Smaller auditing firm Grant Thornton said earlier this year it would give up bidding for top company audits because it always came a ""glorious second"" in a costly exercise that saw audit committees sticking with a Big Four firm.
Officials from the Big Four, smaller rivals Grant Thornton, RSM, Moore Stephens, Mazars and BDO, as well as professional accounting bodies ICAEW and ICAS, held a conference call on Friday to finalize the proposals before presenting them to CMA staff next Tuesday.
""We had all the UK CEOs on it to get their support, that they are happy with the things that are going to be talked about,"" ICAEW Chief Executive Michael Izza told Reuters on Friday.
The recommendations include a cap on how many of the 350 biggest companies a Big Four firm can audit, and having audits shared or done jointly by a Big Four firm and smaller rival.
The Big Four could also license their technology for smaller rivals to use.
A more radical idea aimed at changing ""buyer behavior"" recommends that an independent body selects the auditor for companies, a task currently left to a company's audit committee.
""That causes some challenges with company law and would be a challenging sell to audit committees, but perhaps the time has come to look at some of the more radical options. That mechanism works well in the public sector,"" Izza said.
The CMA said it was continuing to monitor the audit sector to decide whether to take further action, and it was working with the sector's regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, to support any action that watchdog chose to take.
Izza said the discussions have kept regulators, lawmakers and the government in the loop. ""This is not being done in an environment of secrecy. It's being done recognizing there is an issue here,"" Izza said.
Some of the ideas were already raised by competition regulators in a 2013 review that ordered Britain's top 350 companies to put out their audit work to tender at least every decade to avoid accountants becoming too cozy with management.
The European Union also introduced reforms in 2016.
The outcome, however, is a switch between Big Four firms, rather than greater market share for smaller auditors.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:27PM ET</span>",Top Zimbabwe court confirms Mnangagwa's presidential election victory,"By MacDonald Dzirutwe
HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court confirmed President Emmerson Mnangagwa's disputed July 30 election victory on Friday, dismissing an opposition challenge that had held up his inauguration, which will now be held on Sunday.
Before the vote, Mnangagwa had said a credible election could pull Zimbabwe out of its diplomatic isolation under former president Robert Mugabe, ending international sanctions and prompting an economic recovery. 
Instead the vote left the nation polarized, with Nelson Chamisa, who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), mounting the legal challenge and violence flaring on the streets of Harare.
In a unanimous ruling of the nine judges of the country's top court, Chief Justice Luke Malaba said Chamisa had failed to prove allegations of fraud during the presidential vote.
""Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa is duly declared the winner of the presidential elections held on the 30th of July 2018,"" Malaba said in his ruling.
The election, in which Mnangagwa and Chamisa were the main contenders, was touted as a crucial step towards shedding Zimbabwe's pariah reputation and securing international donor funding to revive an economy suffering chronic shortages of investment and cash, as well as high unemployment.
An army crackdown in response to post-election violence by opposition supporters left six people dead on Aug. 1, recalling the heavyhanded security tactics that marked the 37-year rule of Mugabe, who was removed in a coup last November.
Mnangagwa now faces the challenge of persuading the international community that the army crackdown and lapses in the election process will not derail his promise of reforms to overcome corruption and mismanagement under Mugabe.
The president called for peace on his Twitter feed, after the ruling was delivered.
""Nelson Chamisa, my door is open and my arms are outstretched, we are one nation, and we must put our nation first. Let us all now put our differences behind us,"" he said.
Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa told Reuters that Mnangagwa would be inaugurated on Sunday.
At ZANU-PF's offices, hundreds of supporters in the party's green and yellow colors followed Malaba's judgment on television, erupting into song and dance after their candidate was confirmed as president. 
""He won the battle,"" a supporter told Reuters TV, adding that while Mnangagwa's enemies were trying their best, ""they fail"". 
HARARE CALM
MDC Secretary General Douglas Mwonzora told reporters outside the court that ""whatever we do as MDC we are going to act within the law... We want Zimbabweans who want to demonstrate to be allowed to demonstrate.""
Outside the party's office, one MDC member questioned the judges' verdict. ""It was not fair, they were favoring one side -- ZANU-PF. The MDC had enough evidence but it was not considered,"" he said.
Police blocked roads around the court, a 19th century British colonial building just opposite Mnangagwa's offices in central Harare. Vehicles carrying water cannon reappeared on streets near the court house while riot police patrolled the city center in groups.
A Reuters witness said Harare was calm immediately after the ruling, with people going about their usual business.
In a statement, the European Union urge all parties to ""call for calm and restraint"" after the court ruling.
""It is important that the new government engages all stakeholders in substantive discussions on the necessary reforms, including on further electoral reforms,"" the EU said.
Before the ruling, the head of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches told Reuters it was speaking to senior leaders from ZANU-PF and the MDC to facilitate negotiations.

""We have been reaching out to both political parties to their highest level of leadership for us to explore a possibility of some form of dialogue,"" General Secretary Kenneth Mtata said.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Italian banks face high-risk choice over domestic debt,"By Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) - Falling foreign demand for Italian government bonds is pressuring domestic banks to step into the breach, as they did back in 2011-2012. Yet they may find it harder to come to the rescue of the country's debt this time around.
Foreign investors shed a net 33 billion euros ($38 billion) in Italian government bonds in June, the Bank of Italy said last week, following a 25 billion sell-off in May, spooked by pledges to ramp up spending and unwind past deficit-curbing reforms from Italy's anti-establishment coalition government.
When a similar trend developed during the euro zone crisis, home banks responded by gorging on high-yielding bonds that beefed up their revenues for years to come. The annual pace of increase in their domestic bond holdings soared to 20 percent from an average of just 1 percent in 2004-2007.
But any hopes the banks will repeat that role may be frustrated because their situation has changed since then.
""Whether domestic financial institutions will continue to act as a steady (and potentially increasing) source of demand for sovereign (debt) ... remains a fundamental question for the coming months,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Matteo Crimella said in a recent note.
To be sure, banks generally favor their own country's bonds, a tendency known as ""home bias"". Analysts also flag that they can be subject to ""moral suasion"" from authorities to help out in times of stress.
But ""regulatory and supervisory changes, together with the risk of a deterioration in banks' capital ratios/ratings owing to weaknesses in the sovereign market could, all together, raise the bar for domestic banks to step in as buyers,"" Crimella said. 
Complicating Italy's task of refinancing the world's third-largest public debt, worth 2.3 trillion euros, the European Central Bank (ECB) will soon end the bond purchases it has been carrying out under its ultra-expansionary monetary policy. 
MARGINAL BUYER 
""With the ECB's ... purchases likely coming to an end and the risk that foreign investors will reduce further their exposure to BTP bonds, the need for a 'marginal buyer' of Italian government debt could increase,"" Crimella said.
""Any reluctance of domestic banks to fulfill that role could lead to a shortfall in demand, especially should the government pursue a bulky fiscal expansion.""
Italian banks have stepped up purchases in the face of the recent sell-off and their holdings hit a one-year high of 370 billion euros in June, up from 342 billion in April. 
Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) estimate Italian banks have room to buy a further 44 billion euros before Italian government bonds on their balance sheet match a 2015 high of 11 percent of total assets.
That compares with 3.5 percent in 2007 before the global financial crisis and a 2015 euro area average of 4.3 percent.
Yet any buying increases risks for bank balance sheets, where the damage from Italy's falling bond prices is already apparent.
UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and Intesa (MI:ISP) both lost roughly one third of a percentage point in core capital due to the sell-off, though Intesa was able to offset the hit by issuing new shares to reward employees and by converting savings shares.
Jefferies calculated a further 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point capital erosion at Italy's top two banks this quarter, based on current bond yield levels.
REGULATORY THRESHOLDS 
Italian banks have strengthened their capital in recent years and are well above regulatory thresholds, but investors are always wary of declining capital levels.
Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) suffered even more as the market turmoil shaved 0.84 percentage points off its capital, complicating bad debt disposal plans for Italy's fourth-largest bank.
 Intesa Sanpaolo  declined to comment, while Banco BPM and UniCredit had no immediate comment. 
Any decline in capital ratios could hamper ongoing attempts to deal with a legacy of bad loans, which soared after a harsh recession and have become the focus of regulatory and investor concerns.
The ECB, which directly supervises larger Italian banks since November 2014, has made cutting bad loans a priority and banks need to preserve their capital to be able to weather the impact of disposals which are normally carried out at a loss.
Analysts say Europe-wide stress tests the European Banking Authority is conducting this year may also increase lenders' awareness of sovereign risks. 
Domestic banks' willingness to mop up Italian bonds could be tested in coming months as verdicts by rating agencies loom on Rome's debt and intensifying tensions over the 2019 budget could unnerve foreign buyers.
The yield gap between Italian 10-year bonds over German Bunds has already widened to 2.8 percentage points  compared with 1.3 points before the market turmoil.
BofA analysts warn the premium could widen further to as much as 4 percentage points, or shrink back to 1.7 points, before the end of the year, depending on the government's next moves. 
Domestic lenders therefore have plenty of risks to weigh up before continuing their recent buying spree of Italian government debt.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Builders on Canada's coasts brace for new steel protections,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's latest steel tariff proposal has alarmed construction companies, who have warned it could have an outsized impact on the country's coasts, boosting costs in places like Vancouver, already Canada's most expensive housing market, while protecting steel producers in central Canada.
The new measures could make steel more expensive in regions that depend on imports from overseas, raising the cost of large building projects like condominium towers as subcontractors pay new duties on supplies like rebar, used to reinforce concrete. 
""It's baffling to me. They're trying to appease a very small group of east coast mills - there is no west coast support,"" said Ron McNeil, chief executive of LMS Reinforcing Steel in British Columbia, where there is no primary steel production.
The Canadian government is considering safeguards - special limits on steel imports from all countries in seven product categories - to protect steelmakers as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs send overseas producers in search of new markets. [L1N1V50V7]
Safeguards would protect plants owned by  Stelco  Holdings (TO:STLC), ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AS:MT) and others. They come on top of retaliatory duties that have made it more expensive to import U.S. steel, Canada's response to Trump's tariffs.
With about 1,000 employees, McNeil's LMS imports some 90 percent of its rebar from Asia. The closest Canadian mill, Edmonton's AltaSteel, supplies some of LMS's Alberta projects, but their capacity is limited. McNeil said it does not make sense to move rebar by rail from Ontario because transportation costs would be triple what they are from Asia. 
Fabricators typically quote fixed prices and lose money when steel prices rise.
""The shipping cost is five times more to ship it from Quebec to Newfoundland as opposed to Turkey,"" said Cory Pittman, operations manager at Allstar Rebar in St. John's, Newfoundland on Canada's Atlantic coast.
Pittman, who said all Newfoundland's construction steel comes from overseas, is part of the new Canadian Coalition for Construction Steel that is urging the government to proceed carefully on safeguards.
Canada's finance department said any new measures would stabilize ""the impact of steel imports, and minimize trade disruptions.""
But it was not clear how the government can ensure shifting supply lines do not disrupt some regions. 
A July study commissioned by the construction coalition estimated that tariffs on U.S. steel would raise the average price of rebar by 6 percent in British Columbia and safeguards would add another 7 percent, while reducing shipments.
""We know that not all provinces have equal access to steel, just by their geography,"" said Mary Van Buren, president of the Canadian Construction Association. ""That could create a shortage of steel and then secondly could lead to price escalation."" 
Steel is a relatively small part of the cost of most buildings. Real estate consultants Altus Group estimates rebar is about 4 percent the total building cost of an average condominium tower in Toronto. 
Other factors like labor shortages have already raised costs this year, and every new expense hurts when revenue is fixed due to advance sales, said David Schoonjans, senior director at Altus. 

""Even if it's done with the best of intentions, I think there's a high risk of things happening that nobody foresaw,"" he said.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>","Cigna, Express Scripts shareholders approve $52 billion deal","(Reuters) -  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) shareholders on Friday voted in favor of the health insurer's proposed $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), although the deal still needs clearance from antitrust authorities.
The vote in favor of the merger was on expected lines after activist investor Carl Icahn walked away last week from his 11th-hour attempt to rally shareholders to reject the deal. 
The U.S. Department of Justice is still conducting an antitrust review of the combination that is not expected to close until later this year.
According to the preliminary results, about 90 percent of the votes cast were in favor of the merger, the health insurer said.
Cigna expects the merger to close by end of 2018.
The insurer agreed to buy Express Scripts in March saying the two companies could save more on healthcare costs for clients if they better coordinated medical care with prescriptions. 
But since then Express Scripts has come under stiffer opposition from the Trump administration, lawmakers and drug makers as being a middleman that drives up drug costs. Icahn had argued that Cigna was overpaying given prospects for reduced profits. 
He backed down after shareholder advisory groups recommended that shareholders vote for the deal.
Express Scripts shareholders also approved the deal, with about 78 percent of outstanding shares of Express Scripts voted for the deal.
Cigna's plan for the acquisition comes as Express Scripts' major rival CVS Health (N:CVS) and  Aetna Inc  (N:AET) move forward on their own merger. Cigna's deal to be bought by Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) fell apart last year after it failed to pass antitrust review.

Cigna shares slipped 0.10 percent, while Express Scripts rose 0.47 percent.

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Commerce's Ross picks ZTE monitor after rejecting 'Never Trump' lawyer,"By Karen Freifeld and Doina Chiacu
(Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has appointed a former federal prosecutor to monitor China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) (SZ:000063) after people familiar with the matter said he rescinded an offer to a former U.S. official for signing a ""Never Trump"" letter before the 2016 presidential election. 
A new monitor for ZTE is required as part of a June settlement that ended a ban on U.S. companies selling components to China's No. 2 telecommunications equipment maker. The ban threatened ZTE's survival and became a source of friction in trade talks between Washington and Beijing. 
Roscoe Howard, a former U.S. Attorney in Washington, will lead a compliance team designed to help ensure that ZTE does not illegally sell products with American parts to Iran and other sanctioned countries. 
Howard, who got his law degree from the University of Virginia in 1977, is a partner in Barnes & Thornburg's litigation department in Washington, and served as associate independent counsel during the Clinton and George H. W. Bush administrations. 
Howard was not the first choice of Commerce Department officials.
Peter Lichtenbaum, a former assistant secretary for export administration at the Commerce Department, received a letter on Aug. 15 offering him the post, sources said. 
Ross then learned that Lichtenbaum was among the dozens of former national security officials who signed a letter in August 2016 saying Trump was not qualified to be president and they would never vote for him, the sources said on condition of anonymity. 
Last Friday, two days after making the offer, the department withdrew it, the sources said.
""This is the final decision. Period,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said about Ross's decision to rescind the offer to Lichtenbaum and choose Howard.
Trump, a former real estate magnate and reality television star, drew opposition from establishment Republicans who opposed his candidacy during the 2016 presidential campaign. His administration has been known to reject people who opposed him.
ZTE, which relies on American-origin components for its smartphones and computer networking gear, pleaded guilty last year to violating U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods and technology to Iran.
The ban on ZTE was imposed in April after officials said the company made false statements about disciplining 35 employees tied to the wrongdoing.
As part of the 2017 guilty plea, ZTE paid nearly $900 million. To lift this year's ban, it paid an additional $1 billion penalty, placed $400 million in escrow in case of future violations and installed a new board and senior management.
Under the latest agreement, the Commerce Department is selecting a monitor to oversee compliance for ZTE and its worldwide affiliates for 10 years. Howard will have a staff of at least six people funded by ZTE, including at least one expert in export controls, the Commerce spokesman said.
The government monitor has been designated as a ""special compliance coordinator"" to distinguish from another monitor for ZTE appointed by a U.S. judge in Texas when the company pleaded guilty last year.
That monitor, James Stanton, a lawyer who has handled personal injury cases among others, was picked by U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade, sources told Reuters last year. Kinkeade has control over that monitor.
A key reason the Commerce Department sought a second monitor, according to sources, was to have a qualified person police the company and report directly to the department and the company.

1377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Don't Blame Lax Antitrust for Spawning Superstars: Jackson Hole,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s plenty of evidence that many industries in the U.S. and across the developed world have become more concentrated, with market share controlled by a smaller number of firms.
That’s led to a lot of hand wringing over whether weakened competition and softened antitrust enforcement have enabled the rise of corporate giants, with dire consequences for consumers, workers and the economy.
A new paper by economist John Van Reenen, presented Friday at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, throws cold water on some, but not all, of those concerns. He argues that new technologies and globalization have amplified the advantages enjoyed by the largest and most productive companies, propelling them to their dominance.
“If more markets are becoming ‘winner-take-all’ as with digital platform competition, this will generate the dominance of ‘superstar firms,’” Van Reenen writes. “The success of such firms may be as much due to intensified competition ‘for the market’ rather than anti-competitive mergers or collusion ‘in the market.’”
Real Markets
The paper kicks off the annual retreat for central bankers hosted in Grand Teton National Park by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. This year’s conference is focused on the changing structure of real markets -- not financial markets -- and the implications for monetary policy.
Van Reenen, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, relies heavily on previous research suggesting that aggregate trends in higher profits, growing wage inequality and low productivity -- all of which point toward a general erosion of competition -- may be misleading. He and other economists have found, for example, that most American firms have seen either no increase or a decline in the markups they can charge above cost for their products.
The well-documented rise in overall profits, in other words, is driven entirely by a minority of companies, which also show the highest levels of productivity and innovation.
“The vast majority of the changes are due to reallocation between firms towards larger, more productive and profitable firms,” he says.
‘Superstar’ Firms
He detects a similar dynamic in declining labor share -- the percentage of corporate income that goes to workers. Again, he points to research finding labor share at most companies has remained steady, but declined dramatically among “superstar” firms where profits were concentrated.
Whether Van Reenen is right has implications for monetary policy. If weak competition and lax antitrust enforcement are the culprits, the concentration we’re witnessing will eventually lead to “inefficiently higher prices,” he says. That, in turn could force central bankers to tighten monetary policy. On the other hand, if the superstar scenario proves true, rising productivity should drive more growth and higher wages with less inflation.
Van Reenen is careful, however, to point out that even if he’s correct, that shouldn’t allay broad concerns about concentration and competition.
“Even if superstar firms attain their currently dominant positions on their merits of out-competing rivals, it does not mean that they will always use their power for the good of consumers,” he writes. “They may well try to entrench their position through lobbying, erecting entry barriers and buying up future rivals.”
So, the lack of antitrust enforcement may not be to blame for concentration, but concentration may make future antitrust enforcement, and other regulatory action, necessary."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors bought back into U.S. stocks this week which set their longest-ever market rally, although risks ahead spurred anxiety over how much longer the ageing bull can last, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists said on Friday.
They also declared the end of a ""tsunami"" of tech fund inflows which have driven the market higher, noting tiny inflows of $0.1 billion this week after a huge $22 billion plowed into tech year-to-date. 
Some $2.6 billion flowed into equities funds and $0.5 billion left bond funds as investors' risk appetite recovered slightly, while $1.2 billion flooded out of gold funds, strategists said, using figures from flows data provider EPFR.
The S&P 500 (SPX) extended its bull run to 3,453 days on Wednesday, the longest such streak in history by calculations which set the rally's birth at March 9, 2009.
BAML strategists, however, weren't particularly impressed, dubbing it an ""old, deflationary, polarized U.S. bull"" in a note titled ""The Old Bull and the Sea"" in a nod to Ernest Hemingway's classic. 
They argued the S&P 500 is narrow, dominated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) whose total market cap of around $4.1 trillion is greater than the combined market cap of the smallest 283 stocks in the index.
Still, overall inflows this week indicated a hesitant return to risk and BAML's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator of market sentiment drifted up to 3.3 this week from 3 last week. 
""Late summer sentiment slowly drifts from bearish toward neutral,"" strategists noted. 
U.S. equity funds drew in $4.1 billion, leading other regions by far as outstanding earnings growth, spurred by tax cuts, set U.S. stocks apart.
European equity funds suffered a 24th straight week of outflows, losing $1.1 billion. Since March they have given back all $51 billion of the inflows of 2016 to 2018, strategists noted. 
Emerging markets, in contrast, have not seen outflows as severe as that, with less than 20 percent of EM debt and equity inflows over 2016-2018 redeemed in the past four months, BAML strategists found. 
This week investors pulled just $0.1 billion from EM stocks, while EM debt saw its biggest outflows in eight weeks ($1.6 billion). 
Outside tech, sector flows showed a distinct preference for ""defensive"" high dividend, strong earning sectors with inflows to real estate, healthcare and utilities. Cycle-sensitive financials, energy and materials sectors saw outflows.
In debt markets, flows into investment-grade bond funds picked up again with $0.5 billion, while high-yield bond outflows lessened, losing just $0.5 billion. 
Gold is a contrarian buy, strategists suggested, after funds invested in the precious metal saw their biggest outflows since December 2016 this week, bringing outflows over the past three months to $7 billion.
HOT AUTUMN FOR MARKETS
This autumn presents a fork in the road for markets - with the possibility of severe negative shocks as well as a more positive path. 
Credit contagion caused by monetary tightening, excess debt and a peak in the profit cycle could cause widening spreads in EM debt to hit European high yield and U.S. investment grade, strategists said, recommending a short in high-yield bonds in this scenario.
A second possible shock could come from an autumn of ""hardball politics"", they said, with Brexit developments, Italy's budget, and China-U.S. trade disputes weighing on global purchasing managers' surveys and earnings forecasts. 
A sweep by Democrats in mid-term elections could spur a switch to ""populist redistribution"", they predicted, for example tightening stock buyback regulation. The best trade in that eventuality would be to short U.S. tech, they said. 
Among positive catalysts a peak in U.S. inflation, the U.S. 10-year bond yield edging below 2.5 percent, and China stimulus could help drive EM and European earnings estimates higher, in which case investors should hold EM and European banks. 
An acceleration in U.S. stock buybacks would also help spur markets, providing a new injection of liquidity akin to quantitative easing, strategists said. 

In 2018 so far 35 percent of U.S. profits are being spent on buybacks - not far from the peak of 38 percent in 2007.

1379,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>","Tunisair wants government backing to lay off 1,200 workers","By Tarek Amara
TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's state airline (TN:TAIR) wants to lay off 1,200 workers to ease financial difficulties which have led to flight delays and the grounding of aircraft due to lack of spare parts, its chief executive told Reuters on Friday.
Tunisair, which has a fleet of 30 aircraft, employs 8,000 staff, part of a bloated public service which the government has failed to trim due to resistance from labor unions. 
By comparison Morocco's state-owned Royal Air Maroc, which has more than 50 aircraft, has some 3,300 workers, according to its website.
""The company is suffering from major financial difficulties because of the high number of workers and the wage bill of the company,"" Elyess Mankabi, the company's chief executive, said in an interview.
""We've proposed to lay off 1,200 workers and we await the government's approval for this program, which will help the company ease its financial burden and get out of its crisis,"" he said.
""In all parts of the world, each plane is supposed to have about 80 employee but at Tunisair, each plane has 165 workers, which is hitting the company's balance sheets,"" Mankabi said.
The company has been suffering losses since the ousting of autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 sent Tunisia into turmoil, deterring tourists and investors.
It faces increased competition as Tunisia has been negotiating an Open Skies agreement with the European Union.
Tunisair has been expanding to Africa to tap new markets in anticipation of growing competition at home.
RESTRUCTURING PLAN
Angry passengers have recently vented frustration on social media about delays, which Mankabi blamed on a shortage of aircraft -- the fleet of serviceable planes has shrunk to 24 from 30 as Tunisair lacks funds to carry out maintenance, Mankabi said.
There was no immediate reaction from the government and labor unions which have failed to agree on restructuring of Tunisair or other public sectors which have high numbers of staff.
Some Tunisian lawmakers have demanded a sale of the firm instead.
The Afek Tounes party, which is not part of the ruling coalition, said in a statement the government needed to intervene urgently to rescue Tunisair.
The Open Skies agreement with the European Union will open all airports except Tunisair's main base in the capital to foreign carriers, but after four years Tunis airport will also be included.
""It will not be easy for the company after Open Skies, (which could come into force this year), But we have a reform program for the company. If implemented, we will be in the right direction,"" Mankabi said.
He said the restructuring plan would cost about one billion Tunisian dinars ($363 million).

Mankabi expects the company to lease six aircraft to boost its fleet in 2019 as the airline launches two new routes in Africa by the end of this year, to Sudan and Cameroon, bringing the number of African routes to 10.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. stock fund investors show no fear of King Dollar,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors are in no rush to shore up defenses against the strong dollar.
The greenback's 6 percent leap over the past six months has flummoxed markets from Turkey to Argentina, whose governments have to repay debt in dollars. 
The stronger currency, which makes U.S. exports more expensive to foreign buyers, has also frustrated President Donald Trump, who is trying to reduce U.S. trade deficits.
Yet among the least popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year are ""currency hedged"" funds, which invest in stocks abroad but strip out the effect of a foreign currency's performance using derivatives. That makes the funds more resilient in a ""King Dollar"" world, when the greenback is dominant, which hurts U.S. investors converting foreign stock gains back into dollars.
Some investors are betting that the dollar's run has gone too far given the risk of seismic U.S. congressional elections in November or the potential for the U.S. Federal Reserve to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes.
""We're not really hedged right now even though the consensus is for a strong dollar,"" said Komson Silapachai, vice president of research and portfolio strategy at Sage Advisory Services Ltd. ""We think there's a bigger chance that the market is underpricing the chance for a weaker dollar.""
U.S.-based currency-hedged funds have logged $10.2 billion in withdrawals this year, while their unhedged counterparts have attracted $30.7 billion, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc. That is a break from past practice, when investors rewarded currency-hedged funds as the dollar gained. 
Hedged funds took in $51.9 billion in 2014 and 2015 as the dollar leapt by more than a fifth, FactSet data shows. Currency-hedged ETFs nearly tripled in number from 20 to 58 from 2014 to 2016 in the United States. The figure has not grown since 2017.
In the more than eight months of the year-so-far, the dollar has depreciated about 2 percent against the yen but gained more than 3 percent against both the euro and a basket of top trading partners' currencies.
The euro's decline helped the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund, up 5.2 percent this year, significantly outperform the nearly flat 0.4 percent return of the unhedged Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit.
Nonetheless, the hedged WisdomTree Europe fund hemorrhaged $2.2 billion because of withdrawals this year, far higher than the $755 million investors pulled from the unhedged Vanguard Group Inc product, Lipper said.
Fast-trading investors are playing a risky game. 
Morningstar Inc analyst Daniel Sotiroff studied the performance of the currency-hedged funds from 2010 to 2018 and found investors typically underperformed the market by attempting to time the currency market.
Still, the dollar tends to falter later in the year, especially ahead of U.S. midterm elections, Silapachai said. The November elections could hand control of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives to Democrats, who are currently in the minority, opinion polls show.
The dollar could also falter if rates do not keep rising.
Rising rates attract yield-hunting foreign investors, but the Fed could delay hikes if inflation stays tame or the economy deteriorates. Short-term rates controlled by the Fed are getting closer to topping long-term rates set by the market, an omen for recession.
RiverFront Investment Group LLC, which along with Sage is among the biggest ETF investment advisers, is no longer using currency-hedged ETFs, according to its chairman, Michael Jones. He said Trump might resolve trade rifts in Europe and North America, giving a boost to foreign currencies, such as the euro.
""We believe that Trump really wants to resolve the trade conflict with the EU and NAFTA before the midterm elections,"" said Jones. The United States, Mexico and Canada have been renegotiating the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
Even investors prepared for an end to the dollar rally disagree on whether emerging markets have bottomed. Either way, the result could be a weaker dollar. 
If the Fed holds off on hiking rates because of a brewing emerging market crisis, the greenback could falter. Conversely, if emerging markets rebound, U.S. investors could sell dollars to buy foreign stocks.
Jeremy Schwartz, WisdomTree Investments Inc's director of research, warned that investors have significant assets in funds with dollar exposure, including domestic multinational companies that will find it harder to export their goods as the dollar rises.
Schwartz said his company's models are more hedged than usual on both developed and emerging markets, meaning they are on guard for further declines against the dollar. 

Yet, he said, investors ""largely have defaulted to the status quo.""

Gap typically offers big discounts to entice shoppers to buy last season's designs, but the company cut back on promotions as it prioritized profit margins over sales in the latest reported quarter, leading to disappointing results at its main brand.
The Gap brand is expected to weigh on the company's gross margins in the current quarter as it works through its inventory issues, B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson said.
Anderson, who cut her price target on the company's stock by $2 to $33, said she would remain on the sidelines until the brand showed consistent positive comparable sales.
Sales at Gap branded stores open for more than a year fell 5 percent in the fiscal second quarter, more than the 2.55 percent decline forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Other analysts saw positives in strong performance at company's other key brands - Old Navy and Athleta.
In a note titled ""Dear B.O.D. of GPS... Please Change Name of Company to Old Navy"", Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said the company's better-than-expected profit and reaffirmed guidance show that the Gap brand does not matter as long as Old Navy remains solid and Athleta continues to grow.
The Gap brand posted its worst same store sales miss in three quarters. Analysts expect sales to fall in the current quarter as well, with an average estimate of a drop of 2.6 percent.

""We think Gap will continue to lose share to fast-fashion and off-price peers,"" Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said, adding that the company had no clear execution on a plan to stave off losses in key segments.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 09:16AM ET</span>",Maersk sends first container ship through Arctic route,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A Maersk vessel loaded with Russian fish and South Korean electronics will next week become the first container ship to navigate an Arctic sea route that Russia hopes will become a new shipping highway.
The Arctic voyage by the 3,600 20-foot container capacity Venta Maersk is the latest step in the expansion of the so-called Northern Sea Route which is becoming more accessible to ships as climate change reduces the amount of sea ice.
The brand new Venta Maersk, one of the world's largest ice-class vessels, will also collect scientific data, said Maersk, underlining that the voyage is a one-off trial for now. 
The decision by Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, to test out the route is a positive sign for Russia, which hopes this could become a mini Suez Canal, cutting sea transport times from Asia to Europe. 
""A well-respected company like Maersk sending a container ship through the Arctic, definitely signals there's something there,"" Malte Humpert, a senior fellow at U.S.-based think-tank Arctic Institute, said.
For a graphic link, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2hQpiTy
The Northern Sea Route runs from Murmansk near Russia's border with Norway to the Bering Strait near Alaska. Ships sailing it require a permit from Russian authorities.
While the route is significantly shorter than going via the Suez Canal, it has not yet proven to be commercially viable for container shippers. 
""Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea Route as an alternative to our usual routes,"" a spokeswoman for Maersk said. 
""Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time,"" the spokeswoman said.
Sea ice around the North Pole reaches its biggest area at the end of the winter in March, and thaws to an annual minimum in September. The ice has shrunk in recent decades in a trend scientists have linked to man-made climate change.
In the past, more expensive ice-classed vessels, higher transit fees, unpredictable ice coverage, high insurance rates, a lack of search and rescue teams, and hefty fees for Russian ice-breaker escorts have put off many international shipping firms.
But Russian officials have said there is strong interest in the sea route from Asian countries and that new icebreakers will allow for year-round navigation in the 2020s.
The Venta Maersk left Vladivostok on Russia's east coast on Thursday and is scheduled to depart Busan, South Korea, early next week. It will then pass through the Bering strait around Sept. 1 with expected arrival in St. Petersburg on the Baltic by end-September.
NEW POLAR ROUTE
Russia is building new roads and a railway and overhauling its ports in an expansion of its freight capacity to prepare for a potential increase in shipping traffic along its Arctic coast.
""This is a matter of national pride ... if Russia wants to maintain strong, economic development, the Northern Sea Route is part of that,"" Humpert said. 
The Venta Maersk will be the first container ship to sail the route, but other types of vessels have already used it, including Maersk's Chinese rival COSCO, according to the Arctic Institute.
Russian natural gas producer Novatek delivered the first ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo to China via the Northern Sea Route in July.

In January, China revealed ambitions to create a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic.

Rothschild were not immediately available for comment. 
Italian daily MF said in an unsourced report on Friday that talks between the two banks over a tie-up or acquisition were continuing.
It added that UniCredit was working with top-flight consultants, including Rothschild's Daniel Bouton.
Bouton was a former chairman of Societe Generale, resigning in 2009 after a decade at the head of the French bank in the aftermath of a rogue trading scandal the previous year.
UniCredit's Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier is also a former manager at Societe Generale and his appointment to the position in 2016 rekindled speculation about the two joining forces.
In June, the FT reported that UniCredit was considering merging with its French rival, adding that Italy's volatile political situation had pushed back the timetable for a deal.
When asked earlier in August about potential acquisitions, Mustier said the bank's plan up to 2019 was based on organic growth but said the next plan could also consider external growth.

The report comes after Siemens earlier this month unveiled its new strategy, which sees its five industrial divisions combined into three operating companies to simplify the trains to turbines company and make its structure leaner.
Under the changes, Siemens said it expected to lift the annual growth rate and profit margin of its industrial business by 2 percentage points over the medium term and increase its basic earnings per share at a faster rate.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>","Casino firm Landing says unable to contact chairman, market value halves","By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Landing International Development Ltd (HK:0582) said it has been unable to contact its chairman and controlling shareholder for over a day, sending its shares plummeting and wiping off almost half of the casino operator's market value in a two-day selloff.
The announcement comes just weeks after authorities halted Landing's $1.5 billion casino project in the Philippines, in a move which likewise sent the firm's stock tumbling.
The management crisis is the latest at a Hong Kong-listed firm since the former chairman of Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd (HK:0993), Lai Xiaomin, resigned in April after becoming the subject of an anti-corruption investigation.
At Landing, shares plunged on Thursday before the casino operator requested a trading halt pending an announcement.
In a statement late on Thursday, Landing said it had been ""unable to contact or reach"" Yang Zhihui since earlier that day, adding its operations and finances were normal. It did not state whether it had reported the chairman as missing to the police.
A spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday that the firm was still attempting to contact the chairman. She declined to elaborate beyond the content of Landing's statement.
Landing shares resumed trading on Friday, falling as much as 33 percent before closing down 16 percent. The stock was worth HK$20 in March but has sunk to a 16-month low of HK$3.15.
The firm now has a market value of about HK$11 billion ($1.40 billion), with Yang owning 50.48 percent of its issued share capital, showed data from Thomson Reuters Eikon.
Yang was involved in property development in China's eastern Anhui province before joining Landing in 2013. Casino executives said he has a close relationship with Macau junket operators, who facilitate the VIP high-roller gambling business.
He also has business ties with Huarong, Chinese publication Caixin reported on Friday. Huarong did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Huarong's Lai is among a number of executives to be investigated under a government anti-graft campaign. Authorities have also detained executives in an effort to curb excessive financial risk, with a probe into the former chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL], Wu Xiaohui, ending in a jail sentence.
Caixin also reported that Yang had been detained at a Cambodian airport. The chief of Cambodia's Immigration Investigation Bureau, General Uk Haiseila, told Reuters on Friday that no Chinese citizen named Yang had been arrested.
Landing listed the same year Yang joined the firm, taking over listed Greenfield Chemical Holdings Co in a deal facilitated by Kingston Securities, a financial services firm headed by Hong Kong billionaire Pollyanna Chu.
It opened its first self-built casino on South Korea's Jeju island in February, and in July was granted a license to build a casino in Manila's Entertainment City.
Shortly after breaking ground in Manila on Aug. 7, however, a presidential spokesman said the casino would be canceled because Landing's lease was unfavorable to the government.

LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has raised an $11 billion loan from banks, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, as it seeks to boost its firepower to finance the kingdom's economic transformation plans.
News of the loan, which was increased from an initial guide size of $6 billion to $8 billion given by sources close to the deal in July, comes after Saudi Arabia indefinitely postponed plans to list state oil giant Aramco, according to four industry sources. 
This is the first commercial loan for the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has been charged with helping to deliver the Vision 2030 reform plan announced by the government in 2016, an ambitious economic program designed to free the kingdom from dependence on oil exports.
The PIF has also made substantial commitments to technology companies or investments, including a $45 billion agreement to invest in a giant tech fund led by Japan's Softbank (T:9984). 
On top of that, it has tentatively committed $20 billion to an infrastructure investment planned with Blackstone (N:BX).
The sovereign fund will pay a margin of 75 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate for the loan, the same as that which the Saudi government secured when it raised a syndicated loan earlier this year, the source told Reuters.
The PIF was not immediately available to comment.
Proceeds from the loan would be used for general corporate purposes, sources had told Reuters in July. 
The debt raising diversifies PIF's sources of funding, which in the past were capital injections and asset transfers from the government as well as earnings from existing investments.
The fund is expected to receive tens of billions of dollars from the sale of part or all of its stake in petrochemical company Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010) to Saudi Aramco.

Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the PIF. It has a market capitalization of $98 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday, set for its biggest weekly decline since March as markets braced for a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for hints on the direction of monetary policy, while a gauge of global stocks barely budged.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, barely managed to keep in the black, as markets in Europe opened mixed. Most major bourses in Europe registered gains of 0.1 percent apiece, although the exception was Britain's FTSE100 (FTSE) index, which fell 0.1 percent. (EU)
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 95.516 (DXY), down 0.2 percent on the day. 
The U.S. currency took a hit this week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ""not thrilled"" with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates.
Analysts said growing U.S. political uncertainty, reinforced by the criminal convictions of two of Trump's ex-advisors this week, was keeping the dollar under pressure, despite the United States embarking on greater monetary tightening than elsewhere.
""In the current state of the U.S. political system, that is dominated by doubts in the system of checks and balances, remnants of U.S. dollar negativity remain,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann. [FRX/]
Powell is due to give a speech later in the day at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference of central bankers. Where he stands on the pace of interest rate hikes will be scrutinized after minutes from the Fed's most recent policy meeting indicated the central bank would tighten monetary policy soon.
The Fed should raise rates further this year and probably next year as well, despite Trump's opposition to tighter policy, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in interviews aired on Thursday.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also said Trump's comments would not affect the central bank's decision making.
The greenback was 0.1 percent higher against the yen, at 111.405 yen per dollar.  It was 0.2 percent lower to the euro at $1.15605. (EUR=)
Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar was the biggest mover, gaining half a percent on the day after the ruling Liberal party voted in a new leader.
TRADE TALKS END WITHOUT PROGRESS
Earlier in Asia, stocks fell after U.S.-China trade talks ended without any progress. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) shed 0.25 percent. It was still up about 1 percent on the week.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) fell 0.55 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) gained 0.2 percent.
Australian stocks (AXJO) rose 0.15 percent and South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) advanced half a percent. Japan's Nikkei (N225) climbed 0.85 percent, lifted by a weaker yen.
The S&P 500 (SPX) shed 0.17 percent overnight to pull back slightly from a record high scaled midweek, with industrial shares sagging after the United States and China imposed a fresh round of trade tariffs on each other.
Shares of industrial giants  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) CAT.N and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co BA.N, bellwethers of trade confidence, were among the biggest drags on the Dow (DJI), which lost about 0.3 percent. Caterpillar shares fell 2.0 percent, and Boeing shares fell 0.7 percent.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 03:10AM ET</span>",Tipping point? Inflation creep at Australia's mines to erode margins,"By Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - As Australia's big miners gear up for a new round of expansion after years of belt tightening, prices for everything from labor to fuel to equipment have begun to rise, driving up costs and eating into margins.
Having repaired their balance sheets after a harrowing shake-out from a decade-long mining boom in 2013-2014, miners are again plowing money into new projects.
Companies say they can wring yet more savings from already low-cost operations while investing for expansion, but rising costs suggest their fattest margins may be behind them.
At the same time, metals prices are falling as a deepening Sino-U.S. trade row raises concerns about demand growth and clouds the outlook for future sales.

""The pressures are coming,"" said Rohan Walsh, a portfolio manager at Karara Capital in Melbourne. ""It's early, but looking forward there are a number of larger projects starting to ramp up again ...(so) competition for labor, machinery and parts will increase,"" he said.
""The expectation is, you do need to manage it pretty aggressively over the next 18 months otherwise there is a risk that it will erode margins.""
In June, global miner BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) gave the go-ahead for its huge South Flank iron ore expansion and rival  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) said it planned to expand in the Pilbara by developing its Koodaideri site.
RISING COSTS
Executives at a mining conference in outback Kalgoorlie this month said lead times for excavation machinery have doubled over the past two years, tire prices for underground mining trucks have surged by 50-60 percent and delivery times have doubled as miners refurbish their fleets. 
Miners say costs are rising globally, but the trend may be more pronounced in iron-ore rich Australia as demand for steel picks up early in the economic cycle. Australia is also a major coal, copper and gold supplier, and more recently a source of battery materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel. 
For a graphic on Australian miners' capital expenditure, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2P36oV7
BHP is seeing higher labor costs, particularly in parts of Australia, chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said this week. Prices were also rising for diesel, steel and sulphuric acid, used in copper production.
The expansion of the majors is likely to make it more costly for others to follow. 
Graham Kerr, CEO at diversified miner South 32 (AX:S32), said inflation was ""slightly ahead"" in its Australian operations like its Cannington silver/lead mine, but was also appearing elsewhere.
""In Cannington, we are seeing more and more competition for underground people, mine engineers, geotechnical engineers, jumbo operators. The market is becoming much more competitive in that space,"" Kerr told an earnings call. 
For a graphic on full-time employees at top Australian mining firms, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OXdQRA
The tighter labor market has been compounded by the fact that hundreds of workers laid off during the recent market trough either moved away or found work in other sectors.
The 2013-2014 bust also shattered the appeal of careers in mining engineering. The number of enrolments in courses Australia-wide tumbled to just 30 this year from more than 300 at the height of the boom, according to figures from miner Saracen Mineral (AX:SAR).
For a related graphic, click https://reut.rs/2OVInz6
""Mining engineers are as rare as hen's teeth,"" said a recruiter in Kalgoorlie. ""You can get them, but you have to pay."" 
For the world's fourth-largest iron ore miner,  Fortescue Metals  (AX:FMG), fuel, wages and currency movements were the biggest inflation drivers, Chief Executive Elisabeth Gaines told Reuters, adding that it had recently ""adjusted"" labor costs higher. 
""There are some skill shortages and that is something we are very cognizant of,"" Gaines told Reuters in an interview. 
AUTOMATION, LABOR BOOST
To combat inflation, Fortescue is automating its haulage fleet of 100 trucks and introducing a new product with a higher iron content that it expects to boost margins.
""I don't think the days of current margins are behind us at all. If anything we have a very strong strategy to enhance our operating margins,"" Gaines said. 
Australia's deflating housing bubble could also free up some semi-skilled labor, while a weakening Australian dollar is boosting revenue from the sale of products priced in U.S. dollars.
BHP's Mackenzie also expects productivity to offset some inflationary pressures, while the pace of cost increases could slow.
""With everything we see that is possible with productivity ... we have a very good shot at matching that inflation and more, to continue to drive our costs down,"" he said after the company's results.
Still, a banker in Melbourne, said that it was fair to say that for investors the most lucrative profits from the mining sector are now in the rear view mirror.
""We have seen the best of the best in terms of metals prices being helpful, currencies being helpful and companies pulling costs out,"" he said, declining to be named as it is against company policy. 

""The self help is done, the external stuff is done, so now it's a bit more challenging.""

Other highlights include confirmation that none of the ECB’s executive board members will make the trip to the Kansas City Fed’s annual central banker retreat in Wyoming’s remote Grand Teton National Park.
Policy makers gather against a backdrop of strong U.S. growth though the global economic outlook is less rosy. President Donald Trump’s trade war threatens China, while Turkey and other vulnerable emerging markets have been buffeted by financial market turmoil. Trump has also turned his ire on the Fed chief, who he picked, for raising interest rates.
Powell will be joined by both current Fed governors, Lael Brainard and Randal Quarles, as well as Fed governor nominee Marvin Goodfriend. All 11 current regional Fed presidents will be there. The San Francisco Fed has a vacancy at the top.
Investors will focus on Powell’s speech at 10 a.m. New York time Friday on monetary policy in a changing economy for confirmation of an interest-rate increase at September’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Trump might complain about rate hikes, but minutes released Wednesday of U.S. central bankers’ policy deliberations at their last meeting showed they were on track to move in September.
The conference’s formal theme is the implications of increasing market concentration and what it means for competition, consumers and workers if a a few superstar firms such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). control ever-larger market shares in many industries.

Revenue on the other hand rose to $19.5 billion from $18.4 billion a year ago, while diluted earnings per share were down to US$0.18, slightly ahead of analyst’s estimates of $0.17.
In February, AIA changed the company's financial year-end date to Dec. 31 from Nov. 30. As a result, earnings for the first half of 2018 were for the seven months that ended in June, compared to the six months that ended in May last year.
The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares opened lower in morning trade following the release of the earnings report and was down 2.1% by 1:48AM ET (05:48 GMT).

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>",Alibaba's revenue jumps but investments to prolong margin squeeze,"By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), China's biggest e-commerce firm, warned on Thursday investments in its delivery business would keep pressuring profits even as it reported its strongest-ever quarterly revenue growth, largely in line with estimates.
U.S.-listed shares of Asia's most valuable public company rose early on Thursday but then erased gains to end the day down 3 percent.
While Alibaba makes money from its core businesses, including online marketplaces Tmall and Taobao and payment platform Alipay, it also has far flung investments in sports content, microchips and facial recognition technology.
""As Alibaba continues to invest in New Retail initiatives, the consolidation of lower margin businesses such as Cainiao, Ele.me, and Lazada is shifting the long term margin profile of the core business,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.
""We expect management's ongoing focus on New Retail market share will continue to be a profitability headwind for the foreseeable future,"" said Sebastian, cutting his price target on the stock by $5 to $215. 
In April-June, Alibaba's gross margin was 11 percent versus 29.2 percent a year earlier, the lowest since the company's 2014 stock exchange listing. Profit margins at Alibaba are typically well above 20 percent. 
On Thursday, the company said it had formed a holding company for its food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, for which it had received over $3 billion in new investment commitments, including from SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and Alibaba itself. 
Quarterly net profit at Alibaba, led by China's second-richest man Jack Ma, plunged 41 percent, hurt by a one-time charge for stock-based compensation paid to employees to account for a jump in valuation of its affiliate Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL].
Without the charge, Alibaba said its net income would have risen by 33 percent from the year-ago period. Excluding one-off items, the company earned 8.04 yuan per share, or $1.22 per share, missing the average estimate of 8.15 yuan per share.
Ant Financial, China's largest financial technology company, is controlled by Ma and has a profit sharing agreement with Alibaba. It announced a $14 billion fundraising in June, which valued it at around $150 billion.
Ant Financial, which is expanding rapidly into foreign markets, is locked in a costly battle for market share at home with WeChat Pay, owned by Alibaba's arch rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700).
ACCELERATING REVENUE GROWTH
Shares of Alibaba, which has a market value of about $446 billion, are nearly flat so far this year, including Thursday's losses, compared with a 14 percent rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC). 
But Alibaba's core e-commerce business is still growing strongly at a time when the broader Chinese economy is slowing amid a trade tariff war with the United States.
It has been pushing into brick-and-mortar to complement its massive online business and stay ahead of JD.com Inc (O:JD), backed by Tencent.
Both JD.com and Tencent reported slower revenue growth in the latest quarter. Tencent was hurt by weak gaming revenue, while JD.com said that a slump in summer sales hurt profit. 
Sales at Alibaba's core e-commerce business swelled 61 percent to 69.2 billion yuan. Total June quarter sales jumped 61 percent as well to 80.9 billion yuan ($11.77 billion). Analysts expected 80.7 billion yuan, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue in Alibaba's cloud computing business nearly doubled to 4.7 billion yuan, while entertainment unit revenue rose 46.4 percent to 6 billion yuan.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2018 12:38AM ET</span>","Delayed wages, lower profits: Chinese gaming firms fret as approval freeze bites","By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As the maker of family-friendly games like ""Gardenscapes"" and ""Toy Blast"", iDreamSky Technology never expected to get caught up in a tangle with Chinese regulators.
But the Shenzhen-based gaming company is enduring an unprecedented wait for over a dozen of its games to be approved for release in China, a situation it fears could impact profits this year.
iDreamSky is one of many Chinese gaming firms fretting over the implications of a regulatory hold-up that began in March and prompted Tencent (HK:0700), China's largest social media and gaming company, to warn of slower revenue growth.
The reason for the approval slowdown appears to be the result of a bureaucratic reshuffle this year as China tightened its grip on content for entertainment ranging from video games to television reality shows. 
Those changes have bogged down the approval process as the purview of each regulatory office is refined, industry insiders say.
While analysts expect Tencent to bounce back thanks to its many business streams, they say many smaller companies that rely on a few game releases a year are at risk.
""It's hurt us a lot,"" said one iDreamSky employee, referring to the approval situation. ""This will have an impact on our business in the second half of this year and next year."" The employee spoke on condition of anonymity, citing market sensitivities. 
iDreamSky, which is planning to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange, said in May it expected to launch 13 licensed and self-developed games in 2018 and 2019, in genres ranging from sports to puzzles. 
The company was previously listed on the United States' Nasdaq board and is backed by Tencent, which is its second-largest shareholder with a 20.65 percent stake. 
iDreamSky did not respond to requests for comment. 
RICH PICKINGS
China overtook the United States as the largest single gaming market by revenue in 2016, and is expected to rake in $37.9 billion this year, up 17 percent from last year, according to the research firm Newzoo. 
The Chinese gaming industry comprises over 200 companies, 188 of which are publicly listed and earn 90 percent of total revenue, Newzoo said. 
These companies are subject to complicated game approval procedures in China, with executives saying that it can take six months or more for a game to be approved for sale.
Games have to be approved by the government watchdogs for media publication, cyberspace and intellectual property, as well as the ministries for culture and information technology, who scrutinize things like content and copyrights. Additional approvals are required for imported games.
""You need licenses for everything in China,"" said David Hanson, co-chief executive of the gaming distribution platform Ultra. ""But in the West it's instant - you work in a basement and then release your game."" 
LONG QUEUES 
Tencent last week said a government restructuring had caused a temporary suspension of approvals that would have allowed it to monetize its most popular game.
The Chinese government in March split the industry's main regulator into two units, while transferring some power to the Communist Party propaganda department, in a step aimed at strengthening its grip over content and ideology.
Government data shows that the reorganization coincided with a halt in approvals. 
China gave the green light to 1,982 domestic and foreign online games between January and March this year before suddenly stopping approvals, according to government data. In 2017, it approved a total of 9,651 domestic and foreign online games.
China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism did not respond to requests for comment. 
A founder of a gaming studio in the northern province of Hebei, who would only agree to use his surname, Cang, said he been forced to delay salary payments and use his own money to keep his business going. 
""The approval freeze hits small game companies like mine the hardest, it makes it hard for us to go on,"" said Cang, whose company has seven employees. ""My goal for this year is not to go bankrupt.""
Fuchun Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300299), which makes mobile, console and online games, said in July that it would likely report a fall in profit of up to 75 percent for the first half as it was unable to release new games as scheduled. 
NO ZOMBIES 
Some reprieve has been given in the form of a ""green channel"" which allows new games to obtain one-month temporary licenses for new games, but only ten have so far been granted this, industry executives said.
The government is still assessing games despite the halt in approvals, said a censor at a publishing house in the eastern city of Hangzhou who examines games before they go to the central regulator for further checks. He said that there had been a tightening this year on what types of content were acceptable.
Content seen as being at odds with China's ""socialist core values"" is being scrubbed, while games that are too violent and gory - for example those involving zombies - are being rejected, said the censor, who only gave his surname as Zhang. 
For now, companies can only keep applying for approvals and hope things change, said the iDreamSky employee. 
""We're still filling out all the applications,"" she said. ""Maybe things will get back to business by October or end of the year. We all hope so.""

(The story corrects paragraph 23 to show Fuchun said it was likely to report a fall of up to 75 percent in first-half profit, not a loss.)

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The world's first public bond created and managed using only blockchain had support from seven investors, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the sole lead manager of the deal said on Friday, helping raise A$110 million ($80.48 million) for the World Bank. 
Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA) executive general manager James Wall said that the deal, designed to test how the technology might improve decades-old bond sales practices, had exceeded expectations and interest had been ""overwhelming"". 
The American fund  Northern Trust  (O:NTRS), three Australian state governments, local pension fund First State Super, and CBA were the investors in the deal, which is being viewed as an initial step in moving bond sales away from manual processes towards faster and cheaper automation.
World Bank Treasurer Arunma Oteh said there had been ""huge"" interest.
""I am delighted that this pioneer bond transaction using the distributed ledger technology, bond-i, was extremely well received by investors,"" said Oteh, referring to the deal acronym, standing for Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument as well as a reference to Australia's most famous beach. 
""We are particularly impressed with the breath of interest from official institutions... these high-quality investors understood the value of leveraging technology for innovation in capital markets."" 
The World Bank, whose bonds carry an AAA rating, regularly uses its borrowing power to help develop new bond markets as well as pioneering new means for selling and trading the securities.
It issues between $50 billion and $60 billion a year of bonds to back economic progress in developing countries.
Australia is a popular test site for market developments because of its well-established financial infrastructure and the familiarity of international investors with the Australian dollar, which is one of the most-traded currencies in the world.
While there have been other prototypes or parallel simulation blockchain projects in the market before, CBA said the World Bank bond will be the first time that capital is raised from public investors through a legally valid bond issuance that uses blockchain from start to finish.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday it will review a decision by its staff to block nine bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds from coming to market.
Staff at the SEC on Wednesday rejected applications for new funds from three companies, suggesting they were not yet convinced that the products would not be subject to fraud or manipulation.
But the SEC's four commissioners will review those decisions, according to letters the SEC posted on its website. 
SEC staff have delegated authority to make a decision on such applications, meaning the commissioners and the SEC chairman have the power to review the decision if they desire. 
The commissioners had previously voted 3-1 to reject another bitcoin ETF application, with Republican commissioner Hester Peirce dissenting on the basis she felt doing so stifled innovation.
The virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. A fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.

Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) was trading up nearly 2 percent at $6,480 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Thursday after the SEC posted the letters.

No further talks between the two sides had been scheduled, Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the discussions. 
The person added that it is likely no further negotiation would happen until after November’s mid-term elections in the U.S. 
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were both down 0.3% by 9:45PM ET (01:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index traded 0.5% lower. 
Following the conclusion of the U.S.-China meeting this week, the White House said in a statement that the countries “exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship.”
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods just after midnight ET Thursday, prompting China to respond with in-kind measures against U.S. goods.
Overnight, the S&P 500 closed just below breakeven Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.1%.
Powell’s Jackson Hole symposium remarks, due at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), are the highlight of the trading day. Markets will likely be focusing on anything from the Fed chief about maintaining the central bank’s independence after U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he was “not thrilled” about the Fed’s recent hikes and reportedly told people at a fundraiser he was expecting Powell be a cheap-money chairman.
""For equities, the key point will be whether Powell indicates that the Fed is poised to hike rates two more times this year. That would fall in line with expectations and not cause much of a stir,"" said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo.
""Any mention of recent turbulence in the emerging markets may also provide the risk asset markets with some relief.""
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1% as traders await the decision on Friday that would determine the fate of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as rivals seek enough signatures to force a vote on his leadership.
Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%, while South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.2%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors apparently saw a buying opportunity in China despite ongoing trade tensions, adding their most exposure to that market since January, Lipper data for the latest week showed on Thursday.
Investors bought $572 million shares in U.S.-based funds that invest primarily in Chinese equities during the week ended Wednesday, according to the research service.
U.S. and Chinese officials ended two days of talks on Thursday with no major breakthrough as the bilateral trade war escalated with the activation of another round of dueling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country's goods.
Yet investors are expecting Beijing to continue counteracting the effects of the dispute with increasingly relaxed monetary and fiscal policies.
China last week reported downbeat economic data, but rolled out a $14 billion urban railway plan and pushed local governments to speed up issuance of special bonds for the funding of infrastructure projects.
""They're continuing to do more and more,"" said Komson Silapachai, vice president of research and portfolio strategy at Sage Advisory Services Ltd. ""We just think that China has reversed course.""
But there were still some signs of risk aversion in the market. Money market funds, where investors park cash, collected $4.2 billion during the weekly period, after investors pulled out $2.2 billion the week before, Lipper said.
U.S.-based energy sector mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posted $701 million in withdrawals during the week, the most pulled from those funds since September 2016, the data showed.

The S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) has fallen 3.7 percent over the past three months, including dividends, following oil prices lower. Crude prices have been hurt by worries about the global economic growth outlook given trade tensions.

(Reuters) - Gap Inc's (N:GPS) namesake brand reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly same-store sales on Thursday, sending shares down nearly 7 percent in after-hours trade even as the apparel retailer beat Wall Street profit expectations and posted strong revenue.
The results signaled the San Francisco company still must work to revive its Gap brand, which has struggled to keep pace with fast-fashion rivals such as H&M (ST:HMb) and Forever 21 and tackle the dominance of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
Reaffirming its forecast on Thursday, Gap Inc battled rising inventory during the quarter, especially that of Gap brand, as older styles and some summer basics remain on the shelves.
The company earlier offered huge discounts on Gap-label apparel mainly to clear inventories but which ended up hurting sales and margins.
Gap executives said on Thursday the focus has turned toward improving margins. 
""Obviously, we're not pleased with this performance,"" Chief Financial Officer Teri List-Stoll told analysts on a conference call, but added, ""it reflects the conscious choice to prioritize margin dollars over comp growth as we continue to move through the inventory issues in the brand.""
List-Stoll expects some improvement in the fall and through the holidays. 
But Gap brand's assortment continues to look boring, with little effort being made to create newness, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said on Thursday.
""It discourages people from visiting and purchasing ... It means Gap struggles to charge full price and has to resort to continuous discounting to try and stimulate sales,"" Saunders said in emailed comments. 
Gap Chief Executive Art Peck said an improved supply chain remains a focus.
""There's no question that this is an important factor of powering Old Navy's consistency, Athleta's growth and Banana's continued turnaround,"" Peck said on the same call, referring to Gap's other brands.
Old Navy, which offers lower-priced apparel, again performed well. Same-store sales rose 5 percent, topping analysts' estimate of 4.5 percent growth.
Sales at Gap brand stores open for more than a year fell 5 percent in the fiscal second quarter, more than the 2.55 percent decline forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Gap Inc's net sales rose 7.5 percent to $4.09 billion in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, beating analysts' average estimate of $4.01 billion.
Excluding certain items, Gap earned 76 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 72 cents.

Gap shares were down 6.6 percent at $30.30 in after-hours trading.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A lawsuit attempting to block the Trump administration from arresting illegal immigrants seeking to legalize their status based on their marriages to U.S. citizens can move forward, a federal judge in Boston ruled on Thursday. 
U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf said the American Civil Liberties Union can proceed with the lawsuit, which accuses the government of unlawfully separating certain illegal immigrants from their families as they sought lawful residency.
The lawsuit centers on regulations the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) enacted in 2016 during former Democratic President Barack Obama's administration that allowed certain non-citizens, who were married to U.S. citizens, to remain in the country while they applied for legal residency.
The ACLU's lawsuit said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under President Donald Trump was detaining people seeking to benefit from those regulations when they went to government offices as part of the legalization process.
The Republican president's administration has taken a hard line on restricting immigration.
The ACLU has said records show that USCIS officials in New England collaborated with ICE agents to arrest immigrants when they came in for interviews.
The civil rights group said that amounted to a ""trap"" that violated the rights of illegal immigrants who were following regulations designed to help them to become lawful residents.
Wolf on Thursday rejected the Justice Department's claim that he lacked jurisdiction under federal law to hear any lawsuit challenging the authority of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which ICE forms part of, to enforce a removal order against an immigrant.
Wolf said the lawsuit plausibly alleged that ICE failed to consider whether immigrants were seeking an exemption under the 2016 regulations before detaining them.
""ICE may not order the removal of an alien pursuing a provisional waiver merely on the basis of finding the alien is subject to a final order of removal,"" Wolf said in court.
ICE declined to comment, citing the pending nature of the lawsuit, which seeks class action status.
The class action claims in the lawsuit were added to an earlier case centered on Lilian Calderon, a Guatemalan immigrant who was arrested at a government office in Rhode Island in January after an interview that was part of the process to seek legal status. 

Calderon, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has two children, was detained for about a month and was only released after the lawsuit was filed.

(Reuters) -  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) agreed to stop calling the oats in its Nature Valley granola bars 100 percent natural to settle a lawsuit by three consumer groups that said the bars contained small amounts of the pesticide commonly known as Roundup.
Beyond Pesticides, Moms Across America and the Organic Consumers Association on Thursday said the settlement calls for General Mills to remove the phrase ""Made with 100% Natural Whole Grain Oats"" from Nature Valley labels.
The groups said independent tests showed that the granola bars contained 0.45 parts per million of glyphosate, and that oats were the ""most likely"" source of the pesticide.
While this was below the maximum 30 parts per million that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends, the groups said General Mills' label was deceptive and that ""no reasonable consumer"" would expect the bars to contain anything unnatural.
""Nature Valley is confident in the accuracy of its label,"" General Mills spokesman Mike Siemienas said in an email.
He said the Minneapolis-based company settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, and focus on making Nature Valley products ""with 100 percent whole grain oats.""
The settlement came 13 days after a San Francisco jury ordered  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co to pay a school groundskeeper $289 million after he said his exposure to its Roundup weed killer and another glyphosate herbicide caused his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), which now owns Monsanto, has said it would appeal the jury's verdict.
The General Mills lawsuit was one of many accusing food companies of using deceptive labels, including terms such as ""natural"" that do not have clearly understood meanings, to induce consumers to buy or pay more for their products.
In July 2017, a Minneapolis federal judge dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit over General Mills' ""100% Natural"" label, saying that even if the oats contained traces of glyphosate, ""there is no allegation that the oats, themselves, are not natural.""
A subsequent appeal was dismissed.
The consumer groups had sued General Mills two years ago in Superior Court in Washington, D.C.

The Organic Consumers Association sued  Unilever  Plc (AS:UNc) (L:ULVR) in the same court on July 9 over its labeling for Ben & Jerry's ice cream, including a claim over the use of glyphosate.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell on Thursday as trade-sensitive stocks were hit by a fresh round of tariffs in the trade dispute between the United States and China.
Despite ongoing talks, the two countries imposed tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods.
Shares of industrial giants  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), which have been bellwethers of trade sentiment, were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Caterpillar shares fell 2.0 percent, and Boeing shares fell 0.7 percent.
In the S&P 500, the technology sector (SPLRCT) was the sole gainer, rising 0.2 percent. But it pared gains late in the session, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq into negative territory along with the S&P and the Dow.
""It's tough to say how far this will go,"" Brendan Erne, director of portfolio implementation at Personal Capital in San Francisco, said of the U.S.-China trade dispute. ""It could be a fairly long and winding road, but at least it's encouraging that both sides are talking now.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 76.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,656.98, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 4.84 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,856.98 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 10.64 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,878.46.
The energy index (SPNY) fell 0.5 percent and the materials index (SPLRCM) fell 0.7 percent, the biggest percentage drops among the S&P's major sectors, as prices of crude oil and metals fell due to trade war worries.
The potential political fallout from the legal woes of two former advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump also weighed on investor sentiment.
Data from the U.S. Labor Department indicated the labor market was holding firm despite trade tensions as jobless claims fell for the third straight week.
Investors said they were keeping a close eye on the meeting of U.S. central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak on Friday. His speech will be watched for clues on monetary policy after minutes from the most recent meeting indicated that the Fed would raise interest rates soon.
Shares of  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL) fell after the meat producer attributed its underwhelming quarterly results to Chinese tariffs, which Hormel said have led to domestic oversupply and lower prices. Hormel shares ended the session down 3.1 percent.
Shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands Inc (N:LB) plunged 11.4 percent to reach their lowest level since March 2011 after the retailer cut its full-year profit forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.93-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 25 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 137 new highs and 32 new lows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.30%. The S&P 500 fell 0.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.13%.
The China and U.S. tariffs on each other's goods, that went into effect on Thursday, underlined the ongoing trade spat between the two nations, ushering in a cautious day of trade.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods just after midnight ET Thursday, prompting China to respond with in-kind measures against U.S. goods.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) -- both of which have significant internationally exposure, making them vulnerable to rising trade tensions -- succumbed to trade-war fears, closing lower for the day.
The return to investor focus of the escalating U.S.-Sino trade spat comes even as both nations resumed mid-level trade talks for the second-straight day, although many anticipate little, if any, progress.
Sentiment on U.S. was also soured by worries over legal issues concerning Trump. The president's former lawyer, Michael Cowen, implicated him in crimes on Tuesday, saying he had violated the law at the behest of Trump.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and warned that market would ""crash,"" should measures be taken to impeach him.
Beyond the political and trade-war drama, investor attention was also swayed by ongoing corporate earnings.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) stock closed 3% lower after its 61% jump in revenue year on year fell short of estimates. L Brands (NYSE:LB) stock slumped 11% after it cut its full-year profit guidance.
Falling energy stocks exacerbated the move lower in the broader market after oil prices pared gains to settle lower on trade concerns.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 3 cents settle at $67.83 a barrel.
Further evidence that growth in the housing market may be cooling gave market participants further reason to hold off on U.S. stocks. Sales of new homes in the U.S. unexpectedly fell in July to a 9-month low.
The Commerce Department said Thursday new home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units last month, the lowest level since October 2017. That missed economists’ forecasts.

1424,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 04:28PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Chief Powell Takes Center Stage
While economists are enjoying scenic Jackson Hole, Wyo., investors will have to stick around (for the morning at least) to see the text of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech.
Powell’s Jackson Hole symposium remarks, due at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), are the highlight of the trading day. And it could have some extra impact, given the typically low volume of August Fridays.
Along with the normal parsing for any further hints on the path or rate increases, traders will be looking for anything from the Fed chief about maintaining the central bank’s independence.
President Donald Trump recently expressed that he’s “not thrilled” about the Fed’s recent hikes and reportedly told people at a fundraiser he was expecting Powell to help him out by being a cheap-money chairman.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George said two more rate hikes this year could still be appropriate, in interviews released Thursday, and added the FOMC will be able to maintain its independence.
“Expressions of angst about higher interest rates are not unique to this administration,” George told CNBC.
Powell’s speech may also contain some hints on the Fed’s feeling on the economic impact of trade battles. The Fed expressed concern about trade battles stemming economic growth, according to Fed meeting minutes released Wednesday.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods just after midnight ET Thursday, prompting China to respond with in-kind measures against US goods.
2. Core Durable Goods Expected to Rise
Before Powell heads to the mic, the Commerce Department will report the latest durable goods numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Orders for goods that last three or more years are expected to have fallen 0.5% in July, compared with a rise of 0.8% the month before, according to a survey of economists.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, are forecast to have risen 0.5% last month.
Economists expect that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4%.
3. Foot Locker Continues Retail Earnings Parade
The earnings calendar is predictably light tomorrow, but the quarterly numbers out this week have provoked some strong moves in individual stocks.
Athleticwear retailer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) releases its latest results before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analyst surveyed expect that the company earned 70 cents a share on sales of about $1.7 billion.
Along with same-stores sales figures, investors will be looking at inventory levels to see how well the company is moving stock without big markdowns.
Shares fell sharply in early 2017, but have since staged a comeback and are up around 50% in the last year."

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>",JPMorgan undercuts discount brokerages on trades,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) in a bid to lure customers from the discount brokerage industry, said on Tuesday it will begin offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app starting next week. 
Shares of  Charles Schwab  Corp. (N:SCHW) and other discount brokerages fell after CNBC reported the offering was imminent. 
The service will be part of a new suite of investment products called ""You Invest"" through which customers will get at least 100 free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds in their first year, a bank spokeswoman said on Tuesday.
As part of the You Invest offering the bank also plans to launch online managed portfolios early next year, the spokeswoman said.
The industry had been anticipating some sort of dramatic move by JPMorgan for several years. In April 2017 Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter that an ""inexpensive"" self-directed online tool was coming by the end of that year. He also has talked adding free services as part of a bigger consumer package, much like he has seen Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) do with its Prime service. 
Still, the amount of price-cutting, coupled with the bank's widely-used app, makes the move by the biggest U.S. bank potentially disruptive to the discount brokerage industry pioneered by Charles Schwab Corp. (N:SCHW) 
""While this has been telegraphed for some time, JPM entering the discount brokerage market is not your typical bank given its size, scale and global brand,"" equity analysts at Jefferies said in a note on Tuesday.
Shares of Schwab were down 2.35 percent to $50.21 Tuesday afternoon, while shares of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (O:AMTD) were down 7.53 percent to $55.62. E*Trade Financial Corp's (O:ETFC) stock was down more than 4.25 percent to $58.63.
The move follows other disruptive actions by JPMorgan in what analysts have called a ""scorched earth"" strategy against competitors to take market share in profitable business across banking and finance--from credit cards to commercial lending to securities custody.
The new investment services are being offered to so-called ""mass affluent"" customers with no minimum initial investment size, as well as to wealthier clients.
After one year of free trades, the bank expects to add some charges, with pricing depending on the type of account. 
In comparison, Schwab currently charges $4.95 on stock trades while TD Ameritrade charges $6.95 per trade.

JPMorgan's new service will also compete with startups like Robinhood, an online brokerage which offers commission-free U.S. stocks and ETFs trading.

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>","Fidelity fund votes backed Tesla, potential sign of more support","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Funds run by Fidelity Investments sided with Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) management on director votes and other controversial items this spring, filings showed on Thursday, and experts said that could indicate further support for Tesla CEO Elon Musk as he looks to take the company private.
Fidelity funds that are top Tesla holders, including Blue Chip Growth Fund, (O:FBGKX) Growth Company Fund (O:FDGRX) and Contrafund (O:FCNTX), all voted as Tesla recommended at two shareholder meetings held in March and June, the filings showed.
At both Tesla meetings top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended critical votes, citing concerns about Musk's pay and board independence, among other things. Fidelity's votes marked the second set of supportive ballots disclosed by a top investor in the carmaker so far this year.
A Fidelity spokeswoman said the Boston-based firm would not comment on what the votes might suggest about the go-private deal Musk is seeking. How much backing funds offer will determine how much money Musk will need to raise in his unprecedented bid to take the company private.
Asked about the votes, Tesla spokesman Dave Arnold noted comments Musk made in a blog post that he would sound out some top investors about going private and that ""Our largest investors have been extremely supportive of Tesla over the years."" 
The positive votes by the Fidelity funds on the controversial election items could suggest their managers will be more likely to support Musk going forward, said Francis Byrd, a corporate governance consultant.
""You could presume they are sort of locked in,"" Byrd said, though he cautioned that the funds would ultimately want to see the financials of any deal Musk puts forward.
A July 24 filing by Scotland's Baillie Gifford, Tesla's largest owner after Musk himself, also showed it backing Tesla across the board at both meetings. A Baillie Gifford representative declined to comment. 
The special meeting in March was held to approve a new compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Musk. A filing showed the plan won support from about 81 percent of votes cast.
Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended voting against the award as too rich. ISS also recommended votes against two of three Tesla directors who stood for election at its regular meeting in June, citing concerns about their independence and seats on other boards.
ISS also recommended investors back shareholder proposals including one that would require an independent chairman. The directors each won at least 89 percent support, a filing showed, and the proposal for an independent chair was backed by only about 16 percent of votes present.
Thursday's filings offered a rare look at thousands of influential votes Fidelity cast at shareholder meetings this year.
Also noteworthy was that Contrafund, a top shareholder in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), backed one of two proposals at its May 31 meeting calling for the world's largest social media company to revamp its voting structure.
While neither measure passed, strong support they received from outside investors was seen as a rebuke to leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, over their slow response to data privacy concerns.
The filing also showed Contrafund supported all eight Facebook directors up for election including Zuckerberg.

Spokespeople for Fidelity and Facebook did not immediately comment.

The Swiss bank said on Thursday that customers that were not sanctioned would not be affected by its move in the second quarter, which it said ""does not represent a freezing of the assets"".
""Credit Suisse reclassified certain impacted assets from assets under management to assets under custody,"" a spokeswoman for the bank said, adding that this had not resulted in a financial loss for the bank.
""We remain highly committed to Russia and continue to monitor developments,"" she said.
The move by Credit Suisse, which owned aircraft surrendered by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska and had lent money to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg before sanctions, underscores a widespread fear among banks of reprisal from Washington.

For Russia's elite, such steps could close off an important avenue for finance as well as a safe haven for billions of rubles of their wealth.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 11:51AM ET</span>","Bayer's Monsanto faces 8,000 lawsuits on glyphosate","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The number of U.S. lawsuits brought against Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) newly acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) has jumped to about 8,000, as the German drugmaker braces for years of legal wrangling over alleged cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers.
Bayer had previously disclosed 5,200 such lawsuits against Monsanto, which it acquired in a $63 billion deal completed in June.
""The number of plaintiffs in both state and federal litigation is approximately 8,000 as of end-July. These numbers may rise or fall over time but our view is that the number is not indicative of the merits of the plaintiffs' cases,"" Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann told analysts in a conference call on Thursday.
Bayer shares have lost more than 10 percent since Monsanto was ordered on Aug. 10 to pay $289 million in damages in the first U.S. lawsuit over glyphosate-based weedkillers such as Roundup and Ranger Pro.
The legal headache adds to a number of distractions for Bayer, such as falling consumer care product sales and a rebuke on production practices from the U.S. drugs watchdog, as it seeks to strengthen its drug development pipeline and has begun integrating Monsanto into its organisation.
""While this is disappointing, it is not surprising. Indeed, in our litigation scenario analysis, we assumed a doubling of cases to 10,400,"" said Alistair Campbell, analyst at brokerage Berenberg.
Bayer shares were down 1.8 percent at 1600 GMT while the German blue chip index (GDAXI) was up 0.2 percent. 
CEO Baumann reiterated Bayer's view that the jury's verdict on Aug. 10 was inconsistent with the science-based conclusions of regulators.
Bayer said it will initially petition the judge to reverse the jury's verdict from Aug. 10, and ""if necessary"" challenge the ruling with California appellate courts, which will take at least a year. 
When asked whether Bayer would consider settling cases out of court, he said: ""We will vigorously defend this case and all upcoming cases.""
Bayer executives on the call stressed that demand for glyphosate and seeds for crops that tolerate the broad-spectrum herbicide had not been affected by the verdict.
""Nothing whatsoever has changed in the regulatory status of the product. There is simply very high demand, and has been for many decades for glyphosate. It is an invaluable tool for growers,"" said Liam Condon, the head of Bayer's newly enlarged Crop Science division.
Bayer also said on Thursday that it sees no reason to re-assess the legal risks from Monsanto.
Last week Bayer, which is retiring the Monsanto name, launched the integration of Monsanto into its organisation. That is seen as a daunting task even without the litigation, almost two years after it signed the $63 billion deal.

Bayer's second-quarter results, due on Sept. 5, would include provisioning for legal defence costs but no money would at that point be set aside for any possible future damages, finance chief Wolfgang Nickl said.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Japan's Mizuho to take on more lending risk to arrest decline in profitability: CEO,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) will shed its conservative approach to lending and take on greater risk at home and abroad, its new chief executive told Reuters, as Japan's second-largest bank by assets looks to reverse its falling profitability.
Mizuho is the least profitable of Japan's three mega-banks. Unlike peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group Inc (T:8316), Mizuho has not splurged abroad in search of growth to offset stagnation at home where aggressive central bank policy eats into lending income.
One criticism analysts often level at Mizuho is an apparent focus on large, blue-chip firms which have a very low chance of defaulting on loan repayments and so are able to borrow cheaply - something which also makes them not very profitable customers.
Tatsufumi Sakai, who assumed his role in April, said Mizuho must change its risk-averse culture to improve profitability.
""We are taking various measures to improve our risk-taking capabilities,"" Sakai said in an interview. ""For instance, we are making conscious efforts in the overseas non-investment grade field, where we had a tendency to seek safety and avoid errors.""
Mizuho's domestic loan-deposit rate margin - the difference between interest earned from loans and paid for deposits - was 0.84 percent for October-March, compared with 0.97 percent at SMFG. It was 1.24 percent five years earlier, just before the central bank began a policy aimed at reducing lending costs.
Under another initiative, Sakai, 58, said credit officers responsible for screening loans are being embedded with each business unit rather than grouped in an independent department, to make the whole process of lending more responsive to clients.
""We cannot help customers when they really need it by just playing safe,"" said Sakai, a career Mizuho banker.
On expanding abroad, Sakai said Mizuho is unlikely to buy a full-service bank catering to both retail and business clients, such as MUFG target PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk (JK:BDMN).
""Basically, our global business is 'B2B' (business to business) and it's our priority to sharpen our edge there,"" he said. ""We won't try to enter B2C (business to consumer) in a single big deal.""
Rather, he said Mizuho is more likely to invest in or buy financial technology (fintech) start-up companies, for which the bank has a dedicated private equity fund.
Traditional financial institutions have been investing in fintech research and start-ups in anticipation of nimbler, innovative rivals attracting younger generations with cheaper, easier-to-use services in areas such as lending and remittance. 

""For us, it's important from the viewpoint of buying seeds for technology and business. It won't cost much anyway,"" Sakai said.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",U.S. banking profits hit record $60 billion in second quarter: FDIC,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. banking sector reported a record $60.2 billion in profits in the second quarter, up 25.1 percent from the same period one year ago.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported on Thursday that a little more than half of those gains resulted from a lower effective tax rate. The other half of the gains came from higher net interest income, it said. 
Only 3.8 percent of banks reported net losses, while more than 70 percent reported year-over-year growth.
Banks had reported a record $56 billion in profits in the first quarter, as they took advantage of the lower tax rates passed by Congress at the end of 2017. 
Profits would have increased just 11.7 percent in the second quarter without the boost from the new tax law, the FDIC said.
FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams said the new numbers show banks continue to grow, but she warned that competition for business could drive some institutions to take on more risk.
""The competition to attract loan customers will be intense, and it will remain important for banks to maintain their underwriting discipline and credit standards,"" she said in a statement.
Banks are also preparing for a reduced regulatory burden, after President Donald Trump signed a law in May easing rules for most institutions. Many of those law's provisions have yet to take full effect.

The number of problem banks monitored by regulators fell to 82 in the second quarter, from 92 in the first quarter, the FDIC said. That is the lowest number since the fourth quarter of 2007.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 11:11AM ET</span>",Senate panel votes to advance Trump pick to head consumer watchdog,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted on Thursday to advance President Donald Trump's pick to head the federal consumer watchdog despite criticism from Democratic senators.
Kathy Kraninger, a senior official in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was approved on a 13-12 party-line vote to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She would replace Mick Mulvaney the OMB chief who is also serving as acting director at the agency since November.
Her nomination now advances to the full Senate, which has yet to schedule a confirmation vote.
The Senate seems likely to confirm Kraninger, but Democrats are continuing to press for details on the precise role she may have played in implementing the immigration policy that separated families.
In July, Kraninger told Congress that while she did attend meetings relating to the administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, she did not play a role in setting or developing Trump's “zero tolerance” immigration policy that separated more than 2,000 children from their parents. 
Democratic Senators Sherrod Brown and Elizabeth Warren have said Kraninger has not been sufficiently detailed in her answers. But it was unclear if that will be enough to discourage Republicans from supporting her.
""Kathy Kraninger was part of the Trump Administration’s effort to traumatize kids and rip them away from their families. She should be held accountable and fired — not promoted,"" Warren told Reuters in an email on Wednesday.
Kraninger and the OMB did not respond to requests for comment.
Republicans said the agency, which is responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector, has overstepped its authority and hope Kraninger will continue to rein it in. Democrats and consumer advocates want to keep it from being further weakened.
The banking panel on Thursday also advanced the nomination of Elad Roisman, currently the committee's chief counsel, to fill a Republican seat on the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The committee also voted to advance Dino Falaschetti as the new head of the Office of Financial Research. The administration has targeted the agency, which gathers data on financial markets, for drastic cuts and moved earlier this month to reduce staff by one-quarter..

The outlook cut hinted that PINK could be going down the same road as Victoria's Secret, which has been losing customers as more women shift to cheaper bralettes and sports bras from companies such as American Eagle Outfitter's (N:AEO) Aerie.
Pink was launched in 2002, targeting younger customers that the more high-end Victoria's Secret, known for its splashy fashion shows and winged models, was failing to attract.
Shares of L Brands tumbled more than 10 percent to $28.61 in early trading. They have lost more than half their value since the beginning of the year.
L Brands cut its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $2.45 to $2.70 per share from a range of $2.70 to $3.00 estimated previously.
Analysts on average expected earnings of $2.69 per share in fiscal 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Comparable sales at Victoria's Secret, which also houses Pink, fell 1 percent in the second quarter, bigger than the 0.3 percent fall analysts had expected.
Victoria Secret is broken, and Pink is cracking and will not be a quick fix, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said.
L Brands also said Pink Chief Executive Officer Denise Landman would retire at the end of the year and would be replaced by Bath & Body Works executive Amy Hauk.

Reuters on Wednesday reported that Saudi Arabia had called off its plans for listing the oil giant as the country shifts its attention to a proposed stake in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

The bank has terminated the contract of the senior banker, who was at the centre of the incident, as well as that of a second manager who was found to have hampered the original investigation, the FT said.
The victim has left the company, but in January this year was inspired by the #MeToo movement to send two letters to current chief executive Tidjane Thiam, urging him to look again at the case, the FT said.
Credit Suisse declined to comment.

In July, the bank created a new role to lead its handling of sexual harassment claims following a review into the way it handled such cases, including the 2010 incident.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",Oklahoma Medicaid tests new tactic to curb U.S. drug costs,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A new front in the battle over the cost of expensive medicines in the United States is opening up in Oklahoma, the first state where the government's Medicaid program is negotiating contracts for prescription drugs based on how well they work.
In June, Oklahoma received approval from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to factor how effective a prescription medicine is into the price it pays to the manufacturer. 
The state has signed its first contract under this strategy with Alkermes Plc for injected schizophrenia treatment Aristada, and is close to new agreements for an expensive antibiotic and an epilepsy drug, Nancy Nesser, pharmacy director at the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, told Reuters.
An Alkermes spokesperson said the arrangement is intended to ""encourage patients to stay in treatment longer and meet treatment goals."" List prices for the long-acting drug, given every month to six weeks, start at about $1,200 a month. Under the one-year contract, the price decreases every other month as long as the prescription is refilled.
""The longer the member takes it, the better the rebate,"" Nesser said. 
State-run Medicaid departments are powerful purchasers in the $450 billion U.S. market for prescription medicines. By law, the health program for the poor and disabled receives a mandatory 23 percent discount off drug prices, and often negotiates additional rebates for individual medicines. 
But state governments have struggled to keep up with steep drug price increases each year, as well as expensive new medications for diseases including hepatitis C and cancer. 
President Donald Trump has promised to lower prescription drug prices, and in May unveiled a ""blueprint"" with dozens of proposals to deliver on that pledge. 
One proposal would allow some state Medicaid departments to exclude certain drugs from reimbursement, a tactic used by private insurers to demand larger discounts and one that would represent a more significant change. But it is not yet clear how states could do so under federal law without losing existing statutory rebates, healthcare experts said.
In the meantime, Oklahoma's move can give the state more leverage over drugmakers, state officials say. 
Other states are considering whether to follow Oklahoma’s lead, according to Nesser, who has fielded inquiries from several Medicaid departments. 
Michigan's Department of Health and Human Services - which spends nearly $2.4 billion annually on drugs for Medicaid members - told Reuters it will request approval for a program similar to Oklahoma's, although details are still being worked out. 
""This type of arrangement has the potential to improve the quality, value and efficiency of drug-based treatments,"" Michigan Department of Health spokesman Bob Wheaton said in an email.
Colorado's Department of Health Care Policy and Financing said it is in the ""early planning stages"" of a request to pursue value-based Medicaid drug purchasing contracts.
SAVINGS TBD
To be sure, it remains unclear how much money these new value-based programs will save, and whether enough drugmakers will get on board since their participation is voluntary. Oklahoma is working with the University of Oklahoma to study whether the new contracts save money over time.
The state has yet to secure agreements for treatments that take up a major portion of its $650 million in Medicaid spending, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder therapies for children.
In the meantime, the biggest hurdle is just finding pharmaceutical companies that are willing to work with the state, Nesser said. ""Mostly we are talking to smaller companies."" Approaches to cancer drugmakers in particular have so far led nowhere: ""We got the door slammed in our face,"" Nesser said.
Industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said it supports Medicaid efforts to use value-based contracting for new medicines, but said states need to make sure patients still have access to current prescriptions.
Smaller companies, particularly those with newer drugs, may have more of an incentive to use such deals as a lever against large rivals. 
Alkermes' sales of Aristada totaled $93.5 million last year, dwarfed by the $3 billion in sales for Johnson & Johnson's long-acting antipsychotics including Risperdal Consta and Invega Sustenna. 
The new Medicaid agreement in Oklahoma may help Alkermes in its sales pitch to doctors, including for Aristada Initio - approved last month as the first antipsychotic injection that does not require patients to begin treatment by taking oral pills for several weeks.

Nesser said other rebates under negotiation would be structured differently than the Alkermes deal. They could link the price of a drug to its impact on other costs, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations, or give higher-rebate products preferential status over similar treatments.

1483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Alibaba's Sales Surge as Jack Ma's Free Spending Bears Fruit,"(Bloomberg) --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. reported its fastest pace of growth in more than four years by wringing more revenue from newer arenas such as cloud computing and entertainment, avoiding the disappointments that hit rival tech giants.
Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma’s free-spending ways helped the e-commerce heavyweight side-step a Chinese economic slowdown and best its rivals this earnings season. Arch-foe Tencent Holdings Ltd. posted its biggest profit drop in a decade after it ran afoul of regulatory tangles, while internet stalwarts from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). to  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). grappled with fundamental issues such as waning user growth.
Shares of Alibaba rose 3.4 percent to $183.89 at 9:39 a.m. in New York as investors cheered the result, plus more than $3 billion in new funding for its newly acquired food delivery arm as it does battle with Meituan Dianping.
“A lot of growth is coming through acquisitions,” Kim Eng Securities analyst Mitchell Kim said. “With Alibaba investing in retail and having outside investors getting in, that could establish the valuation that investors need to account for.”
Revenue at China’s biggest e-commerce company climbed 61 percent to 80.9 billion yuan ($11.8 billion) in the three months ended June, matching the average estimate. Alibaba’s mounting spending, such as on acquisitions and expanding its Hema supermarket chain, is hurting margins though. Adjusted earnings per share of 8.04 yuan fell short of the 8.19 yuan estimate.
Net income slid 41 percent to 8.7 billion yuan, though that’s after taking into account an increase in the valuation of affiliate Ant Financial, which boosted the expense of shares awarded to employees. That topped the 7.6 billion yuan projected.
“We remain confident on the company’s revenue growth given its diversified product offerings,” Mae Huang, an analyst at SWS Research Co., said in a report. “Despite the short-term costs incurred by the company, we believe Alibaba is building a stronger ecosystem.”
Alibaba’s been busy expanding its Hema supermarket chain and now operates 35 of those stores -- a mix of sit-down dining and groceries plus delivery hub. Much cash also is flowing into China’s $1.3 trillion food retail and services industry, where it’s trying to hold its own against delivery giant and super-app Meituan. Alibaba said Thursday it’s teaming with SoftBank to put more than $3 billion into Ele.me. Alibaba now intends to merge Ele.me with Koubei, another unit focused on connecting restaurants to the internet.
Ma is also spearheading an expensive foray into the $4 trillion retail sector. Alibaba acquired a department store chain with 29 stores and 17 shopping malls last year and also bought a slice of China’s largest hypermarket chain. It’s been shelling out on content for its Youku video-streaming service to stay abreast of Tencent and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). And heavy investment in datacenters for its cloud computing arm helped almost double revenue in that division to 4.7 billion yuan.
However, those burgeoning businesses may be helping mask a slowdown in Alibaba’s bread-and-butter business, said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch.
Customer management revenue -- the lucrative fees it charges for helping merchants with marketing -- grew just 26 percent in the quarter, from 35 percent in the previous three months. That reflects how rivals such as JD.com Inc. and Pinduoduo Inc. are siphoning off Alibaba’s merchants and may affect the bottom line in coming quarters, Zhu said.
“This is probably the slowest growth ever,” he said. “They are swapping high-quality revenue with low-quality revenue.”

The Chinese e-ecommerce giant said revenue soared 61% year-over-year to 80.9 billion yuan, or about $11.8 billion, edging out the 80.88 billion yuan that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.
That revenue growth was well above that of its peers in the so-called FAANG + BAT group, which also includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Baidu, and Tencent. Facebook's revenue growth was the next highest at 42%.
Revenue from core commerce was up 61% year-over-year, while its cloud-computing revenue jumped 93% year-over-year.
Alibaba reported net income attributable to shareholders of 8.7 billion yuan and diluted earnings per share of 3.3 yuan, which easily beat the 2.57 yuan that was anticipated.
Net income attributable to shareholders was affected by an 11.5 billion yuan hit as the result of an increase in the valuation of Ant Financial, causing shares given to Alibaba employees to be more expensive. Excluding that one-time impact, net income attributable to shareholders and diluted earnings per share would have jumped 35% year-over-year and 33% year-over-year respectively.
Adjusted earnings per share came in at 8.04 yuan, missing the 8.19 yuan that was expected.

The company said it now expects adjusted earnings of $8.10 to $8.20 per share for 2018, compared with its previous forecast of $8.05 to $8.15 per share.
Honeywell said the revised forecast reflected strength in its end markets, at a time when commercial jet orders have been booming, as well as an accounting change related to some asbestos liabilities.
The company said last year it would spin off its home and ADI global distribution business and transportation systems into two independent, publicly traded companies by end 2018. 
Garrett Motion Inc is the transportation systems spin-off and Resideo Technologies Inc is the homes and ADI global distribution spin-off. 
The Garrett spin-off will be completed at the end of the third quarter, and the Resideo spin will be completed by the end of the year, the company said.
On or around the effective date of each spin-off, Honeywell said it would get one-time dividends from Garrett and Resideo, totaling about $3 billion, which the company intends to use to pay down its debt and repurchase shares. 
Honeywell said the two businesses were together worth about $7.5 billion in annualized sales. 

Shares of the company were up 2 percent at $159.6 in premarket trade on Thursday.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","U.S.-China tariffs, Trump woes weigh on world stocks","By Kit Rees
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks came under pressure on Thursday as new tariffs took effect in the U.S./China trade war and markets speculated about U.S. President Donald Trump's position following legal rulings against two former advisers.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent lower by 1116 GMT, while a rise across tech and energy stocks helped Europe's STOXX 600 eke out a 0.1 percent gain.
Stocks were subdued as the U.S. and China, despite ongoing talks, implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods.
The world's two biggest economic powers have now slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on a combined $100 billion of products since early July, with more in the pipeline, adding to risks to global economic growth.
Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, cited such concerns as a reason for paring back an overweight on global equities to a very small position.
""We've got trade conflicts, and sanctions, in Turkey and Russia, so there are a few things going on that we were a little nervous about,"" Simmons said, though her firm still saw upside to equity markets, with good fundamentals.
The auto sector, particularly sensitive to tariff developments, was the worst performing in Europe, down 0.9 percent.
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index stumbled 0.5 percent while Chinese blue-chips gained 0.4 percent.
LEGAL WOES
While investors are looking ahead to see how increasing trade barriers between China and the United States might affect corporate earnings, political turmoil also weighed.
Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud.
Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the president and his Republican Party's prospects in mid-term elections.
That weighed on Wall Street overnight and the market ended mixed despite the S&P500 clocking its longest bull run in history.
E-Minis for the S&P 500 were also subdued on Thursday, trading flat.
Cohen's plea deal does not mean the president has been implicated in anything, press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing.
""While the (legal issues) shouldn't substantially alter the stock market landscape, money managers and analysts say the developments raise the likelihood of further turbulence ahead for Mr. Trump heading into the mid-term elections,"" said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut.
Political tensions were not limited to the United States.
Australian shares slipped 0.3 percent after several senior ministers tendered their resignations on Thursday and demanded a second vote on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's leadership.
The Australian dollar fell 0.8 percent for its second straight day of declines.
DOLLAR BOUNCE
The political uncertainty helped the dollar snap a five-day losing streak, with the greenback in demand after the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike for September was on the cards.
The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of major currencies, gave up some earlier gains but still added 0.1 percent to 95.238, pulling off its lowest in three weeks.
The euro was off 0.1 percent at $1.1580, not far from Wednesday's two-week high of $1.1623. The Japanese yen weakened 0.2 percent to 110.77 per dollar.
A stronger dollar put pressure on commodities. U.S. gold futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent while spot gold dipped 0.4 percent to $1,190.49 an ounce. Copper slid 0.9 percent.
Oil prices clawed back earlier losses. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded flat at $74.79 while U.S. crude rose to $67.97.

""The safety assessment of glyphosate has not changed since the time of the acquisition. If that were to change and we were to find that something was missed during the due diligence we would act accordingly. But that is not the case,"" Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann was quoted as saying by German daily Handelsblatt.
He was responding to a question on whether the legal risks from glyphosate would have to be reviewed.
However, he added that the full extent of the current glyphosate litigation was not foreseeable when Bayer assessed the value of Monsanto, according to the interview published on Thursday.
Bayer completed its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in June.
Bayer shares have lost more than 10 percent since Monsanto was ordered this month to pay $289 million in damages in the first of possibly thousands of U.S. lawsuits over claims it did not warn of the cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers such as Roundup.
Bayer has vowed to appeal the verdict, saying it was at odds with scientific evidence and regulators' conclusions.
Bayer was due to hold an analyst call on the glyphosate litigation at 1200 GMT.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 06:14AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Aramco IPO halted, oil giant disbands advisers - sources","By Clara Denina , Alex Lawler and Marwa Rashad
LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has called off plans for the domestic and international listing of state oil giant Aramco, billed as the biggest stock flotation in history, four senior industry sources said on Wednesday.
Financial advisers working on the planned listing have been disbanded as Saudi Arabia shifts its attention to a proposed acquisition of a ""strategic stake"" in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp, two of the sources said. [nL8N1UE4VF]
""The decision to call off the IPO was taken some time ago, but no-one can disclose this, so statements are gradually going that way - first delay then calling off,"" a Saudi source familiar with the IPO plans said.
""The message we have been given is that the IPO has been called off for the foreseeable future,"" said a second source, a senior financial adviser.
""Even the local float on the Tadawul Stock Exchange has been shelved,"" that person said.
Early on Thursday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister issued a denial that the IPO had been called off.
""The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the Government,” Khalid al-Falih said in a statement.
Falih said Riyadh had taken measures to prepare for the listing and the timing would depend on factors including favorable market conditions. 
The proposed listing of the national champion was a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue.
The prince announced the plan to sell about 5 percent of Aramco in 2016 via a local and an international listing, predicting the sale would value the whole company at $2 trillion or more. Several industry experts questioned whether a valuation that high was realistic, which hindered the process of preparing the IPO for the advisors.
A third industry source said the IPO had been called off for the time being but that it could be revived in future, if appropriate.
""It has been postponed until further notice,"" the source said.
Stock exchanges in financial centers including London, New York and Hong Kong have been vying to host the international tranche of the share sale.
An army of bankers and lawyers have competed to win advisory roles in the IPO, seen as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom's wide privatization program.
International banks JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and HSBC, were working as global coordinators, boutique investment banks Moelis & Co and Evercore were chosen as independent advisers and law firm White & Case as legal adviser, sources had previously told Reuters.
More banks were expected to be named but no bookrunners were formally appointed despite banks pitching for the deal.
Lawyers, bankers and auditors are all essential in the drafting the prospectus, a formal document that provides essential details on the company.
Aramco had a budget which it used to pay advisers until the end of June. This has not been renewed, one of sources said.
""The advisers have been put on standby,"" a fourth source, a senior oil industry official, said.

Sources have previously told Reuters that in addition to the valuations, disagreements among Saudi officials and their advisers over which international listing venue to be chosen had slowed the IPO preparations.

1520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Puts IPO on Hold to Focus on Giant Chemicals Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia has formally put the initial public offering of its giant oil company on hold while Aramco focuses on buying a strategic stake in local petrochemical group Sabic for as much as $70 billion.
While the Sabic deal will delay the IPO, it doesn’t mean it’s canceled, people familiar with matter said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said on Thursday in a statement that the government was committed to the Aramco IPO “at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum.”
The statement came after Reuters reported on Wednesday that Riyadh had called off the domestic and international listings, citing people it didn’t identify.
Even if the IPO is eventually revived, the Aramco-Sabic deal will allow the kingdom to achieve some of the original aims Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman set for the jumbo share sale. The main difference would be the origin of the cash: rather than equity investors, it would come from bank loans and bond investors.
Aramco will raise funds from banks and international bondholders to buy a controlling stake in the petrochemical group. That money will go into the coffers of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, which currently owns a 70 percent stake in Sabic. That will replace at least some of the money the Public Investment Fund had been expected to receive from the Aramco IPO.
Doing a large international bond issue would also compel Aramco to reveal much of the same financial and business information as an IPO prospectus, bringing greater transparency to the world’s largest oil producer.
The board of directors of Aramco took the decision to put the preparations for the IPO on hold at a meeting earlier this month in Switzerland, two of the people said. In his statement, Al-Falih said the timing of the listing would ""depend on multiple factors, including favorable market conditions, and a downstream acquisition which the company will pursue in the next few months, as directed by its board of directors.""
Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July that the Aramco IPO was going nowhere, saying that even Aramco officials doubted the project would ever see the light of day.
The Aramco IPO has been a centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed’s reform program to diversify the country’s economy away from oil, known as Vision 2030. Saudi officials said they hope to raise a record $100 billion by selling a 5 percent stake, dwarfing the current record of $25 billion raised by Chinese retailer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in 2014.
The process started in January 2016, when the crown prince said Riyadh was considering selling shares in Aramco, kicking off a deal set to be the world’s largest-ever flotation. For almost two years, Saudi officials repeatedly said the IPO was ""on track, on time"" for the second half of 2018. Earlier this year, they shifted tack, saying it would be delayed into 2019. In June, Al-Falih diluted further the timeline, only saying it would be ""nice"" to get it done next year.
After the Aramco-Sabic deal was first revealed, Amin Nasser, the chief executive officer of the state-owned oil company, signaled the plan to buy a stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp., as the chemical group is known, would delay the IPO.
“A potential Sabic deal would affect the time frame for Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering,” Nasser told Arabiya television in an interview in late July.
The plans for a bond, likely to be combined with banks loans, are very preliminary but it would solve a key problem: Aramco’s valuation. MBS, as the 32-year-old crown prince is known, said the company would be worth at least $2 trillion -- more than double the current market valuation of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). -- and perhaps as much as $2.5 trillion. Yet most analysts and investors have said that $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion was more realistic. A bond won’t put a value on the company.
Aramco has hired several Wall Street banks, including HSBC Bank Plc,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., which have been working for months to prepare the IPO. The Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as Aramco is formally known, wrote to some but not all of its advisers on the IPO and asked them to suspend work for now, one of the people said.
Al-Falih acknowledged in his statement that Aramco and its advisers have already done all the work needed to sell shares, saying: ""The company, for its part, has completed its internal program for IPO preparedness.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged up on Thursday after the latest round of U.S.-China tariffs kicked in, hurting trade-sensitive autos stocks but boosting demand for sectors seen as more insulated from an escalating trade dispute.
The STOXX 600 (STOXX) climbed 0.3 percent, buoyed by tech, healthcare, and consumer staples stocks - ""defensives"" which investors reach for as safer bets in times of uncertainty for their strong earnings growth and high dividend payouts.
The United States and China implemented 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other's goods on Thursday, bringing to $50 billion the value of imports subjected to tariffs on either side since early July, with more in the pipeline.
Autos (SXAP) stocks were the worst-performing for a second day. On Wednesday a surprise profit warning from tire maker Continental sank the stock and hit the sector, already one of the worst impacted by tariff fears.
Continental (DE:CONG) fell a further 1.5 percent, bottom of the DAX, taking its losses to 15 percent since Wednesday's open.
Carmakers  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) fell 0.8 to 1.1 percent, while  Valeo  (PA:VLOF),  Renault  (PA:RENA),  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) were the biggest CAC 40 fallers.
Overall shares continued to move in a range, in a trend that is unsettling some investors concerned about complacency in the market. 
""We have not witnessed (or not yet) a sudden evaporation of risk appetite, as happened, for example, after the summer of 2015, the last time that the health of the world economy was truly in debate,"" said ODDO BHF economists. 
""Corrections and turbulence in recent months and weeks have been fairly localized in both space and time.""
Strong earnings growth is part of what is preserving the market. With the second-quarter results season tailing off, MSCI Europe firms have reported 10.9 percent year-on-year earnings growth.
Outside trade war moves, shares in budget airline Ryanair (I:RYA) jumped 6.3 percent to the top of the STOXX after the Irish pilots' union Forsa said it had reached an agreement in a labor dispute.
Shares in Swiss asset manager GAM (S:GAMH) fell 3.7 percent, the biggest decline on the STOXX 600. The stock is down 22 percent since July 31, when it suspended a director, halting dealing in some bond funds soon afterwards.
Austria's Raiffeisen Bank (VI:RBIV), which operates across eastern Europe and has been in the firing line as new U.S. sanctions on Russia develop, fell 2.5 percent. 
Shares in Danish medical equipment, supplies and distribution company Ambu (CO:AMBUb) recovered swiftly from a 10 percent drop at the open after its third-quarter results missed analysts' targets. 
Swiss telecoms group Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG) rose 6.5 percent after it increased its guidance for full-year 2018 EBITDA.
Building materials firm CRH (I:CRH) pared early gains to trade up just 1.1 percent after reporting first-half margins held steady and striking a positive tone for earnings in the second half of the year. 
Some analysts pointed to weaker cash flow. 

""The slight EBITDA beat versus consensus is offset by weak operating cash generation,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts.

BEIJING (Reuters) - At a trade show in southern Beijing, children and parents crowd around a group of pink and blue dancing robots that resemble toddler-sized Power Rangers.
The robots – wired with wide LED smiles and cutesy personalities – are the brainchild of Chinese-American company AvatarMind, built to be futuristic retail workers, teacher's assistants and household helpers. 
But even as the company polishes off production of 2,000 units, AvatarMind and companies like it are rethinking plans for international expansion in the face of widening tariffs. 
""We want to sell them for the price that is affordable for families, not just institutions. And Trump's tariffs may affect that,"" AvatarMind chief executive Dr John Ostrem said at the World Robot Conference, which ends Sunday.
The main competitor to AvatarMind's iPal humanoid robot is a similar but much pricier bot called Pepper, which is made by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).
Annualized growth rates for robot production in China dropped from 35.1 percent in May to just 6.3 percent in July, according to the country's bureau of statistics
China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) says the slowdown is not related to trade. 
But analysts say there is an obvious link to direct tariffs on industrial machinery and robot parts, as well as domestic manufacturers' putting off production during trade talks. 
""How could it not be related?"" said Iris Pang, economist for Greater China at ING Wholesale Banking in Hong Kong. ""The trade war may have already deferred some decisions of export-related manufacturers.""
U.S. tariffs on $16 billion worth of Chinese goods came into effect at midnight on Wednesday, alongside retaliatory Chinese tariffs on an equal amount of U.S. goods.
Although robots aren't directly named, the U.S. list includes electronics, auto parts and other items that require automated manufacturing and robots. An earlier round of $34 billion tariffs on Chinese goods lists industrial robots. 
The situation could worsen for Chinese robotics manufacturers, analysts say, if the U.S. imposes a further $200 billion in tariffs on a range of consumer goods that create manufacturing demand for robots in China. 
China has included robotics as one of 10 industries to get state support under the country's Made in China 2025 industrial plan, which aims to make it a world leader in key technologies within the next decade.
Some Chinese companies hope the country's cornerstone One Belt One Road foreign policy initiative will provide a boost even if trade with the United States evaporates.
Others said the low cost of Chinese manufacturing would - for now - compensate for tariffs in the U.S., where competing products like Pepper are still more expensive. 
Li Shuai, a manager at Chinese medical robot firm Remebot, said her company is seeking FDA approval for its robots.
""There is a similar product abroad in France,"" Li said. ""Its domestic price is probably in the tens of millions, and the price of our equipment is controlled at about five or six million. Therefore, there is still a great advantage for us.""

The Federal Reserve said the central bank is ready to raise rates again as long as the U.S. economy remains healthy. “Many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation,” minutes of the July 31-Aug. 1 Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Wednesday in Washington said.
The minutes also noted “further gradual increases” in their target rate “would be consistent with a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.”

Reports citing people familiar with the matter said the talks are predicted only to result in a joint statement of productive discussions.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 05:18PM ET</span>","Investors in Tesla bonds, options show skepticism on buyout","By Kate Duguid and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors in the debt and in the equity options of electric carmaker Tesla (O:TSLA) are betting the take-private deal described by Chief Executive Elon Musk will not materialize.
Like its stock price, Tesla bonds have given up all of the gains they made after Musk shocked investors with a tweet on Aug. 7, saying he had ""funding secured"" for a possible buyout deal at $420 per share.
This suggests the credit market has scaled back the chances of a deal, and data showed activity on the equities options market also indicates those investors also are skeptical.
Tesla's high-yield debt trades at around 87.5 cents on the dollar, down from 93.0 cents on Aug. 7, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tesla's convertible bonds due in 2021 <88160RAC5=RRPS> are trading around 107.20 cents on the dollar, down from 120.46 cents on the dollar on Aug. 7.
Convertible bonds give bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity after shares rise over a certain price.
Bondholders are paid back in full in the event of a buyout - at 101 cents on the dollar for the junk bond coming due in 2025 <88160RAE1=RRPS> if certain conditions are met. The company's longer-dated convertible debt would earn an additional premium above par if Tesla were taken private.
""The smart trade at the moment is to short the converts and go long the high-yield bonds, because that spread will collapse"" in the event Tesla files for bankruptcy, said Lawrence McDonald, founder of the Bear Traps Report.
McDonald believes bankruptcy is the path for Tesla if it does not find a buyer because of its high leverage compared to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment. Musk said in his second-quarter shareholder letter that the company can be sustainably profitable from the third quarter onward.
Tesla investors have raised their bets against the convertible bonds. Short positions in the three converts have risen, from $38.14 million on August 6 to $49.47 million on Aug. 16, according to IHS Markit.
Tesla's convertible bonds due in 2021 are trading around 107.20 cents on the dollar - roughly 20.8 cents shy of where they should trade if a deal at $420 was fully priced, said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management.
""If these bonds were priced for a takeover, they would trade at a serious premium to the conversion value compared to when the deal was announced,"" said Dancey. ""The convertibles are certainly not trading as if this company is going to be taken private at $420 and they never did.""
Longer-dated convertible bonds benefit from take-private deals, which give bondholders additional shares. In a $420 per share deal, the 2021 convertible bond would receive an additional 11 percent above face value, or 11 percent more stock.
On the day of Musk's buyout tweet, the share price hit an 11-month high of $387.46, more than $27 above the 2021 conversion rate. The highest the 2021 note traded that day was 120.46 cents on the dollar.
Now, the debt is trading below the price prior to the deal tweet, as well as below its price before its solid second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 1.
OPTIONS TRADERS UNIMPRESSED
Traders in the U.S. equity options market also appeared to doubt whether Musk can make good on his proposal, options data showed.
Data from Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS showed that while traders had initially displayed some confidence Musk might be able to pull off a deal, conviction has dropped.
""Initially options traders reacted with a little bit of belief, now there is disbelief,"" said Matt Amberson, founder at ORATS.
Stripped of the impact of earnings on one-year implied volatility of Tesla options, this gauge of how much traders expect the shares to move in the future is roughly back to where it was before the Musk tweet, ORATS data showed.
Had there been significant expectation for the Tesla to be taken private in the near future the volatility embedded in these contracts would have dropped, Amberson said.

Tesla shares closed about flat at $321.64 on Wednesday.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Credit Suisse freezes $5 billion of Russian money due to U.S. sanctions,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and John O'Donnell
ZURICH (Reuters) - One of Switzerland's largest banks,  Credit Suisse , has frozen roughly 5 billion Swiss francs ($5 billion) of money linked to Russia to avoid falling foul of U.S. sanctions, according to its accounts, further increasing pressure on Moscow. 
The move by Credit Suisse, which owned aircraft surrendered by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska and had lent money to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg before the sanctions, underscores a widespread fear among banks of reprisals from Washington for working with targeted Russian individuals and entities.
For Russia's elite, such steps could close off an important avenue for finance as well as a safe haven for billions of rubles of their wealth.
""Credit Suisse works with international regulators wherever it does business to ensure compliance with sanctions, including compliance with sanctions involving Russia,"" said a spokeswoman for the bank, which did not identify the owners of the money.
Long popular with wealthy Russians for its combination of bank secrecy, political stability and glitzy ski resorts such as Zermatt and St. Moritz, Switzerland has become one of the most important destinations for money leaving Russia.
Roughly $6.2 billion, or 14 percent of total Russian cross-border outflows, went to Switzerland in 2017 — almost three times as much as went to the United States, according to Russian central bank data.
The latest round of sanctions was announced in April by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to penalize Russia for its annexation of Crimea, involvement in the war in Syria and ""attempting to subvert Western democracies"".
More could follow.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would like better ties with Moscow, but although he met Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, relations between the countries remain strained.
Earlier this month, members of Congress, where both chambers are controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans, called for more action, including introducing new sanctions legislation ""from hell"", to punish the Russian ""menace"".
While U.S. sanctions do not apply to neutral Switzerland, its banks are obliged to follow suit because they depend on access to the dollar and could be blackballed by the United States for any missteps.
The Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) asset freeze took place in the second quarter. It is rare for a Swiss bank to reveal such details.
Two of its rivals, UBS (S:UBSG) and  Julius Baer  (S:BAER), said they also respected international sanctions, but declined to say whether they had taken similar steps.
""UBS ... implements worldwide at least the sanctions currently imposed by Switzerland, the U.N., the EU and the U.S.,"" said a spokesman for UBS.
A spokesman for Julius Baer said it ""cooperates with international regulators ... in the field of sanction regulations"".
Credit Suisse is being cautious in part because of earlier bad experiences. In 2009, it reached a $500 million settlement with U.S. authorities over dealings with sanctions-hit Iran.
There have been other instances where European banks have been punished. In 2014, France's  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) agreed to pay a record $8.9 billion for violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.

Switzerland's banking watchdog FINMA does not require Swiss banks to enforce foreign sanctions, but has said they have a responsibility to minimize legal and reputational risks.

""Members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
Fed policymakers raised their outlook on U.S. economy growth, citing stronger household spending.
""Relative to the forecast prepared for the June meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending,"" the minutes said.
2. New Home Sales Expected to Rise
The economic calendar is very busy tomorrow, with more housing data leading the way.
The Commerce Department will release numbers on new home sales for July at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). Economists expect that sales of new homes rose 2.2% last month.
The housing market has been the one cause of concern in the otherwise strong economy. Existing home sales fell unexpectedly in July.
Initial jobless claims figures arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) and the Markit composite and services PMIs are due at 9:45 AM ET (13:45 GMT).
3. Alibaba Numbers Will Give View Into China
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) highlights the earnings before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analysts expect that the Chinese e-commerce company earned $1.19 per share in the latest quarter on sales of $11.8 billion.
Apart from the headline numbers, investors will be looking at the impact of the recent weakness in the Chinese economy and any effect tariffs imposed by the U.S. are having. There will also be focus on how Alibaba’s venture into brick-and-mortar stores is going.
Shares of Alibaba hit their 52-week high at the start of the year, but have been trending downward in the last three months.
Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) will also issue numbers ahead of trading, while Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) weigh in after the bell."
1538,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",S&P 500 bull market now arguably the oldest ever,"(Reuters) - The S&P 500's (SPX) bull market turned 3,453 days old on Wednesday, making it the longest such streak in history, according to some investors' definition. 
The market took the milestone in stride, with the benchmark stock index edging 0.04 percent lower a day after it set an all-time intraday high that slightly exceeded the previous one set in late January.
""Length is not necessarily the thing I'm interested in. More so it could be the new high for the year,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey.
Wall Street is widely considered to be in a bull market that started on March 9, 2009, when investors grappled with the global financial crisis that had vaporized over half of the U.S. stock market's value. Since then, the index has more than quadrupled. 
Now after nine years and five months, investors are debating when, not if, the current run-up in stock prices will end.
Bull and bear markets are identified only retroactively, and it is too soon to say for certain whether a correction in the S&P 500 in February marked the end of the bull market and the start of a bear market.
To be sure that the S&P 500 is still in a bull market, it would have to close above its record high set on Jan 26, which it failed to do on Tuesday. 
""That potential new high is important,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt wrote in a research note. ""(If) we drop 20 percent before we reach a new high, we will go back and declare that the current bull market ended on January 26, 2018, the last high."" 
Wednesday's record is also debatable because Wall Street experts define bull and bear markets differently.
Some experts say a bull market occurred from 1990 to 2000, which would make the current one the longest ever. Others say that bull market started in 1987 and ran to 2000, which would be three years longer than the current bull market. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is responsible for 4.1 percent of the S&P 500's return since March 9, 2009, more than any other company.  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) is second, with a 2.4 percent contribution, according to Silverblatt.

1539,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 04:37PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P 500 Snaps Win Streak as Political Turmoil Grips Wall Street,"Investing.com - The S&P 500 closed marginally lower Wednesday, as gains in energy were offset by political uncertainty in Washington.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.34%. The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose about 0.38%.
U.S. stocks battled political turmoil in Washington after two former members of President Donald Trump's inner circle faced legal repercussions, raising the risk of a bumpy road for the president ahead of midterm elections.
Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight counts and the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen made a plea deal and said he violated the law at the behest of Trump.
Those worries were weighed against an ongoing run of upbeat earnings, which helped shift the narrative toward the underlying strength of U.S. corporates.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock closed 3% higher after the retailer reported better-than-expected earnings as comp sales grew the most in 13 years. While Lowe’s NYSE:LOW) stock closed 5.8% higher, buoyed by an above-forecast earnings report and turnaround plans.
The broader market was also nudged higher by rip-roaring energy stocks as oil prices hit two-week highs after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected.
The large draw in crude supplies was supported by a 1.059 million barrels plunge in imports, offsetting a 2.58 million decline in exports, data from EIA showed.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 3.1% to settle at $67.89 a barrel.
A fourth-straight monthly plunge in existing home sales, meanwhile, did little to help confidence in the broader market.
The Commerce Department showed existing home sales fell 0.7% in July from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 534 million units. Economists were expecting a 0.6% increase to 5.44 million homes.
Investor attention was swayed, albeit briefly, in the latter part of the session as investors parsed the minutes of the Federal Reserve last meeting.
The minutes showed policymakers welcomed further increases amid expectations for the economy to continue to expand at above-trend pace. The Fed's plan to continue raising rates comes just days after Trump blasted Fed chairman Jerome Powell for raising interest rates, urging the central bank to do more to foster economic growth.
On the trade front, meanwhile, mid-level talks between China and U.S. fuelled new hopes that a full-blown trade war between the world's two largest economic may be averted. Yet, trade-sensitive names like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) struggled to pare losses, closing lower for the day.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) ,  Noble Energy  (NYSE:NBL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Wall St. end mixed as S&P marks longest bull run,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mixed on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq gaining on the strength of tech stocks while the S&P 500 was little changed as it marked its longest bull-market run.
The legal woes of two former advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump contributed to investors' caution, while the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from its last policy meeting had only a fleeting impact on Wall Street's major indexes.
U.S. central bankers discussed raising interest rates soon to counter excessive economic strength but also examined how global trade disputes could batter businesses and households.
Energy stocks (SPNY) rose 1.2 percent as oil prices jumped, while retailers gained after  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Lowe's Companies Inc (N:LOW) announced quarterly results. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 came from technology stocks (SPLRCT), which advanced 0.5 percent.
Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty of tax and bank fraud charges on Tuesday evening, while Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to a range of charges and said he acted at the direction of Trump.
Investors are considering whether the twin setback will hurt the Republican Party's election prospects and widen a criminal probe that has overshadowed Trump's presidency.
""There was quite a lot of news that was negative for Trump yesterday that introduced uncertainty into the market,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 88.69 points, or 0.34 percent, to 25,733.6, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.14 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,861.82 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 29.92 points, or 0.38 percent, to 7,889.10.
""We're at a point of technical resistance,"" Phipps said. ""We need a catalyst to break through it, but there's not currently one on the docket.""
On Tuesday, the S&P 500 reached an all-time intraday high but ended the session below that level.
The S&P's bull-market run has now stretched for 3,453 days, the longest streak by commonly used definitions, and comes a day after it hit a record intraday high.
Target shares touched an all-time high after the retailer beat quarterly estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast. Target shares ended the session up 3.2 percent.
Lowe's shares also hit a record high after the home improvement chain promised to cut back slow-moving products and unsuccessful business projects. They closed up 5.8 percent.
Shares of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (N:HIG) dropped 4.2 percent after the insurer said it will buy Navigators Group Inc (O:NAVG) in a $2.1 billion cash deal. Navigators' shares jumped 8.8 percent to $69.90, just below Hartford's offer of $70 a share.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 109 new highs and 22 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.26 billion shares, compared to the 6.42 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 04:09PM ET</span>",Wall Street's sector shakeup will let more tech stocks shine,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chipmakers, cloud-computing sellers and even credit card payment companies will have a greater chance to stand out in the information technology sector next month following the largest-ever shakeup of Wall Street's industry classification system.
In a reorganization spanning three sectors, none of the so-called FANG high-growth stocks - Facebook (O:FB), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) - will be classified as technology companies, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market higher in recent years.
On Sept. 24, S&P will shift Alphabet, Facebook, Twitter (N:TWTR), Paypal (O:PYPL) and videogame makers Electronic Arts (O:EA) and Activision Blizzard (O:ATVI) from the S&P 500 technology index to an expanded telecom group, renamed ""Communications Services."" 
Netflix, which like Amazon, is currently part of the consumer discretionary group, will also move to the expanded telecom group. Amazon will stay put in consumer discretionary.
The changes are part the largest-ever reorganization of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, an industry taxonomy widely used by investors. MSCI will adjust its indexes in November. 
Meant to reflect the economy's evolution, the overhaul of GICS will affect how mutual fund managers choose between stocks, and force passively managed sector funds to reallocate billions of dollars. Removing Alphabet and Facebook from technology indexes may lead investors to pay more attention to smaller, remaining technology companies.
""People will be able to get a clear look at the tech sector without being overwhelmed by these behemoths that really are media companies,"" said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. 
Exchange-traded funds that passively track indexes have about $89 billion invested in the technology sector, much of which will have to be reinvested to stay in line with the sector changes, potentially creating volatility, according to data from Thomson Reuters Lipper.
While many individual investors will still view Alphabet and Facebook as tech stocks, mutual funds have internal rules limiting how much they can invest across different sectors.
With Facebook and Alphabet shifted into the communications sector, fund managers will no longer have to choose between them and Apple or Microsoft (O:MSFT), or bets on chipmakers and cloud-computing, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Patrick Palfrey. 
""And at the same time, an investor can go to the communications sector and overweight an internet services company against a traditional telecom company,"" Palfrey said. ""This is important for investors who have mandates to stay within certain parameters of a sector."" 
Technology stocks have been top performers driving Wall Street's gains in recent years, including Apple (O:AAPL), which currently makes up 16 percent of the S&P 500 IT index (SPLRCT). 
Apple will increase its weight in that index to 20 percent following the removal of No. 2 component Alphabet and Facebook, its fourth largest member.
The changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies. Microsoft, Visa (N:V), Intel (O:INTC) and Cisco Systems (O:CSCO) will round out the S&P 500 IT index's largest five components, followed by Mastercard (N:MA), Oracle (N:ORCL) and Nvidia (O:NVDA). 
(Graphic: Future S&P 500 IT Index: https://reut.rs/2MrVmfi)
(Graphic: Current S&P 500 IT Index: https://reut.rs/2MtpV47)
Even without some of its highest-profile members, the technology sector will boast companies with track records for earnings growth and stock performance. 
Share prices of Visa and Mastercard, not typically viewed as tech companies, in 2018 have surged 23 percent and 34 percent, respectively.
The S&P 500 tech sector under its future configuration would have gained 18 percent so far in 2018, outperforming the 16 percent rise under its current configuration, according to Palfrey. 
In its future configuration, the S&P 500 tech sector is currently trading at about 18 times expected earnings, compared to 19 times earnings with its current constituents.
(Graphic: S&P 500 tech: New vs. Old: https://reut.rs/2MqQMOy)

Following the GICS restructure, tech will account for 21 percent of the S&P 500, compared to 26 percent currently, according to Thomson Reuters data.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","Missouri judge affirms $4.69 billion talc verdict, J&J vows to appeal","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A Missouri trial court judge has affirmed the massive $4.69 billion verdict against Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) in a case involving 22 women and their families who alleged the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer.
J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it would continue to pursue all available appellate remedies. The company, which denies the allegations and says its talc is safe, previously said it was confident the verdict would be overturned on appeal.
In a series of orders on Tuesday evening, Judge Rex Burlison of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis affirmed the jury's July 12 decision in favor of the women, six of whom have died.
""The Court finds there is no just reason for delay and hereby certifies this judgment as final for purposes of appeal,"" Burlison wrote in the judgments.
Defendants in civil cases can generally file so-called post-trial motions, asking the trial court judge to reduce a verdict or set it aside entirely, but J&J did not file such motions. It can now take up the cases with a Missouri appeals court.
The jury found the company's talc-based products had caused the women's cancer, awarding $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages to all plaintiffs.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the women, in a statement on Wednesday said he was confident the judgment would be upheld on appeal.
""We hope this judgment will compel Johnson & Johnson to take responsible, effective action in acknowledging the inherent dangers of the use of talc, and specifically the use of Johnson's Baby Powder and similar products,"" Lanier said.
The verdict was the largest to date arising from lawsuits alleging products like J&J's Baby Powder cause cancer. The company faces some 10,600 cases nationwide over talc, according to an August regulatory filing.
J&J has called the five-week St. Louis trial ""fundamentally unfair"" and its Chief Executive Alex Gorsky has expressed confidence the jury decision will be overturned on appeal.

J&J has been successful at having other talc verdicts in Missouri thrown out on appeal. A lawyer for the company told Reuters J&J would focus on jurisdictional arguments and put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company's talc-based products never contained asbestos.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>","Massachusetts securities regulator faces primary challenge, focus on election handling","By Tim McLaughlin and Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, one of the most aggressive U.S. securities law enforcers, next month will face his first primary challenge in over a decade from a rival who claims Galvin has neglected his role as the state's top election overseer.
Boston City Councilor Josh Zakim, Galvin's 34-year-old challenger in the Sept. 4 primary, won the backing of Democratic state convention delegates in June and the endorsement of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who supports his voter rights focus. 
Zakim argues that Galvin during his 24 years in office has been slow to back election reforms, including same-day voter registration. Seventeen other states allow that practice.
""People want to make sure their voices are heard,"" Zakim said in an interview outside Boston City Hall on Wednesday. ""They're entitled to have their voices heard.""
Galvin, 67, in March defended in court a state requirement that people register to vote 20 days before an election, and the rule was deemed constitutional in a July decision.
Galvin, who last faced a competitive primary in 2006, says he personally supports same-day registration but was defending a rule put in place by state legislators.
Galvin said he was not surprised that his elections role is attracting more attention given Democrats' increased national focus on voting after Republican President Donald Trump's 2016 election.
While securities regulation has largely not come up during the campaign, Galvin called it the ""principal job of the office.""
His cases over the years have targeted Putnam Investments, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Scottrade Inc. In June, he charged MetLife Inc (NYSE:MET) with making false statements to investors related to failing to pay pension benefits to retirees.
""I'm not frustrated. I continue to talk about other aspects of the office, but I'm also quite happy to talk about elections as we have a great record,"" Galvin said in a Friday phone interview.
At the end of July, Galvin's campaign reported $2.8 million in cash on hand, compared to $585,230 for the Zakim campaign, disclosures with the state show. 
Zakim said despite his elections focus, protecting investors would be a priority if he unseated Galvin. He expressed interest in cryptocurrencies and said he wanted to provide clear guidance on how they would be regulated.
But Zakim said he believed his voting rights message has resonated among Democrats.

""People want to see folks who share their values as secretaries of state defending the democracy,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) is extending its Sapphire credit card brand into checking accounts at the largest U.S. bank to attract increasingly wealthy millennials as lifetime customers, it said on Wednesday.
The bank is changing its Chase Premier Platinum accounts, which require a minimum of $75,000 in deposits and certain investments, into Sapphire Banking accounts, spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said by phone.
The new accounts will offer special access to sports and entertainment events as do its Sapphire Reserve credit cards.
The Reserve card became a big hit with millennials eager to travel when it was introduced in 2016 with generous sign-up and spending bonuses, and access to travel lounges.
The new bank accounts will also eliminate some of the fees that can annoy consumers, including those for wire transfers and foreign exchange at overseas ATMs.
Later this year the bank will offer its Ultimate Rewards points, which it pays for credit card spending, as a sign-up incentive to new customers to Sapphire Banking accounts, Seymour said.
The new account is another example of JPMorgan cutting prices and offering additional services to attract customers and take market share from competitors.
On Tuesday the bank rattled the discount brokerage industry by offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app.
The launch of the Sapphire Reserve card disrupted the high-end credit card business and resulted in higher-than-expected start-up expenses for JPMorgan.
JPMorgan has also taken market share in securities lending with aggressive pricing. It has won commercial banking business by opening new offices in cities outside its established markets.
JPMorgan has previously used tie-ins with Sapphire Reserve to promote its mortgage loans.

The bank aims to grow its consumer deposits more quickly than the industry. Low-cost deposits become more valuable to banks as interest rates rise on loans.

Comcast also said the offer period was being extended and would remain open for acceptances until Sept. 12.
Comcast gatecrashed Fox's attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own earlier this year and the U.S. cable giant's latest, higher offer, which it submitted in July, has been recommended to shareholders by the broadcaster's independent directors.

Under British takeover rules, Rupert Murdoch's Fox has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast's offer for Sky.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors crept into stocks as emerging market sentiment deteriorated, betting on a resolution of discord over Turkey and emerging markets, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data for the latest week showed on Wednesday.
Stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based in the United States netted $779 million in the week ended Aug. 15, ICI said, as the Turkish lira plunged to an all-time low and investors fretted about possible contagion in emerging markets.
It was the first week of positive sales for the funds in three weeks. Funds focused on international shares took in $767 million during the period, while domestic equity funds collected just $12 million, the trade group's data showed.
During the week, markets punished Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's refusal to adopt an orthodox response to strong inflation - raising interest rates - by selling lira.
While the Turkish market is marginal within global financial markets, stress there could spread as investors whose bets soured in that market sell assets from South Africa to Argentina. Those countries could struggle to repay debt denominated in dollars as their own currencies weaken. The biggest emerging market, China, is already under pressure from a trade dispute with the United States.
Yet hunkering down in domestic stocks may not solve all of an investor's problems.
Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at St. Denis J. Villere & Co LLC, said the U.S. economy is strong and he is impressed with the financial results of almost exclusively domestic companies his mutual funds hold.
But he is holding a higher level of cash than normal and said there are not many bargains to be found.
""We'd like to put some to work, but we don't need to,"" said Villere, who is based in New Orleans. ""There's a lot of cheap stocks that should be cheap and a lot of stocks that are too expensive.""
During the week, U.S.-based bond funds attracted $1.7 billion, marking a 26th straight week of strong demand.
Funds invested in commodities bled $674 million. The dollar's 6 percent gain over the past half-year against its major trading partners have hurt demand for gold, which is priced in the greenback.
The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in millions of dollars):
  8/15 8/8 8/1 7/25 7/18/2018

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","When it comes to financial aid, a college job can backfire","By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO - Elissa Schimmel does not want to finish college buried in debt, and she worries her parents already are spending too much to help her older brother pay for college.
As Schimmel begins Harper College in Palatine, Illinois, this week, she has scheduled classes for mornings so afternoons are free for a second job. She already has a weekend gig at a pharmacy.
“My parents worked so hard to give us a good life,” said Schimmel, 17 of Barrington, Illinois. She said she wants to spare them additional financial stress.
Many students share the burden of paying for college. About 78 percent of college students work at least part of the year, and 45 percent – including Schimmel – work year-round, not just during summer breaks, according to a new survey by student lender Sallie Mae. 
About 58 percent of freshmen add hours of work as they juggle tuition, housing and other bills – sometimes topping $25,000 a year at public universities and $70,000 at private colleges.
Yet, despite the good intentions, working more hours as a student may backfire if a family cannot afford college and has qualified for financial aid.
Aid formulas targeting families with financial needs typically reduce scholarships and grants for upcoming school years if a student’s income rises roughly above $7,000 a year, said Kalman Chany, a financial aid consultant and author of “Paying for College Without Going Broke.”
Consider, for example, a college freshman who has already earned about $7,000 this year and tries to cram in an additional $3,000 before the end of 2018. That student’s aid could be slashed by as much as $1,300 in the next school year, Chany said. 
“Parents think they are planning well if they get their child to work more, but they don’t know what they are doing,” Chany said. 
That is because few people understand the quirky financial aid formulas embedded in the Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the College Scholarship Service (PROFILE) applications families submit when they seek help paying for college.
Chany and other experts provide this advice to families who need aid:
WATCH LIMITS
Students can earn some income without having it cut into aid. Just be wary once it approaches $7,000 a year. 
Limits are not precise. They vary based on other sources of income, state taxes, whether a student is attending a public or private college and the type of aid. 
Although financial aid typically kicks in when students begin college, that first year is not when working income matters. The application for first-year financial aid looks at income students earned in jobs two calendar years earlier. Families need to start paying attention to what students earn from jobs as early as the second half of 10th grade, starting Jan. 1. 
For each year of college, families reapply for financial aid. After students pass Jan. 1 of their college sophomore year, they no longer have to worry about income from jobs. They can work as much as they want for the rest of college.
Certain programs also have special limits. For example, New York residents may attend state public colleges (CUNY and SUNY) tuition-free if parent and students’ incomes do not total over $125,000 for the coming school year. A student’s job could put them over the limit.
TAKE THE WORK STUDY JOB
If a student is offered a work-study job as part of a financial aid package, that is usually the job to take rather than an outside job. The reason: Work study job income does not impact aid, while other jobs will. 
Keep in mind that working while in school has other ramifications. When students work more than 15 hours a week, grades can suffer and exhaustion leads many to drop out, according to research by Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. 
When working students do graduate, low grades may keep them out of jobs or graduate school. Carnevale has found that students who spend too much time working while attending classes also skip internships that provide a leg-up for quality jobs upon graduation.
BORROW NOW, WORK LATER

If students cannot afford college without working a lot during their freshmen or sophomore years, they may be wise to resist extra jobs and take out more loans for the first two years of school. Then, once they are late in their sophomore year, or any time as a junior or senior, they can work as much as they want while avoiding extra loans.

1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Goldman Says Keep Calm as Curve Narrows to Another 11-Year Low,"(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs economists are reiterating their plea to keep calm and carry on after a widely followed recession signal flashed brighter.
The gap between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields shrank to as little as 21.8 basis points Wednesday, reaching the narrowest since August 2007 -- a year that also marked the last time an inversion of the curve happened. The contraction has prompted traders and Federal Reserve officials to warn of the ominous risks to America’s growth outlook.
While the spread moving below zero has many times preceded recessions, the  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists say its not a great predictive tool now for reasons including the fact that central bank debt purchases have crushed term premium -- the usual compensation investors demand to hold longer-term bonds.
“The historical correlation between yield curve inversion and recession is impressive,” wrote Goldman’s David Mericle and Daan Struyven, in a note. “But it can be misleading,” they said, adding that they see the risk of a U.S. recession as only “moderate for now.”
The dramatic fall in term premium has changed the typical signal the curve raises about how restrictive monetary policy is, they say. Given this, an inversion which typically had indicated that the Fed policy rate was hundreds of basis points past neutral (a level that is neither restrictive or stimulative), today an inversion could occur as soon as the fund rate hits neural or even before, they say.
“The upshot is that the premise of using inversion as a signal -- that there is a consistent mapping from the slope of the yield curve to the probability of recession -- is not plausible,” Mericle and Struyven wrote.
Goldman forecasts the unemployment rate will fall to 3 percent by early 2020 and say inflation and trend unit labor costs will remain a touch below 2 percent with inflation expectations holding on the softer side.
“We are skeptical that the slope of the yield curve adds much to this basic economic perspective,” Mericle and Struyven said.
Even so, just on Monday Raphael Bostic, head of the Atlanta Fed, said that prospects for a curve inversion would prompt him to oppose further interest-rate hikes. And we may get an opportunity to hear more on this Friday from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, when he discusses monetary policy at the Kansas City Fed’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming."

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 10:58AM ET</span>","Target posts best comparable sales growth in 13 years, shares hit record","By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) reported its best comparable-sales growth in 13 years and said a strong economy lifted customer visits to the most in a decade, sending its stock to a record high on Wednesday.
The Minneapolis-based retailer also raised its annual profit forecast and said its quarterly performance was driven by demand for home products, toys and electronics as well as a rebound in seasonal merchandise sales after cold weather in the first quarter hurt demand. 
An extra week of back-to-school spending in the second quarter versus a year earlier along with a one-day sale in July to compete with Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime Day, also boosted performance.
Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said the jump in customer traffic during the second quarter was unprecedented. Store traffic grew 6.4 percent from a 2.1 percent gain during the same period a year earlier.
""There's no doubt that like others, we're currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment, perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career,"" he said. The retailer recorded market share gains across most categories, he added. 
Rising wages, lower unemployment and tax cuts have helped to put more money into the pockets of Americans this year, spurring more shopping. Target rivals like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) have also benefited from rising sales.
Target has also been helped by the demise of weaker competitors in the past year, including Toys 'R' Us Inc and department store operator Bon Ton Store Inc. Roughly 4,000 stores in the United States have closed this year through Aug. 10, according to Coresight Research.
""Target hit the bulls-eye in Q2, with improvement across virtually every meaningful measure,"" said Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea.
Cornell said its performance was aided by investments in its online operations, bulking up its lineup of in-house brands, rolling out smaller stores, a supply chain overhaul, store remodeling and delivery options.
Online sales jumped 41 percent in the quarter, versus a 28 percent gain in the first quarter and a 32 percent rise a year ago after Target cut its next-day delivery fee for household items to $2.99 from $4.99 and rolled out a drive-up service to pick up orders in an hour.
Target is also expanding its delivery services through Shipt, a same-day delivery company it bought for $550 million last year, and partnering with courier services on same-day orders in U.S. metro areas. The retailer said it will offer same-day delivery to about two-thirds of U.S. households by the holiday season.
Target plans to make capital expenditure of $3 billion this year on its supply chain, online delivery, its own brands and merging online and in-store shopping. The retailer intends to reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020. 
The retailer will try to grab more toy sales during the second half. ""We are going to make sure we are taking more than our fair share of that market,"" Cornell said referring to the toy and baby categories. Retailer Toys “R” Us Inc went bankrupt earlier this year.
Second-quarter same-store sales rose 4.9 percent, topping analysts' expectations of a 3.99 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Excluding one-time items, Target earned $1.47 per share in the quarter ended Aug. 4, higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.40.
Margins remained under pressure from investments in e-commerce. The gross margin rate was 30.3 percent, compared with 30.4 percent a year ago.
Revenue rose to $17.78 billion, topping the average estimate of $17.31 billion.
For the full year, Target raised its earnings forecast to a range of $5.30 to $5.50 per share from $5.15 to $5.45. 
The retailer's shares rose as much as 6.8 percent to $88.89, the highest since at least 1980, and were up 5.2 percent at $87.59 at midmorning.

Target's shares have risen more than 27 percent so far in 2018 and over 47 percent in the past 12 months.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pharma sector warns Saudis on German drug curbs,"By Noah Barkin and Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) - European and U.S. pharmaceutical associations have waded into a diplomatic row between Germany and Saudi Arabia, warning that ongoing restrictions on German-made drugs could hurt Saudi patients and dampen future investment in the kingdom.
In a strongly worded letter to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters, the associations highlighted the level of concern in Germany and elsewhere about restrictive procurement measures implemented by Riyadh in response to criticism of its policies. 
While a human rights row between Canada and Saudi Arabia has dominated headlines in recent weeks, Germany has been embroiled in its own spat with the oil-rich kingdom since November.
Germany's foreign minister at the time, Sigmar Gabriel, condemned ""adventurism"" in the Middle East in comments perceived by some as an attack on increasingly assertive Saudi policies. Riyadh dismissed the comments as ""shameful"" and withdrew its ambassador to Germany.
Since then, Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to ease the tensions, speaking to Prince Mohammed by telephone. But the row has rumbled on and German officials say companies such as Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG), Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and Boehringer Ingelheim are being excluded from public healthcare tenders in Saudi Arabia.
""For the past six months German healthcare companies have been having trouble doing business in Saudi Arabia,"" said Oliver Oehms of the German chamber of commerce and industry in Riyadh. ""It is not a general boycott, but the healthcare sector is clearly suffering.""
The dilemma for Berlin has been deepened by the Canada-Saudi dispute, which was triggered by a tweet from the Canadian foreign minister calling for the release of human rights activists in Saudi Arabia.
The kingdom responded by expelling the Canadian ambassador, recalling its own envoy, freezing new trade and investment, suspending flights and ordering Saudi students to leave Canada.
Some German politicians have denounced the Saudi reaction, but the government has remained conspicuously quiet for fear of sabotaging its own conciliation efforts.
'MAJOR NEGATIVE EFFECTS'
News that Saudi Arabia was punishing German companies broke in May. But the existence of the letter, dated June 12 and addressed to Prince Mohammed, has not been reported previously.. 
""This action could have major negative effects on the sustainable supply of innovative, critically necessary medicines for the treatment of patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" the letter from the German (VFA), European (EFPIA) and American (PhRMA) pharmaceutical associations reads.
It says a decision to exclude German-made products from the centralized Saudi procurement process for medical supplies ""is likely to significantly dampen industry's perception of Saudi Arabia as a site for future investment in innovative medicines"".
The associations declined to comment further, but German officials said there had been no response from the Saudis or an improvement in their situation since the letter was sent.
The Saudi authorities did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia is the largest pharmaceuticals market in the Middle East and Africa, with sales of $7.6 billion last year, according to healthcare information company IQVIA.
With a growing burden of chronic diseases tied to a more Western lifestyle, Saudi Arabia's overall drugs market is growing at 10 percent a year and the tender sector is expanding by about 30 percent.
Neither Bayer nor Boehringer rank among the top 10 drug suppliers in Saudi Arabia. That list is led by  Novartis  (S:NOVN),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and local manufacturer Tabuk, according to IQVIA.
German exports to Saudi Arabia fell 5 percent in the first half of 2018. They totaled 6.6 billion euros in 2017, with an estimated 15 percent coming from the healthcare sector.
AMERICAN HELP
Bayer and Boehringer declined to comment. But Siemens Healthineers, which makes X-ray and MRI machines as well as diagnostic equipment, acknowledged that its business in Saudi Arabia had been affected and said it had turned to U.S. authorities for help in ending the impasse.
""The decision of the Saudi Arabian government indeed has an impact on our local business,"" said a spokesman for the Siemens unit, which does not provide a breakdown of its Saudi business.
""We are working on a solution together with U.S. authorities to utilize our global value chain to overcome the restrictions of the Saudi Health Ministry,"" he added, declining to provide further details.
The company employs about 13,000 people in the United States, more than a quarter of its global workforce, and could make the case to American authorities that its U.S. operations and jobs will be hit if Saudi restrictions are not lifted.
It could also rejig supply routes to send more products from the United States instead of Germany.
Johann Wadephul, a senior member of parliament from Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), described the row with Saudi Arabia ""very damaging"".
""Should there be solidarity with Canada? Yes. But I don't think this should be the focus of German foreign policy in the region,"" he told Reuters. 

""The focus should be on improving relations with Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, we haven't achieved this so far.""

By Ed Stoddard
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Some  Nike  (N:NKE) stores were closed in South Africa on Wednesday after public outcry over a racist comment by a man that local media said had links to the sportswear company.
Nike declined to comment on the store closures, but issued a statement reiterating its ""long-standing commitment to diversity, inclusion and respect"", adding that the man seen in a video posted online was not a company employee.
In the video, taken at a beach resort, a white man with a South African accent says: ""And not one kaffir in sight. Fucking heaven on earth."" 
The ""K word"" as it is known in South Africa is apartheid-era slang for a black person and is regarded as a deeply offensive slur on a par with the ""N word"" in America.
Times Live online news service said the man in the video was married to a merchandising director at Nike. A Nike spokeswoman in London declined to comment and Reuters was unable to independently verify the person's identity.
South African media reported Nike stores had closed their doors. Reuters witnesses confirmed that two were shut at a mall in the Sandton district of Johannesburg. 
The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a party known for its hard-left and African nationalist positions, said it would file a criminal complaint against the man in the video.
In January, protesters led by the EFF trashed six H&M stores (ST:HMb) over an ad by the retail chain which featured a black child modeling a sweatshirt with the slogan ""coolest monkey in the jungle.""

South Africa remains deeply scarred by its apartheid and colonial past, with the racial reconciliation embraced by the late president Nelson Mandela frequently marred by racist incidents.

1602,By Business Insider,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",Apple and Google's app-store businesses are coming under pressure — and the companies could end up losing billions of dollars,"For years now, Apple and Google, in addition to their main businesses, have had a growing and profitable side gig in charging developers hefty commissions when those developers sell apps, subscriptions, and other items through their app stores.
But maybe not for much longer.
Apple and Google face regulatory threats and pushback from developers that could hamper their app-store businesses and force them to reduce the cut they take from each sale, Ben Schachter, a financial analyst with Macquarie Research, said in a research note Monday. Though the companies' app stores are just sideshows to their main businesses, they could both take a significant hit to their financial results if they are forced to reduce rates, he said.
Apple, for example, could take a $16 billion hit to its adjusted earnings if it's forced to make a major cut to its App Store commission rates, he said in the note.
""We believe that the traditional ... commission rates for app distribution may come under pressure,"" Schachter said in the note, adding, ""Changes in the commission rates would meaningfully impact profits.""
Both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission on purchases made through their app stores, including app purchases, subscription sign-ups, and in-app purchases of digital goods. Both companies also now charge 15% on subscription charges after the first year, a reduction to entice developers to focus on subscription-based business models.
Though the basic 30% commission has been the norm since Apple launched the iPhone App Store 10 years ago, it's increasingly coming under scrutiny. Earlier this month, Epic Games announced it would distribute the Android version of its megapopular game ""Fortnite""  through its website rather than through the Google Play app store. It opted out specifically because it didn't want to pay the search giant a commission on in-app purchases, which is the main way it makes money off ""Fortnite.""
Epic's move drew widespread publicity  because it was so unusual for a developer to opt out of one of the two major global smartphone app stores. But it may soon be followed by others, Schachter said.
""We've had behind-closed-door discussions with game developers who claim that [Apple's] and [Google's] commission structure is unfair and that they may take a more public role in pushing back against the business model,"" he said.
And it's not just game-makers who are getting fed up. Spotify, in a recent regulatory filing with the Security and Exchange Commission, called out Apple and Google for charging it commissions that aren't applied to rival music-subscription services. The statement was the latest move by Spotify to bring the issue to the attention of consumers and regulators, Schachter said.
Like Epic Games, Spotify has essentially opted out of that model. Though iPhone users can download Spotify from the App Store, they can't sign up for its premium subscription service through it. Instead, they have to do that through its website.
Apple and Google could also see pushback from other developers, particular from streaming-video providers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Schachter said. As that market starts to mature and the players become less focused on signing up new users, they may start to become more concerned about the commissions they're paying to Google and Apple, he said, adding that those concerns may heighten as the two giants rev up their respective video services.
Already, Netflix is testing directing smartphone users to sign up for a subscription to its service via their web browsers rather than through its app, Engadget reported Tuesday.
As Google and Apple ""continue to add more services and directly compete with app developers,"" Schachter said, ""we suspect some of these voices from the music, video, game businesses and others may become louder.""
But the app-store commissions are likely to come under pressure from others besides developers, most notably from the legal and regulatory arena, Schachter said.
In the next year, the US Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an appeal of an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple by consumers that targets its commission fees. They charge that Apple's monopoly over the distribution of apps on the iPhone means developers have no choice but to pay its commissions, which the developers then pass on to their customers in the form of inflated prices. Should the court allow the case to continue, it could eventually upset the whole business model of the App Store.
Meanwhile, Google's business practices have for years been under scrutiny by European competition regulators. Last month, they  hit the company with a $5 billion fine for forcing smartphone makers to install its apps.
Such regulatory scrutiny may only increase, Schachter said. Developers such as Spotify are complaining directly to regulators, he noted.
With the big market growing rapidly (global app sales hit $86 billion last year) and with Apple and Google offering more services that compete with those of leading app makers, the companies' commissions and app stores are increasingly likely to draw regulators' attention, he said.
""We are concerned that given AAPL and GOOG's dominance of mobile [operating systems] combined with their growing efforts to add value and services to customers using those OSs, it will draw regulatory and legal attention,"" Schachter said, referring to the companies by their ticker symbols.
He continued: ""We are particularly concerned that as AAPL and GOOG add more features and offerings such as voice assistants, Apple Music, YouTube Red, a potential video service from AAPL, and more, that competing developers will claim that AAPL and GOOG's position as owners of the platforms may give them 'unfair competitive advantages.'""
Should all this pressure on the app-store commissions lead to decreased prices, the two giants could take a big hit, Schachter said. Over the past year, 14% of Apple's total revenue came from its services business, much of which is derived from commissions on App Store sales.
If nothing changes with commission rates, Apple should see an average commission rate of about 27% on such sales in its fiscal 2020, he estimated, taking into account the 15% rate it charges on ongoing subscriptions. The company's App Store revenue would be about $20.1 billion that year, while its total company earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) would be about $78.6 billion, he said.
But if Apple were forced to slash its average commission rate to 15%, its App Store sales would fall to $11.2 billion in fiscal 2020, and its total company EBIT for the year would drop to $69.7 billion. If it had to cut commissions to 5% on average, its App Store revenue would be just $3.7 billion, and its companywide EBIT — essentially its operating profit — would be $62.2 billion.
Those estimates ""highlight just how levered operating profit is to the high-margin dollars of the App Store,"" Schachter said.
Google could see a similar hit if it were forced to slash Google Play commissions, he said.
Assuming everything stays the same and the company continues to get an estimated average commission of 27% on app-store sales, Google will pull in $10 billion in such revenue in 2020, and its companywide EBIT will be about $40.2 billion.
But if rates were cut to 15%, Google's app-store revenue would be just $5.6 billion that year, and its EBIT for the year would be $35.8 billion, he said. If rates plunged to just 5%, its app-store revenue would be about $1.9 billion, and its total EBIT would be $32 billion.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Toxin at heart of drug recall shows holes in medical safety net,"By Alexandra Harney and Ben Hirschler
SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - A toxin inadvertently produced in the manufacture of a widely prescribed medicine but not spotted for years raises questions about regulators' ability to detect risks in a sprawling global drug supply chain increasingly reliant on factories in China.
China's Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical (SS:600521), which produces bulk ingredients for drugmakers, told its customers in late June it had found NDMA in its valsartan, an off-patent blood pressure drug originally developed by  Novartis  (S:NOVN).
The discovery means that some of the 10 billion pills containing valsartan sold worldwide last year to prevent heart attacks and strokes had traces of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen. No one has been reported as sickened by the toxin, once used in the production of liquid rocket fuel.
Regulators and industry experts say the toxin almost certainly was introduced when Huahai changed the way it produced valsartan in 2012 - a modification that was signed off on by the European body that sets standards. Subsequent inspections by European, U.S. and Chinese regulators also found no problem.
""Everyone failed – the company, the inspectors, the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), the Europeans, the Chinese,"" said Philippe André, an independent pharmaceutical auditor who inspected two Huahai facilities last August and found no critical concerns. ""It's a system failure.""
Reuters was unable to determine how Huahai first discovered the problem. In a July 7 statement released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it said it detected the toxin during the ""optimization and evaluation"" of its manufacturing process.
A Novartis spokesman told Reuters that its generic drugs arm, Sandoz, spotted the NDMA in the course of intensive testing to prepare for expanding its purchases of valsartan. He declined to comment further, including on the identity of the manufacturer or when the tests took place.
Two other smaller bulk suppliers - Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceutical (SZ:300702) and a unit of India's Hetero Drugs - have since also discovered traces of NDMA in some of their valsartan. 
The three companies declined to comment to comment about the case.

REDUCE WASTE
Huahai said in a document released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange it changed the production process to reduce waste and improve yields. 
""The NDMA impurity was produced in trace amounts during the normal manufacturing process according to the company's current registered process,"" it said in a statement on July 24.
""All changes in the company's valsartan manufacturing process have been approved by each country's drug regulator, and the company manufactures in compliance with legal and regulatory standards.""
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulator, which first publicly raised the alarm in a statement on July 5, told valsartan suppliers in a subsequent memo dated July 16 that the NDMA may have been connected to the combined use of the solvent dimethylformamide and sodium nitrite.
The FDA is also going on that hypothesis, said Janet Woodcock, director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She stressed the investigation was still going on.
""This (NDMA) was not what you look for in an inspection,"" Woodcock said in an interview. ""If you don’t test for this you're not going to have an idea that it's in there, and you’re not going to see it on an inspection.""
The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM), responsible for setting manufacturing standards, told Reuters it was aware the solvent was being used when it approved the changed process, but that NDMA as a by-product was unexpected and not tested for. 
Detecting NDMA would have required gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, a very sensitive level of testing, an EDQM spokeswoman said.
""These techniques are not normally used routinely to test pharmaceutical products,"" she said.
RECALLS
Built by Novartis into the $6 billion-a-year brand Diovan, valsartan's European and U.S. patents expired in 2011 and 2012.
Global sales totaled 10.4 billion pills last year, including combination products, healthcare data consultancy IQVIA estimates. People with high blood pressure typically take one pill daily and heart failure patients two. 
More than 50 companies around the world making finished tablets from the tainted valsartan have recalled products in recent weeks, according a Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records. They include major generic drug manufacturers such as Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries (TA:TEVA), Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sandoz. 
Based on the average NDMA impurity detected at Huahai of 60 parts per million (ppm), the EMA says there could be one additional case of cancer in every 5,000 people taking the highest dose for seven years.
The contamination puts a spotlight on manufacturers in China and India, which supply more than two-thirds of all active pharmaceutical ingredients used in medicines, industry executives estimate. China accounts for the lion's share. 
Huahai, founded in 1989 and listed in Shanghai in 2003, was one of the first Chinese companies to get drugs approved in the U.S. market. 
The FDA has inspected the site that made the contaminated valsartan three times since 2010, its records show. European inspectors also visited regularly.
The provincial branch of the Chinese FDA (CFDA) also inspected Huahai facilities 10 times in connection with new drug applications between January 2016 and June 2018, the national online database shows.
SCRUTINY
U.S. and European regulators have increased scrutiny of Chinese and Indian drug factories after the adulteration of the blood thinner heparin sickened hundreds and caused the deaths of at least 81 Americans in 2007 and 2008.
The CFDA is also on alert. 
Last month, it revealed that Changsheng Bio-technology (SZ:002680), a vaccine maker, had fabricated data and sold ineffective vaccines for children. It also found that a diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine sold by the state-owned Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was substandard.
The fact that international inspections do not appear to have detected the NDMA contamination alarms Anders Fuglsang, a former European medicines regulator who runs a pharmaceutical consultancy in Denmark.

""We need to ask ourselves how it is possible - despite pharmacopoeias and agency guidelines, inspection programs with coordination across continents, a system of public quality control, and companies complying with all rules - that a nasty carcinogen can find its way into our drugs and be there for years without anyone noticing,"" he said.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>","Facebook, Twitter dismantle disinformation campaigns tied to Iran and Russia","By Paresh Dave and Christopher Bing
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB),  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) collectively removed hundreds of accounts tied to an alleged Iranian propaganda operation on Tuesday, while Facebook took down a second campaign it said was linked to Russia.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the accounts identified on his company's platform were part of two separate campaigns, the first from Iran with some ties to state-owned media, the second linked to sources that Washington has previously named as Russian military intelligence services.
""Such claims are ridiculous and are part and parcel of U.S. public calls for regime change in Iran, and are an abuse of social media platforms,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations.
The Kremlin rejected Facebook's accusations. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow did not understand the basis for such statements and that they looked like ""carbon copies"" of previous allegations that Moscow has denied.
Global social media companies are seeking to guard against political interference on their platforms amid rising concerns about foreign attempts to disrupt the U.S. midterm elections in November.
The United States earlier this year indicted 13 Russians on charges they attempted to meddle in U.S. politics, but the alleged Iranian activity, exposed by cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc (O:FEYE), suggests the problem may be more widespread.
""It really shows it's not just Russia that engages in this type of activity,"" Lee Foster, an information operations analyst with FireEye, told Reuters.
FireEye said the Iranian campaign used a network of fake news websites and fraudulent social media personas spread across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and YouTube, to push narratives in line with Tehran's interests.
The activity was aimed at users in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East up to and through this month, FireEye said. It included ""anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes,"" as well as advocacy of policies favorable to Iran, such as the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. 
FireEye said the Iranian activity did not appear ""dedicated"" to influencing the upcoming election, though some of the posts aimed at U.S. users did adopt ""left-leaning identities"" and took stances against U.S. President Donald Trump.
That activity ""could suggest a more active attempt to influence domestic U.S. political discourse"" is forthcoming, Foster said, but ""we just haven't seen that yet.""
""DISTINCT CAMPAIGNS"" 
Facebook said the Russia-linked accounts it removed were engaged in ""inauthentic behavior"" related to politics in Syria and Ukraine. It said that activity did not appear to be linked to the Iranian campaign.
""These were distinct campaigns and we have not identified any link or coordination between them. However, they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,"" the company said in a statement.
Facebook last month removed 32 pages and accounts tied to another misinformation campaign without describing its origins, but that U.S. lawmakers said likely had Russian involvement.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said this week that hackers linked to the Russian government sought to steal email login credentials from U.S. politicians and think tanks, allegations the Russian Foreign Ministry described as a ""witch-hunt.""
FireEye said the U.S.-focused Iranian activity ramped up just months after Trump took office, with websites and social media accounts posting memes and articles, some of which were apparently copied from legitimate U.S. and Iranian news outlets. 
In some cases, the domains for the fake websites like ""US Journal"" and ""Liberty Free Press"" were registered years before the 2016 election, in 2014 and 2013, but most remained inactive until last year, FireEye said.
Arabic-language, Middle East-focused websites appear to be part of the same campaign, the company added.
The technology companies variously said they linked the accounts to Iran based on user phone numbers, email addresses, website registration records and the timing of account activity matching Iranian business hours. 
FireEye expressed ""moderate confidence"" about the Iranian origins but said it has not been able to tie the accounts to a specific organization or individuals. 
Hundreds of thousands of people followed one or more of the Facebook pages implicated in the campaign, Facebook said.
It shared examples of removed posts, including a cartoon depicting an Israeli soldier executing a Palestinian and a fake movie poster showing Trump embracing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Postings cited by FireEye expressed praise for U.S. politicians and other Twitter users who criticized the Trump administration's decision in May to abandon the Iranian nuclear pact, under which Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear weapons program in exchange for the loosening of sanctions.
Some Twitter and Facebook accounts were designed to appear as if they belonged to real people in the United States, Britain and Canada, according to FireEye. The accounts used a combination of different hashtags to engage in U.S. culture, including ""#lockhimup,"" ""#impeachtrump"" and ""notmypresident."" 
Twitter, which called the effort ""coordinated manipulation,"" said it removed 284 accounts.
Facebook said it removed 254 pages and 392 accounts across its flagship platform as well as its Instagram service. 
The accounts spent about $12,000 to advertise through Facebook and Instagram. Facebook said it had notified the U.S. Treasury and State departments of the purchases, which may violate sanctions.

Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, did not respond to a request to comment.

1607,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 08:21AM ET</span>",The Bull Market Is Really Old. Does That Mean It’s at Death's Door?,"(Bloomberg) -- In nature, things are cyclical. If only it were as clear cut in stocks.
Alive for 3,453 days, the bull market in the S&P 500 today becomes the longest ever recorded by some measures. Through credit crisis and Trump tweet, the rally that began at the pit of the financial crisis has returned almost 20 percent a year for 9 1/2 years. About $23 trillion in value has been created as thousands of bearish predictions fell flat.
The question is everywhere: is it early or late? Does the passage of time incubate excesses that ensure a rally’s demise? Or does older mean stronger and harder to scare?
What follows is a look at frameworks for deciding whether the advance in U.S. stocks is somehow doomed by the calendar. In a bull run fueled by easy money and investors heady with the rush of earnings growth above 20 percent, the state of the patient is by most accounts sound.
“No bull market comes with an expiry date like a time-stamp on a milk bottle or on a crate of eggs,” said John Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. “Bull markets live and die by both economic and corporate fundamentals.”
Never Forever
First, the bear case, which in large part amounts to the observation that never before has a bull market gone on forever. It’s more than that, skeptics say: the longer stocks go up, the worse grow diseases that will one day claim the run’s life. Valuations soar, standards weaken, skepticism gives way to mindlessness. Years pass and the lessons of old traumas slip away.
“As the expansion expands, people now start to think we may never have a recession, which actually encourages more risk taking and more borrowing,” Srinivas Thiruvadanthai, research director at the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mt. Kisco, New York, said by phone. “It also encourages euphoria, thereby laying the seeds for the demise.”
Check the fundamentals
The message is a broken record that’s been playing all year: the fundamentals are strong. Earnings growth is running at the highest rate in eight years and the U.S. economy just hit 4 percent growth, the fastest since 2014. Yes, macro headwinds such as trade, tariffs, and emerging market currency routs make headlines. But as long as earnings hold up and the underpinnings of the economy remain strong, it’s nuts to bet against stocks.
“A 9-year-plus bull market is undoubtedly old, but we don’t think that means it’s necessarily near an end,” said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial, and Ryan Detrick, the firm’s senior market strategist. “The underlying positives from fiscal policy, government spending, strong corporate earnings, and improving confidence should extend this economic cycle for at least another year, maybe more.”
To Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists including Savita Subramanian, the firm’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, the cycle ins’t over. Rather, the market now resides somewhere between what they classify as mid and late-cycle, as supported by the return of sales growth and a pick-up in capex. The S&P 500 is expected to boost fixed investment spending by 15 percent over the next year, the fastest pace since 2012 according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Stealth bears
Another reason the record doesn’t spell the end? While the advance since March 2009 might be unbroken by a 20 percent fall, it’s endured too many traumas to be considered one long rally. Although neither drop exceeded 15 percent, the S&P 500 went through two 10 percent corrections around the time of the 2015 yuan devaluation. In May 2015 and February 2016, the Russell 2000 and energy companies in the S&P 500 each suffered retreats of more than 20 percent, respectively.
“We had Japan problems, we had China problems, and we had an earnings recession in 2015,” Brian Belski, BMO chief investment strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. “We’ve forgotten all of this because we just look at the headlines. I’m so tired of this late-cycle talk. Why can’t we just invest?”
Belski also points out the importance of acknowledging that different areas and sectors can suffer corrections at different times. It’s not a uniform market.
“I look at the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 or the Russell, and in those 11 sectors I can see early-cycle, mid-cycle, late-cycle,” he said. “Why are we applying this blanket conclusion to everything? That’s the biggest issue right now with investors. We can’t stop ourselves from trying to diagnose the top.”
Different times
Some say figuring out exactly where we are in the cycle is a moot point, as the bull market of the 21st century is not comparable to those of decades prior. About 10 years of persistently low interest rates and quantitative easing make this time around different from any others of the past.
“Go back 10 years ago, we were in trouble, the world was in trouble, and what saved us ultimately was QE, and that was something the world had never seen,” Paul Richards, president of Medley Global Advisors, told Bloomberg Television. “Every model failed to get this thing right. Now that you look at the length of the cycle, the technicians kick in, technicals have never had to factor in QE.”
What investors should expect is more volatility as the market rolls further along, grappling with positives such as fiscal stimulus and the notion of where we stand in the cycle, according to Richards. Alongside heightened volatility, interests rates are rising, the yield curve is flattening, and signs of inflation are breaking through.
“Are there more challenges to a bull market that’s been in existence for a long time than there would be if we were more early on? The answer is yes,” Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co., said by phone. “The risks rise at later stages of a bull market, but in and of itself, the age of the bull market alone is not a harbinger of recession.”

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",Lowe's cuts forecasts on Orchard Supply shutdown,"(Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) trimmed its full-year profit and sales forecasts on Wednesday as it began winding down Orchard Supply Hardware stores and planned to cut down its own inventories in the face of weakening U.S. homebuilding.
The company's shares fell nearly 3 percent to $97.03 in premarket trading as the retailer missed Wall Street estimates for same-store sales in the second quarter.
Lowe's said it would shut all 99 stores of hardware and garden chain Orchard Supply by the end of the fiscal year, leading to between $390 million and $475 million in charges in the second half.
It also said it would seek to cut back on inventory of slow-selling product lines and reinvest in faster-moving goods.
""Exiting Orchard Supply Hardware and rationalizing inventory are the driving force behind the changes to Lowe's business outlook,"" Chief Executive Marvin Ellison, who took charge in July, said in a statement.
Orchard's 4,000 employees were informed of the permanent shutdown only on Tuesday, according to local media reports.
Orchard, which was spun off by Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) in 2011, was bought https://reut.rs/2w3wBvy by Lowe's in 2013 to take advantage of its prime locations in areas such as California, where its bigger rival  Home Depot  (N:HD) has a strong presence. 
But Lowe's has struggled to keep margins up and its same-store sales growth has trailed Home Depot's for many years.
U.S. homebuilding rebounded less than expected from a nine-month low in July, suggesting the housing market was likely to tread water for the rest of this year against the backdrop of rising construction costs and labor shortages.
The No.2 U.S. home improvement store said it expected sales to grow about 4.5 percent for fiscal 2018 and sales at stores open at least a year about 3 percent, below the company's previous target. 
It also cut its full-year profit forecast by 90 cents to $4.50-$4.60 per share.
In the second quarter, same-store sales rose 5.2 percent but missed the average analyst estimate of a 5.34 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Last week, Home Depot's results topped estimates as it benefited from a rebound in demand for seasonal products.
Lowe's net income rose 7 percent to $1.52 billion in the second quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.07 per share, topping estimates of $2.02. Net sales rose 7 percent to $20.89 billion, beating expectations.

Lowe's also named David Denton as its new chief financial officer. Denton, currently CFO of CVS Health (N:CVS), will join in the second half of 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks faltered and bonds rose on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump's political position was threatened by the criminal convictions of two former advisers, while the U.S. dollar reversed course and headed for its sixth straight day of losses.
Investors digested the conviction of Trump's former campaign chairman on eight counts of financial wrongdoing and a guilty plea by his former personal lawyer in separate cases.
U.S. stock futures initially fell on the news but had recouped some losses by 1035 GMT, trading flat to down 0.1 percent. (1YMc1) (ESc1) (NQc1) 
While the immediate market reaction was not dramatic, the developments present further uncertainty over Trump's leadership for investors to navigate.
U.S. bond yields (US10YT=RR) dropped as investors sought safety in Treasuries, and a dip in S&P 500 futures spread to European shares, which opened lower.
U.S. 10-year yields were trading at 2.82315 percent, compared with Tuesday's close of 2.844 percent.
""Trump has weathered quite a few allegations before this, where many people were quick with the `I' word (impeachment), so we need to see whether this could open a new chapter or if it will calm down again and markets move on,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Christoph Rieger. 
MSCI's all-country world stock index (MIWD00000PUS) was unmoved by the uncertainty, rising 0.3 percent after the S&P 500 (SPX) hit a record intraday high of 2,873.23 points, topping the 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26.
The index was poised for the longest-running bull market in its history. Its relentless rise highlights the divergence in fortunes between U.S. stocks - turbo-charged by tax cuts and share buybacks - and the rest of the world. 
Year-on-year earnings growth in the U.S. is expected to be around 24 percent this year while Europe is forecast to deliver around 9 percent.
European shares inched up 0.2 percent by 1100 GMT. They had opened lower as the market awaited U.S.-China trade talks, set to resume under the cloud of Trump's prediction that they would make no real progress.
""The key point is these are mid-level officials,"" said Donough Kilmurray, managing director and head of the Investment Strategy Group for EMEA at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""It's good they are talking, but at that level of engagement we doubt anything significant will come out of it."" 
The U.S. dollar gave up early gains, set for its sixth straight day of selling after Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve's rate rises in a Reuters interview.
The dollar index (DXY) fell 0.1 percent to 95.172 by 1030 GMT.
Earnings growth in U.S. and Europe: https://reut.rs/2LkECRE
EMERGING MARKETS RELIEF? 
Emerging-market stocks (MSCIEF) climbed 0.4 percent, leaving 13-month lows further behind as the dollar's losses helped ease pressure on EM assets, which entered bear territory last week. 
""If you look at the transmission from economic growth to earnings growth to shareholder returns, it's strongest in the U.S., it's ok in Europe and pretty weak in EM,"" said Goldman's Kilmurray, who has been underweight emerging markets for five years. 
""The question we're getting asked now by investors is whether what we see in EM is a sign that something bigger is going wrong in the global economy. Our answer to that is no, these issues have been local issues,"" he said. 
A new threat of further sanctions on Russia from U.S. lawmakers hit the rouble (RUB=) and backed the market's view that Russian sanctions would increase in severity regardless of the Trump administration.
Chinese investors sold shares across the board, sending the Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) down 0.5 percent after the country's central bank said it would not resort to strong stimulus to support growth.
German 10-year Bunds (DE10YT=RR) bucked the trend set by Treasuries, with yields hitting their highest since Aug 10, tightening the gap with the U.S. as the euro zone economy showed signs of improvement.
Investors were also looking to Wednesday's release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's August meeting and a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday for clues on future rate hikes. 
""This could present the opportunity for the Fed to discuss longer-term issues, potentially including discussion around the balance sheet and the implementation of monetary policy,"" said Jim Reid, strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
In commodity markets, U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 1.4 percent to $66.74 a barrel and Brent crude (LCOc1) climbed 1.5 percent to $73.69 per barrel on an industry report showing a drop in U.S. crude inventories 
Copper prices declined ahead of the trade talks. Spot gold  slipped from a one-week high, down 0.2 percent to $1,193.87 an ounce.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 07:05AM ET</span>",Linde-Praxair try to save $83 billion merger after antitrust blow,"By Alexander Hübner and Jörn Poltz
MUNICH (Reuters) - Industrial gases giants Linde (DE:LIN1) and Praxair (N:PX) are in talks to try to salvage their $83 billion merger after U.S. competition regulators demanded they sell assets that generate more than $4.3 billion in sales.
Linde said on Wednesday the divestments were expected to reach a level that would allow either party to abandon the deal, although the German company added that talks continued with both Praxair and regulators.
Analysts said they still expected the deal to go ahead, though they cautioned the asset sales could make the deal less attractive and/or make synergy targets harder to achieve. 
Linde and U.S.-based Praxair agreed an all-share merger in principle in December 2016, aiming to create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France's  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas (NYSE:ARG).
The companies agreed that if antitrust regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in sales, or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty.
Linde said on Wednesday it expected the revenue threshold for divestment commitments to be exceeded, but didn't say by how much and did not mention the EBITDA hurdle. It had previously warned this was very likely to happen.
""Linde and Praxair remain in constructive dialogue with each other and the regulators on how to satisfy their requirements,"" Linde said.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asked for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and also said it wanted prospective buyers of these assets to meet certain other requirements.
Bids for major U.S. firms have had mixed fortunes recently.
U.S. President Donald Trump in March blocked Singapore-based microchip maker Broadcom's (O:AVGO) $117 billion takeover proposal for Qualcomm (O:QCOM) on national security grounds. The $63 billion takeover of seeds maker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) by Germany's Bayer (DE:BAYGn), meanwhile, went through after 7.6 billion euros worth of disposals. 
'HUGE BLOW'
A source familiar with Linde's thinking said both companies were doing everything they could to see the deal through, but they could not lose track of the targeted $1.2 billion in annual synergies without perhaps putting shareholders' support at risk.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Michael Schaefer said he expected Linde and Praxair to seek to address the FTC's demands.
""The fact that they remain in constructive talks signals to us that there is still readiness on both sides to stay the course"", he said.
Linde shares were down 1.3 percent at 0915 GMT, paring initial losses of 2.3 percent.
The German group last month lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC as a buyer of North and South American assets to allay antitrust concerns, while Praxair's European gases business will be sold to Japanese rival  Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp  (T:4091).
The source said U.S. regulators had some qualms about the proposed buyer of the former block of assets, which Linde has been trying to address.
While the European Commission gave its go-ahead this week, regulators in the United States, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and Chile have yet to decide.
Arne Rautenberg, a fund manager at Frankfurt-based Union Investment, this week said he expected the deal to be salvaged, but added Linde might have to shed its high-margin on-site business in the United States, an operator of gas production facilities near petrochemical and steel plants, which would be a ""huge blow"".
The regulatory challenge is a setback for Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who has been a driving force for the deal and had to reshuffle management following the departure of the company's chief executive and finance chief.
The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules.

The minister met Smith on Tuesday for a ""a first discussion of the main issues"" facing the group, the spokesman said.
The former Air Canada executive was named last week as Air France's first non-French CEO, three months after his predecessor quit amid crippling wage strikes.
Smith's own pay may further inflame tensions as he faces the challenge of striking new Air France union agreements on pay and productivity.
His new compensation package amounts to a maximum 3.25 million euros ($3.72 million) in fixed and variable pay, with an additional 1 million euros awarded if specific turnaround goals are met, Air France-KLM said in a notice on its website, confirming earlier French press reports.
Smith, 46, is due to take up the top job in late September.
Unions that had backed earlier strikes will meet on Monday to decide whether to pursue further action, amid some signs that workers' representatives have softened their stance and may opt for a more conciliatory start to relations with their new CEO.
""Beyond the economic and social context, it's not that shocking that the leader of a company like Air France-KLM should command a salary on a par with our main competitors,"" said one union official involved in the talks.

Another influential pilots' union, SPAF, has withdrawn from the grouping and indicated on Wednesday that it would not back any immediate action before Smith's arrival. ""We'll wait to meet him,"" SPAF President Gregoire Alpincourt said.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 06:59AM ET</span>",Sovereign funds pull $5.7 billion from global markets in second quarter,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) pulled $5.7 billion from stock and bond strategies managed by external asset managers in the second quarter, data from research firm eVestment showed on Tuesday, as trade tensions rocked financial markets.
Sovereign investor redemptions from third party asset managers have been relentless since the third quarter of 2014, apart from a modest $567.9 million of inflows in the first quarter of this year. 
The resumption of broad-based selling in the second quarter suggests that number was a blip rather than a turning point, having been revised down significantly from preliminary data indicating much higher inflows. 
A combination of low oil prices, low bond yields and volatile equity markets has prompted sovereign investors to reduce their exposure to publicly-listed securities in recent years, preferring to ramp up their private equity and real estate holdings instead. 
The figures from eVestment, which collates data from about 4,400 firms managing money on behalf of institutional investors, showed the biggest redemptions in the second quarter came from U.S. and global passive equity strategies.
U.S. passively-managed equity funds lost $2.52 billion, while global passive equity strategies lost $1.12 billion.
World stocks (MIWO00000PUS) ended the first half of 2018 flat after the United States escalated a trade war with its key trading partners, prompting investors to take risk off the table. 
But U.S. equities (SPX) have continued to grind higher on the back of robust corporate earnings. 
A survey of sovereign investors by asset manager Invesco published in July showed more than a third planned to cut their equity exposure over the next three years, with a potential trade war cited as a chief concern.
The eVestment data also showed a chunky $2.38 billion redemption by SWFs from Asia ex-Japan equity strategies. 
""It is worth noting that the largest portfolio holdings from the Asia ex-Japan product with the largest SWF outflows in the quarter are primarily Chinese names,"" said Peter Laurelli, global head of research at eVestment.
On a positive note, he added, there was a noticeable increase in the proportion of managers reporting inflows from SWF investors versus outflows. 

Some 44.5 percent of products enjoyed inflows, which is the third consecutive quarterly increase and easily the highest level reported in the last two-and-a-half years, he said.

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Japanese nuclear power companies in talks over alliance: source,"(Reuters) - Four of Japan's biggest nuclear operators and plant builders have started talks on a potential partnership in atomic energy, as the sector struggles to reboot in the wake of the Fukushima disaster seven years ago, a source said on Wednesday.
Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc (Tepco) (T:9501), Hitachi Ltd (T:6501), Toshiba (T:6502) and Chubu Electric Power Co Inc (T:9502) have signed an initial agreement that will be fleshed out in discussions, the source told Reuters. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.
The Nikkei newspaper earlier reported the companies had begun talks on an alliance that would initially focus on decommissioning old reactors.
That could be extended to building and maintaining nuclear plants, with the moves likely to spur a broad realignment in Japan's nuclear industry, the Nikkei reported.
""It makes sense in the domestic arena to cooperate. Four balance sheets is better than one when it comes to nuclear risks,"" said Tom O'Sullivan, the founder of energy consultancy Mathyos Japan.
When contacted by Reuters, all four companies said they had regular discussions with each other as well as with other nuclear operators and builders. Hitachi denied the details included in the Nikkei report on plans for decommissioning and the building of new reactors.
Japan's nuclear sector provided about 30 percent of the country's electricity supply before a tsunami and earthquake caused reactor fuel meltdowns at Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi station in March 2011.
The disaster highlighted regulator and industry failings and turned swathes of the public against nuclear power, with all reactors needing to be relicensed by a new regulator to meet tougher safety standards.
While nine reactors have been restarted, utilities have had to spend billions of dollars on upgrades and alternative fuel supplies to produce electricity in the world's third-biggest economy.
That has led to calls for the government to take over nuclear operations and reorganize an industry that has 10 atomic power operators.
Japan's powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) supports the partnership plans, the Nikkei report said, quoting an unidentified official saying: ""it is now impossible for a private company to be in the business by itself.""
An official at METI declined to comment on talks between private companies and denied it was leading the moves, when contacted by Reuters, declining to be identified.
The shakeup in Japan's energy industry sparked by Fukushima has already led to Tepco and Chubu to merging their fossil fuel power businesses under a venture called JERA that is due to complete the takeover of their coal, gas and oil generation assets in April next year.
Tepco and Chubu, two of Japan's biggest three utilities, have yet to restart any nuclear units and are meeting strong resistance from local populations to any restarts.
The utilities both use the same basic boiling water reactor technology supplied by Toshiba and Hitachi, which built all their nuclear units.
Japan had 54 operational reactors before the disaster, but utilities have announced plans to decommission nine units in the aftermath, in addition to the six reactors at Fukushima, where a decades long clean-up is in progress.
Hitachi shares closed 1.3 percent higher, while Chubu shares dropped 0.8 percent and Tepco gained 0.2 percent. Toshiba was unchanged, with the Nikkei 225 climbing 0.6 percent.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 03:21AM ET</span>","In Kenmore sale, Sears' pension liabilities come back to bite","By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD) is facing a familiar foe in its bid to sell off the Kenmore appliances brand: the U.S. government body that oversees the pensions for the company's 100,000 retirees.
Sears Chief Executive Eddie Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, submitted bids last week of $400 million and $70 million for Kenmore and the department store's home improvement business, respectively.
ESL hopes to have a final agreement as soon as Aug. 24, which would end Sears' nearly two year search for a buyer. It is unclear if the Sears special committee selling the businesses will accept Lampert's offer.
Lampert's strategy in bidding for the two businesses is to entice another potential buyer to the table, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Barring that, the goal is to help the 125-year-old department store operator continue to fund its operations as it faces a cash crunch, the source said. 
But the government agency known as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) plans to use its right to effectively veto the Kenmore sale in order to negotiate a share of the anticipated proceeds from Sears, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.
A spokeswoman for the PBGC declined to comment on the sale of Kenmore, known best for its refrigerators and washer and driers. But she said in a prepared statement, ""We continue to monitor Sears' financial situation."" 
Sears declined to comment. 
The PBGC move mirrors its own successful tactic last year with Sears, when it won future cash payments from the company in exchange for agreeing to the sale of Sears' Craftsman tool line. 
The PBGC, funded in part by insurance premiums paid by companies, is responsible for covering workers' pensions if their former employer cannot. When companies face financial distress and are at risk of leaving the agency with a pension funding gap to cover, the PBGC can intervene to protect itself, pushing the employer to contribute more to worker retirements.
The PBGC's stance could jeopardize Sears' efforts to raise money to stay in business. The retailer, which also runs Kmart discount shops, is burning through $1 billion to $1.5 billion annually, according to analysts, as it struggles to compete with online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and discount chains including Walmart Inc (N:WMT). 
Sears has taken other measures to boost cash, inking a $425 million credit card deal with  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) in May and selling $290 million in real estate in the first quarter.
Sears cautioned investors last year that it may not be able to carry on as a going concern. The retailer, with $5.2 billion in borrowings on May 5, will aim to keep as much of the cash from the Kenmore sale as it can to help make it through the holiday season, the people said.
Sears retirees' pensions face their own funding shortfall of $1.5 billion.

The PBGC now must strike a delicate balance between squeezing as much cash from Sears upfront as it can to plug its pension funding gap, without pushing the company into bankruptcy and jeopardizing any prospect of future payments as well as the jobs of the company's 89,000 workers, the sources said. 
Sears has contributed over $4 billion to its pension over the last decade, but this could be the PBGC's last chance to try to cover the shortfall it faces from Sears. Following the upcoming wave of divestitures, Sears will be left with assets including its battery label Diehard, roughly 100 Kmart and Sears stores not already used to back debt, and auto centers and home services businesses, a Fitch Ratings Inc analyst and sources said.
If ""Sears gets to bankruptcy, there's a chance that all of the choice assets will have already been sold,"" said Stephen Lubben, a Seton Hall law school professor who specializes in bankruptcy. ""The PBGC needs to keep their eye on the sale proceeds.""
The value of the remaining businesses and real estate has deteriorated as Sears has struggled to turn a profit, the people said. Sears is now a shadow of its former self, with a market capitalization of just $132 million, versus close to $30 billion in 2007. 
Lampert has invested and lent to Sears many times over the years, making him the company's largest shareholder with a stake just shy of 50 percent, as well as its biggest creditor, with about $2.1 billion owed to him or funds he controls.
PBGC STRATEGY
The PBGC plans to use its handling of the Sears sale of its tool line Craftsman last year as a blueprint for its negotiations on Kenmore, the sources said. Stanley Black & Decker Inc (N:SWK) moved forward with its $900 million acquisition of Craftsman from Sears only after the PBGC gave its blessing, the sources said.
In exchange, the PBGC won a $250 million payment, rights to a 15-year revenue stream stemming from new sales of the tool line, and liens on $100 million of the retailer's real estate. 
The PBGC's claims to Craftsman, Kenmore, and Diehard came after Sears spun out some of its real estate assets into a separate company,  Seritage Growth Properties  (N:SRG), in 2015 in a $2.7 billion deal.
The move in part led the agency to cut a deal with Sears giving it recourse to the retailer's other assets, one of the sources said.
Selling Kenmore is part of Sears' transformation to an integrated online retailer. But as Sears sells off its crown jewels, the PBGC's chances of being repaid in full dwindle, leaving the agency to pick up the balance in a potential future bankruptcy.

""When a company gets into financial trouble, creditors try to improve their position, lending more money, giving more time, in exchange for a security interest, a better chance to be repaid,"" said Lynn LoPucki, a University of California, Los Angeles Law School professor, explaining that the PBGC has taken this tactic. ""We call this the dance of death.""

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 02:26AM ET</span>",Deal-hungry investment bankers walk Tesla tightrope,"By Liana B. Baker and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk's contemplated $72 billion take-private deal is presenting investment bankers with a dilemma: overlook concerns about how feasible it is or risk missing out on what could be this year's biggest and most high-profile acquisition.
Musk did not just catch investors and analysts off guard earlier this month by announcing on Twitter he was considering taking the U.S. electric car maker private. He also sent shockwaves throughout the investment banking world, which reacted to the news with both excitement and bewilderment.
This is because no company of Tesla's size has ever been taken private by financial investors as Musk has suggested, as opposed to being acquired by a bigger company. Moreover, the standard method of doing so, saddling the company with debt in a so-called leveraged buyout, is not an option for Tesla given that is already servicing a debt mountain of some $11 billion and is not making any money. It reported an operating loss in 2017 of $1.6 billion.
Debate over the deal's feasibility has polarized bankers. During one conference call at an investment bank last week, discussion on whether the deal represented a major opportunity or a fools' errand degenerated into a shouting match, according to one of the bankers who provided the details on condition that neither he nor the bank, which decided not to pursue a role, are disclosed. 
""Given the size of a deal, the company's debt capacity and cash flow, bankers seem similarly chary about this deal happening anytime soon,"" said Stefan Selig, a former top Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) banker who is the founder of financial and strategic advisory firm BridgePark Advisors LLC, which is not involved in the deal.
Bankers aspiring to advise on the deal are courting Musk and Tesla's special board committee that will independently consider the merits of Musk's expected offer. 
Working for Musk could also come with reputational risk, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the factual accuracy of his assertion on Twitter that funding for the deal was secured, sources have said.
However, many bankers said this would not be a deterrent given the magnitude of the potential deal.
""That's likely not enough to color a banker's view on whether or not there is an opportunity,” said Ted Smith, a co-founder and partner of Union Square (NYSE:SQ) Advisors, a technology boutique investment bank. Union Square is not trying to win a role in the Tesla deal. 
Musk, who owns about a fifth of Tesla, said in a blog post (link - https:// last week the effective size of the deal would be much smaller than the $72 billion equity valuation of his offer, because, according to his estimate, two-thirds of the company's shareholders would choose the option he will offer them of ""rolling"" their stakes and continue to be investors in a private company, rather than cash out. 
Musk also said that Saudi Arabia's PIF, which became a Tesla shareholder earlier this year with a stake of just under 5 percent, could help him fund the cash portion of the deal, through sources close to the secretive sovereign wealth fund have played down that prospect.
TROPHY DEAL
There is no precedent for major institutional shareholders and thousands of mom-and-pop investors rolling their stakes in a transaction of this size, and legal experts have warned that carrying this out would require navigating a regulatory minefield. 
If the deal was structured like a leveraged buyout, advisers to Tesla could earn $90 million to $120 million in fees, while advisers to Musk's investor group would earn $30 million to $50 million, and debt financing fees could reach $500 million, according to estimates from financial advisory firm Freeman & Co. 
However, if the Tesla deal is done with equity partners and little debt, as Musk envisions, the fees would be substantially lower, according to Freeman, making it more of a trophy rather than a lucrative assignment for bankers. 
Last week, bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) decided to take the plunge by offering to advise Musk. Goldman bankers have had close ties with him for more than a decade, leading Tesla's initial public offering in 2010. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) equity research analysts said on Tuesday they had ceased coverage of Tesla, and sources confirmed that the bank was also close to being hired by Musk.
Tesla has declined to comment on the matter.
This is despite Morgan Stanley currently advising aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc on attracting a potential investment from PIF, sources told Reuters. Morgan Stanley has been a top financier of Tesla over the years, making it a prime candidate to arrange any debt financing needed, the sources said. 
Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Still up for grabs is the financial advisory mandate to be awarded by Tesla's special committee.  Evercore Partners Inc  (N:EVR), which advised Tesla two years ago in its $2.6 billion acquisition of renewable energy company SolarCity and is also advising PIF on its potential investment in Lucid Motors, is one of the banks vying to advise Tesla's special committee, according to the sources. Evercore declined to comment. 
Other investment banks vying for the Tesla special committee financial advisory role include Centerview Partners,  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ), Moelis & Co (N:MC), and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, according to the sources. The banks did not respond to requests for comment.

It’s a label more frequently slapped on developing export economies and one that President Donald Trump took up just this week to browbeat China and Europe in his increasingly pitched trade war.
But as outlandish as it sounds, some Wall Street observers say the possibility that Trump himself will launch a sustained campaign to weaken the dollar as a way to reduce the U.S. trade deficit can’t be dismissed.
“The trade debate will increasingly include the currency issues,” said Charles Dallara, a former U.S. Treasury official and one of the architects of the Plaza Accord, the 1985 watershed agreement between the U.S. and four other countries to jointly depreciate the dollar. “It’s inevitable.”
Granted, Dallara didn’t specifically use the word manipulation. There’s something of a reluctance among analysts to associate the U.S., the standard-bearer for free-market principles, with the term. They prefer to refer to it as foreign-exchange intervention. Semantics aside, a shift to a more protectionist and interventionist policy, à la 1985, would not only reverberate across the $5.1 trillion-a-day currency market and undermine the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, but could also weaken demand for U.S. assets.
Since falling toward a three-year low in April, the dollar has appreciated almost 6 percent, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. Its advance last quarter was the strongest since 2016, as the greenback appreciated against all 16 major currencies. The dollar is also 11 percent above its average over the 13-year span of the dollar index.
A strong-dollar policy has been a cornerstone for successive U.S. administrations. The U.S. was also a key supporter of the July Group-of-20 pact that member economies will “refrain from competitive devaluations, and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.”
Yet like many other things, Trump has shown a penchant for upending the status quo. Since taking office in 2017, he has routinely talked about wanting a weaker dollar to support U.S. manufacturing. His administration has arguably been, at best, lukewarm toward America’s traditional strong-dollar stance.
After a flurry of tweets in which Trump complained that the dollar is blunting America’s “competitive edge,” Michael Feroli, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase’s chief U.S. economist, wrote in a report this month that he can’t rule out the possibility the administration will intervene in the currency markets to weaken the greenback. Both  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and OppenheimerFunds echoed the view, saying dollar intervention was no longer far-fetched.
‘Deliberate Effort’
“We haven’t had a deliberate effort to weaken the U.S. dollar perhaps since the Plaza Accord in 1985, so it is very unusual and against established practice over the last several decades,” said Zach Pandl, co-head of global FX strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). “A deliberate policy to pursue a weaker currency could cause foreign investors to shy away from U.S. assets -- including Treasury bonds -- raising interest costs for domestic borrowers.”
There are some signs that Trump’s persistent jawboning of the dollar may already be having an adverse effect on foreign demand for U.S. assets. While overall demand at auction has been up and down this year, foreign holdings of Treasuries have slumped to an almost 15-year low of 41 percent. China, the largest overseas creditor, has pulled back this year. Japan, the second biggest, has reduced its share to the lowest level since at least 2000.
Not Thrilled
In recent months, Trump has stepped up the rhetoric as the dollar has bounced off its lows. In an interview published by Reuters this week, Trump once again accused China and the European Union of manipulating their currencies. Last Friday, he also complained to wealthy Republican donors that he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases under Chairman Jerome Powell, which have boosted the dollar.
So what tools does Trump have at his disposal if he wanted to go beyond mere talk? The most direct would be for him to order the U.S. Treasury (via the New York Fed) to sell dollars and buy currencies like the yen and euro using its Exchange Stabilization Fund, according to Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING. But because the fund only holds $22 billion of dollar assets, the impact would likely be minimal. Any direct intervention that is larger and more ambitious in scope would also require congressional approval, he said.
However, Patel says there is one loophole Trump could exploit to get around the fund’s constraints and bypass Congress altogether: by declaring FX intervention a “national emergency.” By doing so, he could then force the Fed to use its own account to sell dollars. Such a move would be a long shot by any stretch of the imagination, but with Trump invoking national security to impose tariffs, Patel says he can’t “completely rule out” the possibility.
FX Clauses
A less extreme, and more plausible, option would be for the Trump administration to include currency clauses in any new trade deals, like it did with the updated U.S.-South Korea trade agreement in March.
There are plenty of caveats, of course, and the odds of any kind of U.S. intervention are still low. At the G-20 summit, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured fellow finance ministers the U.S. wouldn’t meddle in foreign-exchange markets. And while White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has broached the subject of a global accord on currencies in the past, the chances of a multilateral agreement on the dollar are remote. Plus, there’s always the threat of retaliation by other nations if the U.S. goes it alone.
Nevertheless, many who recall the events in the early 1980s that culminated in the Plaza Accord see certain parallels to what’s happening today. Then, as now, the dollar’s strength on the back of rising interest rates was at the center of trade tensions between the U.S. and other major economies. Protectionism was on the rise, as were fears of foreign imports costing American jobs. Then, the bogeyman was Japan. Today, it’s China.
Precipitous Drop
And as the trade war with China intensifies, some are worried the yuan’s precipitous drop may prompt the U.S. to open a new front in the FX markets. The yuan has tumbled 9 percent since April, when trade friction with China started to intensify. The magnitude of the decline, by some measures the fastest since the 1994 devaluation, boosted speculation the People’s Bank of China is deliberately weakening the yuan to offset the tariff impact.
There are reasons to think that China isn’t trying to weaponize the yuan. A senior official at the PBOC said this week that China won’t use competitive currency devaluation as a tool to cope with trade tensions. Earlier this month, the central bank effectively made it more expensive to short the currency as it sought yuan stability.
That hasn’t stopped Trump from criticizing the country for taking advantage of the U.S. by keeping its exchange rate artificially low. (It’s worth noting that the Treasury Department, which conducts a twice-yearly review of international foreign-exchange policies, declined in April to formally name China a currency manipulator based on its own set of criteria.)
Playing Games
Eurizon SLJ Capital’s Stephen Jen warns that Trump may be quick to retaliate in the FX markets if it suspects that China is “playing games with its currency,” which may have disastrous effects on demand for U.S. assets.
“If you’re an international portfolio manager with 30 percent of your exposure to the U.S., and you know the currency will be guided meaningfully lower as a policy tool, why would you be investing here?” he said. “The Trump administration needs to be very, very careful with its dollar policy.”
Recall how the Fed’s quantitative easing sowed frustrations in emerging markets over what some officials saw as a means to manufacture a weaker dollar. Guido Mantega, Brazil’s finance minister at the time, went as far as to say the Fed was throwing money “from a helicopter” and “melting” the dollar.
Whatever the case, Dallara is bracing for more turbulent times.
“I’ve lived through a lot of market gyrations in my career,” he said. “And I have an uneasy feeling that I can’t validate by data that tensions are going to, at some point, emerge into volatile market dynamics. This is a risk.”

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 22, 2018 12:34AM ET</span>",Two U.S. airlines cut China routes as state-backed rivals turn up heat,"By Allison Lampert and Brenda Goh
DENVER/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Two U.S. airlines on Tuesday cut routes between China and the United States, underscoring increasingly tough competition from state-backed Chinese rivals as they aggressively expand their fleets with cut-price tickets.
American Airlines (O:AAL), the largest U.S. carrier by passengers, said it would drop a route between Chicago and Shanghai, canceling the second direct flight from the U.S. city to China in four months. It had canceled a flight to Beijing in May, although it still operates daily flights to the capital from Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. 
""The two China routes ... have been colossal loss makers for us,"" said Vasu Raja, vice president of network and schedule planning, adding that high fuel costs had also made the route unsustainable. 
Hawaiian Airlines [HAII.UL] said it would from October suspend its thrice-weekly nonstop service between Honolulu and Beijing, which it opened in 2014, citing slower-than-expected growth in demand.
Competition from Chinese airlines is expected to grow with the anticipated easing of China's near-decade-old ""one route, one airline"" policy, which would allow more local airlines to fly long-haul international routes.
""U.S. airlines are at a severe disadvantage,"" said Mike Boyd, president of aviation forecaster Boyd Group. ""The majority of demand is China-generated, and that gives Chinese carriers the advantage."" 
Chinese passengers arriving at U.S. airports are expected to nearly triple to 12.8 million in 2024 from 4.3 million this year, and the profile is shifting from groups to independent travelers, according to Boyd Group.
United Airlines (N:UAL) President Scott Kirby said Shanghai and Beijing had rebounded for the airline after several years of weakness, although revenue per available seat mile (RASM) was below levels of two or three years ago.
""We've had several years of weakness as there was an awful lot of capacity growth out of Beijing and Shanghai,"" Kirby said on the sidelines of the International Aviation Forecast Summit in Denver.
American and Hawaiian said the route cancellations were unrelated to demands placed by China's civil aviation regulator on foreign airlines to amend the way they referred to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on their websites. 
Chinese state media had earlier this month singled out the two companies and other U.S. airlines as being among the last firms to comply with China's demands.

""That issue of how Taiwan was displayed on our website had absolutely zero impact on this decision,"" Hawaiian's chief executive, Peter Ingram, said. ""Our economic evaluation was well underway long before that issue arose.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) has hired Credit Suisse's head of private banking in Asia Pacific as chief executive to repair its reputation following four bruising months since a powerful financial sector inquiry revealed board-level misconduct at the firm.
Francesco De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) will start at the country's largest listed wealth manager on December 1, with a one-off payment of A$17.7 million ($12.95 million) on top of a salary package worth up to A$8.3 million, AMP said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Interim CEO Mike Wilkins, who took over the reins of the 169-year-old firm after the inquiry's revelations triggered the departure of its CEO, chairwoman and several other executives, said De Ferrari would lead a growth strategy for the company. 
""We have designed a remuneration structure to drive the recovery of AMP and recognize the degree of challenge in the task ahead,"" Wilkins said.
AMP's share price has tanked since mid-April when the inquiry heard AMP had charged thousands of customers for financial advice it never gave, then doctored a supposedly independent report to the corporate regulator about it, exposing serious flaws in its governance and culture. [nL4N1TN1HO]
AMP shares were 1.9 percent lower in Wednesday morning trading, compared with the broader market (AXJO) that was down 0.6 percent. But since the shares began trading ex-dividend on Wednesday, the 5 Australian cent decline compared to the 24.5 cent dividend implied investors supported the appointment. 
""It is a good start,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Daniel Toohey, referring to De Ferrari's appointment. ""He is relatively unknown so it's too early to judge but AMP needs a cultural shift and he comes left of field and that seems positive,"" Toohey said. 
The revelations by the inquiry, called the Royal Commission, triggered the resignation of AMP's former CEO Craig Meller, and of Chairwoman Catherine Brenner, who was replaced by ex-Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA) CEO David Murray.
De Ferrari, who was also chief executive of Southeast Asia and frontier markets for  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN), said he was committed to changing the company and restoring its reputation. 
""While 2018 has clearly been a challenging year for the business, I’m confident we can earn back trust which will underpin the recovery of business performance,"" De Ferrari said in the AMP statement. 
AMP is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits pursuant to findings of the inquiry, which has said it may also recommend criminal charges. 
Credit Suisse said it would replace De Ferrari with Francois Monnet and Benjamin Cavalli, who would run the second-biggest Swiss bank's private banking business in North Asia from Hong Kong and South Asia from Singapore, respectively.
""Under Francesco's leadership, we have built a highly successful onshore and offshore private banking business model, and expanded its footprint across the region beyond established key wealth management hubs to capture the opportunities in both mature and emerging wealth markets,"" said Credit Suisse Asia Pacific CEO Helman Sitohang in a statement.

Cohen pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight counts related to tax fraud, excessive campaign contributions, making false statements to a financial institution, and unlawful corporate contributions. While he did not name Trump directly during the hearing, his attorney Lanny Davis said shortly afterward that ""Donald Trump directed [Cohen] to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.-Turkey business groups on Tuesday warned that a political dispute between the NATO allies was affecting investor confidence and had forced some firms to suspend investment plans.
In interviews with Reuters, the heads of the American Turkish Council and Turkey-U.S. Business Council, which jointly represent 250 companies, called on President Donald Trump and President Tayyip Erdogan to meet to end the dispute over the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson.
""Only the two presidents can put this relationship back on track,"" said Mehmet Ali Yalçindağ, chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council. ""We need to end this before it strains and permanently damages the relationship."" 
The countries are deadlocked over demands by Washington for the release of Brunson, while Turkey wants the U.S. Treasury to halt an investigation into majority state-owned Halkbank (IS:HALKB), which faces a potentially hefty U.S. fine for violating Iran sanctions.
Brunson has denied Turkey's allegations that he was involved in a plot against Erdogan two years ago.
Howard Beasey, president and CEO of the American Turkish Council, said a $300 million merger and acquisition deal by a Turkish firm in the United States was suspended last week over political uncertainty.
A second Turkish company was reconsidering plans to produce a steel product in the United States after Washington recently imposed additional steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkish imports.
""That is all at risk right now, not because they don't still see opportunity, but because they just don't know where the political relationship is going to go,"" Beasey said, referring to increased trade and investment between the two countries.
""The United States is using its economic strength in a dangerous way for political gain and we don't agree with the use of sanctions for that reason. We can see direct impacts already,"" he added.
Beasey said the Turkish currency, the lira, had already been under pressure before the diplomatic rift and the United States was not to blame for its slide. He said, however, Washington's decision to impose sanctions on two Turkish ministers, and the threat of more to come, had exacerbated the problem.
The lira's weakness has cranked up pressure on Turkish banks and corporates, which now account for the bulk of credit ratings downgrades in emerging markets this year. The sell-off in the lira has spread to other emerging market currencies and global stocks in recent weeks. 
The lira has lost about 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar so far this year. It weakened on Tuesday after Trump, speaking in a Reuters interview, said he would give Turkey no concessions in return for the release of Brunson.

Trump and Erdogan last met in Brussels on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels in mid-July where they discussed the Brunson case.

BOSTON (Reuters) - With a volatile chief executive and a potential breakthrough product starting production, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is a challenging stock to hold.
Just ask the managers of two well-known T. Rowe Price Inc (O:TROW) funds who came to opposite conclusions about the carmaker during the second quarter, recent commentaries show, even before Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk started tweeting about taking the carmaker private.
The split opinion matters because the enthusiasm of top investors will determine how much money Musk would need to raise. 
T. Rowe Price of Baltimore remained Tesla's third-largest investor with about 12 million shares at June 30, down 24 percent from the prior quarter.
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
Among other top holders, Baillie Gifford & Co and BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) raised their stakes during the quarter by 3 and 7 percent respectively, filings show, while Fidelity funds as a group cut Tesla by 21 percent to 11.2 million shares.
Fidelity and BlackRock spokespeople declined to comment. A Baillie Gifford representative did not immediately comment.
Managers of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund (O:PRGTX) wrote in a June 30 semiannual report that in regards to Tesla, ""We trimmed our position significantly as the stock rose, feeling that the risk/return trade-off had grown less attractive at higher valuation levels.""
The fund, led by Joshua Spencer, held 505,283 Tesla shares at the end of June, disclosures show, less than a sixth of the 3,192,850 shares held at the end of March, the biggest recent sale among funds tracked by Thomson Reuters Eikon. At Dec. 31 it had 2,250,300 Tesla shares.
Tesla has risen and fallen in Spencer's holdings before, which he has termed an ""on-again, off-again relationship.""
Tesla shares finished June at $342.95, up 29 percent from the end of the March. They closed Tuesday at $321.90, up 4 percent.
While Spencer's fund was selling Tesla, its second-largest buyer in the second quarter was T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (O:TRBCX). It had 1,298,653 Tesla shares at June 30, up from 821,953 at March 31, disclosures show.
In a quarterly review as of June 30, managers led by Larry Puglia wrote they added shares ""as we were encouraged by the company's announcement of incremental progress toward its Model 3 production target.""

""The company also reaffirmed its guidance of achieving positive earnings and cash flow in the second half of 2018 and reiterated that an additional capital raise would not be necessary to fuel operations through the end of the year,"" they wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will no longer provide financing guarantees to Wall Street firms' single-family rental home bonds.
In the last two years, Fannie and Freddie began participating in the single-family rental home market, in part by guaranteeing financing. Ending the experiment means large investors will no longer be able to tap the government-sponsored enterprises for financing. 
""What we have learned as a result of the pilots is that the larger single-family rental investor market continues to perform successfully without the liquidity provided by the Enterprises,"" the regulator's director, Melvin Watt, said in a news release.
The FHFA's announcement follows criticism of these securitizations. Some critics say that to provide payments to investors, the Wall Street firms must minimize maintenance costs and maximize rents and fees. 
A recent Reuters special report detailed tenant complaints about private-equity-backed Invitation Homes (N:INVH), now the largest U.S. single-family rental home landlord.
Invitation tenants said their landlord charged excessive fees and skimped on upkeep of homes. 
After the 2008 economic crisis, private equity firms bought thousands of homes financed with billions of dollars in bonds - the rental-market equivalent of the mortgage-backed securities that led to the housing market collapse.
In September 2017, criticism of such deals intensified when Fannie Mae guaranteed the refinancing on a $1 billion Invitation Homes rental-backed bond. 
Affordable housing advocates and realtor groups complained to the FHFA that the deal strayed from Fannie's stated mission of supporting affordable home ownership. The deal, they said, risked pushing up rents and reducing the inventory of affordable homes.
In response to Tuesday's news, an Invitation Homes spokesman said by email: “Single-family rental is an important and affordable option for many families seeking high-quality homes in communities with good schools and good jobs, and we’re pleased to have partnered with Fannie Mae on this transaction.”
In its announcement, the FHFA said, ""It is premature to allow the Enterprises to enter this portion of the single-family rental market because the effects of their participation on rent growth, long term affordability, for-sale assets and homeownership is insufficiently understood without significantly more extensive research and analysis.""
Though it is ending its relationship with large investors, the FHFA added that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will ""continue to support the single-family rental market through their existing individual investor programs.""

DENVER (Reuters) - United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) is eying joint ventures with three Latin American carriers in the near future, but a deal would not immunize the U.S. airline from the ""ups and downs"" of the region's volatile market, President Scott Kirby said on Tuesday.
""I think we will get it done in the not so distant future, but hard to predict an exact time,"" he said at the International Aviation Forecast Summit in Denver. ""All of the turmoil in Latin America makes things complicated."" 
United, the third-largest U.S. passenger carrier, is trying to finalize joint-venture agreements with Colombian airline Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), Panama's Copa Airlines (N:CPA) and Brazil's Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras (N:AZUL). 
Such deals would improve connectivity between the U.S. and Latin American aviation markets and create growth opportunities, he told reporters on the sidelines of the International Aviation Forecast Summit in Denver.
Latin American airlines have experienced a turbulent few years with increased competition in Mexico putting some of its carriers under pressure while dominant regional economy Brazil plunged into a once-in-a-generation recession that it has struggled to recover from.

Kirby also told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that United is looking to add lie-flat beds in business class in 2020 on some of its Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX 10 narrow-bodies that would fly domestic routes.

(Reuters) - After a seven-month stall, Wall Street's bull market looks back on track, thanks to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and other high-flying technology and consumer discretionary companies.
The widely followed S&P 500 (SPX) stock index rose as much as 0.57 percent on Tuesday to 2,873.23, putting it above its previous record high of 2,872.87 on Jan. 26, although it failed to close above that high. 
Closing above the January record would mean that the benchmark index ended a correction on Feb. 8, according to some investors.
Bolstered by quarterly earnings reports and a rise in stock buybacks, the S&P 500 has gained over 2 percent in the past month.
Confirmation that the bull run remains alive comes on the day the S&P 500 matches its longest rally in history, 3,452 days between November 1990 and March 2000, according to S&P Dow Jones indices. On Wednesday, it could claim the title of longest ever.
Following its January high, the S&P 500 slumped 10.2 percent over two weeks, just meeting many investors' definition of a market correction and raising fears that nearly a decade of gains on Wall Street might be over.
Since then, Wall Street has splintered: Small caps have soared thanks to deep corporate tax cuts, while companies exposed to global trade have underperformed, with some investors worried about U.S. President Donald Trump's feud with China and other trading partners over import tariffs.
After steep drops in February and March, the S&P 500 inched slowly back toward record highs as sweeping tax cuts sent earnings sharply higher and provided cash for companies to buy back more of their shares and invest in new capital.
Nearly 80 percent of S&P 500 companies reported June-quarter earnings per share above Wall Street's estimates, compared with a 64 percent beat rate in a typical year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
The S&P 500 is outperforming other major indexes globally for the year since May, and has not looked back. It ended Tuesday up 0.21 percent at 2,862.96, helped by consumer discretionary companies.
Fueled by Amazon,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Alphabet and other high-growth tech and consumer stocks, the Nasdaq has surged 14 percent in 2018, far outperforming the S&P 500's 7 percent rise. 
""A lot of it is earnings,"" said Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. ""The technology stocks continue to drive things. We've waited for that theme to go away but it hasn't."" 
The Russell 2000 index (RUT) of small companies hit its own record highs on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 materials sector (SPLRCM) this year has lost 2 percent. 
The S&P 500 has been trending higher since early 2009, providing a gain of over 300 percent for investors who stayed on for the entire ride. 
Some investors worry that the market is at risk of a sell-off if the few top-shelf stocks that have driven it higher in recent years lose steam. 

""One of the areas of concern is that there’s still a relatively narrow breadth in the market in terms of leadership. So you want to take that into account,"" said Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers in New York.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 touched a record high on Tuesday and equaled its longest-ever bull-market run, as U.S. stocks rose on earnings reports in the consumer sector and relative calm in the trade dispute between the United States and China.
The S&P (SPX) rose as much as 0.6 percent to a record intraday high of 2,873.23 points, topping its previous record high of 2,872.87 on Jan. 26, though it closed below both those marks.
The index's bull-market run is now 3,452 days old and on Wednesday would become the longest such streak in history, at least for some market watchers.
Trade-sensitive industrial stocks rose for the fourth consecutive session as investors remained optimistic that the United States and China could move closer to settling their trade dispute. The S&P 500 industrial index (SPLRCI) rose 0.8 percent.
The S&P consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) climbed 0.9 percent as shares of off-price retailer TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX) rose on strong results and  Toll Brothers  Inc's (N:TOL) encouraging quarterly report boosted shares of homebuilders.
""We've got good momentum, which is fundamentally justified by the strong economy and better earnings,"" said Kevin Caron, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. ""Investors still seem relatively optimistic about growth, and you're seeing that expressed in the market today.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 63.6 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,822.29, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 5.91 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,862.96 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 38.17 points, or 0.49 percent, to 7,859.17.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT), which is less affected by global tariff disputes than its large-cap peers, ended the session up 1.1 percent at a record closing high.
The S&P 500 energy index (SPNY) rose 0.5 percent and the S&P 500 materials index (SPLRCM) gained 0.4 percent, in tandem with higher prices for oil and metals.
Helping commodity prices was a drop in the dollar after President Donald Trump said he was ""not thrilled"" with the Federal Reserve for raising rates and that the central bank should do more to help him boost the economy.
The criticism came ahead of the release of the Fed's minutes of its August policy meeting on Wednesday, which is expected to reaffirm its confidence in the U.S. economy and its commitment to future rate hikes.
Toll Brothers shares jumped 13.8 percent after the homebuilder reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Shares of its industry peers PulteGroup (N:PHM),  Lennar  (N:LEN) and D.R. Horton (N:DHI) also rose between 3.8 percent and 5.5 percent.
TJX shares climbed 4.7 percent, ending the session at a record closing high, after the retailer topped quarterly comparable-store sales estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast.
But shares of  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) tumbled 7.1 percent after the beauty products maker missed sales estimates for the first time in six quarters.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.88-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.32-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 32 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.86 billion shares, compared with the 6.49 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1664,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Minutes Eyed for Rate-Hike Clues
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday releases the minutes of its previous meeting due 2:00 p.m. ET.
Traders are expected to parse the minutes for clues about future rate hikes and a possible update on the central bank's efforts to unwind its massive $4.2 trillion balance sheet.
Investors are keen to get a sense of the Fed's monetary policy plans for next year as inflation has reached the 2% target, and unemployment has dropped below 4% -- the lowest since 2000.
In its July 31-Aug. 1 meeting, the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and gave an upbeat assessment of the economy, leaving little doubt that the central bank will meet expectations and raise rates next month.
But President Trump has been highly critical over the Fed's rate hikes, calling on the central bank to do more to boost U.S. growth.
While Trump's remarks are not expected to influence Fed policymakers, the dollar sold off sharply Tuesday to a nearly two-week low.
2. U.S. Housing Data, China-U.S. Talks Get Underway
U.S. housing activity is expected to show a rebound after an unexpected fall in June.
Existing Home Sales due 10.00 a.m. ET for July is expected to show a rise of 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.44 million units, after falling 0.6% in June.
The fall in June was blamed on a mismatch between the growing level of homebuyer demand and the declining pace of home sales.
Elsewhere, the United States and China are set to return to the negotiating table on Wednesday, to hash out their differences on trade, but market participants are not expecting much in the way of progress from the mid-level talks.
Yet it is hoped the dialogue would pave the way for more meaningful talks in the future that could lead to the end of the trade war as early as November, when President Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet.

3. Energy Information Administration's Weekly Inventory Report on Tap
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week after an unexpected climb in the prior week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 1.497 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 17. Domestic crude output – which rose for the first time in three weeks to 10.9 million barrels a day in the prior week – is also likely to garner investor attention.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>","U.S. buyback announcements slow, but on track for $1 trillion: TrimTabs","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - U.S. companies' taste for their own shares is set to push buybacks past the $1 trillion-a-year mark for the first time as soon as November, TrimTabs Investment Research said, even as its latest data showed the pace of new repurchase announcements slowing during the second-quarter reporting season.
Companies have been using a chunk of their savings from a slashing of corporation taxes in the tax law passed late last year to go on a share repurchase spree.
Announcements made in the second-quarter reporting season up to Aug. 17 brought the year-to-date tally to $769 billion, putting U.S. companies on track for a $1 trillion of repurchase announcements around November, according to David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs.
The previous record for annual share repurchases was $809.6 billion in 2007, Santschi said.
""The only reason we wouldn't get there is if the economy turns down and corporate borrowing costs go up,"" he said.
But in the latest reporting season U.S. companies announced an average of $3 billion in buybacks on a daily basis compared with the $3.5 billion a day average for the past eight earnings seasons, according to TrimTabs.
Daily buyback announcements in the second-quarter reporting season were below the $6 billion average for the first two earnings seasons of 2018, although that number was inflated by Apple (O:AAPL)’s record $100 billion buyback announcement in May, according to the research firm.
While there is typically a lull in buyback announcements in the reporting season spanning mid-July to late August, Santschi said the drop could be a sign of caution among corporations. 
""It wasn't extremely low but it was lower. It could be some of the rhetoric about trade and currency is making people uneasy,"" said Santschi. ""Buybacks tend to be heavy when executives are feeling good about business. If they're not feeling good they cut back.""
He also noted that buyback announcements hit a record in both the January/February and the record was then surpassed in the April/May reporting season.

For the year so far daily buyback announcements have averaged $4.8 billion, compared with the previous record of $3.2 billion in 2007.

Capita, which provides IT-led services for the public and private sectors, delivered a series of profit warnings after running into problems chasing contracts on slim margins and last month announced that Nick Greatorex was stepping down as CFO.
An official announcement could be made as soon as Wednesday, Sky News said, citing sources. 
The company also has a new chief executive, Jon Lewis, who took over in December.
Butcher was appointed Go-Ahead's CFO in 2015, having previously served as finance director at state-backed rail infrastructure company Network Rail.
Go-Ahead and Capita said they had no comment on the Sky News report. 
Capita this month reported a 60 percent drop in first-half pre-tax profit, underlining the huge challenge facing the company.

Go-Ahead, which has been criticized for cancellations and strikes over the past two years, said in May that improved efficiency measures on its Southeastern rail franchise would boost profit this year.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 03:24PM ET</span>","Uber hires CFO after lengthy search, paving way for IPO","By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has hired a chief financial officer, the ride-services company said on Tuesday, filling a long-standing vacancy and clearing the way for a much-anticipated initial public offering next year.
Uber said it had hired Nelson Chai, a financial services veteran with deep connections to the banks and deal-makers Uber must impress ahead of what is expected to be a large, complicated IPO. Uber lost more than $1 billion per quarter in three of the last six quarters. Still, it hopes its growth potential will attract investors.
Uber must meet its self-imposed deadline of an IPO next year or a shareholder provision that would lift transfer restrictions on shares could create a chaotic market of buying and selling Uber stock.
The CFO position has been empty since 2015, when Brent Callinicos departed. Previous Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick had shown little interest in hiring a replacement, but the search stepped up last year under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. 
Uber's most senior finance executive, Prabir Adarkar, left last month to become CFO at meal-delivery service DoorDash, further depleting the department.
Uber's lack of a CFO, and the protracted search for one, had worried investors. Operating without such a senior manager is rare for a company the size of Uber, whose net revenue, after payment for drivers, promotions and refunds, was $2.8 billion in the second quarter this year. A CFO is also vital for conducting an initial public offering.
""I know people at the major investment banks,"" Chai, 53, said in an interview. ""After the announcement (from Uber) goes out I expect to become a lot more popular with people from my past.""
Chai has had stints at Merrill Lynch, where he worked as CFO through the financial crisis, and Bank of America (N:BAC) after it bought Merrill Lynch in 2008. He was also president of commercial lending bank CIT Group (N:CIT).
Previously, he worked as CFO at Archipelago Holdings and helped take that electronic stock exchange public in 2004. It was later bought by the New York Stock Exchange, where Chai worked as CFO until 2007.
Most recently, he was president and CEO of insurance provider The Warranty Group, placed there by private equity firm TPG to improve the company's performance. His relationship with TPG, an Uber investor and board member, and especially John Thain, another Uber board member who ran CIT Group, Merrill Lynch and the New York Stock Exchange, led him to Uber.
Chai said had breakfast with Khosrowshahi in June, his introduction to the job and the man he would work for.
""He will be a great partner for me and the entire management team as we move toward becoming a public company,"" Khosrowshahi said.
Uber chose Chai after making an offer to VMware (N:VMW) CFO Zane Rowe this past spring. Rowe turned it down under pressure from his board, according to people familiar with the matter.
MONUMENTAL TASK
Chai acknowledged Uber must work to convince public market investors it can keep growing and that it has a path to profitability after losing more than $4 billion last year. Revenue for the second quarter was up 8 percent over the first quarter and more than 60 percent from last year.
Potential investors will challenge him to explain the sphere of business at Uber, which has oscillated between investing and divesting in products, strategies and geographies.
This year Uber sold its Russia and Southeast Asia businesses, while pledging to invest heavily in India. It scrapped its autonomous trucking effort while doubling down on its freight-hauling business. It bought an electric bikes company and is eyeing a scooter service, but retrenched from its self-driving car ambitions.
""The bigger part is going to be talking through some of the strategy choices the company has made to invest in and shareholder return,"" Chai said.
Uber had a number of executive vacancies to fill since Kalanick departed, and not all have gone smoothly. Chief Operating Officer Barney Harford, picked by Khosrowshahi, has been accused of making racially insensitive comments, prompting an internal probe.

Chai is based in New York City, and said he is currently looking for an apartment in San Francisco and starts the job next month.

Morgan Stanley's move comes a week after  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) stopped its coverage of Tesla last week shortly before confirming it was acting as a financial adviser on a matter related to the automaker.
Morgan Stanley's website showed Tesla had been moved to ""Not Rated"" from ""Equal-weight"" on Tuesday without providing further details on the reason for dropping coverage.
Shares of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla rose to a high of $324.79 on Tuesday, bouncing off a three-month low on Monday when JP Morgan slashed its price target on the company by $113 and said it believed Chief Executive Elon Musk had not secured funding for taking Tesla private.
Musk had tweeted early last week that he was working with buyout firm Silver Lake and investment bank Goldman Sachs as advisers in his efforts to secure tens of billions of dollars in funding and take the car maker private.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Norway's wealth fund, a Tesla investor, said on Tuesday that its rules would allow it to stay on as an investor in the carmaker if it delists from the Nasdaq exchange.
Musk has given no details of funding since saying in a blog on Tesla's website a week ago that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down.
His tweet earlier this month that he was considering taking Tesla private and that he had secured funding prompted investor lawsuits as well as an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Separately, Musk, a prolific Twitter user with 22.4 million followers, deleted his Instagram account, which had about 8 million followers.
""Instagram is so thirsty, yet gives you Death by Water,"" Musk said in response to a tweet asking why he had deleted his account.

Musk has been criticized for his erratic behavior on social media, with some investors urging him to refrain from making controversial comments.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Probe cites multiple causes for Puerto Rico's fiscal free fall,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Short-term fixes, deficit financing and political pressures helped drive Puerto Rico into a fiscal catastrophe that landed the U.S. commonwealth in bankruptcy court last year, according to an investigative report released late on Monday. 
The 600-page report commissioned by the island's federally appointed oversight board last September also addresses potential claims for investors and regulators and recommends ways for Puerto Rico to avoid future fiscal problems. 
With roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, Puerto Rico commenced bankruptcy proceedings in federal court in May 2017. A fiscal oversight board created by the U.S. Congress in 2016 under the so-called PROMESA Act tapped law firm Kobre & Kim to produce the report.
“The 10-month investigation involved an extensive evaluation of evidence from many sources. We conducted over 100 witness interviews and reviewed voluminous productions of documents in both English and Spanish,” John Couriel, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim, said in a statement.
In conducting its probe, the law firm had access to documents that had been restricted from public view by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who oversees the island's bankruptcy.
The report found that contrary to accusations by some bondholders, Puerto Rico's Sales Tax Financing Corporation, known as COFINA, was not created to evade the island's constitutional debt limit.
""Over time, however, COFINA became a comparatively accessible source of liquidity that staved off the need for Puerto Rico to find a more permanent solution to its financial problems,"" the report said.
It recommended amending the island's constitution so that debt issued by COFINA, which securitized sales tax revenue to achieve higher credit ratings, counts toward the debt limit.
Political pressures impacted rates charged by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which became dependent on short-term loans from the island's Government Development Bank that were paid off through bond issuances, according to the report. 
Meanwhile, investigators could not determine how the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) spent some proceeds from bonds issued between 2010 and 2013. The report recommended a mix of governor-appointed and independent members for utility boards and the establishment of audit committees and independent rate boards.
The probe found deficiencies with Puerto Rico's budgeting process and chronically late annual audits, as well as with credit rating agencies.
While the report said it could not conclude the rating agencies significantly contributed to the island's fiscal crisis, it faulted them for undeserved high ratings that made bonds more attractive to certain investors.
""Indeed, certain of Puerto Rico-related bonds retained investment-grade ratings for a prolonged period despite mounting levels of debt service, declining issuer performance, and worsening macroeconomic indicators, with several issuers ultimately landing in a form of bankruptcy after (the rating agencies) reduced the ratings below investment grade,"" the report stated.

The report will be the subject of a public hearing the oversight board set for Sept. 18.
