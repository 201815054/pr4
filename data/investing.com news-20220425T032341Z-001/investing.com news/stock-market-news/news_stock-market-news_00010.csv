The continuing low-interest-rate environment is also contributing to investors’ confidence. Given this backdrop, we believe stocks with attractive long-term growth prospects—SS&C Technologies (SSNC),  Amdocs  (NASDAQ:DOX), Criteo (CRTO), and EchoStar (SATS)—which look undervalued at their current price levels, could be ideal picks now. So, let’s discuss.The major stock indexes rallied last week, and today’s index futures indicate bullish investor sentiment. A solid start to the third-quarter earnings season is the key catalyst. The market also received support from news that initial jobless claims fell below 300,000 for the first time since the pandemic.
Though the inflationary environment and supply chain constraints remain concerns, continuing low interest rates and solid corporate earnings should keep supporting the market’s momentum in the near term.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality stocks SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC), Amdocs Limited (DOX), Criteo S.A. (CRTO), and EchoStar Corporation (SATS). They all look undervalued at their current price levels.

Investing.com – Ulta Beauty stock (NASDAQ:ULTA) fell more than 5% Tuesday as the company’s long-term financial targets that it disclosed earlier in the day failed to impress.
The beauty retailer expects its total net sales to grow at a compounded rate of 5% to 7% starting next financial year through 2024.
This comes after the company reported its second quarter earnings in August. Net sales had then jumped 60% to $2 billion. The company is targeting $8.2 billion in net sales at midpoint in the current financial year. That translates into an over 32% jump from 2020 net sales of $6.2 billion. The forecast was thus found underwhelming.
Ulta Beauty aims to add 50 stores every year in that period. Comparable sales are seen growing between 3% and 5% annually.
Operating profit margin is seen coming in at 13% to 14%. Diluted earnings per share is aimed to compound in low double digits.
The company also plans to go full throttle on ensuring quicker deliveries of its products and a wider presence. It is introducing ‘Beauty to Go,’ a commitment that buy online, pick-up in store orders will be ready for pick-up in two hours or less.
It is also launching same day delivery in select markets. The company now also has a new partnership with Google to leverage its own GlamLab Virtual try-on tool for lipstick and eyeshadow with select brands within Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s search and YouTube platforms.

Apollo trails Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, the world's largest alternative asset manager, which announced in 2018 that it would also grow its assets under management to $1 trillion by 2026. Blackstone had $684 billion in assets as of the end of June. 
""We are in the excess return business and assets are what is in short supply, not capital,"" Apollo Chief Executive Marc Rowan said during an investor day event.
Rowan said its insurance platform, led by annuities provider Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Ltd, will be a key driver in expanding its assets under management and earnings over the next five years. 

That is because Athene has the capacity to amass significant outside capital without much fundraising, allowing Apollo to generate profit from its fixed-income investments at low costs and from even low rates of return, Rowan said.

Investing.com — Bitcoin mining firm Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) announced the development of 200 megawatts of immersion-cooling technology at its Whinstone facility, which it acquired earlier this year. 
Shares of Riot Blockchain rose more than 2% on Tuesday.
“After months of research and development, utilizing partnerships across industries, Riot is proud to be a pioneer in the use of cutting-edge immersion-cooling technology at an unprecedented scale,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. 
The company previously announced a 400 MW expansion of Whinstone, of which 200 MW of the infrastructure is committed to utilizing immersion-cooling technology in Bitcoin mining.
The development includes two buildings under construction and will host approximately 46,000 S19 Antminers from Riot’s current miner fleet.
Immersion-cooling is a method where Bitcoin mining chips are immersed in a specialized fluid to keep the integrated circuits working at lower temperatures. The technique allows them to run at higher productivity rates, with preliminary results estimating a 25% increase in hash rate, with an estimated potential increase in performance of as much as 50%. 
""By leveraging technology, industry-leading low power costs, and economies of scale, Riot intends to continue driving operating and capital efficiencies for its self-mining business and its institutional clients. Due to these efficiencies, we anticipate observing an increase in the company’s hash rate and productivity through 2022, without having to rely solely on purchasing additional ASICs,” added Les, referring to integrated circuit chips.
The initial deployment of ASICs in the immersion-cooled buildings will begin by Q4."

(Reuters) - Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc's experimental COVID-19 antiviral pill, being developed with Roche, failed to help patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a small study of mostly low-risk patients, driving the U.S. drugmaker's shares down more than 65% on Tuesday. 
The trial results puts Atea and Roche far behind U.S.-based Merck & Co Inc in the race to a pill to treat COVID-19.
Atea is considering changing the target patient population for its larger, late-stage trial, making it more similar to the trial run for Merck's molnupiraivir. As a result, Atea said it will not have data from that trial until the second half of 2022, a delay of at least six months. 
Merck applied for U.S. emergency use authorization for its drug last week after it was shown to cut the rate of hospitalization and death by 50% in a trial of mild-to-moderately ill patients who had at least one risk factor for the disease.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) is due to report data for its antiviral as soon as this quarter. 
Atea's shares slumped about 70% to $12.15 in early trading, while Roche shares fell 1.9%. Both Merck and Pfizer shares were up about 1.5%.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said the setback was an unfortunate delay for a potentially important COVID-19 drug and will increase the emphasis on the use of vaccines. 
Atea said the treatment did not show a clear reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the overall population of patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 compared to placebo in the mid-stage study.
However, the viral load reduced in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions.
Nearly two-thirds of the patients in the study had mild symptoms with no underlying health conditions, with COVID-19 vaccinated patients included in the overall study population, Atea said. The Merck trial did not include vaccinated patients. 
""Having a healthier and partially vaccinated patient population with largely mild disease has important implications in determining the viral kinetics and may have made it more difficult to evaluate viral efficacy,"" Atea Chief Development Officer Janet Hammond said in a conference call.

The company said it was looking to modify an ongoing late-stage study testing the drug in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 to include changes to the trial's main goal and patient population.
""It's really the high risk patients where you're going to have the greatest likelihood of seeing an impact clinically,"" Hammond said.

This is evident from recent reports stating better-than-expected retail sales in September, despite rising inflation. So, discount retailers Costco (COST) and Dollar General (DG) should benefit from the increased foot traffic and consumer spending. But which of these stocks is a better choice now? Read more to find out.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which is headquartered in Issaquah, Wash., operates membership warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan. It offers branded and private-label products across a range of merchandise categories. In comparison, Goodlettsville, Tenn.-based Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) provides various merchandise products in the Southern, Southwestern, Midwestern, and Eastern United States. Its offerings include consumable items, seasonal items, home products, and apparel.
Discount stores witnessed a significant decline in foot traffic last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with substantial progress on the vaccination front, students heading back to school, and workers returning to their jobs, retail sales are increasing this year. According to an advance estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau, retail sales in September beat analysts’ expectations, despite inflationary pressures. So, discount stores offering merchandise at slashed prices should attract more customers, and both COST and DG are well-positioned to capitalize on the rebounding demand.
COST's shares have gained 24.6% in price over the past six months, while DG has declined 1.4%. In terms of their past year’s performance, COST is again the winner with 21.1% gains versus DG’s 3.6% slump. Furthermore, COST’s 22.6% price gains year-to-date compare with DG’s 1.6% returns.

That's why investors should consider undervalued automotive stocks such as Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WGO), AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE:AN), Sonic Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:SAH) that could see their shares rise in the months ahead.A significant theme that has rocked multiple industries over the past year is the massive global chip shortage. One industry that has been particularly hit is the automotive industry. This has led to fewer new cars being produced and has also been a boon to used car dealers and parts suppliers. While the chip shortage was initially expected to be over sooner rather than later, we now know that's further from the case. 
Automotive News reported last week that a new forecast from IHS Markit predicted that the auto industry will not recover until the first half of 2023. This means there could be another year of inventory shortages and higher prices. While investors may want to avoid large automotive manufacturers, used cars, parts, and services will still be high in demand.
If we want to generate higher returns, though, we should focus on very cheap stocks. When I say very cheap, I am looking for a forward P/E below 10.

(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported lower-than- expected quarterly revenue after sales of its COVID-19 vaccine missed Wall Street estimates following a string of production setbacks. 
The New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based company maintained its 2021 sales goal of $2.5 billion from the vaccine, and said it recorded $766 million in sales of the shot in the first nine months of 2021 - which indicates that sales will have to more than triple in the fourth quarter to meet its forecast. 
""We're still very much committed to the $2.5 billion of revenue and the supply that is correlated to that,"" Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told investors on a conference call.
The drugmaker earlier this year experienced quality problems at a Baltimore manufacturing facility that produces the single-dose vaccine, resulting in wastage of millions of doses.
The J&J (NYSE:JNJ) shot, once touted an as important tool for vaccinating hard-to-reach areas, is behind its schedule for deliveries in the United States and Europe.
The vaccine has the lowest uptake in the United States at a time when rivals  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) are signing up supply deals for booster doses in 2022 and beyond. 
""It's hard to say if J&J will meet that target or not, but with the booster guidance coming out soon, that could provide a boost to the fourth quarter,"" Edwards Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans told Reuters. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to authorize a booster dose of the J&J vaccine, with a decision expected in the coming days. 
J&J's shares rose nearly 2% in morning trade, reversing a premarket fall, as the company raised its overall adjusted profit forecast and beat earnings estimates. 
Sales in its medical devices unit rose 8% to $6.64 billion but missed analyst estimates of $6.87 billion, hurt by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant. 
Excluding items, J&J earned $2.60 per share, beating expectations of $2.35 per share, according to Refinitv data. 
J&J lifted its 2021 forecast for adjusted earnings per share to between $9.77 and $9.82, from its prior estimates of $9.60 to $9.70. 

Overall sales of $23.34 billion missed expectations of $23.72 billion. 
COVID-19 vaccine sales of $502 million missed estimates of $815 million, according to FactSet.

Investing.com – Shares of vaccine-makers traded higher Tuesday on a report in The New York Times that the Food and Drug Administration plans to allow people to receive booster shots that are different from their first Covid-19 doses.
BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) was up 5.5% and its partner in developing and marketing their Covid vaccine,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), gained 1.4%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was up 0.7%.
According to the report, the FDA won’t recommend one shot over another but will let people get a booster that is different from the shot they first received.
The FDA is also expected to approve Moderna and J&J boosters Wednesday, the NYT report said. Pfizer-BioNTech is the only entity to have the FDA's nod so far to administer boosters to people 65 and older and those at-risk.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 2.2% though the company lifting its annual forecast arguably had bigger a role in that. In fact, according to the NYT report, the mix-and-match could reduce the appeal of the company’s vaccine.
A study presented to FDA’s advisory panel has suggested that recipients of J&J’s vaccine might benefit most from Moderna’s booster shot.
J&J now sees its annual adjusted earnings to be around $9.79 per share, up some 1.4% from a prior estimate of $9.65 at center of the guidance range.

Investing.com — Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) shares have seen a sharp rise Tuesday following a positive crypto market and news that it has been chosen as the custody partner for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s pilot of Novi, a new digital wallet.
Coinbase shares rose 2% on Tuesday and hit a high of $307.83 after the opening bell. Facebook shares are up nearly 1%.
Facebook's wallet will enable people to send and receive money abroad instantly without fees. Coinbase Custody uses a fully segregated cold storage capability for managing private keys.
Coinbase said users involved in the pilot can acquire Pax Dollars through their Novi account. A Pax Dollar is a stablecoin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar and issued on the Ethereum blockchain.
""Novi users who can participate in the pilot can acquire Pax Dollar (USDP) through their Novi account, which Novi will hold on deposit with Coinbase Custody. Novi users will then be able to transfer USDP between each other instantaneously,"" stated Coinbase.

(Reuters) -Snap Inc said on Tuesday it is launching a studio to help brands create augmented reality advertising and experiences, part of a move to popularize the use of technology that can overlay computer-generated images onto a person's view of the real world. 
The owner of photo messaging app Snapchat first became popular with young users for its early forms of augmented reality (AR), such as photo filters that could superimpose dog ears onto a person's photo, or add a dancing hot dog to a video. 
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has since staked its future on advancing the technology, launching AR-enabled eyewear and acquiring startups that develop technology to allow users to virtually try on clothing.
The new studio, Arcadia, will help brands build AR experiences not just for Snapchat, but any other social media apps or websites where it wants to place content, said Jeff Miller, global head of creative strategy at Snap.
""The goal is to push the boundaries of what's possible in AR,"" he said.
P&G Beauty,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and entertainment company WWE are Arcadia's first clients of record, meaning the studio will handle the brands' AR work and strategy, Snap said.
Arcadia, which will operate as a division of Snap, will also work with companies in a project-based capacity, or provide advice to brands and ad agencies through workshops, it said.
Snap will announce a leader for Arcadia in the coming weeks, and the division is expected to have between 25 to 50 employees within the next few months, Miller said.

On Monday Arcadia launched its first AR project with fast-food chain Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) at one of the its New York restaurants.
Visitors to the restaurant can open the Snapchat app and scan a code which will let them virtually try on ""Snap Shack"" branded clothing and purchase items on their phone, or to see a dancing cheeseburger, hot dog and french fry in the restaurant.

They also provide aircraft asset management and corporate services to securitization vehicles, joint ventures, and other third parties.
In the company’s most recent quarter end, its earnings beat expectations and rose 24.5% year over year. This was due to a rapid recovery in air travel in many of the world’s major markets. This led to increased demand for AER’s aircraft and an increase in its cash flows. Management is highly optimistic that the global leasing environment will continue to rebound in the months ahead.

However, intense competition and a semiconductor chip shortage will keep some industry participants under tremendous pressure in the near term. For example, analysts have recently downgraded EV stocks Hyliion (HYLN) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE). Read on to learn more as to why.Last year was tough for the automotive industry. However, increasing fuel prices and government incentives to encourage the transition from traditional, internal combustion vehicles to electric vehicles (EV) have boosted EV sales this year. To meet the rising demand, automakers are increasingly investing in this space. And the global electric vehicle market is expected to reach $812.89 billion by 2028, registering a 19,8% CAGR. 
While most EV players have benefited from the industry tailwinds, some are struggling to stay afloat due to intense competition. Furthermore, an acute semiconductor chip shortage and supply chain constraints are hampering the production of EVs.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid EV stocks that possess weak fundamentals and poor growth prospects. Cases in point are Hyliion Holdings Corp. (HYLN) and Lordstown Motors Corp. (RIDE), which due to their fragile financial health have recently been downgraded by analysts. Therefore, we think these two stocks are best avoided now.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>","Ericsson plans cut in China ops on Huawei backlash, flags supply chain issues","By Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) announced on Tuesday plans to reduce its operations in China after suffering a big sales drop in one of its biggest markets due to retaliation for Sweden's ban on China's Huawei from selling 5G gear in the country.
The news came as the company reported better than expected third-quarter core earnings boosted by strong sales of 5G equipment in most of the world, offsetting a loss of market share in mainland China and a hit from the global supply chain problems.
Sweden banned China's Huawei from selling 5G gear in the country a year ago and Ericsson has since lost most of its share in the latest rounds of telecom tenders in China.
The proportion of revenue Ericsson earns from China has dropped to around 3% of the total from 10-11%, Chief Financial Officer Carl Mellander said in an interview, offsetting gains made as Ericsson filled the void left by Huawei in several countries as it retreated under pressure from the U.S. government.
Mellander said the decline started in the second quarter and would show as a year-on-year loss until the same period of next year. 
China sales declined by 3.6 billion Swedish crowns ($418.14 million) in the third quarter alone and the company is now planning to reduce its sales and delivery organisation in the country.
The reduction in China marks a small retreat for the company that has been in the country for over a hundred years. Chief Executive Borje Ekholm had last month vowed to double down on efforts to regain market share in China. 
Ericsson, a rival of Nokia (NYSE:NOK), also said the global supply chain issues had started to bite.
""Late in Q3 we experienced some impact on sales from disturbances in the supply chain, and such issues will continue to pose a risk,"" CEO Börje Ekholm said in a statement.
The company was not able to deliver certain hardware to its customers due to chip shortage at suppliers, coupled with logistics problems, leading to a drop in revenue, Mellander said.
Shares of the company were down marginally and analysts said that the supply chain constraints could translate into potential upside for next year as demand stayed strong.
Quarterly adjusted operating earnings rose to 8.8 billion Swedish crowns ($1.02 billion) from 8.6 billion a year ago, beating the mean forecast of 7.85 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Securing 5G contracts from all three U.S. telecom firms -- Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile -- has helped the company to absorb the losses in China. 

Total revenue fell 2% to 56.3 billion crowns, missing the 58.14 billion crowns forecast by analysts.

Investing.com – Halliburton stock (NYSE:HAL) fell 3.3% Tuesday after the company’s third-quarter revenue fell short of estimates at a time when the U.S. rig count rose, and activity jumped.
The company provides hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Russia and CIS countries.
Chairman, President and CEO Jeff Miller said he sees a multi-year upcycle unfolding as structural global commodity tightness drives demand for its services, both internationally and in North America.
Revenue in the third quarter jumped 30%, to $3.86 billion, and that helped the company swing back to a profit of $240 million from a loss of $19 million in the same period a year ago.
The U.S. rig count jumped by 51 units over three months to 521 rigs at the end of the third quarter, according to data at rival  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR).
Adjusted profit per share of 28 cents was higher than the 27 estimated by analysts.
Completion and production revenue was driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the western hemisphere, higher cementing activity in West Asia as well as enhanced well intervention activities in Europe, Africa and CIS, the company said.
Drilling-related services improved in North America. Latin America, Mexico and Ecuador also showed more opportunities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are demanding much stricter environmental criteria when financing shipping companies as investor pressure grows on the sector to accelerate going greener, according to Boston Consulting Group (BCG).
Shipping, which transports about 90% of world trade, accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions and BCG forecast the industry will need $2.4 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
""ESG-driven requests are already prompting more action from banks. Shipping is already feeling it and they (shipping companies) are under pressure now,"" said Peter Jameson, partner with BCG, which are consultants for the COP26 UN climate summit that starts on Oct. 31.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) has already provided loans linked to sustainability targets for drilling group Odfjell and the shipping division of Oman's Asyad Group, the bank has said.
""When looking at lending on new assets, banks are going to create a bigger conduit for CO2 reductions through their policies,"" Jameson told Reuters.
""The banks are also seeing insurance companies feeling shareholder pressure and this is also causing big pension funds to reassess.""
Leading shipping financiers currently provide close to $300 billion of lending to the industry annually, analysts estimate.
Of the $2.4 trillion that BCG estimates will be needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, Jameson said $500 billion would be required between now and 2030 with the remaining $1.9 trillion between 2030-2050.
The bulk of the total amount – around $1.7 trillion – would go towards developing future fuels.
""Funding sources are already becoming available, yet plenty more are still required,"" Jameson said.
ESG-related assets under management are estimated to represent up to 80% of total lending to shipping by 2030, BCG said.

UN shipping agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has said it aims to reduce overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050, but industry groups are calling for more progress from governments.
""The risks to balance sheets will start to force more questions being asked to the IMO,"" said Ulrik Sanders, managing director at BCG, adding that this would ""prompt more action towards decarbonisation"".

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, reassured by signs that companies are continuing to earn money despite much-heralded problems with supply chain disruptions and higher input prices. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT),. the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 100 points, or 0.3%, at 35,358 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Many analysts remain upbeat due to evidence of strength in global demand as much of the world starts to put the pandemic behind it.
""Notable production outages are already improving, including COVID-19-related disruptions to chip production in Southeast Asia and weather-related interruptions to petrochemical plants in the Gulf of Mexico,"" UBS  Global Wealth Management's chief investment officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note to clients. Haefele said he expects only ""a modest drag of 1% to our S&P 500 earnings per share growth forecast of 45% this year.""
Earlier, the market had had to shrug off signs of a slowdown in a U.S. housing market that has run hot for most of the last 18 months. Building permits fell by more than expected to their lowest in 11 months, while housing starts also fell short of expectations.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock was one that benefited from dispelling doubt about its outlook, rising 1.1% after the company raised its guidance for the year a little and upheld its forecasts for sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, which was dogged by various problems in the time around its authorization from regulators. Insurance giant Travelers also impressed with its quarterly update, as strong investment returns helped to offset a sharp rise in catastrophe losses, caused chiefly by Hurrican Ida. Travelers (NYSE:TRV) stock rose 2.2%. 
Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) stock rose 1.9% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reassured its clients that the retailer's profit outlook was healthy, arguing that some of the consumer spending patterns that have supported its earnings during the pandemic are likely to have real staying power.
Another stock making conspicuous gains in early trading was  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), which rose 4.2% after announcing a deal to provide custody services to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s new digital wallet project, Novi. The ongoing rally in crypto currencies, as the U.S.'s first exchange-traded fund for Bitcoin futures started trading, also supported Coinbase stock.
Merck stock rose 1.9% after reports that the UN-backed World Health Organization is planning to buy its antiviral Covid-19 pill for distribution among poorer countries, once it's approved by regulators. 
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) rose 3.3% after the Chinese e-commerce giant said it is developing a new generation of powerful datacenter chips, known as the Yitian 710. "
30,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 09:42AM ET</span>",East European designers sashay onto the catwalks of high fashion,"By Michael Kahn and Silvia Recchimuzzi
PRAGUE/GDANSK (Reuters) - With celebrities such as Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Billie Eilish wearing its designs, Hungarian fashion house Nanushka has stardust many designers can only dream of.
Yet the company is just one of a number of upstart designers from central Europe elbowing their way to the top of global fashion, showcasing their collections on the catwalks of London, Paris and New York as they target lucrative markets such as China and the United States.
Once a struggling local brand, Budapest-based Nanushka has seen annual revenue grow 33-fold to 33 million euros ($38.32 million) since a private equity firm came aboard in 2016. 
Focusing on sustainable designs including its vegan leather apparel, Nanushka has become Europe's fastest-growing fashion company, according to the annual FT 1000 list of Europe's high-growth companies.
Other ready-to-wear designers that have emerged from central Europe onto the global scene include Slovakia-based Nehera, worn by Hollywood stars Keira Knightley, Tilda Swinton and Marion Cotillard, and Poland's Magda Butrym, sported by Megan Fox and Hailey Bieber among others.
For these firms, creating a niche in high fashion has been facilitated by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram and other online platforms which help young, independent designers outside of international fashion centres to be seen by a global audience hungry for something different. 
""Without social media probably you know 15-20 years ago it would have been almost impossible to build a global fashion house from Budapest,"" Nanushka's Chief Executive Peter Baldaszti - married to founder and designer Sandra Sandor - told Reuters.
The brand - which opened a New York store in 2019 and another in London in 2020 despite the pandemic - counts the United States as its biggest market but says China is the future. Parent company Vanguards Fashion Group, of which Baldaszti is also CEO, also snapped up Italian fashion brand Sunnei for $7 million in 2020 as part of a strategy to build a fashion portfolio across Europe.  
Central Europe boasts a long tradition of craftsmanship in the textile industry dating back to the First Republic era between the two World Wars when the region was an epicentre of culture and design. 
Following the fall of Communism in 1989, Western luxury brands and fashion houses set up shop to produce bags, scarves and clothes in the region, capitalizing on the proximity to west European markets, lower costs and a skilled workforce.
Now local luxury brands in those markets are moving in the other direction to tap into a global luxury goods sector pegged to grow to around $383 billion in 2025 from $309 billion this year, helped by demand in China and among Millenials, according to Hamburg-based database company Statista.
""We started with showing in Paris ... but Instagram is something that really opened the door for brands from countries that are not really on the fashion map at all,"" Polish handbag-maker Chylak founder Zofia Chylak told Reuters. 
A Chylak handbag, made of Italian leather, costs around 200-250 euros and the brand's popularity among some Polish influencers living abroad has helped it become a global name.
DESIRE FOR AUTHENTICITY
Bratislava-based Nehera – named after Czech businessman Jan Nehera who in the 1930s was first in the world to pioneer ready-to-wear clothing - presented its 2022 spring collection in Paris and plans to return to New York after pulling back during the pandemic. 
“We are aiming to re-enter the U.S. and European markets,"" Ladislav Zdut, founder of the brand which last month opened a showroom in Milan and is in early talks with local investors to help fuel expansion plans, told Reuters. 
“But we significantly increased orders to South Korea and China and were growing during the pandemic.”
A young generation of designers from smaller countries - many of whom worked or studied abroad - have also accumulated the contacts and knowledge to serve an international luxury market, said Achim Berg, global leader of McKinsey's apparel and fashion group.
""The big luxury brands are dominating the trends in the market but there is a desire for new brands for curation and authenticity,"" he told Reuters.
Scandinavian brands such as Acne Studios, Ganni and Toteme show how firms from a small region outside the fashion capitals can establish themselves, according to Berg.
In central Europe, rising incomes have also created a stable local customer base able to afford luxury items that help fledgling designers establish themselves before looking abroad, designers and companies say.
Poland's Magda Butrym embraced the local-first approach when starting up in 2014 before going global, Chief Executive Jakub Czarnota told Reuters.
Lady Gaga was seen wearing a short, polka dot Magda Butrym dress in one recent Instagram post and the brand, also favoured by social media influencers, is now present in 40 markets. Asia and the Middle East offer strong growth opportunities going forward but the company will continue to scour its regional roots to create something different, Czarnota said.
""Global consumers are eager to discover newness and this gives brands an opportunity.  

""Eastern European designers can look for inspiration to their regional culture and heritage and translate them into distinct products and collections,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Israeli startup AIR on Tuesday unveiled its first ""easy-to-operate"" electric, vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that it aims to sell directly to consumers predominantly in the United States starting in 2024.
AIR has been working with the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) for two years and expects to obtain certification by the end of 2023 for the AIR ONE, a two-seater, 970 kg (2,138 lb) eVTOL, which will have a flight range of 110 miles (177 km), Chief Executive Rani Plaut told Reuters. 
AIR raised seed funding of under $10 million last year and has been running unmanned tests of its vehicle. It is building prototype models and expects to sell its eVTOLs for around the same price as an expensive car, Plaut said, without providing more precise details. 
An increasing number of investors and aviation companies have piled into the hot but yet-to-be-approved urban air mobility space and the number of eVTOL startups has proliferated.
Air taxi firm Joby Aviation has gone public via a merger with a blank-check company and Vertical Aerospace - which has pre-orders for up to 1,000 eVTOL aircraft with launch customers Avolon and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) - is going public via a merger with Broadstone Acquisition Corp.
Plaut said the difference with AIR is that it will be sold to consumers who can use its ""fly by intent"" software to fly without being fully trained pilots.
""Our focus is entirely personal,"" he said. ""We're not talking about commercial flights, we're talking about people using this as they use cars."" 

The United States has a lot of open airspace that makes it a suitable first market for the AIR ONE. Plaut said AIR expects demand could reach 15,000 vehicles a year. 
AIR is currently raising additional funds to get through the FAA certification process, but did not disclose how much.

(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL)'s NetSuite on Tuesday said it will put automated banking features into its accounting software for businesses, with  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) as its first partner to automatically send and receive money and reconcile accounts.
Oracle NetSuite sells cloud-based software to mid-sized businesses to track their financials. But many core functions, like wiring money to pay a bill or reconciling billing records with bank statements to see how much cash is available for use at any given time, still requires humans to push buttons and key in data.
Oracle NetSuite on Tuesday said it has used artificial intelligence and partnerships with banks to automate those processes. When a bill or an employee expense report comes in, the software can read it, file it appropriately and have money wired.
Evan Goldberg, executive vice president of Oracle NetSuite, said the goal of the new system is to help businesses get a more accurate daily picture of their cash position and free up staff in finance departments to work on more important things like planning and analysis.
""Labor is at a premium,"" Goldberg told Reuters in an interview. ""You want your people not working on manual data entry, but working on stuff that's actually going to add strategic value to the business.""

The Oracle NetSuite system requires integration with banks, which have also been working to use technology to make business transactions more efficient. Oracle NetSuite said it aims to integrate with most major banks and that its first partner is HSBC.
In a statement, Barry O’Byrne, chief executive officer for global commercial banking at HSBC, said partnerships like the one with Oracle NetSuite are ""central to our strategy of supporting our clients’ growth across all regions, from Asia to the Americas. We envisage this to be the first alliance of many.”

At one time, Ericsson was expecting big orders from Chinese carriers for deploying 5G networks, but with the acrimony showing no signs of abating it warned in July of a hit to its sales.
The warning came true as China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) awarded it a contract significantly smaller than previous ones. As a result, the company closed the third quarter with China’s contribution to its net sales halving to 5% from a year ago.
China sales declined by 3.6 billion Swedish crowns and the company told Reuters it plans to resize its sales and delivery framework in the country.
Strong sales in the U.S. helped the company absorb the damage in China. The company won 5G contracts from the three telecom firms there -- Verizon (NYSE:VZ), AT&T and T-Mobile -- and that kept the decline in sales at 2% to 56.3 billion Swedish crowns ($6.53 billion).
Net profit was 4% higher at 5.8 billion SEK."

Ma, who has largely been out of public view since a speech last year in which he publicly criticized China's regulatory system, is in Spain for a study tour on agriculture and technology related to environmental issues, the report said, citing a source familiar with Ma's schedule.
He was in Hong Kong spending ""private time"" with this family before flying to Europe, according to SCMP, which is owned by Alibaba.
Alibaba was not immediately available for a comment.

Ma, a globe-trotter not known to shy away from the limelight, retired as Alibaba's chairman in 2019.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the merger could hamper competition in markets that assess prices of biofuels, coal, oil, and petrochemicals in the UK, but added it could allow the deal if its concerns were addressed. 
""After a thorough investigation... we've found that the deal raises competition concerns in only a handful of markets involving the supply of certain commodity price assessments in the UK,"" CMA Senior Director Colin Raftery said. 
IHS and S&P have five working days to propose remedies in order to avoid facing an in-depth Phase 2 probe by the CMA.
IHS Markit said it had discussed the sale of its Oil Price Information Services, Coal, Metals and Mining, and PetroChem Wire businesses to News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), as well as the divestiture of its base chemicals business, to address the regulators' concerns. 

IHS and S&P will now formally submit the proposals to the CMA.
The IHS Markit-S&P deal, announced last November, is aimed at creating a data powerhouse, as companies in the financial information services sector race to create a one-stop shop to lure the biggest clients and invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - FS Investments, an alternative asset manager that invests roughly $25 billion, said it has hired Troy Gayeski, the former co-chief investment officer at Anthony Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital, as its chief market strategist.
Gayeski joins FS Investments as low interest rates force investors to search for new ways to make money in their fixed income portfolios, prompting moves into private credit and real estate investments, for example.
At FS Investments, Gayeski will work with chief investment officer Mike Kelly, Robert Hoffman, who heads research, and chief U.S. economist Lara Rhame. His position is a new one.
""I look forward to benefiting from (Gayeski's) insight, expertise and strong industry relationships as we continue to grow our business and work to deliver innovative new solutions to our clients and investors,"" Michael Forman, FS Investments' chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
The firm, founded as Franklin Square Capital Partners in 2007, concentrates on giving retail investors access to alternatives including business development companies (BDCs) that loan money to smaller companies at a time other lenders pulled back from making these types of loans.
BDCs, like Real Estate Investment Trusts, create an income stream that has become very popular with investors in the current low-rate environment. FS Investments teamed up with venture firm KKR to form FS KKR Capital (NYSE:FSK) Corp.
Gayeski left Scaramucci's $6.5 billion SkyBridge, where he had worked for over a decade, over the summer. Still he played a key role at Scaramucci's marquee Wall Street conference when it returned in person to New York's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center last month and Gayeski hosted one of the conference's first panels.

CAIRO/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) says it has shut down two large networks targeting users in Sudan in recent months, as civilian and military leaders spar with one another over the future of an interim power-sharing arrangement.
The battle for public opinion, much of it happening online, is intensifying as Sudan reels from economic crisis and a shaky transition to democracy following 30 years under President Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted in a popular uprising in 2019.
Facebook said one of the networks of inauthentic pages it took down was linked to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the other was populated with people who researchers, hired by the civilian government, flagged as supporters of Bashir agitating for a military takeover.
This week, hundreds of protesters set up camp outside the presidential palace demanding that the military overhaul the cabinet, in what would effectively amount to a coup.
Earlier this month, Facebook said it had shut a network of almost 1,000 accounts and pages with 1.1 million followers run by people the company said were linked to the RSF.
    The network boosted RSF official media feeds and other content related to the militia, led by powerful General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo who is deputy head of the ruling Sovereign Council and seen by some Sudanese as harbouring political ambitions.
    Representatives for the RSF and Dagalo did not respond to requests for comment. The government had no comment on the RSF-related takedown. Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, denies he is out for personal empowerment and has said in the past that he is committed to the democratic transition to civilian rule.
    Facebook's director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, told Reuters the network was identified by the platform's own internal investigation.
    The company also said it removed a second network in June, after being tipped off by Valent Projects, an independent research firm hired by Sudan's Information Ministry to look into activity linked to Bashir loyalists.
Facebook said the network comprised more than 100 accounts and pages and had more than 1.8 million followers.
The Sudanese government's efforts to fight what it describes as ex-regime loyalists working to undermine the transition has not previously been reported.
    Loyalists were ""working systematically to tarnish the image of the government"", the ministry said in a statement to Reuters, referring to social media posts in the network identified by Valent.
    In both networks, posts mimicked news media but offered skewed coverage of political events, according to Facebook and some independent researchers.
Those Sudanese with internet access - estimated at about 30% of the 45 million population - depend heavily on social media for news.
    The military-civilian partnership that replaced now-jailed Bashir in 2019 has been pushed to breaking point in recent weeks in the aftermath of what authorities called a failed coup attempt.
    Civilian officials have accused both Bashir loyalists and the military of stirring up unrest, including in the east of the country where tribal protesters have been blocking shipping at Port Sudan, exacerbating shortages stemming from a long-running economic crisis.
Military leaders deny the accusations and say they are committed to the transition to democracy.
'AGITATION'
While Facebook says it uses technical signals on its platform to target groups working to mislead users about their identity, researchers like Valent Projects say they rely on analysis of content, noting for example when a single post is shared simultaneously by different accounts.
Valent Projects said the network it identified was more than three times larger than Facebook's assessment, attracting more than 6 million followers and continuing to grow.
    It was active as recently as this week, agitating for a military takeover as protesters gathered in central Khartoum, and last month in the aftermath of the coup attempt, said Valent Projects representatives.
""It looks like they were trying to give the impression of grassroots support for such a move,"" said founder and director Amil Khan.
When asked about the differing assessments, Facebook's Agranovich said the company was confident it had shut down the entire network and that other accounts Valent identified were not connected.
He said Facebook would continue to monitor for any revival of the network.
Some of the network's posts say Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is not a Muslim and accuse his staff of being paid in dollars, a charge they have denied.
Contributors promote the return of Bashir, jailed on corruption and other charges and wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of atrocities in the Darfur conflict. Bashir has denied all charges.
The network amplified calls for civil disobedience in the east, said Zouhir Al Shimale, Valent Projects' head of research.
    It also promoted protests ahead of the June 30 anniversary of the coup in which Bashir took power in 1989, according to the research firm.
    ""People in Sudan thought there was just going to be a massive demonstration because they saw so much activity,"" said Khan, citing a movement called Akhtona (""Get out of the way"") in local Arabic dialect. In the end some 3,500 people showed up.
    Contacted by Reuters, three administrators of pages that Facebook left running denied being part of a network.
    ""The ruling bodies today categorise any criticism of their oppressive policies and poor economic and political management as being related to the former regime,"" said one of them, who declined to be identified.
    The information ministry said it took no legal measures against the pages or administrators. ""The Sudanese government is committed to protecting freedom of expression,"" it said.
Two takedowns previously announced by Facebook, in December 2020 and May 2021, targeted accounts boosting Dagalo and the RSF, according to researchers at Stanford Internet Observatory and the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
    In both networks Facebook said it found links to the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), the officially defunct group accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections. 

    Anna Bogacheva, who the United States accused of carrying out IRA operations to interfere with elections and political processes, declined to answer questions about IRA when reached by phone.
    Agranovich said the most recently targeted network linked to the RSF did not reveal foreign links, and appeared part of a growing trend of domestic influence operations.

(Reuters) - Black people made record-breaking gains over the last year in securing seats on boards of S&P 500 companies, while women came close to accounting for a third of corporate directors, according to a report from executive search firm Spencer Stuart released on Tuesday.
Ethnic and racial minorities accounted for 47% of all new directors, compared to 22% in the prior year, according to the report. Nearly all of the increase came from the appointment of Black directors, who made up 33% of new board seats from May of 2020 through May of 2021, up from 11% in the prior period.
Julie Daum, who leads the North American board practice at Spencer Stuart, said there was a ""very conscious effort"" by corporate America to recruit African-American directors after the murder of George Floyd last spring and the Black Lives Matter movement.
Black Americans now account for 11% of board seats at S&P 500 companies, edging closer to their roughly 13% representation in the general U.S. population, the report found. 
Women now make up 30% of all S&P 500 directors, a key threshold that advocacy organizations including the Thirty Percent Coalition have called for. The figure is up from 28% a year earlier and 16% a decade ago, the report found.
""It took a long time to get there,"" Daum said. 
Spencer Stuart found that adding women directors fell from the third most important priority for boards to 10th, which Daum called ""discouraging."" 
""There is a feeling that we got there, so we don't have to focus on it,"" she said. 
The percentage of new directors who are women fell to 43% over the last year from 47%, according to the report.
Hispanics and Latinos accounted for 5% of corporate directors versus their 18.5% share of the U.S. population, the report found. 
Of new directors, Hispanics and Latinos made up 7%, an increase of 3% from the prior year. 
The report looked at S&P 500 boards over a one-year period ending in May 2021. Most of the new directors from racial and ethnic minorities were additions to boards, rather than replacements, Daum said. 
The retirement age for board directors continues to rise, according to the report.

Boards that set the mandatory retirement age for directors at 75 or over accounted for 51% of those with such policies, up from 48% the prior year.
About 70% of S&P 500 boards have a mandatory retirement policy, according to the report

The company’s cost inflation will accelerate to 9% in the second half from 7% in the first part of the year, Chief Financial Officer Juergen Esser said on a call with reporters. The stock fell as much as 2.3%.
“We expect 2022 at least at the same level as 2021, and maybe even higher,” Esser said. “We need to get prepared for more supply-chain disruptions and challenges.”
Shortages of transport containers and blocked-up ports have snarled logistics for companies around the world. The worldwide franchiser for the Ikea home-furnishings chain last week also predicted such issues to continue into next year. That poses yet another challenge for Danone, which named a new chief executive officer this year after activist shareholders criticized its underperformance.
While Danone initially focused price hikes on its dairy business because of a surge in milk costs, the company is now preparing increases for its bottled-water and specialized nutrition units as well, Esser said. The company also said it plans to rely more on efficiency measures.
Inflation has been highest in emerging markets like Mexico, Brazil and Russia, Esser said. Products will also become more expensive in the U.S. and in Europe, where Danone is currently in talks with retailers. 
The company said its plant-based business, which makes products like soy milk and almond coffee creamer, was hampered by logistics disruptions. Spot rates for trucks in the U.S. are at record levels, though capacity may improve through the first quarter of next year, Esser said. 
Its dairy business has also been faced with cardboard shortages around the world. Costs of plastic packaging is rising by a high double-digit percentage, Esser told analysts.  
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Danone’s new CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique faces the challenging task of improving underlying performance, as the company has struggled to consistently increase both prices and volume simultaneously since 2015, which is why we believe greater innovation is key as inflationary pressure rages. Without that, consumers could reject further price hikes and switch to other brands.
-- Duncan Fox, BI consumer-goods analyst
“Managing the full supply of packaging at the moment is not a walk in the park,” Esser said. 
Danone’s sales climbed 3.8% on a like-for-like basis in the third quarter as pricing offset a drop in shipments. Analysts expected a 3.6% gain.

Investing.com – Procter & Gamble stock (NYSE:PG) traded 2% weaker in Tuesday’s premarket as the company repeated its annual profit forecast while warning of higher commodity and transportation expenses.
The maker of Ariel detergents and Gillette razors is expecting commodity and freight costs in the current financial year to take $2.3 billion off its bottom line. 
Higher prices of farm and non-farm commodities, metals and crude oil has meant more expensive raw materials for producers. Pricier crude not only raises transportation costs but it also means dearer chemicals that go into making P&G’s cleaning agents, plastics, packaging and other derivatives.
P&G expects 2022 all-in sales as well as organic sales growth of 3% at the midpoint of its guidance range.
Net sales in the first quarter rose 5% to $20.3 billion. Organic sales were higher by 4%, driven by a 2% increase in volumes, P&G Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said. Price hikes helped to the extent of 1%. CFO Andre Schulten told the Wall Street Journal that he expects to pass more price rises on to customers in the coming weeks. 
Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.61. Both sales and profit were higher than estimates.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -SoftBank Group-backed Indian ride-hailing firm Ola is set to lose two top executives, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, ahead of a potential $1 billion initial public offering. 
Chief Financial Officer Swayam Saurabh and Chief Operating Officer Gaurav Porwal are leaving the company, according to the memo sent to employees by Chief Executive Officer Bhavish Aggarwal. 
Ola did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Aggarwal in the memo also announced several management changes across its mobility, vehicle commerce, and delivery and financial services units.
Saurabh, a former CFO of Hindustan Zinc, has been with Ola for seven months while Porwal, who has run the mobility business over the last year, joined the company in 2019.
Porwal will be leaving Ola to ""pursue other interests"", while Saurabh will be pursuing other opportunities, according to the memo.
Moneycontrol first reported about Ola's management changes on Tuesday.
Ola plans to raise up to $1 billion through an initial public offering in the next few months, according to recent media reports.

Founded in 2010, Ola also counts private equity firms Temasek and Warburg Pincus among its investors and competes with U.S.-listed Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) for a share of India's ride-hailing market. The firm has since expanded into offering cars on lease and into the electric-vehicle space in the country.
Ola's electric vehicle business earlier this year launched a scooter and has charted out plans to produce kick scooters, e-bikes, drones and even flying cars. The unit raised more than $200 million at a valuation of $3 billion in September.

The brokerage trimmed its iPhone revenue estimate to $63 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which would be a yearly fall of nearly 4%, analyst Samik Chatterjee said in a note to clients. 
Last week, Needham said it expected iPhone 13 shipments to total 80 million units in the first quarter and cut its estimates for the holiday quarter by 10 million units citing supply chain issues including the chip shortage.
For the fourth quarter, JPM expects iPhones to bring in revenue of $46 billion after selling 58 million units, marginally higher than Wall Street's forecast of $41 billion.
According to Refinitiv IBES, analysts are expecting about 45 million units for the holiday quarter and 79.4 million units in the first quarter.
While Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies due to its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors, supply chain bottlenecks and lockdown in countries like Vietnam in the second half of the year are hampering its production timelines.
Bloomberg News reported last week that the Cupertino, California-based company is likely to slash production of its iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units due to the global chip shortage.
Customers wanting an iPhone 13 are already having their patience tested with one of the longest wait times for the phone in recent years, analysts said.
""We continue to see strong demand for iPhone 13 and 5G iPhone SE relative to low investor expectations to act as a catalyst, the timing of realization of which, although delayed on account of supply headwinds, is unchanged in magnitude,"" Chatterjee said.

However, Apple said on Monday that its two new MacBook Pro models, that run on more powerful in-house chips, and new AirPods 3, will start shipping next week.
Apple's announcement of hardware innovations for the holiday season despite the chip shortage showed the company was flexing its supply chain muscles, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's No. 2 bank UniCredit has invited expressions of interest from investors for its leasing business to gauge market appetite for the unit as it weighs a potential sale, two people close to the matter said.
One of the sources said UniCredit aimed to gather investors' valuations for the unit and its portfolio of assets, but no decision on the sale had yet been taken and it may not happen. 
A representative for UniCredit declined to comment. 
Based on data by industry association Assilea, UniCredit Leasing ranked sixth in Italy in 2020 with 3,833 new contracts signed for 801.7 million euros ($932 million). 
The biggest leasing company in Italy in terms of outstanding contracts, according to Assilea, UniCredit Leasing has a market share of around 7%. 
The unit, which relies on the group's branches to distribute its products, has around 10 billion euros in credits on its books, of which around 1 billion euros are non performing - or 0.5 billion euros net of writedowns.
UniCredit had looked in the past at a possible sale of the leasing business, which reported a profit of around 20 million euros for the first half of 2021.
Analysts estimate between 800 and 900 million euros of UniCredit's capital could be allocated to the leasing unit, calculating a return on equity of around 5% for the business.
UniCredit is working on a new business plan expected in November under new CEO Andrea Orcel, who took over in April.
The former head of investment banking at UBS, Orcel has pledged to boost revenues and profits after his predecessor focused mainly on cutting risks.

Under previous CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, UniCredit cleaned up its balance sheet and replenished its capital reserves, selling nearly 15 billion euros in assets during the French banker's four-year tenure. 
Progress on the new plan has been held back by protracted talks with Italy's Treasury to buy ""selected parts"" of ailing state-owned rival Monte dei Paschi di Siena.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson stock (NYSE:JNJ) rose 1% in Tuesday’s premarket as the company nudged up its annual profit forecast while keeping its outlook for Covid vaccine sales for the year unchanged.
The company now sees its annual adjusted earnings to be around $9.79 per share, up some 1.4% from a prior estimate of $9.65 at center of the guidance range.
J&J in July said it expects to produce between 500 million and 600 million doses of its one-shot vaccine this year, pretty much half of its previous target of making a billion. Production and quality issues at a manufacturing site set the company back in rolling out its Covid vaccines faster.
The forecast revision follows third-quarter results that saw the consumer and pharmaceutical giant beat estimates for profit but fall short on sales.
Sales in the pharmaceuticals business, which contribute more than half of the company’s revenue, rose the most, by 14% on an adjusted basis. Medications against cancer, hypertension, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis were in demand.
Sales in the consumer health business grew 5.7%. Over-the-counter products like Tylenol and another analgesic Motrin as well as Aveeno skin and beauty care products all gained.
General surgery, surgical vision products and contact lenses in vision and hip and knee implants took sales of medical devices higher by 7.6% as people tended to ailments they had kept in abeyance during the pandemic.

The company reported pre-tax net investment income of $771 million, up 15% from last year. Low interest rates and hot capital markets in the U.S. helped the insurer yield higher returns from its non-fixed income investments, which offset a weak performance from its fixed-income investments.
Flash flooding and heavy rains due to Ida in late August caused damage to property and disrupted businesses. These losses are expected to take a big chunk out of insurers' earnings, with catastrophe-risk modeling firm Risk Management Solutions Inc estimating U.S. insurers could lose between $31 billion and $44 billion. (https:// Travelers' catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, came in at $501 million, compared to $397 million a year earlier.  
The company reported a combined ratio of 98.6% for the quarter, compared with 94.9% a year earlier. A ratio below 100% means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims. Total revenues rose 6% to $8.81 billion.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>",Russia to go after Google this month with fine of up to 20% of annual turnover,"By Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it would this month seek to fine U.S. tech giant Google a percentage of its annual Russian turnover for repeatedly failing to delete content deemed illegal, Moscow's strongest effort yet to rein in foreign tech firms. 
Communications regulator Roskomnadzor said Google had failed to pay 32.5 million roubles ($458,100) in penalties levied so far this year and that it would now seek a fine of 5-20% of Google's Russian turnover, which could reach as much as $240 million, a significant increase. 
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Russia has ramped up pressure on foreign tech companies as it seeks to assert greater control over the internet in the country, slowing down the speed of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) since March and routinely fining others for content violations.
Opposition activists have accused Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of caving to Kremlin pressure after they removed an anti-government tactical voting app from their stores.
Roskomnadzor earlier in October said it would ask a court to impose a turnover fine on social media firm Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), citing legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin in December 2020.
""A similar case will be put together in October against Google,"" Roskomnadzor said in emailed comments to Reuters on Tuesday, noting that the company also owned video-hosting site YouTube.
The SPARK business database showed that Google's turnover in Russia in 2020 was 85.5 billion roubles. A 5-20% fine would amount to between 4.3 and 17.1 billion roubles. 

Google is currently fighting a court ruling demanding it unblock the YouTube account of a sanctioned Russian businessman or face a compounding fine on its overall turnover that would double every week and force Google out of business within months if paid.

Investing.com – Walmart stock (NYSE:WMT) traded 1.7% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to a ‘conviction buy’ with a target of $196.
Analyst Kate McShane’s new target for Walmart is over 38% higher than the stock’s Monday close of $141.68.
The analyst said the retailer was one of the strongest stories at the Goldman Sachs 28th annual retail conference in September. She attributed this to the company's improving ability to grow EBIT along with continued investments, which will likely bear fruit over the coming year.
Walmart has ridden a wave of hyper-stimulated consumer demand thanks to generous fiscal subsidies for consumers and rock-bottom interest rates, that have spurred both hoarding of basics and bigger-ticket household goods at various times during the pandemic.
While the pandemic-fueled shopping has cooled somewhat, some new consumer habits have stuck and purchases of certain items continue to be elevated. "
59,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>","Tesla quarter may hinge on China factory, supply chain costs","By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors will be closely watching Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s quarterly results on Wednesday for indications of its performance in China, where the electric carmaker has posted robust sales in the face of negative publicity and a host of new domestic competitors.
The company headed by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is expected to report a jump in revenue driven by record global deliveries in the July to September period. 
While it has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals, some investors are concerned supply-chain issues could increase costs and weigh down margins.
The upside could come from Tesla's Shanghai factory, which has surpassed the company's factory in Fremont, California in terms of production, and has cut costs with the use of more Chinese parts including batteries.
Tesla Inc started deliveries in late August of a less expensive version of the Model Y sport utility vehicle equipped with cheaper, iron-based batteries made by CATL in China, a source familiar with the matter said. 
""The Giga China efficiency is front and center, moving margins higher,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush who is bullish on Tesla. 
Tesla CEO Musk said the Shanghai factory now produced more vehicles than the company's sole U.S. factory. 
""It's the best quality, lowest cost and also low drama, so it's great,"" said he at a shareholders' meeting earlier this month.
Even so, Tesla was not immune to global supply chain crisis and Tesla has done better partly because it has been willing to pay.
""The sheer amount of money we're spending on flying parts around the world is just not great but hopefully temporary,"" Musk said. 
Some investors want to see how those costs add up.
""I think that there is probably a headwind to margins. They're paying more for components,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, an investor in Tesla. 
""I think that would be a huge positive if they can raise auto gross margin in this environment."" 
While Tesla has raised prices in the United States to offset cost pressure, it has cut them in China where it faces more competition from Chinese rivals such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Li Auto Inc and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) Inc. 
Tesla had received strong backing from the Chinese government when it built China’s first wholly foreign-owned car plant in 2019. But in recent months it has grappled with regulatory scrutiny over how it handles data as well as consumer complaints over product safety and other issues. 
Tesla's China sales leapt 44% in the third quarter, from the previous quarter, as it boosted exports to Europe and other countries, and it introduced the more affordable Model Y SUVs. 
""It seems the negative news did not really hurt loyal demand. Consumers have very high confidence in Tesla's product,"" Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said. 
""Other local competitors are really catching up very quickly, Tesla is still leading the charge,"" he said.
Investors will also keep an eye on the planned expansion of Tesla's so-called full self-driving beta software. Tesla started widening access to the software earlier this month, having tested the new advanced driver-assistant program with about 2,000 people for a year. 
Tesla's shares on Monday ended up 3.2% at $870.11, inching closer to its record close-high of $883.09 reached on Jan. 26.

Unlike most of his peers at the top of big tech companies, Musk said during a call in July that he was unlikely to attend earnings calls with investors and analysts. 
The calls have been a colorful quarterly ritual Musk has used for discourses on Tesla technology, or to fire back at analysts, the government and critics.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 0.4% up in Tuesday’s premarket session a day after the company unveiled two high-end MacBook Pro laptops powered by its next-generation silicon chip.
The laptops use Apple’s new in-house ‘M1 Pro’ and ‘M1 Max’ processors, which promise to be 70% faster and more efficient than its previous M1 chip.
Intel, which counted Apple as its biggest customer for long, traded slightly weaker premarket. With Apple putting its own chips in high-end laptops as well, the separation from Intel has widened.
M1 Max's graphics performance is four times faster than that of the M1 chip, the iPhone-maker claimed, while the M1 Pro's is twice as fast. It’s also much faster than earlier Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips.
Apple has been designing its own processors for its devices for the past decade, an exercise, allowing it to put those chips in more models and devices.

""Japan is a new love of ours,"" he said.
Kelly expects a mild correction in equity markets from now until the end of the year, with the first half of 2022 being tough for all asset classes.
A ""confluence of headwinds,"" including supply chain bottlenecks, growing energy shortage, and wage price spirals aided by central banks' monetary policies, have begun creating a circle of ""wagon trains around markets,"" Kelly said.
PineBridge, which manages $133 billion in assets, is adjusting its portfolio from ""early recovery, early cyclical beneficiaries ... towards a balance between some more sustainable growth allocations,"" he said.
Preparing for a ""slower, choppier flatness"" as growth peaks and central banks begin withdrawing stimulus, Kelly said: ""We're still early enough with this in pent-up returns potential.""
Kelly was bullish on China despite the uncertainties caused by its recent regulatory changes, as it focuses on domestic consumption as well as foreign trade, specifically building up sectors essential to plug the deficits in global supply chains.
""They're going to make the environment very conducive for investors who align themselves with those policies,"" he said.

""If you're comfortable sharpshooting within China ... there's no reason to step back, they're not going back to a planned economy.""

62,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 04:47AM ET</span>",Five U.S. lawmakers accuse Amazon of possibly lying to Congress following Reuters report,"By Steve Stecklow, Aditya Kalra and Jeffrey Dastin
LONDON (Reuters) - Five members of the U.S. House Judiciary committee wrote to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief executive Sunday, and accused the company's top executives, including founder Jeff Bezos, of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices.
The letter also states that the committee is considering ""whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate.""
Addressed to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, the letter followed a Reuters investigation last week that showed that the company had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands - practices Amazon has denied engaging in. Jassy, a longtime Amazon executive, succeeded Bezos in July.
The letter states that ""credible reporting"" in the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets ""directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.""
""At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon's representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law,"" the letter https:// states.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson issued a statement that said: ""Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.""
It added: ""As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer's policy that we're aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action.""
Since 2019, the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating competition in digital markets, including how Amazon uses proprietary seller data from its platform, and whether the company unfairly favors its own products.
In sworn testimony before the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee last year, Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to benefit its own private-label product lines. In another hearing in 2019, Nate Sutton, Amazon's associate general counsel, testified that the company does not use such data to create its own branded products or alter its search results to benefit them.
Asked during the 2019 congressional hearing whether Amazon alters algorithms to direct consumers to its own goods, Sutton replied: ""The algorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.""
The lawmakers' letter gives Jassy ""a final opportunity"" to provide evidence to corroborate the company's prior testimony and statements. It also notes that ""it is criminally illegal to knowingly and willfully make statements that are materially false, conceal a material fact, or otherwise provide false documentation in response to a congressional investigation.""
It gives the CEO until Nov. 1 to provide a sworn response to clarify ""how Amazon uses non-public individual seller data to develop and market its own line of products"" and how Amazon's search rankings favor those products.
It also requests copies of all documents mentioned in the Oct. 13 Reuters investigation.
""We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,"" the letter states.
The Reuters probe was based on thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents – including emails, strategy papers and business plans. They showed that, at least in India, Amazon had a formal, clandestine policy of manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods – and that at least two senior company executives had reviewed it.
In response to the Reuters report, Amazon said, ""We believe these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated."" The company did not elaborate. The company said the way it displays search results doesn't favor private-brand products.
The lawmakers' letter also cites other recent stories in the Markup, the Wall Street Journal and the Capitol Forum about Amazon's private-brand products and use of seller data.
The letter's sharp wording ratchets up the rhetoric between Washington and Big Tech. Companies including Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google have been under growing scrutiny in Washington, Europe and other parts of the world, fueled by concerns among regulators, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are engaging in unfair practices that hurt other businesses.

The lawmakers' letter was signed by a bipartisan group, and included the judiciary committee's chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler, and four members of the antitrust subcommittee – its chair, Democrat David Cicilline, vice chair Pramila Jayapal and Republicans Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz.
On Wednesday, following publication of the Reuters investigation, U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of Amazon, called for breaking up the company. In India, a group representing millions of brick-and-mortar retailers urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to take action against Amazon.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Fast and furious,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao
It took two weeks for UK money markets to go from expecting no interest rate rises this year to betting on a cumulative 35 basis-point moves in November and December. But such bets are proliferating almost everywhere, rate-sensitive short-dated bond yields are rising and bond curves are flattening -- the U.S. 2-10 curve for instance has flattened 12 bps in a week.
Besides Britain, some are placing bets on a September 2022 Fed rate hike; a month ago, no move was predicted before 2023. Earlier on Tuesday, Australia's central bank was at pains -- again -- to stress it did not plan interest rate rises before 2024, yet that hasn't budge money markets from pricing a late-2022 move.
So, is it justified? Growth is clearly wobbling, especially in China where Q3 GDP slowed to 4.9% while Monday data showed U.S. industrial production shrank 1.3% month-on-month in September.
Inflation is less transitory than anticipated, yet raising rates probably won't fix the supply-side glitches that are driving up prices and curbing output.
Perhaps that's why bonds have not built on the recent moves, with yields lower today and the dollar slipping to three-week lows. That's cheered markets, especially on top of robust earnings so far in the Q3 season and equity futures are implying firmer New York and European sessions, following gains across Asia.
Another piece of good news -- Chinese developers Sunac and Kaisa made coupon payments, while Evergrande may also meet an onshore bond coupon due on Tuesday.
What's ahead today? A raft of Fed and ECB policymakers, another airing for Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and of course a slew of earnings, including from a FAANG -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

The roll-out of ""GetGo"" to the Tesco Express store at High Holborn follows a successful trial at a staff store on the retailer's headquarters campus at Welwyn Garden City, north of London, which has been in place since 2019, the firm said.
The High Holborn store has been cashless since it opened in 2018.
Customers with the Tesco.com app will be able to check-in to the store, pick up the groceries they need and walk straight out without visiting a checkout.
A combination of cameras and weight-sensors will establish what customers have picked up and charge them for products directly through the app when they leave the store.

Customers will receive a receipt on their phone within a few minutes of leaving the store. 
Tesco said it has partnered with Trigo to roll out the technology.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tata Sons' $2.4 billion purchase of debt-ridden, government-owned Air India will give the conglomerate immediate access to valuable flying rights and landing slots that will help it claw back market share from foreign rivals. 
But industry executives warn any success will be a long and complicated process that could cost it more than $1 billion and require fixing myriad problems, including its worn-out fleet, poor service and the lack of a charismatic leader.
Air India, with its maharajah mascot, was once renowned for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service championed by the airline's founder, JRD Tata, India's first commercial pilot.
But since the mid-2000s, its reputation has fallen as financial troubles mounted. It flew widebody planes with business class seats in poor repair and grounded some of its new Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 787 Dreamliners to use for spare parts. Customers faced many delays and staff and suppliers were not always paid on time, executives said. 
""If you don't have newer airplanes or airplanes that are reliable, no matter what you do, you are going to have a problem,"" said a veteran aviation industry executive who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. 
The ownership transfer from the government to Tata is expected to go through by the end of the year. The company will then have until summer 2022, when a post-COVID demand surge is expected, to fix the issues, the person added, estimating it would cost more than $1 billion to refurbish Air India's 141 planes and up to $300 million to retrain staff and improve operations and service. 
The figures do not include the purchase or lease of new aircraft.
Tata and Air India declined to comment.
POINT TO POINT
Air India's biggest competitive advantage is its ability to fly non-stop to destinations like the United States and Europe, where it enjoys lucrative landing rights. Foreign hub carriers such as Emirates and Etihad Airways can only compete with one-stop options.
Many industry experts predict that after the pandemic, non-stop flights will become even more popular, particularly with lucrative business travellers.
""I'm a big believer if a passenger has a choice their strong preference is to fly point to point,"" Robert Martin, chief executive of lessor BOC Aviation said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event last week. 
Foreign carriers dominated international traffic to and from India before the pandemic hit, with Air India holding a 19.3% share, including its low-cost arm Air India Express, in the final quarter of 2019, according to government statistics.
If an improved Air India can win back even 20% from other global carriers it would be a big boost to the bottom line, the industry executive said.
TAJ LEVELS OF SERVICE
Air India also needs a charismatic and experienced leader along the lines of JRD Tata or Richard Branson to help rebuild a service culture at the airline, experts said.
Tata's experience of building India's largest hospitality chain, with Taj hotels as the flag-bearer, could help with the staff and service, said Dilip Cherian, an image consultant. The company also owns the luxury car brand Jaguar as well as information technology firms, steel concerns and other businesses.
""The hospitality businesses will help them hugely in setting the image right. The Taj fits in very well with the kind of Air India culture of early years,"" Cherian said. 
Tata also owns majority stakes in Vistara, a premium joint venture with Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and AirAsia India, a low-cost carrier with AirAsia Group. Tata has benefited from its partners' expertise but neither venture is profitable. 
Having three airlines is likely to put Tata in a strong bargaining position with aircraft manufacturers, engine makers and lessors, as well as with suppliers, airport operators and fuel companies, analysts say. 
Air India had about $2.1 billion of unpaid bills, which the government took over before the airline's sale to Tata.

The carrier enjoys goodwill in the international market because of its legacy, said Anuj Trivedi, partner at law firm Link Legal, which assisted Air India on the deal. 
""It won't be easy and there will be challenges, but with Tata the hope is Air India will take off again,"" he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is planning to hire hundreds of staff to boost its advertising sales in Europe and elsewhere, as the music streaming service looks to increase revenue from customers who don't pay a monthly fee but make up the bulk of its user base.
""We are increasing our ads business marketing workforce by over 70% in Europe, Australia and Canada ... and that's off a pretty sizable base,"" Lee Brown, Spotify's head of advertising business, said in an interview.
""We're investing in our advertising business. As far as long-term strategy, I think gone are the days of advertising being less than 10% of our overall revenue.""
Spotify has also hired an ad industry executive with 25 years of international experience to lead international sales, Brown said, though he did not give a name.
The company, which earns income from paid subscriptions and by disseminating ads to non-paying users, saw its advertising business return to growth this year after being hit by the pandemic.
Of its 365 million monthly active users, 210 million are ad-supported, bringing in about 12% of its total revenue.
""An ad not only creates revenue for the firm, but it also lowers costs, as it leads to fewer songs being played and, in turn, modestly lower royalties to be paid,"" Morningstar analysts said.
A surge in podcast content - Spotify carried 2.9 million podcasts as of the second quarter, up nearly 12% from the previous three months - has helped boost ad revenue, as podcasts pull in more users and, being longer, allow more time for ads. 
The company is looking to add more tools for advertisers, and will make its podcast advertising and publishing platform Megaphone available in Germany, France, Spain and Italy.
Megaphone, bought by Spotify last year, offers tools for podcasters to create ads for their own programmes, for which they receive income, and to measure their reach. It currently hosts about a third of the top 200 shows on Spotify and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Spotify has been spending hundreds of millions to beef up its podcast business. Its competition with Apple has intensified after both launched paid subscription platforms for podcasters earlier this year.
The Swedish company is expected https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-pandora-lead-us-audio-listeners to overtake Apple in podcast listeners for the first time this year, according to research firm eMarketer.

72,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 12:52AM ET</span>","Megahit ""Squid Game"" puts focus squarely on Netflix's overseas growth","By Eva Mathews
(Reuters) - The success of the South Korean dystopian drama series ""Squid Game"" has led investors to bet on Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s plans to explore more international content to boost slowing subscriber growth.
With a 111 million-strong fan base in just 27 days after its release, the low-cost survival drama has become Netflix's biggest original show launch ever, underpinning its efforts to ramp up investments in overseas content. 
""We continue to view international expansion as a key driver of subscriber growth, particularly in less-penetrated, emerging markets,"" Guggenheim analysts said in a client note.
In the first half of the year, the streaming giant had reported its slowest pace of subscriber additions since 2013 due to the coronavirus-led break in production.
But, as ""Squid Game"" became an instant worldwide sensation after launching towards the end of the third quarter, analysts said actual global subscriber additions can topple estimates of 3.8 million and benefit the next three months too.
THE CONTEXT
Netflix has lost a lot of market share since the onset of the pandemic as newer, more exclusive platforms gained quick popularity from stay-at-home entertainment seekers.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+, for instance, is banking on the success of ""Ted Lasso"" and raised its share of the global streaming pie by 75% this year, according to research firm Parrot Analytics.
Netflix's most formidable challenger Disney+ sits on a base of 116 million paying subscribers in a short span of two years.
Meanwhile, AT&T-owned HBO Max raised its global subscribers forecast to between 70 million and 73 million by July, indicating the preference to stream content-on-demand is here to stay. 
For a graphic on Global streaming market share:
https://www.datawrapper.de/_/qwKJf/ 
International shows like ""Money Heist"", ""Lupin"" and ""The Crown"" have drawn cross-border fame and several Emmy award nominations, helping steady the overseas subscriber growth.
""The streaming wars, as they currently stand, are not a battle to unseat Netflix within viewers' homes, but rather to earn a place alongside the red giant,"" MoffettNathanson analysts said in a research note.
Bloomberg News reported https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-17/squid-game-season-2-series-worth-900-million-to-netflix-so-far?sref=y3YMCJ4e that ""Squid Games"" would add about $900 million to the company's value, citing internal documents.
FUNDAMENTALS
* Analysts estimate Netflix's third-quarter revenue to grow 16.14% to $7.48 billion when it reports results on Oct. 19

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese tech giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd said on Tuesday it has developed a processor that will be used to power servers in its data centers.
The development marks the latest foray into semiconductors for the company, mirroring moves from other global cloud computing players while also dovetailing with Chinese government's priorities to boost the nation's chip sector.
Developed by Alibaba's in-house semiconductor unit T-Head, the chip — the Yitian 710 — is based on architecture from UK-based Arm Ltd, and will not be available for commercial use outside of Alibaba.
Alibaba is the largest cloud computing provider in China by market share and the third-largest globally, according to research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT).
Its rivals in the sector have also released server chips of their own. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rely on their respective Kunpeng and Graviton chips to power their cloud computing infrastructure.
Alibaba also said it has a developed proprietary line of servers, called Panjiu, and added that it will make the source code for its Xuantie series of IP cores — based on the RISC-V open source architecture — available to the public. Alibaba unveiled the Xuantie in 2019.
China's government has long urged industry to invest in the domestic chip sector, which remains behind that of global counterparts. 

The country remains reliant on overseas companies for much of its advanced semiconductors, a vulnerability brought forth when U.S. sanctions against Huawei crippled that company's booming smartphone business.
In addition to Alibaba, search giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), phone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp, and a number of Chinese automotive and appliance companies have begun investing in chips.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia risks losing its advantage in the green energy revolution if its leaders don't promptly commit to cutting carbon emissions by 2050, the country's richest man, Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) founder Andrew Forrest said on Monday. 
Forrest, who grew Fortescue from a minnow to rival the world's biggest mining giants in less than two decades, has spearheaded his company's global green energy drive, signing deals from Brazil to Indonesia to Democratic Republic of Congo.
The company aims to build a 250 megawatt hydrogen electrolyser at Bell Bay in Tasmania -- 25 times the size of the biggest existing electrolysers in the world -- for less than A$1 billion ($740 million), Forrest said, putting a price on the project for the first time. 
Fortescue is ready to make a final investment decision this year, as promised, but is waiting for support from the state government before going ahead with the project.
While Forrest told Reuters that Australia is the best place to realise his green vision, the country's failure to commit to a policy to cut emissions is risking that advantage. 
""I would say 2050 neutrality is a certainty for Australia. If we support it by COP26 the dividend flow to regional Australia will be substantial. If we don't support it by COP26, the future will remain uncertain,"" Forrest said, referring to the COP 26 climate conference in Glasgow at the end of October.
""The renewable energy, green hydrogen, green ammonia, green electricity industry is very, very mobile,"" he said. 
""It is where the will is strongest - they will be the first to be developed."" 
Australia's energy policy is again in the spotlight as Prime Minister Scott Morrison prepares to attend the conference, where global leaders will meet to set further climate goals to follow on from the landmark 2015 Paris accord.
But Morrison is short on updated climate ambitions to bring to the table given his reliance on the junior partner in Australia's coalition government which said it would not be rushed into a decision on whether to support a target of net zero emissions by 2050.
The Nationals who represent coal and farming heartlands worry that stronger emissions targets will cost jobs. Coal is the country's second biggest export earner. 
But Forrest, speaking to Reuters from London, said that rural Australians were set to be the biggest winners in the move to green energy - if agreements are made in time.
""I have demonstrated investment into the regions despite the fact Australia is dragging the chain,"" Forrest told Reuters.
Fortescue is investigating the potential to convert top Australian fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot's Brisbane ammonia plant to use green hydrogen as a feedstock instead of natural gas, with an on-site electrolysis plant that will produce up to 50,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year.
The plant's future had been under threat due to soaring gas prices, however setting up a green hydrogen production site to feed the existing plant could save 400 jobs and create many more, Forrest said.

At the same time, the product from the plant will be cheaper for local farmers.
""So farmers in Australia long into the future can plan for the next season, or even for the next generation ... knowing that fertilisers are coming from a hydrogen molecule that is infinite,"" Forrest said.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 07:36PM ET</span>",Morrisons investors set to rubber stamp $10 billion CD&R takeover,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shareholders in supermarket group Morrisons are expected on Tuesday to approve a 7 billion pound ($9.6 billion) offer by U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), bringing the curtain down on Britain's most fiercely contested takeover this year.
CD&R, which has former Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, won an auction for Morrisons on Oct. 2, bidding a penny a share more than a consortium led by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) owned Fortress Investment Group.
Investor approval for the deal will conclude a six-month battle to buy Morrisons, Britain's fourth-biggest grocer and one of the country's biggest food producers.
It will end Morrisons' 54-year run as a publicly listed company and see the ultimate decisions on the group's future shift from its Bradford, northern England, base to the New York home of CD&R.
Morrisons, which started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda in annual revenue.
The battle for Morrisons has been the most high-profile amid a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets.
With the winning bid representing a hefty 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June, analysts expect little or no dissent.
To go through CD&R's offer needs the support of shareholders representing at least 75% in value of voting investors at the meeting, which is being held both physically and virtually.
CD&R has committed to retaining Morrisons' Bradford headquarters and its existing management team, led by CEO David Potts.
It has also said it will execute the supermarket chain's existing strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and maintain staff pay rates.
These commitments are not legally binding, however. 

If, as expected, shareholders approve the offer, CD&R could complete its takeover by the end of the month, making Morrisons the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity after a buyout of No. 3 player Asda, by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital, completed in February.

By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday released a report examining the frenzied trading in shares of retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), and other 'meme' stocks, in January, and recommended some areas for further regulatory consideration.
The report could have implications that affect where retail stock orders are executed and how that service is paid for, when brokers can restrict trading, and the amount of transparency around short sales.
Here are some key details from the GameStop saga: 
WHAT HAPPENED?
Shares of GameStop surged more than 1,600% in January as retail investors colluded in online forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets to try to bid up the heavily shorted stock and force hedge funds to unwind their bets against it, with the hope the short squeeze would drive the price even higher.
The extreme volatility in GameStop shares, along with other popular meme stocks, prompted the clearinghouse that guarantees trades before they are completed to raise the collateral from brokers to clear the trades.
That led several brokerages, including Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets, to temporarily restrict trading in the red-hot stocks, helping curb the rally, infuriating retail traders and rattling market confidence. Others, like  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, adjusted margin requirements and limited advanced options strategies on the affected stocks.
WHY THE SURGE IN RETAIL TRADING?
In late 2019, large retail brokers like Schwab and Fidelity followed Robinhood's lead and eliminated trading commissions. 
Then, in early 2020, with COVID-19 lockdowns keeping people at home, major entertainment and sporting events canceled, and government stimulus checks sent to many U.S. households, retail trading levels soared.
While the main narrative around the GameStop frenzy was retail investors taking on big hedge funds, institutional investors were also major players in the buying and selling. 
WHO WAS HURT?
Hedge fund Melvin Capital required a $2.75 billion lifeline when it had to close out its short position in GameStop at a huge loss in January.
Anybody who bought GameStop shares at $482.95 on Jan. 28 and then sold them since would have lost money. 
GameStop shares are currently at $183.28, around 1,275% higher than they were a year ago.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE?
- Congress held several hearings on the GameStop episode;
- The SEC has asked for public comments on the effects of the ""gamification"" of trading apps and whether the public is at risk; 

- The main post-trade utility for U.S. stocks has recommended shortening the settlement cycle for stock trades to one day after the trade happens, from two days;
- Various companies and industry groups have made recommendations on improving transparency around the execution of retail orders.

LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, has thrown its weight behind a plan to provide free in-depth data on how thousands of companies are adapting to the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Ahead of the COP26 global climate talks in Glasgow, BlackRock said it backed a plan to scale up the Transition Pathway Initiative, an asset-owner project set up in 2017 that aims to assess companies' response to climate change.
The move comes as more global investors make their own pledges to net-zero carbon emissions across their portfolios - a commitment that requires in-depth analysis of the disparate climate plans of the companies in which they invest.
Under the plan, the number of companies assessed by the TIP will jump to 10,000 from 400, through the creation of a TPI Global Climate Transition Centre at London School of Economics and Political Science.
As well as the expanded coverage of global equity markets, the initiative will also cover corporate debt and government bonds.
""This TPI Centre will underpin the global climate transition directly empowering investors to take action and judge climate performance through the same lens,"" said TPI Chair Adam Matthews.
""It will be a critical component of the post Glasgow COP financial infrastructure enabling investors to deliver on their commitments.” said Matthews.

The inclusion of BlackRock takes the number of asset owners and managers backing the TPI to 110 with combined assets of $40 trillion.
""We consistently hear from investors around the world on the need for quality data to inform decision making, and so we are pleased to support TPI as it scales its analysis to provide valuable input,"" said Sandy Boss, global head of BlackRock Investment Stewardship.

""You're going to get a heavier slate of earnings reports this week from a diverse set of industries,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, adding, ""the path of least resistance remains higher going into earnings season for large-cap tech.""

Forecast-beating results from big U.S. lenders last week had set a positive tone for third-quarter earnings season, with analysts expecting S&P 500 earnings to show a 32% rise from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
The solid start likely helped investors shrug off uneasiness from earlier in the day after China recorded its slowest pace of economic growth in a year for the third quarter, hurt by power shortages and wobbles in the property sector. [MKTS/GLOB]
Other top contributors to the S&P's gains were Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc ahead of its earnings report this week, Amazon, which added 1% and chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp, which closed up 1.6%. 
While technology, closing up 0.9%, was the S&P's top index point boost, consumer discretionary was the biggest percentage gainer, climbing 1.2% and communications services followed with a 0.7% gain. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Netflix,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and oilfield services company Baker Hughes Co are also due to report quarterly results this week.
But while mega tech gainers were strong enough to boost the S&P and the Nasdaq, optimism was not widespread with four industry sectors closing in the red.
Of the S&P's 11 major sectors, seven closed higher. The biggest decliners were utilities, down 0.97%, and healthcare, down 0.7%. 
Shares of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co closed down 3% after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) downgraded the media giant's stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight.""
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.24-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 113 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.1 billion shares, compared with the 10.3 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Iberdrola said in a statement it would foot the bill for the East Anglia Hub site, whose soaring turbines will have capacity to generate 3.1 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 2.7 million homes.
Positioning turbines in the sea allows generators to capture high wind speeds free of any of the barriers present on land and is a key component in the decarbonisation plans of some of the world's biggest economies. 
The investment is contingent on Britain giving planning permission for the site, and contracts for difference, which guarantee a minimum price for the electricity it generates.
It adds to the 10 billion pounds Iberdrola has already pledged to invest in Britain between 2020 and 2025. 
Britain aims to have installed 40 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, up from its current 10.4 GW. Iberdrola trades in Britain through Scottish Power, which it bought in 2007.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian payments company Getnet Brasil, controlled by Spain's  Banco Santander  SA (NYSE:SAN), made its trading debut on the Sao Paulo stock exchange on Monday with a 7.3 billion reais ($1.32 billion) market value.
Santander spun off and listed Getnet Brasil, previously controlled by Banco Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil SA, in a bid to unlock additional value for its shareholders. Getnet is now part of Santander's global payments company PagoNxt.
Brazil's third-biggest card processor, Getnet reached a valuation close to the country's leading card processor,  Cielo SA  (OTC:CIOXY), which has a market capitalization of 7.1 billion reais. 
But its valuation lags those of more recent entrants StoneCo Ltd and PagSeguro Digital Ltd, which both trade in the United States.
The Brazilian lender acquired Getnet in 2014 to offer credit and debit card payments services to merchants. With a market share of 16% in Brazil, it posted revenues of 1.3 billion reais in the first half of the year and a net income of 188 million. reais.
Currently Getnet operates in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House committee will hold a hearing on Thursday with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on its efforts to reform airplane certification following two Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson will testify at a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing nearly three years after a Lion Air 610 737 MAX crashed in Indonesia. 
Congress in December approved legislation boosting FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections.
House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio said Monday that ""while the FAA continues to make progress on implementing this new law, more work must be done, particularly publishing a rule requiring aerospace manufacturers to adopt safety management systems.""
One issue is ensuring people performing aircraft certification tasks on behalf of the FAA do not feel undue pressure.
On Friday, the FAA issued two memos on its reform efforts. One directs FAA teams for Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) to assign FAA aviation safety personnel with appropriate expertise within 60 days to serve as advisors to the oversight offices for each company.
The other requires that FAA employees review for approval or rejection all new unit member selections to the oversight offices.
An FAA survey released in August 2020 found some safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
The law requires an independent review of Boeing’s safety culture. That review is still pending.

Acting FAA Associate Administrator for Safety Chris Rocheleau said a new agency office overseeing oversight efforts that opened this year ""is a key part of the FAA’s ability to provide comprehensive oversight of manufacturers and their products"". It also allows FAA ""to more quickly identify and address areas of concern and to make sure safety does not take a back seat to business objectives.""
DeFazio's panel in a 2020 report said the MAX crashes ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""

84,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",Factbox-Fun facts from the U.S. SEC report on January's GameStop saga,"By Michelle Price
(Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator released its long-awaited post-mortem into January's GameStop saga https://www.reuters.com/business/why-did-sec-release-report-gamestop-2021-10-18, in which retail traders banded together on social media and piled in to GameStop and other ""meme"" stocks in an attempt to punish hedge funds that had bet against the company, sending its shares soaring.
While the episode was explored in some detail during a congressional hearing https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/hedge-funds-robinhood-face-grilling-by-congress-over-gamestop-reddit-rally-2021-02-18 earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission report, published on Monday, offers some new details on what went down. Here are some takeaways: 
880,000 NEW ACCOUNTS STARTED TRADING GAMESTOP IN JANUARY
""GameStop had already started to receive attention on Reddit in 2019, including in discussions about short squeezes. That attention grew throughout 2020,"" the SEC said.
""Price increases, trading interest, and social media interest all accelerated in 2021."" 
By Jan. 27, the number of unique accounts trading GameStop on a given day had reached 900,000 compared with 10,000 at the beginning of the month, the SEC said. 
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ALSO DROVE THE RALLY
In addition to retail investors, institutional investors, including several hedge funds, also purchased shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
Some of those purchases may have been partly driven by hedge funds that had betted against GameStop, trying to cover their positions, and some of those funds made bad losses.
In contrast, some funds that were long GameStop cashed in. 
""Some investors that had been invested in the target stocks prior to the market events benefited unexpectedly from the price rises, while others, including quantitative and high-frequency hedge funds, joined the market rally to trade profitably,"" the SEC wrote. 
NO 'GAMMA SQUEEZE'
One theory for GameStop's meteoric rise was a so-called gamma squeeze, which happens when market makers purchase a stock to hedge the risk created by writing call options on that stock. That, in turn, puts even more upward pressure on the stock price. 
The SEC did find that GameStop options trading volume by retail investors increased substantially, but that was mostly driven by an increase in the buying of put, rather than call, options. The data also showed that market-makers were buying, rather than writing, call options. 
""These observations by themselves are not consistent with a gamma squeeze,"" the SEC wrote. 
NO NAKED SHORTING
The unusually large amount of short selling in GameStop sparked speculation of “naked” shorting - selling shares without arranging to borrow the underlying security.
When a naked short sale occurs, the seller fails to deliver the securities to the buyer. ""Based on the staff's review of the available data, (GameStop) did not experience persistent fails to deliver,"" the SEC said. 
IT WASN'T ALL ABOUT GAMESTOP

By early 2021, individual investors were increasingly downloading broker-dealer apps and more than 100 stocks experienced large price moves or increased trading volume that significantly exceeded the broader market, the SEC said. 
For example, single-day price changes on Jan. 27 from the closing prices on Jan. 26 for KOSS Corporation (480.0%), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc (301.2%), Naked Brand Group (252.3%) and Express Inc (214.1%) were larger than any single-day GameStop price change, according to the SEC.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock indexes mostly rose on Monday following gains in U.S. mega-cap technology and other growth names, while five-year Treasury yields rose to their highest levels since early 2020.
The dollar dipped after data showed production at U.S. factories fell by the most in seven months in September, erasing earlier gains.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was also slightly higher, reversing earlier losses following data showing China's gross domestic product grew 4.9% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, its weakest pace since the third quarter of 2020. 
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended up while the Dow edged lower. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500.
Facebook shares, under pressure recently, rose sharply with some positive reports out, including its plans to create 10,000 jobs in Europe to help build the so-called metaverse - an online world.
Investors awaited more third-quarter results from U.S. companies this week after a mostly upbeat start to the earnings season last week.
""You're going to get a heavier slate of earnings reports this week from a diverse set of industries,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, adding, ""the path of least resistance remains higher going into earnings season for large-cap tech.""
China's outlook as well as supply constraints related to the coronavirus pandemic have been issues for U.S. companies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.15 points, or 0.1%, to 35,258.61, the S&P 500 gained 15.09 points, or 0.34%, to 4,486.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 124.47 points, or 0.84%, to 15,021.81.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.50% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12%.
The dollar fell 0.02% to 93.95 against a basket of currencies. It had earlier reached 94.17 as U.S. Treasury yields increased.
Yields on five-year bonds rose as high as 1.193%, their highest since February 2020, extending a two-week rising streak. 
Yields on 30-year U.S. bonds were only slightly higher, flattening the gap between five-year and 30-year debt US5US30=RR to its narrowest level since early 2020.
Some market watchers are forecasting the Federal Reserve will need to increase interest rates sooner than previously expected to quell rising price pressures.
They say the U.S. central bank will need to move as inflation looks unlikely to fade anytime soon.
Bitcoin last fell 0.15% to $61,448.06.
Oil prices eased after touching multi-year highs.
Brent crude oil futures were down 62 cents or 0.7% at $82.26 a barrel after hitting $86.04, their highest since October 2018.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude were 12 cents higher, or 0.1%, at $82.40 a barrel, after hitting $83.87, their highest since October 2014.
U.S. gold futures gained 0.16% to $1,764.80 an ounce.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 06:04PM ET</span>",Apple doubles down on chip strategy with new premium-priced MacBooks,"By Stephen Nellis and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) -Apple Inc on Monday announced two new MacBook Pro models that run on more powerful in-house chips, furthering its break from previous supplier  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and showing its strategy for setting its machines apart from the rest of the PC industry.
The new 14-inch and 16-inch models start at $1,999 and range up to $6,099 in their most expensive variations. Using two new chips called the M1 Pro and M1 Max, Apple claims they will far outperform rival machines based on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), especially when the new laptops are used with only battery power.
With the moves announced in an online event on Monday, Apple is courting a group of users that include professional photographers, film makers and audio producers looking for a powerful tool - a prestige segment that rivals such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) have in recent years tried to peel away from with its lineup of Surface hardware. 
But it is also laying out a path for what Apple's computers will look like when it completes its two-year transition away from Intel chips next year. The chips have helped propel Mac sales, which were up 32% to $26 billion in the first nine months of Apple's fiscal 2021. 
Apple's first laptop chip - last year's M1, used in the company's consumer-oriented MacBook Air and less-expensive Pro models - had some advantages over Intel's chips. But those have become more stark with the professional-grade chips, whose features will likely filter into lower-end models over the coming years, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies. 
""This is the first bedrock that has been laid architecturally, and in many ways it's unprecedented to see this level of performance at this level of power efficiency,"" he said.
Johny Srouji, Apple's chip chief, said the M1 Max chip uses up to 100 watts less power than other high-end laptop chips, which translates to better battery life.
""It's the most powerful chip we've ever built,"" Srouji said of the M1 Max.
Apple said the 14-inch model will start at $1,999 and the 16-inch model will start at $2,499. Both computers will start shipping next week, Apple said.
Apple also announced several new music-related products at its Monday event. The company announced a $5-a-month version of its streaming music service that will allow access to its full music catalog on Apple devices by using its Siri voice assistant. Apple's full service remains $10 a month, and shares of streaming music rival  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) were up 0.4% on the news, suggesting Spotify's investors do not view the new service as a major threat.
Apple also introduced a third generation of its AirPods wireless ear buds. Apple's new AirPods are sweat- and water-resistant for use with workouts and will have some sound features previously found in the higher-end AirPods Pro, Apple said during the launch event. Apple said the new AirPods will cost $179 and start shipping next week.

Add-on devices like AirPods tend to be large sellers during holiday shopping seasons and have become one of Apple's fastest-growing categories, with its home and accessories segment growing 25% to $30.6 billion in Apple's fiscal 2020. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were up about 0.8% on Monday afternoon.

GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Fortescue (FSUGY), Kronos (KRO), and USD Partners (NYSE:USDP) are established companies that offer 5%-plus dividend yields. So, it could be wise to add them to one’s retirement portfolio. Read on.According to data from FactSet, 41 S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter results so far, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations. However, U.S. oil prices jumped another 1%, surpassing $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. In addition, the 10-year Treasury yield this week started edging back up toward 1.62%. So, market volatility will likely continue amid increasing inflation.
Against this backdrop, investors are turning to dividend-yielding stocks to ensure a steady income stream. Investors’ interest in dividend stocks is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF’s (SDY) 3.2% returns over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 2.2% returns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About a dozen U.S. senators from both parties on Monday formally introduced a bill that would bar Big Tech platforms, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, from favoring their products and services.
The bill follows others introduced with the goal of reining in the outsized market power of tech firms, including industry leaders Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Thus far none became law, although one, which would increase resources for antitrust enforcers, passed the Senate.
Senators Amy Klobuchar and Chuck Grassley's bill would prohibit platforms from requiring companies operating on their sites to purchase the platform's goods or services and ban them from biasing search results to favor the platform.
A companion has passed the House Judiciary Committee. It must pass both houses of Congress to become law.
Reuters reported on Wednesday, after reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, that Amazon's India operations ran a systematic campaign of creating knock-offs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in the country, one of the company’s largest growth markets.
When news of the bill broke last week, both Amazon and Google warned of potential unintended consequences.
Amazon said in a statement that the bill, if it became law, ""would harm consumers and the more than 500,000 US small and medium-sized businesses that sell in the Amazon store, and it would put at risk the more than 1 million jobs created by those businesses.""
Google said that the measure would make it more difficult for companies to offer free services -- Google's search and maps are both free -- and would make ""those services less safe, less private and less secure."" 
Facebook, which said that it competes with a range of social media, including TikTok and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), said antitrust laws should ""not attempt to dismantle the products and services people depend on.""
Klobuchar chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee while Grassley is the top Republican on the full committee. Co-sponsors include five Democrats and five Republicans.

Companies expressing support for the bill included Spotify (NYSE:SPOT),  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) and DuckDuckGo, Klobuchar's office said in a statement.
The bill would not break up the companies or force them to drop services but bars some bad behaviors that affect businesses that rely on their platforms, said Stacy Mitchell with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance who said that she would prefer a more aggressive bill.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. markets functioned well during January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) volatility, while short selling was not the main cause of the unprecedented rise in the 'meme stock,' according to a long-awaited Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) report. 
The report published on Monday provides a post-mortem into how amateur traders using commission-free retail brokerages drove shares in GameStop and other popular meme stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against them. 
Amid the intense volatility, several brokerages restricted trading in the affected stocks, curbing the rally, infuriating retail traders, sparking outrage from policymakers, and leading to a Congressional hearing. 
Despite the extraordinary series of events, the SEC concluded that the basic plumbing of the market remained ""sound,"" an SEC official said. The report also found that positive sentiment on video game retail company GameStop rather than dislocations caused by short selling was the main driver of GameStop's stock spike.
Short sellers borrow shares from brokers and then sell them into the market, with the agreement that they will buy the shares back and return them to the lender at a later date. If the price has fallen, the short seller can buy the shares back at a lower price than they paid for them, locking in a profit.
When a heavily shorted stock soars, short sellers are forced to buy the shares back at higher prices to close out their positions, pushing the stock even higher - known as a ""short squeeze."" 
The SEC found, however, that ""it was the positive sentiment, not the buying-to-cover, that sustained the weeks-long price appreciation of GameStop stock.""
It also rebutted a popular theory, sparked by the unusually high volume of short selling in GameStop, that some hedge funds were 'naked' shorting the stock - selling without arranging to borrow the shares. The SEC said it found no evidence of this. 
The report does not address several outstanding questions, including whether bad actors manipulated social media to whip up positive sentiment in GameStop, or whether hedge funds tried to pressure retail brokers to restrict trading in GameStop, something that all parties concerned have denied.
An SEC official said it could not discuss in the report misconduct that could result in a potential enforcement action. 

The agency's chair Gary Gensler told Congress earlier this year that the agency would address other issues raised by the saga, including short selling disclosures, game-like trading prompts used by brokers, and brokers' practice of sending customer orders to wholesale market makers for a fee.
""January's events gave us an opportunity to consider how we can further our efforts to make the equity markets as fair, orderly, and efficient as possible,"" Gensler said in a Monday statement.

The U.S. housing sector that earlier witnessed a boom has lost its momentum in recent months, hurt by a tight jobs market, supply chain issues and shortage of raw materials.
That has sent property rates soaring, with the median U.S. house price in August up nearly 15% from a year earlier.
""We believe Zillow's decision might be affected by slowing homes sales and the company's inability to sell through at the same rate at which it is acquiring, as buyers take a step back"", BofA Securities said in a note. 
Zillow, which operates the popular home valuation model 'Zestimates', said it would clear a backlog of properties on its platform. The company bought 3,805 homes in the second quarter.
Analysts, however, said Zillow's move might open the door to rivals such as Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) Technologies Inc to grab market share.
Opendoor can gain a significant share if it just generally operates more efficiently, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said in a note.

The company, which went public through a merger with a blank-check firm led by venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya last year, bought 8,494 homes in the second quarter.
Opendoor shares were up 2.6% in afternoon trade, while Zillow shares were down 8.5%.

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered on Monday ahead of a busy week of earnings, including reports from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Investors were skittish about slowing economic growth in China, the world’s second largest economy, and concerns about rising oil prices affecting prices across the spectrum. With one half-hour of trading left, the Dow was down slightly while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were edging higher.
China reported the slowest pace of economic growth in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages and the struggling property sector.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was rising in anticipation of a product reveal event where it introduced new MacBook Pro laptops powered by an updated home-made chip. 
But the big event this week is corporate earnings, and the conference calls where CEOs talk about how they are working around supply shortages, labor shortages and rising material costs and what they were doing about the months ahead. 
Analysts expect the S&P 500 earnings to show a 32% rise from a year ago, Reuters reported, citing Refinitiv data.
Other companies up this week include Covid-vaccine maker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), telecom giant  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and chipmaker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).
In other stock news on Monday, shares of Walt  Disney  Company (NYSE:DIS) sold off after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts cut it to equal weight from overweight, citing challenges in the continued growth of its Disney+ streaming business after starting off last year with blistering hot growth. The company also said it was delaying the production for several movies.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Johnson & Johnson earnings
Johnson & Johnson will report third-quarter earnings Tuesday. The company is expected to notch a profit per share of $2.36 on revenue of $23.66 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Last week, the company got the nod from the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel for a booster shot of its Covid-19 vaccine.
2. Procter & Gamble earnings
Home-product maker Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s first-quarter revenue is seen at $19.79 billion with profit per share at $1.59. But analysts will be listening to what the company says about hiring and supply chain issues, especially heading into the end of the year.
3. Netflix earnings
Netflix’s third-quarter revenue is estimated to come in at $7.48 billion and earnings per share at $2.57. The streaming giant’s run-away hit Squid Game may be a hard act to follow, but analysts will be listening for what the company says about its content production pipeline.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Four venture capital funds founded by women of color in the United States on Monday said they are banding together under an umbrella called The Ally Capital Collab to get an edge on fundraising and investments.
The 22 Fund and WOCstar Fund have Black female founders, while Supply Change Capital and 2045 Ventures have Latina founders, according to The Ally Capital Collab.
Protests on racial injustice last year have triggered a move towards more diversity in the venture capital world, but startups run by people of color remain under-represented.
According to data firm Crunchbase, in the first nine months of 2021, over $7 billion of investments were made in Black- and Latino-founded startups, up from less than $3 billion on average for the previous six years.
That represents around 3.2% of funding to all U.S. startups.
""There's a lot of investors who fundamentally are aligned with us, but have never had access to us. And so this is us coming together to make sure that people know about us,"" said Gayle Jennings-O'Byrne of the New York-based WOCstar Fund, which invests in startups by minority women. 
She said that creating an organization like The Ally Capital Collab for funds to work together makes it possible to aid each other in due diligence and give investors confidence, as many minority venture capitalists lack the Silicon Valley network to raise funds. 
Representatives from all four funds are set to speak at an event at the Milken Institute in California on Monday.

Last year, industry group the National Venture Capital Association launched an arm called Venture Forward to try to tackle the lack of diversity.
""If we can help move the needle on the investor diversity... it's going to inherently change the make-up of founders,"" said Maryam Haque, Venture Forward executive director. She said its latest survey indicated there had so far been little progress in improving racial or ethnic diversity at the partner level.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy has been asked to provide more than 7 billion euros ($8 billion) in capital to UniCredit to strike a deal over Monte dei Paschi and offload as much as possible of the state-owned bank to the stronger rival, two people close to the matter said.
UniCredit, Italy's No. 2 lender, agreed on July 29 to discuss buying selected parts of Monte dei Paschi (MPS) from Italy's Treasury, which rescued the Tuscan bank in 2017, spending 5.4 billion euros.
Under the terms of the bailout, Italy must cut its 64% stake in MPS by mid-2022 at the latest. Negotiations between UniCredit and the Treasury have entered a crunch phase and a preliminary accord was expected in time for a UniCredit board meeting on Oct. 27 to approve third-quarter results.
However, one person involved in the discussions said that more time may be necessary and it was unclear at present whether a draft accord could be reached this month.
""Talks are in the final stretch, we need to see if the conditions exist to close the deal,"" a Treasury official told Reuters, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Complicating matters for the Treasury, UniCredit agreed to enter exclusive talks over MPS only on condition an acquisition would leave its capital reserves unaffected while providing a double-digit boost to its earnings per share.
The parties have only recently started discussing capital needs, with a source saying UniCredit sent a proposal to the Treasury that envisages various scenarios depending on the portion of MPS it takes on.
The Italian press reported at the weekend that a capital injection of close to 7 billion euros was necessary if UniCredit were to take all but 300 MPS branches mostly in Italy's poorer south, while also leaving behind the bank's capital services unit, leasing and factoring arm, and IT centre.
UniCredit has said it is targeting MPS' branches in Tuscany, Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. 
But the two sources said the capital outlay would be more than 7 billion euros if UniCredit were to take on the largest possible portion of MPS.
With the structure of the deal still under discussion, it remains to be seen how UniCredit's demands will be met. The Treasury declined to comment.
MPS' capital raising needs investor participation to comply with EU rules on state aid, according to a copy of a confidential document detailing the transaction seen by Reuters.
With UniCredit - dubbed Uranus in the document - set to finance the MPS' acquisition in shares, the MPS rights issue would give new investors a way into UniCredit, while the Tuscan bank's existing shareholders, including the Treasury, are also set to become investors in UniCredit.
UniCredit's capital requests are much higher than a 2.5 billion euro capital raising MPS has planned for next year were it to fail to find a partner.
But a fourth person close to the matter said that while securing a permanent solution to MPS' woes was extremely costly, a smaller capital injection risked providing only a medium-term fix, adding UniCredit was ready to walk away from a deal if the terms set in July were not met.

UniCredit has said it will steer clear of legal risks stemming from mismanagement and any MPS' problem or risky loans, which will go to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO.
The document said the legal risks, together with MPS' assets not transferred to UniCredit or other lenders such as MCC and MPS' historic properties in Siena, would go to Fintecna, another state agency. ($1 = 0.8637 euros)

Apple shares edged up 0.7% on Monday.

Apple said the M1 chips will give applications on the Mac operating system  a ""huge boost.""
The move to include the chips is seen as a way for Apple to remove  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) chips from its computers. Intel has been a leading player in the chip industry for a significant period and has provided chips for Apple's Macbook Pro for around 15 years. According to Intel, approximately 80% of the world's computers have Intel processors inside them.
However, Apple has its sites set on competing with Intel in the market, describing the chips as ""the first pro chips designed for the Mac,"" and ""a major leap forward.""

Let’s discuss.The evolution of financial technology or fintech has over the past few years made banking, investing, and financial transactions more convenient and efficient.

Further, the company should benefit from a strong economy and supply chain improvements.Retail stocks have struggled during the pandemic. At first, many retail stores were shut down in many parts of the country. Even when stores were allowed to reopen, foot traffic never recovered to previous levels.
Then, as case counts declined and vaccinations increased, there was a boom in retail sales, as there was pent-up demand to shop in stores and consumers were eager to spend their stimulus dollars. As a result, retail shares were among the biggest gainers in the first half of 2021. Since then, the delta variant has created a more gloomy outlook for consumer spending with higher costs eating into discretionary income. 
This has resulted in a sharp pullback for retail stocks. However, there are some good reasons to believe that the dip in retail stocks could be a buying opportunity, given the recent drop in coronavirus cases, reports of improvements in supply chains, declines in shipping rates, and healthy levels of wage growth. Therefore, investors should look to buy the dip in high-quality retail stocks like Vera Bradley (VRA).

Investing.com —   Cloudflare Inc  (NYSE:NET) stock has continued its recent rally — up over 130% for the year to date after it told investors it will work with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX), and other search engines to help businesses improve search results for their customers.
Cloudflare shares have climbed another 4.8% on Monday to $175.70.
“A fast, reliable website and timely search results are at the heart of any growing business, whether it’s a startup or Fortune 500 company. Since the beginning, we’ve worked to help our customers to give them the speed, reliability, and security they need to do business,” said Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare.
The web infrastructure and website security company will allow websites to automatically notify search engines whenever content is created, updated, or deleted through participation in the IndexNow.org initiative. This will enable sites to be crawled more efficiently, which Cloudflare says will allow its customers to guarantee users see the most up-to-date version of their content.
According to Cloudflare, 45% of Internet traffic comes from web crawlers and bots. Through the launch of Crawler Hints, they can indicate to bot developers when content has been changed or added.
""Website owners will be able to improve site performance by reducing unnecessary bot traffic and to provide timely content, which ultimately helps improve search rankings,"" the company said in its statement. 
Fabrice Canel, principal program manager at Microsoft Bing, said: “Cloudflare has built a really easy 1-click button for their users to start using it right away. Cloudflare’s mission of helping build a better internet resonates well with why we started IndexNow, that being to build a more efficient and effective search.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's North American unit said Monday it will invest about $3.4 billion (380 billion yen) on U.S. automotive battery development and production in the United States through 2030.
The world's largest automaker by volume also said it plans to establish a new company and build a new U.S. automotive battery plant together with Toyota Tsusho, the automaker's metals trading arm and a unit of the Toyota Group.
The new plant, which includes a planned $1.29 billion Toyota investment through 2031, aims to start production in 2025 and is expected to create 1,750 new U.S. jobs.
The funds are part of the $13.5 billion it announced in September it planned to spend globally by 2030 to develop batteries and its battery supply system. The largest Japanese automaker said in September it aimed to slash costs of its batteries by 30% or more by working on materials used and the way the cells are structured.
Toyota said the new company will initially focus on producing batteries for hybrid vehicles. Toyota said it will later disclose production capacity, the new company's business structure and the plant site.
Toyota North America CEO Ted Ogawa said in a statement the investment ""will help usher in more affordable electrified vehicles for U.S. consumers.""
Automakers around the world are investing billions of dollars to ramp up battery and electric vehicle production as they face increasingly stringent environmental regulations.
Toyota has mounted a lobbying campaign to try to convince U.S. lawmakers not to include an additional $4,500 tax incentive for union-made electric vehicles.
In August, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order setting a target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles.
Detroit's Big Three automakers said in August they aspire ""to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of electric vehicles... by 2030.""

Toyota said last month it ""unreservedly signed up to meet the challenge of making half of the vehicles we sell electric"" by 2030.
Biden’s 50% goal and the automakers’ 2030 goals includes battery electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles that also have a gasoline-engine.

LONDON (Reuters) - As Europe's third quarter reporting season kicks into gear, investors are scrutinising company results for any signs that supply chain strains, labour shortages and surging energy prices are starting to undermine profits. 
Confidence in Europe's earnings resilience has helped the continent's bourses recover from a wobble in September with the latest Refinitiv I/B/E/S data showing third quarter profits for the 600 biggest listed European companies are expected to grow 46.7% from the same period in 2020. 
However, while earnings upgrades have consistently outnumbered downgrades since October last year, the weekly ratio between the two has dropped to 1.8 from a 17-year high of 26.3 in August. 
Graphic: Earnings revisions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrazzlpm/Pasted%20image%201634293481215.png 
Arnaud Bauduin, fund manager at Ofi AM in Paris, says there has been a shift in sentiment linked to inflation, which hit a 13-year high https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/euro-zone-inflation-jumps-13-year-high-worsening-ecb-headache-2021-10-01 in the euro zone last month.
""We are suffering from the tail effects of COVID. The economy is not fluid and this is why we have all those problems in supply chains and then inflation,"" he said.
""When you look at companies, the strong momentum that we've seen in the last 12 months is starting to fade.""
On Monday, the chief executive of Dutch health technology company Philips blamed ""chips and ships"" as it cut its financial outlook with a shortage of electronic components and a lack of shipping containers hampering production and delivery.
Shares in Belgium's Umicore also fell after the catalytic converter maker cut its 2021 core profit outlook due to the chip shortages.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), meanwhile, point to the risks stemming from staff shortages and the possible need to increase wages at a wide range of European companies, from Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) to game video editor Ubisoft and the UK's  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG). 
Major central banks for the most part are cautiously sticking to their view that the inflation spike will prove transitory, but supply chain bottle necks and staff shortages raise the chance of more permanent pressures if firms adjust pricing and wage policy.
With the prospect of central banks tapering stimulus and in some cases even raising rates in an attempt to stop inflation running away, the financial sector is set to thrive.
Wall Street set the tone last week when the S&P 500 notched up its biggest daily gain since early-March as banking giants JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citi,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) crushed estimates with combined third quarter profits of $28.7 billion. 
And with oil prices climbing well above $80 a barrel to their highest in many years, energy has seen the highest number of positive weekly earnings revisions among sectors on the STOXX 600.
Downgrades outnumbered upgrades for real estate and utilities, which typically suffer when bond yields rise. 
Graphic: Sectors, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zjpqkeewwpx/Pasted%20image%201634114638427.png 
Despite the inflation worries, Fahad Kamal, CIO at Kleinwort Hambros in London, like many investors, remains upbeat on equities for the time being.

""While company CEOs are mentioning inflation a lot there has never been greater expectations for revenues, profits and margins,"" he said. 
""We get that valuations are extended but the underlying macro backdrop is so supportive and if companies are worried about inflation, it's not showing up in the margins which are at 13-14%.”

(Reuters) -Europe's drug regulator said on Monday it was evaluating use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children as young as five, while also taking steps to aid an increase in production and boost the shot's reach.
The European Medicines Agency said it would review data, including results from an ongoing study, for the vaccine - known as Comirnaty. It has already been authorised for use in those 12 years of age and older in the European Union and United States.
The two-shot vaccine, based on new mRNA technology, was found to induce a strong immune response in five- to 11-year- olds in a clinical trial of 2,268 participants, the drugmakers said last month. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech submitted data on Comirnaty for young children last week. 
While children are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, they can spread the coronavirus to others, including those more at risk of severe illness. 
Alongside vaccinating children, regulators and drugmakers are also considering booster doses for the vulnerable, underscoring the need to increase production and extend access to protection from the virus to as many people as possible. 
The EMA also said on Monday it had approved https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-manufacturing-sites-new-formulation-approved-covid-19-vaccine-biontech-pfizer two more manufacturing sites for producing the vaccine in the Italian cities of Monza and Anagni, while also giving the green light to a ready-to-use formulation of Comirnaty. 
The sites would produce up to 85 million additional doses to suppply the European Union in 2021, the regulator said. Pfizer and BioNTech are the biggest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the bloc.

The drugmakers' new approved formulation that does not require dilution would also allow for longer storage and easier transportation at regulator refrigerator temperatures of 2°C to 8°C. 
In a statement https://investors.biontech.de/node/10851/pdf, BioNTech said the new formulation for individuals 12 years and older will be available in a phased rollout starting in early 2022.

And given the continuing low-interest-rate environment, which is beneficial for small-cap stocks, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound small-cap stocks CTS Corporation (NYSE:CTS), Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC), and Travelzoo (TZOO), which have suffered price declines over the past few months. Let’s discuss.Last week was the best week in months for the major stock indexes, thanks to a stronger-than-expected start to the third-quarter earnings season. However, the stock market is expected to remain volatile on concerns over rising Treasury yields, inflation, and disappointing Chinese economic data. While small-cap stocks typically experience more volatility than mid-cap and large-cap stocks when the market is volatile, the current low-interest-rate environment is beneficial for small-cap stocks.
Small-cap stocks usually offer higher growth potential. Over the long run, small-cap value index funds outperform the S&P 500. Investors’ interest in small-cap stocks is evidenced by the Dow Jones U.S. small-cap total stock market index’s 39% returns over the past year.
Therefore, given the current market volatility, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of beaten-down small-cap stocks CTS Corporation (CTS), Universal Electronics Inc. (UEIC), and Travelzoo (TZOO), which are fundamentally sound.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) traded below $20 for the first time since May 21 after UBS (NYSE:UBS) downgraded it to sell.
The downgrade follows the company’s decision to push the launch of its first commercial flight to the fourth quarter of 2022 from the third. The delay is due to a planned upgrade that will boost its spaceship’s durability.
Analyst Myles Walton pegs the stock to hit $15. It hit a low of $19 so far in the session underway today, down more than 4%.
According to Walton, the event path for the stock is now disjointed for the better part of the next year and with 24% of outstanding shares (32% of the float) exiting their lock-up period at the end of October, the stock would come under pressure.
Walton said that while it doesn't seem like a lot, a cumulative delay of 2.5 years that is longer than the time the company has been public – it debuted on NYSE on October 28, 2019 – will challenge investor optimism on flight cadence.
Walton said the key to Virgin Galactic turning profitable is the Delta class spaceship, without which the annual passenger revenue is topped out around $30 million compared to the company's $225 million to $250 million annual cash burn.
The company currently has one mothership, Eve, and one spaceship, Unity. It is developing its Delta-class spaceship, which will have a shorter one-week turnaround time."
127,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 11:52AM ET</span>","Valneva says its COVID-19 vaccine shows similar protection to AstraZeneca's, fewer side effects","By Kylie MacLellan and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) -Valneva SE on Monday said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated efficacy ""at least as good, if not better"" than AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s shot in a late-stage trial comparing the two, with significantly fewer adverse side effects.
Valneva, among a handful of drugmakers testing their vaccines against one already in use, is hoping its candidate, which uses more traditional technology than the mRNA vaccines, could be a more reassuring option for Europeans still reluctant to be immunised.
""The really important vaccine doses that we need to give, both nationally and internationally, are to those that have not yet been immunised,"" the trial's lead investigator Adam Finn told reporters on a call. ""That's our priority.""
Valneva's VLA2001 vaccine triggered a significantly stronger immune response, he said, suggesting that protection against COVID-19 in terms of antibody response would be ""at least as good, if not better than the AstraZeneca vaccine.""
Finn noted that both vaccines were highly effective, particularly against severe disease. No participants were hospitalised with COVID-19 during the trial.
Adding additional reassurance, Valneva's trial was conducted while the highly-transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus, responsible for recent global spikes in COVID-19 hospitalization and death, was already circulating widely. 
The study also showed that Valneva's vaccine, given in two shots 28 days apart, prompted significantly fewer adverse reactions, such as arm pain and fever.
Valneva's Paris-listed shares were up about 33% - on track for their best day ever - and have more than doubled since January, despite plunging last month, when Britain scrapped a contract for around 100 million doses over concerns the vaccine might not receive approval.
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results did not change the government's decision, though Britain's medicines watchdog would review the results once it receives the full data.
Valneva said it aims to submit the data to Britain's regulator in November for possible approval by the end of 2021, and hopes to win approval from the EU by the end of March next year.

The company plans to continue manufacturing its vaccines at a site in Scotland.
The French company is expanding its trials to cover both adolescents and the elderly, and hopes to extend approval to these groups after it obtains approval for people aged 18-55.

(Reuters) -Oyster Point Pharma Inc's treatment for dry eye disease became the first U.S. approved nasal spray for the chronic condition, sending the drug developer's shares about 7% higher in morning trade.
The company said on Monday its spray, Tyrvaya, will be made available from next month to patients with a prescription, but did not reveal its listing price.
Tyrvaya's potential market size could be more than $1 billion, Cowen and Co analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a note, as the market is still large and underserved. 
The dry eye disease -- characterized by stinging, sensitivity to light, blurred vision and eye fatigue -- affects about 38 million Americans, and is currently treated with over-the-counter artificial tear drops such as GenTeal and Refresh. 
Oyster Point Chief Commercial Officer John Snisarenko said Tyrvaya will be ""very affordable and competitive"" with Novartis' Xiidra and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Restasis -- prescription eye drops also used to treat dry eye disease. 
He said patients will have to pay around $10 out of pocket for Tyrvaya if their insurers do not cover the drug.
Oyster Point said the twice daily nasal spray was tested in trials covering over 1,000 patients with mild, moderate or severe symptoms, where it showed statistically significant improvement in production of tear film on eye surface.
Tear film helps keep eyes moist, reducing risks of infection and contributing to clear vision. 

Tyrvaya, the first approved product for Oyster Point, is significantly differentiated from competition due to its faster onset of action, impressive safety and tolerability profile, and ease of use, Cacciatore said. 
It is a nasal spray formulation of the drug varenicline, also used in  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s smoking cessation drug, Chantix.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Geely-owned Volvo Cars said on Monday its initial public offering would be priced within a range of 53 to 68 Swedish crowns per share, valuing the automaker at up to $23 billion in what is likely to be one Europe's biggest listings this year.
Volvo Cars, which has spent years under the Geely Holding umbrella strengthening its foothold in the premium market, said this month it planned to raise $2.9 billion through an IPO and list its shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange.
Sources told Reuters last month that Geely was in advanced discussions with banks to list the Swedish company in the coming weeks, aiming for a valuation of about $20 billion.
The carmaker said in a statement its IPO would value the company, maker of models such as the high-end XC-90 SUV, at between 163 billion and 200 billion crowns and that shares would begin trading on Oct. 28.
""I think we have a very strong interest especially from the Nordic investors,"" Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told a news conference called at short notice as the prospectus for the offering was unveiled. 
NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said his initial assessment on valuation had been more conservative.
""I think their ability to pull off this valuation depends on Polestar, not just their investment but also how they can work together. Polestar is a promising company but what you are paying for there is for the future,"" he said.
Electric-car maker Polestar, owned by Geely and Volvo, last month said it will go public by merging with a U.S.-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by billionaire Alec Gores and investment bank Guggenheim Partners at an enterprise value of $20 billion.
Volvo repeated that it expected the issue of new shares to provide it with gross proceeds of about 25 billion crowns before transaction costs. ""This will secure that we can continue with the plan that we have,"" finance chief Bjorn Annwall said.
The transaction, including expected converted investments by investors AMF and Folksam, was seen resulting in a free float of about 19.5% to 24.0%, Volvo said.
The Gothenburg-based company, which said its January-September operating profit (EBIT) rose to 16.6 billion crowns from 3.6 billion in the year-ago period, had previously said that owner Geely would remain its biggest shareholder after the listing.
In 2018, Volvo Cars and Geely, which also owns an 8.2% stake in Sweden's Volvo Trucks, postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker, citing trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
The market for initial public offerings (IPO) has been hit hard by runaway inflation and the rising rate environment, with a slew of cancellations and postponements hitting the screens in Europe and the United States after a stellar first half. 
Many companies that listed earlier in the year are trading well below their list price, with Renaissance's IPO index for the EMEA region down 10% this year so far. 

However, bankers say there still is demand for large companies that garner the attention of global funds, and appetite for the electric vehicle sector remains robust.

Not only do they offer higher growth potential, but they also can help diversify a portfolio. That’s why investors should take a look at highly rated mid-cap growth stocks such as  Omnicell , Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL), Alkermes PLC (NASDAQ:ALKS), and PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH).Most investors are more familiar with large-cap companies, which have a market cap of $10 billion or more, than mid or small-cap companies. A mid-cap company has a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion, and a small-cap company has a market cap under $2 billion. So, it would make sense that the larger companies get more media coverage and investor attention than their smaller peers.
But investors should consider adding smaller companies to their portfolios, especially for diversification reasons. While small-cap companies typically offer the most growth potential, they also come with more risk. Mid-cap stocks, on the other hand, still offer great growth potential but with less risk. Mid-cap stocks are in the middle of their growth curve, and many even see their market capitalization rise due to profit growth and higher share prices.
The trick is to find mid-cap stocks with solid business and robust growth potential. That's why I ran a search for mid-cap stocks in our proprietary POWR Ratings system that have an overall Buy rating and a Growth Grade of A. Three of the top stocks on this screen, Omnicell, Inc.

Keep reading to find out. Kosmos Energy Ltd . (NYSE:KOS) in Hamilton, Bermuda, operates as an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, focused along the Atlantic Margins. The company's primary assets include production offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and gas development offshore Mauritania and Senegal.
Due to rising crude oil and natural gas prices amid a prolonged supply squeeze, the oil & gas industry has gained impressively over the past year. Shares of KOS have gained 217.5% in price over the past year and 19.4% over the past five days. Also, KOS’ shares returned 7.3% in their last trading session to close at $3.81. Moreover, the stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $2.74 and $2.80, respectively.

However, since most meme stocks possess weak fundamentals, it could be risky to bet on them based solely on their price performance. As such, we believe investors are better off avoiding meme stocks Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), and Clover Health (CLOV). These stocks are rated ‘Strong Sell’ in our proprietary rating system. Read on.
Following the massive short squeezes experienced by GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) earlier this year, meme stocks gained immense popularity. While discussion on social media led to many other fundamentally weak stocks witnessing skyrocketing price rallies, meme trading has attracted criticism from several analysts. In addition, allegations of a fraudulent trading scheme made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has created some wariness and confusion related to investing in meme stocks.
The meme investing trend is still causing hedge funds’ conniptions. Hedge funds have lost billions of dollars in a battle for market supremacy with retail investors this year. Given that most meme stocks are overpriced, and it’s almost impossible to identify when to buy or sell them, we think investors should be judicious when picking a meme stock.
We believe meme stocks Beyond Meat, Inc. (BYND), Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPCE), and Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV), which possess weak fundamentals and growth prospects, are best avoided now. These stocks have been rated ‘Strong Sell’ by our proprietary rating system.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Beijing's property tax plans and fresh signs of weakening in China's housing market knocked real estate shares in the country on Monday despite the central bank's efforts to calm nerves over China Evergrande Group's debt woes.
Bonds in the sector, however, enjoyed a day of healthy gains following upbeat central bank comments and after developer Kaisa Group said it had paid the coupon on one of its dollar bonds and planned to make a payment on a second this week.
The CSI300 Real Estate Index, which tracks the stocks of China's biggest developers, fell 2.6% with China Vanke and Poly Development dropping more than 3%. Real estate shares have slumped 22% this year. 
Hong Kong property shares fared better though, with an index tracking mainland firms ending the day 0.8% up.
China's President Xi Jinping called on Friday for the nation to ""vigorously and steadily advance"" legislation for a property tax, which could curb rampant speculation, according to an essay in the ruling Communist Party journal Qiushi.
Rocky Fan, economist at Sealand Securities, said property tax expectations were negative for real estate shares because ""people would balk at buying properties and take a wait-and-see attitude, hurting developers' revenues"".
Global financial markets have been rocked by fears of contagion over a liquidity crisis at Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities.
On Sunday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang said the economy faced challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement"", and that authorities were keeping a close eye ""so they do not become systematic risks"".
BANK COMMENTS HELP
Yi's comments followed another PBOC official speaking on Friday, who said the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system were controllable and individual financial institutions' risk exposures were not big.
China property debt markets reacted favourably to the PBOC's comments on Friday, and extended their rally on Monday.
""You have had some supportive comments from the PBOC,"" said Colm d'Rosario, senior portfolio manager at Amundi. 
""The government has been in an active process of how to manage this situation,"" he said, also pointing to reports of messages to speed up mortgage approvals.
Bonds also got a boost after Kaisa told Reuters it had paid $39.4 million worth of coupon for a dollar bond due on Oct. 16, and planned to transfer funds for a coupon worth $35.85 million due Oct. 22 into bondholders accounts on Thursday.
A number of Kaisa Group's bonds due in the next three years added about 5 cents in the dollar with the 2024 issue trading above 50 cents in the dollar for the first time in 10 days, MarketAxess data showed.
Some bonds issued by Yuzhou Group jumped 6 cents in the dollar while those of Zhenro Properties added 4 cents.
But other analysts were less upbeat. 
""The PBOC is downplaying the market impact of Evergrande's default,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote in a research note, adding that the developer's problems represented an industry-wide problem.
""Policymakers have the levers to contain the spillover risk; but if no policy action is taken, the risk of further deterioration should not be underestimated, which may lead to investment slowdown, weaker consumption, fiscal problems for local governments and broader financial sector pressure.""
GROWTH WOBBLES
Data on Monday confirmed expectations of a slowdown in economic growth. China's economy expanded 4.9% in the third quarter, slower than expected, while industrial output also came in short of expectations.
New construction starts in September slumped for a sixth straight month, the longest spate of monthly declines since 2015, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
Bond markets seemed to be broadly unfazed by another spate of ratings downgrades. 
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded the corporate family rating (CFR) of Kaisa on Monday to ""B2"" from ""B1"" and placed its ratings on review for further downgrades, citing weakening liquidity and rising refinancing risk expectations over the next six to 12 months amid tight funding conditions and large debt maturities. 

Moody's also downgraded the ratings of Greenland Holdings and Guangzhou R&F, among others.
Sinic Holdings, which has a $246 million bond maturing on Monday, said last week it would likely default. Fantasia Holdings, which missed a payment earlier this month, has another $21.44 million coupon due on Monday.

Investing.com —   Medtronic  PLC (NYSE:MDT) stock is sliding Monday after a report from New York Injury Law News said that a recent recall of Medtronic Pipeline Embolization Devices has been expanded. 
Shares fell 5.11% in morning trading.
The previous recall included around 800 devices. The report said it has now been expanded to include approximately 8,825, with Medtronic asking healthcare providers to immediately return unused products and contact Medtronic.
The device is a braided wire mesh tube that is flexible and placed within the affected artery to treat and prevent certain brain aneurysms.
According to New York Injury Law News, Medtronic is making the recall because of a risk that the delivery system’s wire and tubes may fracture or break while the doctor is putting it in place.
If the device breaks, pieces could be left inside the patient's bloodstream and cause additional health problems. The recall has been identified as Class I, meaning it could cause severe injury or fatality. 
Earlier this month, the FDA issued a Class I recall on Medtronic's MiniMed Remote Controllers used with a Medtronic MiniMed 508 insulin pump or the MiniMed Paradigm family of insulin pumps.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips on Monday cut its outlook for sales and profit growth this year and said the global supply chain problems that added to its growing list of worries in the third quarter would likely intensify. 
Amsterdam-based Philips said comparable sales dropped 7.6% in the July-September period to 4.2 billion euros ($4.9 billion) as a shortage of electronic components such as memory chips and a lack of shipping containers hampered production and delivery.
""It's chips and ships"", Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Memory chip producers were not able to keep up with Philips' increased demand, Van Houten said, with orders for its products ranging from electric toothbrushes to patient monitoring systems rising 17% last quarter.
Ships transporting Philips' products were also backed up in ports worldwide as international trade rapidly recovered from the COVID-19 induced slump.
""We expect the port congestion to be temporary, while it could take until the second half of next year to get the shortage of chips under control"", Van Houten said. 
The impact of the supply chain problems will likely increase to 200 million euros in missed sales in the final quarter of 2021, the CEO said, up from 150 million euros in the third quarter.
Although the issues will probably still hit sales into 2022, Van Houten said he expected growth to return in the course of next year.
RECALL BITES
Philips shares fell almost 1% in early trading in Amsterdam, having already lost around a fifth of their value since the company recalled millions of respiratory devices in June.
It has set aside 500 million euros to repair or replace the popular machines used mainly for the treatment of sleep apnea.
The amount does not, however, cover the possible costs of litigation, with Philips facing more than a hundred class action suits from worried patients, some of whom have said degrading foam in the devices could cause cancer or other health issues.
Van Houten said it was still too early to estimate the costs of litigation, as Philips was working with experts to determine the actual health risks from the degrading foam, something that wasn't expected to be known until some point next year.

The recall and supply chain problems pushed adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) down 25% in the third quarter to 512 million euros, slightly above analysts' expectations.

Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek last month hinted at a slowdown in Disney+, saying fourth-quarter global paid subscribers will grow by ""low single digit"" millions compared with a rise of 58.5 million in the previous three months.
Disney+, which has one of the richest portfolios of media content, had a blockbuster launch in 2019; it attracted new subscribers with its hit ""Star Wars"" and ""Avengers"" franchises.
Rival streaming platforms such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video have had a different approach. They invested heavily on original content to draw in subscribers.
""While the company (Disney) appears to be targeting one new piece of content a week, not every piece of content has the same franchise value or visibility,"" Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar said.
Barclays also said the slowdown in Disney+ subscribers could not be solely attributed to a pull forward in additions in 2020, when streaming platforms gained popularity as people hunkering down at home sought entertainment.
To achieve its target of 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, Disney will need to more than double its current pace of growth to at least the same level as Netflix, according to Barclays.

Netflix, which is due to report its quarterly results on Tuesday, had 209 million subscribers as of the quarter ended June. Disney+ had 116 million paying customers.
Disney shares, which have not been downgraded by any brokerage so far this year, fell about 2% in early trading.

The deal was initially struck in February. However, regulatory restrictions placed on the Issa brothers and TDR were not lifted until June.
Only then could the Asda and EG Group's teams start to share commercial information relating to EG's purchase of the petrol forecourts.

Investing.com – Zillow stock (NASDAQ:ZG) plunged more than 10% as the company suspended buying new homes while it clears the backlog of already-signed contracts through the remaining part of the year.
The company blamed a labor crunch and other supply issues.
""We have not been exempt from these market and capacity issues and we now have an operational backlog for renovations and closings. Pausing new contracts will enable us to focus on sellers already under contract with us and our current home inventory,"" Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Wacksman said in a note.
The Zillow Offers business connects prospective sellers with a local agent partner, the company said.
Zillow Offers is a service to homeowners to sell without having to coordinate repairs or host open houses or showings. After buying a home, Zillow prepares it for sale by doing the same type of projects a typical seller would, then lists it on the open market.
The company, which acquired more than 3,800 homes during the second quarter, has seen its stock price tumble about 27% this year after it nearly tripled in 2020 amid the pandemic-fueled housing market boom, according to Bloomberg."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Monday after a sharp and unexpected fall in U.S. industrial output in September once again cast doubt over the strength of the recovery. 
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 130 points, or 0.3% at 35,183 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was effectively unchanged.
Earlier, new data had shown U.S. industrial output fell by 1.3% in September, after August's data were also revised down to show a modest drop instead of the increase initially reported. Manufacturing output also fell for a second straight month, by a steeper-than-expected 0.7%. The figures strengthened perceptions that the world is struggling with extended disruptions to global supply chains, a problem exacerbated in the short term by surging fuel prices. 
Wholesale Gasoline prices in the U.S. hit $2.50 a gallon for the first time in seven years in early trading in New York, against a backdrop of reports that key producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are struggling to produce even the volumes that they are allowed to produce under their agreement with Russia and other key exporters. 
The figures reflect the aggregate of problems announced with varying degrees of severity by industrial companies across the U.S. in recent weeks, as regards their ability to source semiconductors and other key components. They also reflect in increasingly troublesome backlog of ships bringing imports to U.S. ports, the result of aggressive stimulus policies kept in place over the last 18 months.  The data came hard on the heels of numbers showing a sharper-than-expected slowdown in Chinese gross domestic product growth in the third quarter of the year. 
The downward move hit both old- and new-economy stalwarts, though to varying degrees. U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) stock fell 6.5%, on fears that much of the supply-chain woe is concentrated in an auto sector that is a key customer for it. However, even at the top end of the manufacturing food chain, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 0.4%. Reports last week had flagged that even the iPhone maker can't get hold of all the silicon chips that it needs right now. 
Among individual movers,  Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) stock fell 10% after Bloomberg reported that the online realtor is temporarily suspending its home-flipping service, unable to keep up with strong demand from customers. The service has been a surprise hit for the company since launching, but has been arguably over-stimulated by loose monetary policy and by the pandemic, which has triggered an unprecedented shift in customer preferences for housing with more space - even if that means moving out of town.
Elsewhere,  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) stock fell 4.8% after reports that it is expanding a recall of devices inserted into the arteries of patients that are aimed at preventing aneurisms. The so-called pipeline embolization devices are reportedly susceptible to breaking and creating fresh and potentially fatal problems with patients' blood circulation.
On a more positive note,  Albertsons Companies  (NYSE:ACI) stock rose 3.8% to its highest in two weeks after the grocery store chain raised both its quarterly dividend and its full-year earnings guidance on the back of a strong third quarter.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) and MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) Corp's lung disease therapy, citing an inspection issue at a third-party facility, the companies said on Monday.
The therapy is a drug-device combination that uses United Therapeutics' approved treatment, Tyvaso, in combination with MannKind's portable inhaler. 
MannKind's Dreamboat device is a small and portable dry powder inhaler, making its administration more convenient than the traditional nebulized therapy. 
MannKind's shares fell 29.3% to $3.60 in premarket trading, while United Therapeutics' shares were down 2.5% at $182.42. 
The companies said the agency did not cite any operational shortcomings at MannKind's device manufacturing and testing facility. The inspection was related to a facility that performs analytical testing of a drug substance used in the therapy. 
MannKind told Reuters that it remains confident the inspection issue would be resolved ""in short order"". 
The companies were seeking approval of Tyvaso DPI to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as well as PAH associated with interstitial lung disease. 
A favorable label for the therapy appears likely, and its approval is a matter of ""when"" and not ""if"", J.P. Morgan analyst Jessica Fye said in a note.
While PAH is a type of high blood pressure that affects blood vessels in the lungs, PH-ILDs are a group of diseases that cause inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, making it harder to breathe. 

MannKind and United Therapeutics began collaborating on the pulmonary hypertension product in September 2018. MannKind manufactures the clinical and commercial supplies, while United is responsible for development and regulatory activities.
United said it now expects to launch the product no later than the summer of 2022.

Investing.com –  Disney  stock (NYSE:DIS) fell 2.2% in Monday’s premarket trading after Barclays (NYSE:BCS) downgraded it to equal weight from overweight, citing the likelihood of a significant slowdown in growth at its Disney+ streaming service.
Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar cut the target for the stock by $35 to $175 per share. The shares closed at $176.46 Friday.
For the third quarter ended July 3, Disney+ had 116 million paying customers, more than doubling its base in a year to emerge as a rival to Netflix which had 209 million subscribers at the end of June.
But according to the analyst, the group's growth story now appears to be weakening as the year nears its last two months. He called the slowdown in Disney+ growth “significant.""
Venkateshwar argues that for Disney+ to get to its long-term streaming subscriber guide, the media giant needs to more than double its current pace of growth to at least the same level as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
The number one player in the market is now riding on the windfall from Squid Game, the Korean-language series that has caught fire with audiences around the world. Netflix estimates its most-watched original series to create $900 million in value for the company, according to Bloomberg. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has been talking up metaverse since July and the buzzy word, first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, has been referenced by other tech firms such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
""No one company will own and operate the metaverse,"" Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post. ""Bringing this to life will take collaboration and cooperation across companies, developers, creators and policymakers.""
Using technologies such as virtual and augmented reality Facebook plans to create a greater sense of ""virtual presence"", which will mimic the experience of interacting in person.
The coronavirus pandemic has shifted much of the office meetings online, leading to the rise of conferencing apps such as Zoom, and big tech companies are looking to capitalize on this shift.
Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, intends to connect its nearly three billion users through several devices and apps.
Zuckerberg believes the metaverse would be accessible across VR, AR, PC, mobile devices and game consoles.
It has already committed $50 million for building the metaverse, and testing a new remote work app where users of Oculus Quest 2 headsets could hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves. 

While Facebook did not say what roles it would hire for and where they would be based, the company has been facing antitrust probes in the region, and is often criticised over online safety and hate speech on its platform.
""We look forward to working with governments across the EU to find the right people and the right markets to take this forward, as part of an upcoming recruitment drive across the region,"" Clegg wrote.

“We believe the Fed’s rate hike path will be shallower than the current market pricing,” BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s Scott Thiel said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  
BlackRock strategists expect the Fed to stick to its plan to raise rates in 2023, as indicated in the so-called dot plot. That’s a view that runs counter to money markets that have priced an increase of around 30 basis points by September of next year, as everything from supply-chain bottlenecks and materials shortages to high commodity prices spur inflation.
Read more: Traders Ramp Up U.K. Rate-Hike Bets on Bailey Inflation Warning
A global bond selloff gathered pace Monday with 10-year Treasury yields extending a climb to 1.6%. Traders boosted bets on higher rates last week to almost 50-50 by June, putting the first increase right around -- or potentially even before -- the time that the Fed has suggested asset-purchase tapering might end. 
But Thiel says policy makers likely have room to overlook the pandemic-driven pressures. 
“Clearly there is a very active debate here given the high levels of inflation we are seeing,” Thiel said. “It will be with us for some time. But we believe it will slowly ease.”
Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues expect elevated inflation to abate next year. The Fed’s staff in Washington predicts inflation will be back under 2% in 2022, according to minutes of last month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting released Oct. 13.
That’s not to say Thiel is telling clients to buy Treasuries. Quite the opposite. He’s expecting the selloff to continue, though at a more measured pace and is recommending underweight exposure to interest-rate risk. There’s still room for the U.S. economy to expand and yields at the current levels do not reflect that, he said.
“We will see yields rising over time in part because we believe they are at the wrong level to begin with given the level of economic activity we have seen,” Thiel said. “So there will continue to be adjustment higher in interest rates albeit not as violent as what we’ve seen in the last two weeks.”

Investing.com – Albertsons stock (NYSE:ACI) traded 4.5% higher in Monday’s premarket as a strong second quarter led it to raise its annual outlook and declare a higher dividend.
Sales and other revenue for the quarter ended September 11 were 4.4% higher at $16.5 billion. The company attributed this to a 1.5% increase in comparable sales and to higher fuel sales.
Both revenue and adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share topped estimates.
Supply chain, product and advertising costs were higher compared to a year ago but they were offset by productivity gains and improved pharmacy margins related to the administering of Covid-19 vaccines.
Similarly, lower Covid-related expenses were offset by higher wages and investments in digital and omnichannel capabilities.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Foxconn unveiled its first three electric vehicle prototypes on Monday, underscoring ambitious plans to diversify away from its role of building consumer electronics for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tech firms.
The vehicles - an SUV, a sedan and a bus - were made by Foxtron, a venture between Foxconn and Taiwanese car maker Yulon Motor Co Ltd.
Foxtron Vice Chairman Tso Chi-sen told reporters that he hoped electric vehicles would be worth a trillion Taiwan dollars to Foxconn in five years time - a figure equivalent to around $35 billion.
Formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer aims to become a major player in the global EV market though it concedes it is a novice in the car industry.
It first mentioned its EV ambitions in November 2019 and has moved relatively quickly, this year announcing deals to build cars with U.S. startup Fisker Inc https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/fisker-finalizes-deal-with-foxconn-make-evs-us-starting-2023-2021-05-13 and Thailand's energy group PTT Pcl https://www.reuters.com/article/foxconn-ptt-electric-idUSL3N2NI0LY.
""Hon Hai is ready and no longer the new kid in town,"" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told the event timed to mark the birthday of the company's billionaire founder Terry Gou, who drove the sedan onto the stage to the tune of ""Happy Birthday"".
The sedan, which was jointly developed with Italian design firm Pininfarina, will be sold by an unspecified carmaker outside Taiwan in the coming years, while the SUV will be sold under one of Yulon's brands and is scheduled to hit the market in Taiwan in 2023.
The bus, which will carry a Foxtron badge, will start running in several cities in southern Taiwan next year in a partnership with a local transportation service provider.
""So far Foxconn has made a pretty good progress,"" said Daiwa Capital Markets tech analyst Kylie Huang.
Foxconn has also set itself a target of providing components or services for 10% of the world's EVs by between 2025 and 2027. 
This month it bought a factory from U.S. startup Lordstown Motors Corp to make electric cars. In August it bought a chip plant in Taiwan, aiming to meet future demand for automotive chips.
A successful push by contract assemblers into the car industry has the potential to bring in a slew of new players and undermine the business models of traditional car companies. Chinese automaker Geely this year also laid out plans https://www.reuters.com/article/us-geely-strategy-electric-focus-idUSKBN2AA2YI to be become a major contract manufacturer.

Industry watchers are closely watching for clues of which firms might build Apple's electric car. While sources have previously said that the tech giant wants to launch a car by 2024, Apple has not disclosed specific plans.

The announcement by the luxury brand, part of Stellantis, comes as a shortage of semiconductors forces automakers around the world to slow or suspend production.
Maserati said its decision stemmed from ongoing disruptions in the supply of parts.
""In particular, due to a scarcity of semiconductors, production volumes would not adequately meet expected global demand,"" Maserati said in a statement.
A global premiere for the Grecale, which will be produced in Cassino in central Italy, was initially scheduled for Nov. 16.
Stellantis this month also confirmed it would present the Tonale, the new Alfa Romeo SUV, next March after it had been expected at the end of this year.
Stellantis, formed this year though the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, has halted production at several plants, including in Europe and Canada, due to the chip shortage.

It has forecast it will produce 1.4 million fewer vehicles this year.
The FIM-CISL union has said the impact of a semiconductor shortage on Stellantis' Italian production this year will be worse and longer-lasting than the damage to output caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - When a Swedish court ordered the country's biggest cement maker to stop mining limestone by its huge factory on the windswept island of Gotland to prevent pollution, ecologists cheered.
Besides protecting wildlife and water supplies, the ruling could force the plant that makes 75% of Sweden's cement and is the country's second biggest carbon emitter to slash output while it finds raw materials elsewhere, or even shut altogether. 
That might be good for Sweden's emissions targets, but not such good news for the rest of the planet.
A government-commissioned report seen by Reuters said it could force Sweden to import cement from countries that pump out more emissions in the overall manufacturing process - or risk massive job losses in the construction industry at home.
""Imports from countries outside the EU would probably lead to larger environmental impacts as a result of lower standards related to CO2 emissions and lower standards in land use,"" the report, obtained via a freedom of information request, said.
Sweden's dilemma encapsulates one the challenges facing nations meeting in Glasgow for the U.N. COP26 climate talks: how to show they are not cutting emissions by simply exporting the problem elsewhere - a phenomenon known as ""carbon leakage"".
A rich, stable Nordic democracy, Sweden has long topped international environmental rankings and has managed to cut back on greenhouse gases for years while preserving economic growth on a path towards its target of net zero emissions by 2045. 
It has the world's highest carbon tax at $137 per tonne and is a leader in the use of renewable energy. In 2018, its carbon emissions per head stood at 3.5 tonnes, well below the European Union average of 6.4 tonnes, according to World Bank data.
But the stand-off over the Slite cement plant epitomises the growing tension between local environment goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement signed by nearly 200 countries to try to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius.
""We have to weigh up the global focus - doing the most for the climate - but also maintain our high ambitions when it comes to our local environmental problems,"" Sweden's Minster for Environment and Climate Per Bolund told Reuters. ""These two things can be balanced.""
ALTERNATIVE FUELS
Much of Europe's imported cement comes from Turkey, Russia, Belarus and countries in North Africa. 
They don't have anything like the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world's largest carbon market and one that sets the price of carbon permits for energy-intensive sectors, including cement, within the 27-nation bloc.
The World Bank says only 22% of global emissions were covered by pricing mechanisms last year and the International Monetary Fund put the average global price of carbon at $3 a tonne - a tiny fraction of Sweden's carbon tax.
While the Swedish court's decision was not linked to Slite's carbon footprint, but rather the risks its quarry poses to local groundwater, the impact from an emissions point of view depends on the efficiency and energy mix of the producers likely to supply Sweden with cement to plug any shortfalls.
Slite's owner, Germany's HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), also plans to make it the world's first carbon neutral cement factory by 2030, but the uncertainty over its future following the court ruling may delay or even scupper the project.
""We need a decision soon on the long-term basis for these operations if that is not to be delayed,"" Magnus Ohlsson, chief executive of HeidelbergCement's Swedish subsidiary Cementa, said last month.
Koen Coppenholle, head of European cement lobby group Cembureau, said he was confident European plants were ""cleaner"" overall because high EU carbon charges on producers had encouraged them to invest in reducing their emissions.
""In Europe, right now, we are replacing 50% of our primary fuel needs by alternative fuels,"" he said
According to Cembureau data, however, imports of cement from outside the EU have jumped by about 160% in the last five years, even though total volumes remain relatively small.
But carbon leakage, where emissions are shifted from countries with tight environmental rules to ones with laxer and cheaper regimes, is an issue for dozens of industries and policymakers are trying to tackle it.
In July, the EU unveiled plans for the world's first carbon border tax to protect European industries, including cement, from competitors abroad whose manufacturers produce at lower cost because they are not charged for their carbon output.
Europe's cement industry supports the move, but warns it is fraught with difficulties, such as how to measure emissions in different countries given varying processes and fuels.
""If you impose strict requirements on CO2 and emissions, you have to make sure you do that in a way that you don't push companies outside the EU,"" said Coppenholle. ""That's the whole discussion on carbon leakage.""
For a country such as Sweden, which has cut its emissions by 29% over the last three decades, the issue of domestic action versus global impact goes beyond cement. 
The country's already low, and declining, emissions from domestic production dropped to just under 60 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2018.
But if you measure what Swedes consume, including goods and services produced abroad, the figure is about a third higher, according to Statistics Sweden, which put so-called consumption-based emissions at 82 million tonnes that year.
CLIMATE IS GLOBAL 
The local versus global perspective also raises questions about which type of industrial policy is ultimately greener.
Sweden's leading steel firm SSAB, state-owned miner LKAB and utility Vattenfall, for example, have invested heavily in developing a process to produce steel without using fossil fuels.
They say switching to so-called green hydrogen power would reduce Sweden's emissions by about 10%, a big step towards reaching the country's 2045 net zero emission goal.
But for researchers Magnus Henrekson at the Research Institute for Industrial Economics, Christian Sandstrom at Jonkoping International Business School and Carl Alm at the Ratio Institute, this is an example of the ""environmental nationalism"" that benefits one country, but not the world.
They estimate that if Sweden exported the renewable energy it would use to make hydrogen to Poland and Germany instead - so they could cut back on coal-fired power - overall CO2 emissions would fall by 10 to 12 times more than by making ""green"" steel.
The EU's carbon border levy, meanwhile, is only due to be phased in from 2026, potentially too late to have a bearing on the fate of Cementa's Slite limestone quarry.
Sweden's parliament has agreed to a government proposal to tweak the country's environmental laws to give Cementa a stay of execution, but no long-term solution is in sight.
Environmentalists such as David Kihlberg, climate head at the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, say easing regulations gives industries an excuse to put off changes that need to happen now.

""It would be incredibly destructive for climate diplomacy if Sweden came to the top climate meeting in Glasgow and said our climate policy is to increase emissions and the local environmental impact in order to pull the rug from under Chinese cement producers,"" he said, referring to a hypothetical scenario that is not Swedish policy.
""The climate question is global and has to be solved by cooperation between countries.""

LONDON (Reuters) - With electric car sales soaring and regulations increasingly favouring zero-emission vehicles, a flurry of announcements on Monday showed how the global auto industry has kicked into a higher gear as it races to speed past the fossil-fuel car era.
As part of its own 30 billion euro ($34.7 billion) electrification plan Stellantis - born out of a merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler earlier this year - said it had entered a preliminary agreement with battery maker LG Energy Solution to produce battery cells and modules for North America, where the world's No. 4 automaker expects more than 40% of its U.S. sales will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030.
That follows a recent announcement that  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) will take a 33% stake in battery cell manufacturer Automotive Cells Company (ACC), founded in 2020 by Stellantis and TotalEnergies in 2020.
Carmakers are racing to secure battery supplies as they switch to electric, with dozens of new battery plants planned across Europe and America.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's plans to go electric in Europe received a boost on Monday as the company said it would invest up to 230 million pounds ($316 million) to retool an engine factory in northern England to produce electric car power units instead of combustion-engine transmissions.
The No. 2 U.S. carmaker has said its car lineup in Europe will be all-electric by 2030.
Companies like Mercedes-Benz Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) maker have warned that shifting to electric will cost jobs at combustion-engine plants, so Ford's announcement is a boost for workers making fossil-fuel engines at its Halewood plant near Liverpool.
The shift to electric has also been accompanied by changes in the automotive landscape, with a large number of startups hoping to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
That has attracted the attention of Taiwan's Foxconn, which has ambitious plans to diversify away from its role of building consumer electronics for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tech firms.
Indeed, Foxconn unveiled its first three EV prototypes on Monday - an SUV, a sedan and a bus - made by Foxtron, a venture between Foxconn and Taiwanese car maker Yulon Motor Co Ltd.
It first mentioned its EV ambitions less than two years ago and has moved relatively quickly, this year announcing deals to build cars with U.S. startup Fisker Inc and Thailand's energy group PTT Pcl.
The need for speed was also a reason Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) had Tesla CEO Elon Musk address top executives at the German carmaker over the weekend.

Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s CEO Herbert Diess has made no secret of his ambitions to chase and overtake Tesla, the world's leading electric carmaker. 
But in a Linkedin post, Diess said he had invited Musk as a ""surprise guest"" to drive home the point that VW needs faster decisions and less bureaucracy for what he called the biggest transformation in the company's history.

Investing.com – Shares of luxury good makers were trading weaker in European markets Monday following disappointing GDP growth figures from the world’s second biggest economy.
LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Kering  (PA:PRTP), the company behind Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Hermes (PA:HRMS) all traded around 3% lower in Paris.
China grew 4.9% in the third quarter when the expectation called for a 5.2% expansion, according to Reuters.
Supply chain bottlenecks and major upheavals in the property market made it the weakest clip for the world’s biggest market for luxury goods since the third quarter of 2020.
Overall industrial output rose just 3.1% in September from a year earlier, marking the slowest growth since March 2020 when the pandemic was sweeping through parts of the country.
Traders looked through a modest rebound in retail sales in September, amid concerns that the structural issues weighing on the Chinese market, including the fate of Evergrande, once China’s largest property developer, will continue to weaken sales in what is the most important national market for the luxury sector.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>","Stellantis, LGES strike battery production deal for North America","(Reuters) -Stellantis NV has struck a preliminary deal with battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES) to produce battery cells and modules for North America, as the world's No. 4 automaker rolls out its 30 billion euro ($35 billion) electrification plan.
Global automakers are investing billions of euros to accelerate a transition to low-emission mobility and prepare for a progressive phase-out of internal combustion engines.
Stellantis and LGES's joint venture will produce battery cells and modules at a new facility with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt hours (GWh), the two firms said on Monday. No financial details of the deal were provided.
The plant is scheduled to start production by the first quarter of 2024, with groundbreaking expected in the second quarter of 2022, the companies said in their statement. Its location is under review and will be announced later.
Stellantis, formed in January from the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, has said it wants to secure more than 130 GWh of global battery capacity by 2025 and more than 260 GWh by 2030.
The batteries produced under the deal will supply Stellantis' U.S., Canadian and Mexican assembly plants for installation in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, supporting its goal of e-vehicles making up more than 40% of its U.S. sales by 2030.
The company, whose brands include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat, Opel and U.S. best-sellers Jeep and Ram, earlier this year announced it would invest more than 30 billion euros through 2025 on electrifying its vehicle lineup. 
Stellantis has said it would build three battery plants in Europe and two in North America, including at least one in the United States.
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) analyst Monica Bosio said the deal was positive, and a further step ahead in Stellantis' electrification process. 
It comes weeks after Stellantis and its partner TotalEnergies agreed to open up their battery cell joint venture ACC to Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), to expand their European sourcing of battery cells.

Stellantis is also targeting more than 70% of sales in Europe to be of low-emission vehicles by 2030, and aims to make the total cost of owning an EV equal to that of a gasoline-powered model by 2026.

The optimism of mom-and-pop traders is causing many institutional investors who share Morgan Stanley’s cautious view to “cover and chase,” strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a note. That’s keeping the S&P 500 index within striking distance of last month’s record, even as supply and cost issues appear to be more persistent for both businesses and the consumer, they said.
“This divergence between markets and confidence must be resolved over the next few months one way or another,” the strategists wrote.
Wilson has repeatedly forecast a 10% to 20% correction in U.S. stocks this year, as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorates. Though last week he gave some ground and pushed out out his prediction for a peak-to-trough decline of at least 10% for the S&P 500 from the fall to early next year.
While Morgan Stanley’s bearish view is shared by some strategists, such as Bank of America Corp., others including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have said that concerns over stagflation are overblown and continue to recommend buying the dip.

Investing.com – ADRs of Philips (NYSE:PHG) fell 1.7% in Monday’s premarket trading as the medical devices giant lowered its annual outlook after sales declined in the third quarter.
The company struggled with a shortage of critical components that go into its equipment and warned the headwinds would continue in the fourth quarter. To make matters worse, Philips also had to deal with a massive recall of its respiratory devices, an exercise that has so far cost it more than $600 million since it first provisioned for it more than six months ago.
The recall affected the sale of certain breathing devices and respirators. Combined with shortage of raw materials, this pulled group sales down by around 8% to 4.2 billion euro ($4.87 billion).
Adjusted third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and amortization totaled 512 million euros, or around 12% of sales, compared to 684 million euros in the same quarter last year, or about 16% of sales.
The Dutch company now expects to deliver around 2% comparable sales growth with a modest adjusted EBITA margin improvement for the full year.
The earlier forecast aimed at around 4% sales growth with an adjusted EBITA margin improvement of 70 basis points at center of the guidance range. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street banks have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic-era trading boom, fueled by the Federal Reserve's massive injection of cash into financial markets. 
With the central bank nearing the time when it will start winding down its asset purchases, banks are set to profit again as increased volatility encourages clients to buy and sell more stocks and bonds, analysts, investors and executives say.
The Fed has been buying up government-backed bonds since March 2020, adding $4 trillion to its balance sheet, as part of an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The strategy was designed to stabilize financial markets and ensure companies and other borrowers had sufficient access to capital. It succeeded but also resulted in unprecedented levels of liquidity, helping equity and bond traders enjoy their most profitable period since the 2007-09 financial crisis.
The top five Wall Street investment banks -  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) - made an additional $51 billion in trading revenues last year and in the first three quarters of 2021, compared with the comparative quarters in the year prior to COVID, according to company earnings statements.
The trading bonanza, along with a boom in global deal-making, has helped bank stocks outperform the broader market. The KBW Bank index has risen by 40% in the year-to-date compared with a 19% advance in the S&P 500.
Now, banks with large trading businesses are expected to profit a second time as the Fed starts to withdraw the stimulus, prompting investors to rejig their portfolios again.
""As investors look to position based on that volatility, that creates an opportunity for us to make markets for them. And obviously that would lend itself to improved performance,"" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters this week.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in late September that tapering was imminent. An official announcement is expected in November and the central bank has signaled it will look to halt asset purchases completely by mid-2022 - a timetable seen by some investors as aggressive.
Banks have already benefited from enhanced volatility since Powell's comments in late September, which led to a spike in Treasury yields and a decline in equity markets. That led to a pick-up in trading volumes at the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth quarter, executives say. 
""It is possible we will see bouts of volatility associated with the tapering,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview Thursday, adding that she doesn't expect a repeat of 2013's 'taper tantrum.'
At that time, the Fed's decision to put the brakes on a quantitative easing program sent markets into a frenzy as investors dumped riskier assets in favor of 'safe havens,' leading to a spike in government bond yields and sharp falls in equity markets.
Fed officials are confident of avoiding that scenario this time around by giving markets enough advance warning of their intentions. 
""The sweet spot is where you have some volatility but not enough to disrupt the broader capital markets which have been an important contributor to healthy trading results over the past year,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.
Third-quarter results from the biggest U.S. banks this week showed strong performances in equities trading, boosted by stocks hitting record highs, but a more subdued showing in bond trading reflecting calm in those markets. 

Investors are anticipating activity will ramp up again in the run-up to tapering, when it eventually begins. 
""It will certainly be a positive,"" said Patrick Kaser at Brandywine Global Investment Management. ""Volatility is a friend to trading businesses.""

Investing.com – ADRs of Valneva (NASDAQ:VALN) climbed more than 31% in Monday’s premarket as the company said the phase-3 trials of a prospective vaccine against Covid-19 vaccine had shown positive results.
The trials pitted Valneva’s candidate against the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine that is among the six most widely used in the world against Covid. Valneva claims the results showed its candidate has superior neutralizing antibody levels compared to the British firm’s vaccine.
The outcome may suggest that both vaccines used in the study prevented severe Covid-19 caused by the circulating variants including the predominant Delta, Valneva said.
Valneva said it is preparing for trials in children 5-12 and a booster trial to evaluate the vaccine, VLA2001’s, booster performance for people in need of it.
The company has commenced submission for initial approval with the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and is preparing to initiate the same with the European Medicines Agency.
The announcement comes only weeks after the U.K. cancelled a provisional order of 100 million doses of the drug alleging that the company had violated its contract. Valneva had denied the allegations at the time and outside observers had seen the move as motivated in part by friction between the U.K. and French government over mutual implementation of the Brexit agreement and a bilateral agreement on policing migrant flows across the English Channel. 
The stock had lost more than half its value in reaction to the U.K.'s move, but has now around half of those losses.

Investing.com -- U.S. investors are split over the future of clean energy according to a new Investing.com survey, which revealed that 46% see ""similarities between today’s green energy sector and the dotcom crash of 2000.""
According to the survey of more than 1,200 respondents, 70% of investors are disappointed with clean energy’s performance under President Joe Biden thus far - including 41% who said the investments have “fallen significantly short” of their expectations. That said, just 13% confirmed that they will sell their clean energy investments now, less than a year into Biden’s presidency.
President Joe Biden’s climate plan, including more than $2 billion in proposed spending on clean energy projects for Fiscal Year 2022, was widely projected to spur a boom in clean energy investments and the overall performance of that sector. 31% of respondents attributed the sector’s underperformance to Biden's clean energy agenda “not living up to his campaign's promises”, and 29% cited supply chain issues associated with the reopening of the economy following the COVID-19 lockdown. More than 90% expressed that clean energy stocks’ performance are connected to government policy, including 46% who described that connection as “strong.”
""The underperformance of many clean energy stocks this year comes as investors book some profits, following the sector’s significant gains throughout 2020,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “As the trade became progressively more crowded in Q1 of this year, the smart money - which poured into the sector even before Biden was elected - headed for the exits.”
Of the survey respondents, 45% identified as having investments in clean energy stocks or ETFs. One in five of those invested, introduced clean energy into their portfolios after Biden was elected president, while about 1 in 4 specifically made these investments due to their perceptions surrounding the sector’s growth potential under Biden.
Among those who have avoided clean energy investments, almost 30% did so due to skepticism over the sector’s potential in the market regardless of who is serving as U.S. president, while 22% were driven away from the investments specifically because they believe Biden’s policies will not have a positive impact on the sector. 28% of respondents said the performance of clean energy stocks in 2021 has reinforced their stance against these investments - although nearly half (47%) said this year’s events have made no impact on their outlook.
Moving forward, the survey found that there is at least some optimism regarding clean energy investments. Nearly 70% of investors anticipated some degree of growth in the sector’s value in the coming year, although 29% predicted that value would increase by less than 10%. About 14% expect a stagnant year in which the sector will remain at its current value.

173,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>","Before debt woes, China Evergrande's ambitious car making goals stunned industry","SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - At the Shanghai Auto Show in April, the booth for China Evergrande Group's new energy vehicle (NEV) unit was hard to miss.
One of the largest exhibitions at the event, in a prime spot opposite BMW, the property developer-backed unit showed off nine concept vehicle models under its brand ""Hengchi"", which translates to ""eternally speeding."" 
""There has never been a car company that has been able to deliver such a diversified product line in such a short amount of time,"" Daniel Kirchert, who joined Evergrande NEV days before the auto show as vice president, told industry executives and reporters in a speech at the event.
Analysts and industry executives say there have long been questions about how Evergrande NEV, founded in 2019, would meet its ambitious goals - chairman Hui Ka Yan had declared that it wanted to sell one million EVs a year by 2025, a level Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is only expected to hit this year after 18 years of operation.
Six months after the auto show, the doubts are stronger than ever as the company's parent wrestles with more than $300 billion in liabilities. 
""Those targets would be really aggressive, nearly impossible to achieve even for established, well-managed automotive companies because of the capital and human resources required to even attempt executing on the plan,"" said Tu Le, an auto analyst at Sino Auto Insights. 
Between 2019 to 2021, Evergrande's NEV arm raised more than 50 billion yuan ($7.78 billion) from its parent, as well as investors such as Sequoia Capital China, ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc and Alibaba-linked fund Yunfeng Capital.
It has announced 14 models and plans to have 10 factories across China and Sweden. So far, it has built or is constructing six, including one in Shanghai. A recent Reuters visit there found about 20 Hengchi electric vehicles for testing parked outside. But the company has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. 
In comparison, Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), two of China's most successful NEV startups by sales, struggled to raise money in their early years, and raised a combined $7.3 billion through stock market listings and pre-IPO fundraising. 
Nio has four models and is building its second factory. Xpeng has three and is expanding production sites to four from current two. Tesla sells four models and has four car plants.
Evergrande NEV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'CARS ON PAPER'
Lofty goals and investor bullishness in March helped push Evergrande NEV's market capitalisation to over HK$700 billion ($89.99 billion) - a value greater than that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Its market capitalisation has since slumped to about HK$38 billion.
The company has managed to lure top executives from auto giants, such as designer Walter De Silva and battery scientist Junesoo Lee from SK. Kirchert had been chief executive at Byton, another Chinese EV startup struggling in a crowded sector. He did not respond to a request for comment. 
But the rapid expansion also prompted criticism from Beijing, including Chinese state news agency Xinhua, which in March singled the company out as an example of the problems with the industry. 
""The vast market potential has given birth to some 'powerpoint car companies' that 'make cars' on paper,"" Xinhua said in a report on the high valuations about electric carmakers. 
Evergrande NEV warned in stock exchange filings last month that it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses. 
It also ended plans to issue shares in China's mainland and said in an exchange filing that it had failed to pay some plant construction suppliers. A memo seen by Reuters also showed that it has instructed contract workers to stop working at Shanghai factory from September. 
But three sources familiar with the matter say the company is not abandoning the project, and is in talks with external investors to pay for the project, leveraging precious production licenses it has obtained through an acquisition and land linked to the auto projects. 
On Monday, it told suppliers and local authorities in the coastal city of Tianjin, where it is building a car plant, that management would make sure it began mass production next year. 
Last week, its Swedish vehicle unit, National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB, told Reuters it is in talks with U.S. and European venture capital firms and industrial partners to find new owners. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the unit could be valued at as much as $1 billion.

Optimism for the third quarter earnings season has provided a timely boost for equity markets, which flirted with correction territory in September.
World stocks have just enjoyed their biggest one-week rally since June with Wall Street's favourite gauge of volatility, the VIX index, tumbling.
Earnings for the S&P 500 and Europe's STOXX 600 are currently expected to rise 32% and 46% respectively and, so far, companies which have already reported results have exceeded expectations overall.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)'s 66% surge in profit on Friday, courtesy of a big wave of M&A and IPOs, came after the four largest U.S. consumer banks also shone.
But now as Europe waits on blue chips such as ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) to enter the arena and for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to kick off the reporting for the 'FAANG' group, the mood may be souring again.
Philips on Monday lowered its outlook as parts shortages bite and over on Wall Street, there are now more downward than upward revisions, suggesting Q3 enthusiasm may have reached its peak.
Data showing that China's economy hit its slowest pace in a year due to power shortages, supply chain bottlenecks and property market wobbles, has dampened the mood and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan is losing 0.4%.
Futures for European and U.S. equities are also in negative territory while Brent crude oil prices are trading well above $85 a barrel after hitting their highest price since October 2018.
Elsewhere bitcoin is above $62,000 with the first American bitcoin futures ETF expected to begin trading this week amid global inflation worries.
Prices are rising too quickly for policymakers' tastes and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on Sunday warned investors that he and his colleagues ""will have to act"".
Investors are speculating that the BoE might become the first of the world's biggest central banks to raise rates, later this year or early in 2022.
Central bank action will be closely watched this week with a meeting in Turkey, Hungary expected to nudge up its benchmark on Tuesday and Russia's central bank to follow on Friday.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
-- China's economy stumbles on power crunch, property woes
-- -Philips lowers outlook as recall, parts shortages bite
-- Bitcoin hovers near 6-month high on ETF hopes, inflation worries

-- UK RightMove house prices

175,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",Energy and commods hedge funds post big gains as prices skyrocket,"By Maiya Keidan and Julia Payne
TORONTO/LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds that bet on a big comeback for commodities enjoyed soaring returns in the first nine months of 2021 as the world faced an energy crunch.
The average global macro commodities hedge fund is up 23.2% for the first nine months of the year, according to data provider PivotalPath, a period that saw the average equity energy hedge fund rise 12.3%.
Lockdowns and curtailed travel during the pandemic, along with a shift to renewable energy, led to underinvestment in oil and gas just as fossil-fuel demand rebounded sharply, boosting prices for fuels worldwide. 
Last week, Brent oil futures hit a three-year high at $85 a barrel. Natural gas and power prices have soared, particularly in Europe, where earlier this month benchmark wholesale gas futures at the Dutch TTF hub were up 400% from the start of the year. 
Those markets have been volatile, particularly natural gas, where volatility measures hit a record this month. Trend-following hedge funds enjoyed strong gains in September from natural gas, according to UBS.
London-based long-short hedge fund Westbeck Capital Management, which runs $230 million in assets under management, made 17.2% in September, bringing year-to-date returns to 94%, a firm spokesman told Reuters.
Westbeck went into September with long bets on exploration and production companies, particularly in Canada, including Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources, Baytex Energy (NYSE:BTE) Corp and MEG Energy (OTC:MEGEF) Corp, according to its August investment letter seen by Reuters. The fund noted the summer pullback in oil and oil equities was a great buying opportunity.
U.K.-based Odey Asset Management made 40% between the start of the year and Oct. 15 in its long-short equities fund, which also bets on commodities. Auspice Capital, a Canadian computer-driven commodities-focused fund, landed returns of 30.5% in the year to Oct. 14.
""Demand could soften in the next decade as the world transitions to green energy, but in the near term $100-150 oil is not off the table,"" said Tim Pickering, the fund's chief investment officer. ""On an inflation adjusted basis, the price of oil is low. Volatility will likely remain high.""
London and Malta-based Andurand Capital Management has also had a stellar year with one of its two funds rising 83% so far this year after a big 20% bounce in September, Reuters reported on Oct. 5.
Current investor position leaves room for oil to run higher, analysts said. Managed funds currently have a net long position of more than 327,000 U.S. crude contracts on the NYMEX, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
That's still well short of this summer's level of bullishness, according to RBC Capital Markets data, leaving room for more investors to stake out long positions. 

""I certainly believe we're going to get to triple digits,"" said David D. Tawil, co-founder at New York-based event-driven hedge fund, Maglan Capital, and interim CEO of Centaurus Energy (OTC:CTARF).
Tawil, who declined to provide his performance data, said the rally will be driven by coronavirus restrictions being lifted, rising inflation and increased winter demand.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -AirAsia X Bhd (AAX) is proposing to pay just 0.5% of debt owed to each of its creditors and to terminate all existing contracts so that it can restructure 33.65 billion ringgit ($8.1 billion) of liabilities, a document seen by Reuters shows.
The Malaysian low-cost long-haul airline, a sister carrier to cash-strapped AirAsia Group Bhd, said in a stock exchange filing on Monday it had set a date of Nov. 12 for creditor meetings to vote on the restructuring proposal.
""To avoid a liquidation and to allow the airline to fly again, the only option is for AAX to undertake the proposed debt restructuring,"" the airline said in a 127-page explanatory statement for the creditors meeting seen by Reuters.
Half of the total liability is the cost of terminating airplane orders from its largest creditor Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) for 78 A330neo widebodies and 30 A321neo narrowbodies, the document said.
AAX also proposed that if it were to garner more than 300 million ringgit ($72 million) in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, lease rentals and restructuring costs during its 2023-2026 financial years, all creditors except Airbus would be entitled to 20% of those earnings.
It is one of many carriers in the Asia-Pacific region to have entered a court-overseen debt restructuring process to survive the pandemic. Others include Malaysia Airlines, Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Philippine Airlines.
The 0.5% of debt owed to each creditor will be paid from operating cash flow one year after the debt restructuring goes into effect, the airline said in the document.
AAX also said it is in negotiations with lessors of 29 planes and certain other creditors on commercial terms for continued or future business relationships.
It is giving lessors the option of continuing to lease planes to AAX on new terms or to accept the termination of the lease and have the relevant planes returned. Two lessors have already indicated they want to terminate the leases, AAX said in the document.
The airline added its scheme aims to arrive at a business and debt structure which is sustainable and to strengthen the group's financial position.
To gain approval for its proposal, AAX needs agreement from creditors holding at least 75% of the total debt value in each of three classes of creditors. 
Airbus, which on its own forms one creditor class, declined to comment, citing the ongoing restructuring process.
AAX said several other creditors, including suppliers and lessors, had already indicated they were in favour of the proposal. AAX CEO Benyamin Ismail in September told Reuters that all creditors had indicated they want to see the airline proceed with its restructuring.
The airline plans to raise 500 million ringgit https://www.reuters.com/article/airasia-x-fundraising-idUSL1N2IU0SV after its debt restructuring through a rights issue and share subscription.

AirAsia and its founders own some 43% of AAX. AirAsia this month reached a deal with Airbus to restructure an order for 362 narrowbody planes. It has also received approval from Malaysia's only financial guarantee issuer for a loan of up to 500 million ringgit with an 80% government guarantee.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Sunday told workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery their six-month lockout will end if they ratify the company's contract offer or remove the United Steelworkers union (USW) as their representative.
""As we have told the Union, the conditions which would end the lockout remain the same: the company will end the lockout when we have a signed, ratified agreement,"" Exxon said in a message posted on-line.
""This has not changed, and anything said to the contrary is untrue. Additionally, if employees were to decertify, the company would return employees to work.""
Decertification is the process to remove a union from representing employees at a given location. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is reviewing a petition signed by at least 30% of the locked-out workers that could lead to a vote to decertify USW Local 13-243 in Beaumont as their representative. No date for a vote has been set.
Workers at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant, which makes Mobil 1 motor oil, are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the company's contract offer.
Bryan Gross, USW international representative, said the company chose to begin the lockout on May 1. 
""The company asked, 'What has the union done?' The union has helped with groceries, assisted with bills, and is now providing health insurance for all of the 'world-class employees' at a multi-billion dollar oil company put on the street instead of bargaining in good faith for a fair contract,"" Gross said on Sunday. 
The USW has urged workers at the refinery to reject the contract offer in Tuesday's vote.

The union filled a complaint with the NLRB in June alleging the purpose of the lockout was to remove the union. 
Exxon said it began the lockout to prevent the disruption of a possible strike.

The comments on Thursday by Musk to a VW managers gathering in Alpbach, Austria, confirmed by Diess via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1449333401048293378 on Saturday after a report in Handelsblatt daily, included praise of VW for being an ""icon"" and Tesla's greatest challenger, Handelsblatt said.
The paper said that when asked by Diess why Tesla was more nimble than its rivals, Musk said it came down to his management style and that he is an engineer, first of all, and has an eye for supply chains, logistics and production.
In a post on Linkedin, Diess added that he had brought in Musk as a ""surprise guest"" to drive home the point that VW needs faster decisions and less bureaucracy for what he called the biggest transformation in VW's history. 
""Happy to hear that even our strongest competitor thinks that we will succeed (in) the transition if we drive the transformation with full power,"" Diess said on Linkedin. 
As an example of Tesla's prowess, Diess said it took the rival only two to three weeks to rewrite software to allow for a switch from one type of microchip, which went out of stock, to another.
Diess said in his Saturday tweet that VW, which has emerged as the main contender to Tesla for global electric vehicle supremacy, would continue its dialogue with Tesla.
""We will visit you soon in Gruenheide,"" the CEO said.
Diess warned last month that the planned opening of Tesla's car factory at Gruenheide near Berlin, the company's first in Europe, will force local industry to step up its game against the fast-growing U.S. electric vehicle maker.

Tesla is awaiting final building approval for the 5.8 billion euro ($6.8 billion) German site.
VW, in turn, plans to build six large battery factories in Europe by 2030 as part of an all-in bet on electric mobility.

The migration of its onshore business units to GSGH from Beijing Gao Hua Securities was underway, it added.
""This marks the start of a new chapter for our China business following a successful 17-year joint venture,"" Goldman Sachs said in a statement.
It becomes the second Wall Street firm to be granted approval to shift to full ownership of its securities business after JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) moved to 100% in August https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-gets-beijings-approval-first-fully-foreign-owned-brokerage-2021-08-06. 
Securities businesses in China typically house investment banking, research, equities and fixed income businesses.
Unlike most of the other China JVs, Goldman had day-to-day operational control of its business even with its minority ownership.
Lucrative underwriting fees on equity and bond transactions - especially initial public offerings (IPOs) - in China's expanding capital markets has been the driving force for Western banks to increase stakes in their mainland business.
Full ownership could allow foreign banks to expand their operations in the multi-trillion-dollar Chinese financial sector, and better integrate them with their global businesses.

Shares of Australia's largest airport operator, which has risen about 44% since receiving the first buyout proposal in July, was down by nearly 1% at A$8.29 by 0251 GMT.
SAA is comprised of Australian investors IFM Investors, QSuper and AustralianSuper and U.S.-based Global Infrastructure Partners.

The nine-episode thriller, in which cash-strapped contestants play childhood games with deadly consequences in a bid to win 45.6 billion won ($38.58 million), became an international hit after it launched last month. 
In comparison to its estimated net worth, the show cost just $21.4 million to produce, Bloomberg said.

Netflix had earlier announced the show had amassed 111 million fans, but Bloomberg said those figures were based on slightly older data.
Los Gatos, California-based Netflix estimated that 89% of people who started the show watched more than one episode, the news agency said, and 66% of the viewers finished watching the series in the first 23 days.
Netflix declined to comment on the report. An attorney for the company told Bloomberg that it would be inappropriate for Bloomberg to disclose the confidential data contained in the documents that it had reviewed.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning, as energy prices continue to soar and add to inflationary pressure concerns.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.66% by 10:31 PM ET (2:31 AM GMT) and the SZSE Component fell 1.10%. Data released earlier in the day said that the GDP grew a smaller-than-expected 0.2% quarter-on-quarter and 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021.
Industrial production grew 3.1% year-on-year, retail sales grew 4.4% year-on-year in September and the unemployment rate was at 4.9%.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.30% and South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.10%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.28%.
With the Chinese data closely watched to gauge the severity of a global energy crunch in the country, People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang Yi said on Sunday that China's economy was ""doing well"", but it faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement”.
However, the risks posed to the Chinese economy and financial system from China Evergrande Group’s debt woes can be contained, he added.
Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the consumer price index grew a higher-than-expected 4.9% year-on-year and 2.2% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter.
Despite the increasing risk appetite, concerns about inflation amid a continuing global energy crunch and uneven economic recovery from COVID-19 continue to weigh on investor sentiment. This comes as key central banks prepare to begin asset tapering.
“Sentiment really got quite bearish. Markets are feeling reasonably emboldened by the fact that we are probably going to see some reasonably robust results from U.S. corporates this quarter.” IG Group market analyst Kyle Rodda told Bloomberg.
“But the longer-term issue remains what is happening with the global supply shock brought upon by COVID-19, the inflation pressure that’s coming about from that, and the very fine line that the U.S. Federal Reserve is walking to try and tamp down these inflation risks, while at the same time not stepping on the recovery or undermining financial market strength.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will take part in a policy panel discussion on Friday. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank will “have to act” to curb inflationary pressure and warned that higher energy costs will mean price pressures will continue."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Michigan judge has thrown out a lawsuit that General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) filed against Stellantis' Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) that accused its rival of fraud and unfair competition.
GM sued FCA in 2019, alleging it bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.
    Wayne County Circuit Judge David Allen on Friday dismissed GM's state court lawsuit, which also named two former FCA executives who previously pleaded guilty in a Justice Department bribery probe.
The judge said that GM ""failed to adequately demonstrate that FCA caused it any actual, legally recognizable harm through its bribery scheme.""
    Allen noted that GM's allegations against FCA spanned more than a decade, dating back to 2009, adding: ""Even the most enthralling drama must eventually reach a conclusion. This one is no exception.""
GM's lawsuit had sought ""damages in an amount to be determined at trial, including but not limited to the billions of dollars in damages GM suffered.""
    Stellantis spokeswoman Shawn Morgan said on Sunday: ""As we have said from the date the original lawsuit was filed, it is meritless. The courts once again agreed and dismissed GM’s complaint.""
    A GM spokesman said on Sunday: ""We respectfully disagree with the ruling and are considering our legal options.""
In July 2020, U.S. District Judge Paul Borman rejected GM's federal racketeering lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-fiat-chrysler-lawsuit-idUSKBN24930S that made parallel bribery claims against FCA. GM's appeal of Borman's ruling is pending.

(Reuters) - A late-stage trial of Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s experimental treatment for an inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) failed to reach its main goal, but secondary measures and biomarkers showed favorable trends, the company said on Sunday.
Biogen will engage with regulators and other stakeholders ""to understand the meaningfulness of this data and potential paths forward,"" Toby Ferguson, head of the neuromuscular development unit at Biogen, told Reuters. The company is treating trial patients in a follow-on study and recently launched a Phase 3 trial of the drug, tofersen, in patients who are not yet experiencing ALS symptoms. 
Tofersen, administered directly into the spinal canal each month, is designed to suppress the production of SOD1, a protein that can accumulate to toxic levels in ALS patients with mutations in a specific gene. Around 2% of ALS cases are believed to be caused by the genetic mutation.
After 28 weeks of treatment, the 108-patient trial showed a 1.2-point difference on a scale evaluating functional status for patients with fast-progressing ALS who were given tofersen compared to placebo patients, which was not statistically significant. In the group of patients with slower-progressing disease, the difference was 1.4 points.
An improvement of at least 2 points would be clinically meaningful, Guggenheim Partners said in a recent research report.
Biogen also detailed results from secondary trial endpoints, including breathing ability and muscular strength, indicating that patients treated with tofersen fared better than placebo patients, and that placebo patients switched to the drug in the extension phase of the study experienced similar gains. 
""Despite the fact that there was no statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint, there is a clinical signal here,"" said Dr. Timothy Miller, the study's lead investigator and ALS Center Director at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. He presented the tofersen data at the annual meeting of the American Neurological Association.
The trial also showed that patients given tofersen had lower levels of SOD1 protein compared to placebo patients, as well as lower levels of plasma neurofilament light chain, a potential marker of nerve cell degeneration.
""That suggests that there is an effect on clinical function of the person,"" Dr. Miller said.
Most side effects in trial patients were mild to moderate, including headache and back pain, but two patients experienced spinal cord inflammation, and 5.6% of tofersen patients dropped out of the study.
Globally, around 168,000 people have ALS, a fatal neurological disorder also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Around 10% of cases are linked to genetic mutations, including SOD1.

Biogen, which licensed tofersen from Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) Inc, now plans to open early access to the drug to all patients with SOD1-associated ALS. In countries allowing such programs, patients can access a medicine free of charge before it is licensed commercially.
Shares of Biogen have fallen by about a third after hitting $414 in early June on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's controversial approval of Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm. The agency's decision to approve the drug based on evidence that it removes protein plaques associated with the brain-wasting disease, rather than proof that it improves cognition, led to a backlash that has curtailed use of the medication while Medicare, the U.S. health plan for seniors, works to develop payment terms.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2021 09:40AM ET</span>",Merck COVID-19 pill sparks calls for access for lower income countries,"By Francesco Guarascio and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - The plan to roll out Merck & Co's promising antiviral pill to treat COVID-19 risks repeating the inequities of vaccine distribution, potentially leaving the nations with the greatest need once again at the back of the line, international health groups say.
For example, only about 5% of Africa’s population is immunized, creating an urgent need for therapeutics that could keep people out of hospitals. That compares with more than a 70% inoculation rate in most wealthy nations.
Merck on Oct 11 applied for U.S. emergency clearance of the first pill for COVID-19 after it cut hospitalizations and deaths by 50% in a large clinical trial. The medicine, made with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could gain authorization as soon as December.
The U.S. drugmaker has taken the unusual pandemic step of licensing several generics of its antiviral molnupiravir before its branded version was even authorized for marketing.
But international health officials said even that is not enough for the medicine to reach many in low- and middle-income countries in large enough numbers, while noting shortcomings and red tape among global organizations that could further slow distribution.
Merck this year plans to produce 10 million treatment courses of the pill, which is taken twice a day for five days, and another 20 million next year. 
In addition, its licensing deals with eight Indian drugmakers will allow cheaper generic versions for 109 low- and middle-income countries including in Africa, a move international groups acknowledge is a positive concession.
But as wealthy nations secure molnupiravir supply deals - the United States has already locked up 1.7 million courses with an option for 3.5 million more by January of 2023 at about $700 per course - concerns grow over who might be left out.
NOT MOVING QUICKLY ENOUGH 
Merck said it has worked on the technology transfer needed to start generic manufacturing, in contrast to vaccine makers who continue to resist calls to waive patents or allow for generic versions to boost supplies.
But a recent report prepared for the United Nations' Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator program tasked with buying COVID-19 therapeutics for poor countries cited concerns that U.N. agencies were not moving quickly enough to secure adequate volumes of potential new treatments ahead of time, including Merck's drug.
Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP), a United Nations-backed public health organization, has 24 companies signed up and willing to make the drug if Merck agrees to expand the licenses.
“If you're not in the license, you're relying on Merck, and it looks to us that that could mean a potential supply shortfall as well as overpricing,"" said Peter Maybarduk of Public Citizen, who sits on the MPP governance board. He suggested that could lead to wealthy countries outbidding poor nations for the medicine.
It is unclear how many generic pills will be available or when. The licensed Indian manufacturers including Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla Ltd, Dr. Reddy’s Labs, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Sun Pharmaceuticals, and Torrent Pharmaceuticals declined to provide details on production plans. 
In addition, manufacturing for low-income countries in many nations also requires World Health Organization (WHO) approval, a regulatory process that typically takes months.
Merck said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country’s ability to pay. A spokesperson confirmed it is in discussions about expanding licenses for generic molnupiravir ""to build sufficient global supply of quality-assured product to meet orders globally.""
But middle-income countries will be hard pressed to negotiate against the richest nations, another MPP official said.
The governments of Australia, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia said they already had deals or were negotiating supply contracts with Merck. The EU is considering buying the pill after Merck applies for authorization in Europe.

The eight generic manufacturers chosen by Merck all have WHO pre-qualified facilities to allow them to supply buyers like the Global Fund, according to Paul Schaper, Merck's executive director of global public policy. They will set their pricing and decide how much they plan to manufacture.
“What we are anticipating and hoping for is that they will compete with each other on pricing,”  Schaper said.

Support for the conservative OVP has crashed from 34% to 26% in the wake of the affair, according to the survey published by newspaper Kurier on Sunday.
The outcome puts the party, which installed former foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg as the new chancellor, only marginally ahead of the opposition Social Democrats (SPO)'s approval rating of 24%, the paper said.
Kurz, 35, quit as chancellor under pressure from his junior coalition party, the Greens, after prosecutors placed him under investigation on suspicion of various degrees of bribery, corruption and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing.
Kurz remains leader of his party and is now also its top lawmaker in parliament, triggering opposition claims he is still exercising power behind the scenes.
Some 71% of the people questioned in the Kurier survey thought Kurz's resignation as chancellor was justified, with only 22% saying it was unwarranted.
Anti-corruption prosecutors say they suspect conservative officials then in the Finance Ministry of using state funds to pay for manipulated polling and coverage favourable to Kurz to appear in a newspaper starting in 2016, when he was seeking to become party leader. 
A poll by Unique Research for Profil magazine published on Saturday also showed how the Kurz affair has damaged the OVP.

The conservatives polled only 25% with Schallenberg as candidate, 10% down on earlier polls and the same level as the Social Democrats.
Two thirds of respondents told the Unique Research poll they thought there was substance to the allegations against Kurz, while 23% said they thought there was nothing to the affair.

AutoSAP said domestic passenger car production dropped by 53.1% in September year-on-year, to 56,157 cars.
It said the chip shortage impact would exceed that of pandemic shutdowns last year, and called on the government to activate an aid programme created amid the coronavirus pandemic last year to compensate firms for wages of idled workers.
AutoSAP said production rose 2.9% year--on-year cumulatively in the January-September period to 831,653 cars.
""Already since August, production has been significantly affected by output curbs and the September statistic confirms the negative trend,"" AutoSAP said.
The country's biggest producer, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) 's Skoda Auto, has said it would significantly limit or shut production at its Czech plants from next week, possibly until the end of the year.
The car sector is the backbone of the highly industrialised Czech economy, employing 180,000 workers, and makes up a quarter of industrial output.
SAP said 120 billion crowns in revenue would be lost at car makers and a further 80 billion at parts suppliers. The 200 billion crowns in revenue equals to about 3.3% of the country's expected nominal gross domestic product this year.
The other car makers with assembly plants in the Czech Republic are Hyundai -- which has been the least affected by the chip shortage -- and Toyota .

In an interview with weekly Journal du Dimanche, Oudea called 2021 an atypical year, citing a very low cost of risk, which reflects provisions against bad loans, a strong post-pandemic economic rebound, and a flow of savings towards more dynamic investments.
""Next year will undoubtedly be a year of more moderate growth,"" Oudea said.

The comments on Thursday by Musk to a VW managers gathering in Alpbach, Austria, confirmed by Diess via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1449333401048293378 on Saturday after a report in Handelsblatt daily, included praise of VW for being an ""icon"" and Tesla's greatest challenger, Handelsblatt said.
The paper said that when asked by Diess why Tesla was more nimble than its rivals, Musk said it came down to his management style and that he is an engineer, first of all, and has an eye for supply chains, logistics and production.
In a post on Linkedin, Diess added that he had brought in Musk as a ""surprise guest"" to drive home the point that VW needs faster decisions and less bureaucracy for what he called the biggest transformation in VW's history. 
""Happy to hear that even our strongest competitor thinks that we will succeed (in) the transition if we drive the transformation with full power,"" Diess said on Linkedin. 
As an example of Tesla's prowess, Diess said it took the rival only two to three weeks to rewrite software to allow for a switch from one type of microchip, which went out of stock, to another.
Diess said in his Saturday tweet that VW, which has emerged as the main contender to Tesla for global electric vehicle supremacy, would continue its dialogue with Tesla.
""We will visit you soon in Gruenheide,"" the CEO said.
Diess warned last month that the planned opening of Tesla's car factory at Gruenheide near Berlin, the company's first in Europe, will force local industry to step up its game against the fast-growing U.S. electric vehicle maker.

Tesla is awaiting final building approval for the 5.8 billion euro ($6.8 billion) German site.
VW, in turn, plans to build six large battery factories in Europe by 2030 as part of an all-in bet on electric mobility.

EVERETT, Wash. (Reuters) -Waving signs like ""coercion is not consent,"" and ""stop the mandate,"" some 200 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co employees and others staged a protest on Friday over the planemaker's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for U.S. workers.
Boeing said on Tuesday it will require https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-will-require-its-125000-us-employees-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19-2021-10-12 its 125,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated by Dec. 8 under an executive order issued by President Joe Biden for federal contractors. 
As the pandemic has continued to rage, Biden announced the requirement in September because a large swath of Americans have resisted vaccination even though the shots are free, widely available and declared safe by regulators. 
""It's my choice and it's my body,"" one avionics engineer said, his voice nearly drowned out by anti-Biden chants and trucks honking to show support along the busy street outside Boeing's factory in Everett, north of Seattle. 
""It's an experimental drug given under a pseudo-emergency,"" he added. 
Another worker, an assembly mechanic, said: ""This is America. We don't just do what we're told because one person says to.""
Earlier this week, Boeing said employees must either show proof of vaccination or have an approved reasonable accommodation based on a disability or sincerely held religious belief by Dec. 8.
""Boeing is committed to maintaining a safe working environment for our employees,"" a spokesperson said. ""Advancing the health and safety of our global workforce is fundamental to our values and a core priority every day.""
Major U.S. airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have said they will also meet the deadline imposed on federal contractors, as has aircraft parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR).
""Now that he has issued the Executive Order, it is our responsibility to comply with that order,"" Spirit Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile wrote in a memo to employees and seen by Reuters on Friday. 

Spirit was calling back former employees as it prepares for what Gentile characterized as ""one of the fastest increases in production rates in the history of our industry.""
Boeing has said its mandate does not apply immediately to its sites in Texas, where Republican Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Monday barring COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.

In addition to an appeal to ratify the contract offer, which the union has urged workers to reject, the managers offered information about a decertification petition that may lead to a vote to remove the USW from representing the workers, said Bryan Gross, a representative of the international union.
""The company locked us out six months ago,"" Gross said. ""They haven't asked about anybody and now they are reaching out and saying, 'Trust us.'""
An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The 650 workers locked out on May 1 at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and lubricant-oil plant are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on Exxon's contract offer. 
The company said in a message posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Friday that once the offer is ratified ""the company will work with the union to establish a return to work agreement and return USW-represented employees to the site, ending the lockout.""
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board is reviewing a petition submitted by at least 30% of the locked-out workers calling for a decertification vote. If successful, it would remove USW local union 13-243 in Beaumont from representing the workers. 

The USW opposes opposing Exxon's contract offer, saying it would eliminate job seniority, which gives workers a say in job assignments, and create virtually separate agreements for refinery workers and lubricant plant workers.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -The Swedish electric vehicle unit of China Evergrande Group is in talks with U.S. and European venture capital firms and industrial partners to find new owners, its top chief said, as its Chinese parent battles default on more than $300 billion in debts.
National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB (NEVS), owned by the cash-strapped Chinese property developer, has funds to last ""for a good while"", its Chief Executive Stefan Tilk said, adding that several investors were showing interest in the firm.
He declined to comment on a possible valuation. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the unit could be valued at as much as $1 billion.
Evergrande has already missed three rounds of interest payments on its international bonds, and has been scrambling to sell some of its assets to raise cash.
The Chinese property developer has spent billions of dollars on stakes in automobile technology developers, including NEVS. It also has joint ventures with Germany's Hofer and Sweden's Koenigsegg.
NEVS, which received an electric vehicle production licence in China four years ago, is the Swedish arm of Evergrande's EV unit Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group. 
Tilk said that NEVS is discussing a potential sale or other financing mainly with European and U.S. firms, but declined to name them.
""We are in dialogue both with venture people and companies that have the same idea and direction as us and want to get into this with our full competence,"" he told Reuters. ""So they are both industrial partners and venture capitalists.""
Evergrande NEV warned in stock exchange filings last month that it was still looking for new investors and to make asset sales, and that without either it may struggle to pay employee salaries and cover other expenses. 
Tilk added that NEVS, which gave notice of redundancy to nearly half its roughly 650 workers in August, could hire staff again to get the competence Evergrande wants in Europe if it survives the crisis.

""If Evergrande can continue its operations, which they hope to do, they will be interested in having a footprint in Europe, with infrastructure like a plant, tests, lab. And we have that,"" he said.
In the meantime NEVS, which bought carmaker Saab's assets in 2012, is focusing on building its mobility ecosystem PONS, an autonomous ride-sharing network for smart cities and university campuses.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Evergrande Group's chief executive is holding talks in Hong Kong with investment banks and creditors over a possible restructuring and asset sales, two people said, as the Chinese developer battles against default on more than $300 billion in debts.
CEO Xia Haijun, a confidant of chairman Hui Ka Yan and who runs Evergrande's day-to-day operations including financing, has been in Hong Kong, where the property firm has a major presence, for more than two months, the two sources told Reuters.
A third source said Xia was talking to banks and creditors in Hong Kong, but did not say what was being discussed.
Shenzhen-headquartered Evergrande, which is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, has left its offshore investors in the dark about repayment plans after already missing three rounds of interest payments on its dollar bonds.
Xia's talks with investment banks and creditors in Hong Kong has not previously been reported.
One of the sources said Xia needed to communicate with foreign banks on loan extensions and repayments. The source declined to disclose the identity of the creditors that Xia had spoken to in recent days. 
""Xia also needs to sort out how many off-balance sheet debts the group has offshore, because many were underwritten at subsidiary levels and he himself may not be even aware of (that),"" he said. ""Before that they cannot work on restructuring and talk to bondholders.""
Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some of its assets to raise cash - efforts that have not yet yielded much success - as concerns have grown in recent weeks about a possible collapse and the impact on global markets and China's economy.
Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation, Reuters reported on Friday.
A Chinese central bank official said on Friday the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems on the banking system was controllable and the risk exposures of individual financial institutions were not big.
Evergrande and Xia did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The sources, who have direct knowledge of the development, declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
PUBLIC APPEARANCE 
Evergrande Chairman Hui has not appeared in public in recent weeks or announced plans to address the group's woes, leaving investors wondering if they would have to book losses when the 30-day grace periods end this month for unpaid bond coupons.
Last month, the developer issued a statement saying Hui had urged company executives to ensure the quality delivery of properties and redemption of wealth management products.
Xia, who is also vice president of the board, joined the company in 2007 and is responsible for Evergrande's capital operation and management, as well as legal affairs and overseas affairs, according to the company's website.
He has been in Hong Kong since July, according to one of the sources. The second source said Xia had been meeting Chinese investment banks in the city to explore possible asset sales.
Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, has said that it is looking to dispose of stakes in assets including its services and electric vehicle units to raise funds.
The developer is finalising details to sell 51% of its Evergrande Property Services unit to Hopson Development for HK$20 billion ($2.57 billion). 
Investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds, demanded last week more information and transparency from Evergrande. 

The developer said last month it had appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and Admiralty Harbour Capital as joint financial advisers to examine its financial options, as it warned of default risks amid plunging property sales.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property has pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy China Evergrande Group's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation, two sources said.
The collapse of the talks for the landmark building's sale is another setback for cash-strapped Evergrande which has been scrambling to divest some assets to repay creditors knocking on its doors. With more than $300 billion in liabilities, it has already missed three rounds of interest payments on its international bonds.
Yuexiu, based in the southern city of Guangzhou, was close to sealing a deal in August to acquire the 26-storey China Evergrande Centre in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district that serves as Evergrande's local headquarters, said the sources. 
The deal, however, faltered after Yuexiu's board opposed the move over worries that Evergrande's unresolved indebtedness would create potential complications in completing the transaction smoothly, they said.
Once China's top-selling developer, Shenzhen-based Evergrande has in recent months sought to raise funds by offloading assets - from properties to stakes in subsidiaries - both in mainland China and in Hong Kong.
Evergrande, which saw its 8.75% June 2025 bond fall more than 6% to 18.625 cents on Friday, did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did Yuexiu. 
The people declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.
Evergrande bought the harbourside building, which is located in Hong Kong's commercial and night life district and covers an area of 345,000 square feet, from local peer Chinese Estates Holdings for HK$12.5 billion ($1.61 billion) in 2015.
That deal set a record for a single transaction of a commercial building in the Asian financial hub with the highest price per square foot at the time. It also made the property Evergrande's single largest asset in the city.
Evergrande has financed the bulk of the transaction with securitised products worth more than HK$10 billion, said one of the sources, which means it would only recoup limited cash from the sale of the building.
EVERGRANDE PROSPECTS 
The board of Yuexiu, which focuses on property developments in China's Greater Bay Area and has a presence in Hong Kong, became concerned about the deal's certainty at a time when Evergrande's future is uncertain, said one of the sources.
Yuexiu also received guidance from the municipal government of the southern city of Guangzhou to put the purchase on hold at the end of August, said the person. 
A separate source familiar with the matter said the deal was halted in late August because the Guangzhou government wanted to review the overall financial situation of Evergrande first to better understand the use of proceeds from its asset disposals.
The Guangzhou government did not respond to a request for comment.
Separately, Evergrande is in final talks to sell a 51% stake in its property management arm Evergrande Property Services to domestic peer Hopson Development, in a deal that could fetch about HK$20 billion, said two of the sources. 
One of them said both parties are finalising details including financing for the buyer.
When asked about the deal, Hopson said any comments will have to wait till an announcement is made. 
The Hopson deal would be Evergrande's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead. The struggling developer's other business interests include a bottling water company and an electric vehicle maker. 

It is also close to selling its Guangzhou FC Soccer stadium and surrounding residential projects to Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group, Reuters reported last month.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee who led fellow workers in publicly sharing instances of what they called harassment and discrimination at the company said on Thursday that she had been fired.
    Janneke Parrish, an Apple program manager, said the iPhone maker informed her on Thursday that she had been terminated for deleting material on company equipment while she was under investigation over the leaking of a company town hall to media. She told Reuters she denies leaking.
    Parrish said she deleted apps that contained details of her finances and other personal information before handing her devices in to Apple as part of the probe. 
    Parrish said she believes she was fired for her activism in the workplace.
    ""To me, this seems clearly retaliatory for the fact that I was speaking out about abuses that have happened at my employer, pay equity and, generally, about our workplace conditions,"" she said. 
    Apple said Friday it does not discuss specific employee matters.
    Apple has recently experienced other examples of employee unrest. Last month, two Apple employees told Reuters they had filed charges https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02 against the company with the National Labor Relations Board. The workers accused Apple of retaliation and halting discussion of pay among employees, among other allegations.
Apple has said that it is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace"" and that it takes ""all concerns"" from employees seriously.
    U.S. law protects the right of employees to openly discuss certain topics, including working conditions, discrimination and equal pay. 
    Over the summer, current and former Apple employees began detailing on social media what they said were experiences of harassment and discrimination. Parrish and some colleagues began publishing the stories on social media and a publishing platform in a weekly digest titled '#AppleToo.'

    Parrish said she was careful to respect company rules and never shared information that she believed to be confidential. She said she continued to publish the '#AppleToo' digest after coming under investigation at the end of September.
    ""If anything, it's made the importance of that work clearer than ever, when Apple's response to criticism is to start internal investigations into those that it wants to see gone,"" she said. ""It's easier for them to terminate people than it is for them to actually listen.""

The company said the FDA pointed to ""deficiencies"" related to the regulator's inspection of Revance's manufacturing site.
No other concerns were raised in the agency's ""complete response letter"", the drug developer said.
Revance's DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, a potential rival for  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Botox anti-wrinkle injection, was successful in reducing moderate to severe frown lines in a late-stage study in December 2018.
In November last year, the U.S. FDA delayed its decision on the drug, as it was unable to conduct required inspection of the company's manufacturing facility due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Revance later said it was expecting approval in 2021.
""We are very disappointed by this unanticipated response from the FDA and are seeking further clarity from the agency,"" Mark Foley, the chief executive officer of Revance, said in a statement on Friday. 

Revance said it plans to request a meeting with the FDA as soon as possible to address the agency's concerns.

Burry's Scion Asset Management said in a regulatory filing in mid-May it had put options on 800,100 Tesla shares as of the end of the first quarter. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they were part of a broader trade were not available. 
Based on Tesla's closing price of $667.93 at the end of the first quarter, the value of that many shares would have been about $534 million. The actual value of the options position was not known.
Put options give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future. 
Options analysts said at that time it was possible the puts disclosed in the filing might be part of a larger trade that would curb losses if the put position went against the fund.
""No, it was a trade,"" Burry was quoted as saying in an email to CNBC on Friday, when asked whether he was still shorting Tesla.
""Media really inflated the value of these things. I was never short tens or hundreds of millions of any of these things through options, as was reported. The options bets were extremely asymmetric, and the media was off by orders of magnitude,"" Burry told CNBC.
One of the investors profiled in the book ""The Big Short"" and the film of the same name for betting more than $1 billion against the U.S. housing bubble, Burry has previously been skeptical of Tesla's sky-high valuations.

Tesla and Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Natural gas prices hit a multi-year high in the U.S. recently, and increased in other global regions also, including Europe and Asia, and was a key driver of higher stock prices for TELL and LNG.

(Reuters) - California's Contra Costa County said on Friday that oil refiners Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) may need to reduce capacity of proposed renewable plants by about 50% and 20% respectively to mitigate environmental impact. 
The two petroleum refiners are planning to convert oil refineries in the San Francisco-area county to produce transportation fuel from feedstocks such as soybean oil and animal fats that produce less greenhouse gas emissions.
Contra Costa is required to identify an environmentally superior option to the projects under the California Environmental Quality Act.
The county said it would be an ""environmentally superior option"" for Marathon to process 23,000 barrels per day of fuel instead of the planned 48,000 barrels per day in a draft environmental impact report (EIR) released Friday.
The draft EIR will be available for public comment for at least 45 days, the county said.
To reduce environmental impacts of a similar project at Phillips 66's Rodeo, California site, the county identified the refiner could supply 102,000 bpd of renewable fuels to the regional market instead of 120,0000 bpd using only two pre-treatment trains, which would cut down the number of marine vessels needed.
The county said Marathon's project would reduce air emissions from the plant due to less feedstock being processed. However, it said emissions from the facility and other nearby development would still exceed ""regional air quality thresholds of significance, and this impact would remain cumulatively significant and unavoidable.""

Environmental advocates have said demanded the county consider the effects on water, air quality and food prices.
Marathon said Friday that it is conducting a study to determine whether the use of ""green hydrogen"" would be feasible at the facility at a later date. Using hydrogen is necessary to produce renewable fuels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday and the Dow scored its biggest weekly percentage gain since June, as Goldman Sachs rounded out a week of strong quarterly earnings for the big banks.
 Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) shares jumped 3.8% and gave the Dow its biggest boost, as a record wave of dealmaking activity drove a surge in the bank's quarterly profit.
Goldman's report followed strong results from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and others this week. Banks were among the biggest positives for the S&P 500 on the day, and the index's bank index climbed 2.1%.
Results from big financial institutions provided a strong start to third-quarter U.S. earnings, though investors will still watch in coming weeks for signs of impacts from supply chain disruptions and higher costs, especially for energy.
Forecasts now call for third-quarter S&P 500 earnings to show a 32% rise from a year ago. The latest forecast, based on results from 41 S&P 500 companies and estimates for the rest, is up from 29.4% at the start of October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co chief technical pilot, accused of deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet, was charged with fraud on Friday, pleaded not guilty and was released, the U.S. Attorney's Office in northern Texas said.
Mark Forkner, 49, was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on six counts of scheming to defraud Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars for the plane maker.
According to the indictment, Forkner provided the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Evaluation Group with ""materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information"" about a new part of the flight controls for the Boeing 737 MAX, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
The MCAS, a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane’s nose down in certain conditions, was tied to two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX over a five-month period that killed 346 people. The FAA grounded the plane for 19 months, an action which was lifted in November 2020.
A lawyer for Forkner said he should not have been charged and was not responsible for the two fatal Boeing crashes. 
""If the government takes this case to trial, the truth will show that Mark did not cause this tragedy, he did not lie, and he should not be charged,"" Forkner lawyer David Gerger said in a statement. 
Gerger called on people who worked at Boeing, the FAA or an airline ""to help the truth come out. Please contact us, get us a message, do not be intimidated.""

Boeing and the FAA declined to comment.
In January, Boeing agreed to pay https://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-737max-justice-int/boeing-to-pay-2-5-billion-to-settle-u-s-criminal-probe-into-737-max-crashes-idUSKBN29D07Q more than $2.5 billion in fines and compensation after reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department over the MAX crashes, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been inspecting the risk of the condition, myocarditis, among younger men vaccinated with Moderna's shot, especially versus  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine, after certain Nordic countries limited use of the shot, the report https://on.wsj.com/3p3P5Zp said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The agency has not yet determined whether there is heightened risk, and the delay could be several weeks, though the timing was unclear, the report said.
In June, Moderna filed for U.S. authorization of its vaccine among adolescents aged 12 through 17. The FDA authorized rival Pfizer's vaccine for use in children as young as 12 in May.
The U.S. FDA's review of Moderna's application is ongoing, an FDA spokesperson told Reuters, adding that while the agency cannot predict how long the process may take, it is evaluating the data as expeditiously as possible.
Europe's drug regulator found in July that such inflammatory conditions could occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Moderna's vaccine or Pfizer/BioNTech's shot, more often in younger men after the second dose.
However, the regulator stressed that the benefits of the shots outweighed any risks.
Earlier this month, Finland, Sweden and Denmark paused the use of Moderna's shot for younger males due to reports of myocarditis, though the Danish Health Agency later said the vaccine was available to under-18s.

Moderna's two-shot vaccine has U.S. authorization for emergency use in people aged 18 and above.
The FDA in June added a warning to the literature accompanying Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 shots to indicate the rare risk of heart inflammation.

(Reuters) - Outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday unanimously recommended the agency authorize a second shot of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine for all recipients of the one-dose inoculation.
The agency is also considering lowering the recommended age for booster shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to people as young as 40, FDA official Dr. Peter Marks told the advisory panel.
The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee backed the shots for all J&J recipients aged 18 and older at least two months after their first dose.
The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation, but typically does.
After hearing presentations from J&J and FDA scientists, many members of the advisory panel asked if J&J's single-dose vaccine should actually be considered a two-dose shot for everyone.
They pointed to the lower levels of virus neutralizing antibodies it provokes compared to vaccines using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech.
""There is a public health imperative. What we're seeing is this is a group with overall lower efficacy than we have seen with the mRNA vaccine, and so there is some urgency to do something,"" said Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health who chaired the meeting. 
The FDA authorized boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine last month for Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness or occupational exposure to the virus. 
Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said data from Israel, where  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) booster shots have already been administered broadly, suggests that the vaccine's efficacy is waning and makes a compelling case for lowering the age for receiving booster shots to 40. 
Concerns about rare cases of heart inflammation in younger men who receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine also made 40 a good cutoff point for the additional shots, Marks said.
CONCERNS OVER J&J DATA
Marks raised concerns that the data presented by J&J did not reflect all of the information on the vaccine's performance.
""There are some real challenges here. All of the data do not fully align with this being a vaccine that retains excellent activity over time, against all forms of disease or even against severe forms of disease,"" Marks said. 
J&J scientists said their vaccine was more durable than the mRNA vaccines.
""If the vaccine isn't adequate, it should be boosted and everybody should get it,"" said Dr. Eric Rubin, an infectious disease expert at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. 
After the vote, Rubin said he expects that getting the second J&J dose later than two months after the first should be safe. While the data are scarce, he said, ""there isn't much to suspect that it's wrong,"" adding, ""I certainly am supportive of those individuals getting another dose.""
Once the FDA signs off on the second dose, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make specific recommendations on who should get the shots. CDC advisers are scheduled to meet to discuss the boosters next week.

On Thursday, the panel unanimously backed booster shots of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness or occupational exposure to the virus. 
U.S. health officials have been under pressure to authorize the additional shots after the White House announced plans in August for a widespread booster campaign pending approvals from the FDA and the CDC.

The agreement with Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) was reached after the bank met some of the union's demands, such as setting a lower number of layoffs, capped at 1,380, a union spokesperson said.
""If 1,380 employees take redundancy leave the bank would accept it,"" the union spokesperson said, adding that if more decided to leave cuts would be capped at 1,605 employees.
Sabadell issued a statement to Spain's National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) confirming the deal.
""Today Banco Sabadell has reached an agreement with all the sections of the unions negotiation committee which represent the employees, in the framework of a redundancy procedure for Banco Sabadell in Spain which will affect a maximum of 1,605 employees,"" the bank said in a statement.
The cost of the process is estimated at 269 million euros ($312.15 million) before tax, the bank said.
This would have a negative impact of about 23 basis points on Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) fully loaded ratio, the strictest measure of solvency, it added. 
This impact will be neutralised by capital gains from the sale of its bond portfolio, the bank said. 
The agreement will lead to savings of at least 100 million euros ($116.01 million) per year before tax, in line with what was announced in Banco Sabadell's Strategic Plan, the bank added. 
Spanish banks and their counterparts elsewhere in Europe are cutting costs and adapting to a shift toward online banking, either by themselves or through tie-ups, as their overall profitability is eaten away by ultra-low interest rates.
In September, Sabadell presented unions with a plan to cut 1,936 jobs and close or partially shut 496 branches, amid a shift towards online banking.
It is the lender's second workforce reduction in less than a year after recently cutting 1,817 jobs in Spain, where it employs a total of 14,648 people.

A total of 320 branches will close, almost a fifth of the bank's more than 1,600 branches in Spain, while the rest will open a few days a week, one of the sources told Reuters in September.

Unperturbed by news of a fatal stabbing of a British lawmaker on Friday, Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.37% to hit a near 20-month high. The UK blue-chip index has now recovered all ground lost since the coronavirus pandemic began in March last year.
Concerns that soaring oil prices could drag on businesses and the economy also took a backseat for now.
Forecasts of an oil supply deficit over the next few months as demand rises on the back of relaxed travel restrictions drove oil prices to a three-year high of above $85 a barrel. 
U.S. crude recently jumped 1.13% to $82.23 per barrel and Brent added 0.83% to $84.70, after hitting a high of $85.10.
Bets that rising prices are likely to prompt central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected lifted government bond yields, though gains were more pronounced in the United States than in Europe.
The yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries, which reflect short-term rate expectations, zoomed up to a near 19-month-high 0.3949%, from Thursday's 0.354%. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield also rose to 1.5738%, from Thursday's 1.519%. 
In Europe, 10-year Bund yields slipped after registering seven straight weeks of gains on signs of rising inflationary pressure and robust economic growth. 
The dollar, bolstered by bets that quickening inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected, touched a three-year high against the yen, which is usually sensitive to rate differentials. One dollar bought as much as 114.46 yen, the most since October 2018. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was lower on the day, however, slipping 0.104%, and set for its first weekly decline versus major peers since the start of last month, having lost a little ground to sterling and the euro. 
Gold prices took a breather on Friday after having their best day in seven months the previous day. Spot gold dropped 1.6% to $1,766.82 an ounce, and U.S. gold futures fell 1.67% to $1,766.70 an ounce. 
The return of optimism will be tested by next week's anticipated weaker growth data from China, and the impact of strengthening oil prices on consumers going into the winter months, said Mike Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.
Indeed, China's energy crisis deepened on Friday with coal prices hitting a record high.
European car registrations slumped by more than a quarter in September, and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it would cut global output in November as chip shortages and supply chain problems continued to dog the sector.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 1.35%, rising 2.1% for the week in its best weekly performance since late June, while Japan's Nikkei surged 1.81%, led by tech stocks.
Analysts largely attributed the gains in Asia to the U.S. rally.
Chinese shares rose more cautiously than elsewhere with blue chips up 0.38% ahead of next week's growth figures. 
A Chinese central bank official said on Friday that the spillover effect of China Evergrande Group's debt problems on the banking system is controllable, in rare official remarks on the liquidity crisis at China's No. 2 developer that has roiled markets.

Bitcoin hit a six-month high of $61,895.05 on Friday, approaching the record hit in April, as traders became increasingly confident U.S. regulators would approve the launch of an exchange-traded fund based on its futures contracts.

It’s too soon to know whether this is the start of a new uptrend or simply just another bounce. However, we are entering a seasonally bullish time of the year and early indications are that Q3 earnings season is going to be strong as well which could be another tailwind for stocks. In this week’s commentary, I will cover this topic and our market outlook. Read on below to find out more….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published October 15, 2021 from the POWR Stocks Under $10 newsletter).
Over the last week, the S&P 500 is up by 0.8% with the Russell 2000 up 1.3%. It’s certainly been more of a rotation-type environment rather than a trending market where all boats are lifted higher.
Ultimately, these types of advances are more sustainable and can last longer. The S&P 500 is up by 20% this year, yet it’s never gotten too extremely overbought other than in mid-February, where it was punished with a steep decline.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher for the week Friday, underpinned by data pointing to unexpected strength in the consumer, and another wave of better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1%, or 382 points, the Nasdaq climbed 0.5%.
The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales rose  0.7% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.2% decline. The retail sales control group – which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP –  gained 0.8%, above expectations for a 0.4% rise. 
The gain in retail sales suggests that the impact of the delta variant of the coronavirus on consumer spending, which makes up about 66% of economic growth, is starting to wane.
“Consumer spending has remained resilient and reflects strong buying power and favorable credit conditions. The increase in food services throughout the Delta wave suggests households are better equipped to manage around Covid flare-ups,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The backdrop of optimism on the economic recovery pushed Treasury yields higher, underpinning bank stocks, which have been bolstered by upbeat quarterly results from major Wall Street banks.

On Thursday, Boeing said some 787 Dreamliner parts were improperly made over the past three years. They were supplied by Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS), as a sub-contractor to Italy's Leonardo.
Reuters on Thursday reported that Boeing had also contacted aerostructures maker Spirit in March to warn it not to use parts supplied by MPS.
On Friday, Spirit said that from March through July, Boeing had issued communications to its supply chain, including Spirit, identifying possible flawed parts dating back to 2017.
""Upon receipt of information from Boeing identifying parts from sub-tier suppliers which used MPS, Spirit took appropriate action,"" the company said in an emailed statement.

In its March warning, Boeing asked Spirit to use alternative suppliers as it continued an audit of MPS, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The planemaker had also asked Wichita-based Spirit to trace any MPS parts it had used back to 2017 and to treat them as ""suspect nonconforming,"" meaning they would be subject to further checks.

224,By StockNews,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",Time to Buy Silver?,"Silver (SLV) is down for the last 9 months but is finally showing signs of life. Fundamentals remain positive with inflation and loose monetary policy. Taylor Dart explains why you should consider buying.It’s been a torturous 9-month stretch for investors in the silver (SLV), but periods of significant underperformance often set up the conditions for violent reversals, and this is what the bulls are finally enjoying as we begin Q4. While the S&P-500 (SPY) is up 3% for the month, silver has gained 6%, and the Silver Miners Index (SIL) is up 11%, with leaders like GoGold Resources (GLGDF) sitting just shy of new 52-week highs. Typically, a 10% rally in less than ten trading days would be a reason to take some profits into strength. However, with sentiment for silver hitting its worst levels in years last week, I see no reason to rush to take profits. Instead, I think we could be in the early innings of a multi-month rally for silver, which should translate to the significant upside for the best names in the sector. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
As the chart above shows, bullish sentiment for silver spent more than three weeks below the 25% level in September, suggesting that there were three bears for every one bull in the market. Bullish sentiment finally plunged to a reading of 10% last week, denoting a reading of nine bearish market participants for everyone that was bullish, and these extreme readings often become at the tail end of bear markets. While nothing is guaranteed, extended periods of pessimism have typically preceded multi-month 20% plus rallies in the silver price, with any pullbacks providing buying opportunities. So, while some investors that bought the dip might be anxious to take profits into strength, I believe the best silver miners are heading much higher from here over the next six months. This is because silver is nowhere near a sell signal, and the earliest we could get a sell signal for silver would be January, based on how depressed the readings have been over the past nine months. For reference, the last time market participants were this bearish was in September 2018; silver gained 22% over the next 12 months, while the Silver Miners Index enjoyed a 40% plus rally.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 02:52PM ET</span>",Statins may slightly lower COVID-19 death risk; using a different vaccine as booster may offer more protection,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Statins may protect slightly against COVID-19 death
Widely-used statin drugs for lowering cholesterol may be linked to a slightly lower risk of dying from COVID-19, new data suggest. Researchers at Karolinska Institute in Sweden reviewed the medical records of nearly 1 million residents of Stockholm over the age of 45 between March and November 2020, roughly 18% of whom had been prescribed a statin, such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s Lipitor (atorvastatin) and Merck & Co's Zocor (simvastatin). The people prescribed statins had more risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes: they were older, more often male, had more medical conditions, lower education levels and less disposable income. After taking all that into account, statin users were still 12% less likely to have died of COVID-19 during the study period, according to a report published on Thursday in PLOS Medicine https:// The researchers did not compare outcomes in people who actually got infected with the virus, however. And they only had data on prescriptions - not on whether patients took the medicine as prescribed. A formal clinical trial would be needed to confirm the findings. Still, they conclude, their data ""suggest that statin treatment may have a modest preventive therapeutic effect on COVID-19 mortality."" 
Boosting with a different vaccine is safe, may be better
People who got Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine as a first shot had a stronger immune response when boosted with vaccines from either Pfizer Inc/BioNTech SE or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, according to a study run by the National Institutes of Health. The trial, which included more than 450 adults who received initial shots from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, or J&J, also showed that ""mixing and matching"" booster shots using different vaccine technology is safe in adults, the researchers reported in a paper posted on medRxiv on Wednesday https:// ahead of peer review. Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are based on messenger RNA (mRNA) while J&J's uses viral vector technology. The trial looked at a total of nine combinations of initial shots and boosters. Using different types of shots as boosters generally produced a comparable or higher antibody response than using the same type, the researchers reported. Mixing booster doses ""may offer immunological advantages to optimize the breadth and longevity of protection achieved with currently available vaccines,"" they said.
Old age alone does not predict COVID-19 mortality risk

Older patients are known to be at higher risk for poor outcomes after infection with the coronavirus, but among those hospitalized with COVID-19, other characteristics help predict who is likely to do poorly, new data suggest. In a review of data on 4,783 people age 65 and older who were hospitalized for COVID-19 early in the pandemic, researchers at Northwell Health hospitals in New York found that age itself did not independently predict whether a patient was more likely to die. Instead, they reported on Thursday in BMC Geriatrics https:// more important predictors of death for elderly patients were factors such as how independent they were before the infection, how sick they were when they arrived at the hospital, and their pre-existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, lung disease and dementia. The researchers noted that in facilities forced to ration care or facing resource shortages, some guidelines use advanced age as a reason to deny care. ""Our findings support the American Geriatrics Society position statement indicating age alone should never be used to make decisions regarding resource allocation under conditions of resource scarcity,"" the researchers said. ""Although age is still an important factor in the overall risk of COVID-19 mortality... a comprehensive approach that accounts for the above factors is essential in preventing ageism.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House on Friday will lift COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors starting Nov. 8, ending historic restrictions that had barred much of the world from entering the United States for as long as 21 months.
The unprecedented travel restrictions kept millions of visitors out of the United States from China, Canada, Mexico, India, Brazil, much of Europe and elsewhere; shrunk U.S. tourism; and hurt border community economies. They prevented many loved ones and foreign workers from reuniting with families.
""Oh how I've missed Christmas in NY,"" Alexandros Koronakis, an executive with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) in Brussels, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
U.S. allies had heavily lobbied the Biden administration to lift the rules. Many praised Friday's announcement, including Sweden's ambassador to the United States Karin Olofsdotter, who called it ""very welcoming news."" 
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz confirmed the Nov. 8 date https://twitter.com/KMunoz46/status/1448994395957641241?s=20 on Twitter, adding the policy ""is guided by public health, stringent, and consistent."" 
Restrictions on non-U.S. citizens were first imposed on air travelers from China in January 2020 by then-President Donald Trump and then extended to dozens of other countries, without any clear metrics for how and when to lift them.
Curbs on non-essential travelers at land borders with Mexico and Canada have been in place since March 2020 to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reuters first reported Friday's announcement of the Nov. 8 starting date earlier in the day.
U.S. airline, hotel and cruise industry stocks rose on the news, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), up 2.8%; Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Inc, up 3.7%; and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, up 0.9%.
U.S. international air passenger traffic was down 43% in August and overall passenger air traffic was down 21% over pre-pandemic levels, the U.S. Transportation Department said Friday.
Airlines have seen an increase in international ticket sales in recent weeks after the White House announced plans to lift the restrictions, Nick Calio, chief executive of the Airlines for America industry trade group, said in a statement. 
Calio said the ""full reopening of international travel is also critical to reviving economies around the globe, reinvigorating communities and supporting millions of jobs in the U.S. and abroad.""
The United States had lagged many other countries in lifting such restrictions. 
In January, Trump issued an order to lift travel restrictions on people in Europe and Brazil. But the order was reversed https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/biden-block-trumps-plan-lift-covid-19-european-travel-restrictions-2021-01-18 by President Joe Biden before it took effect.
The Biden administration, which repeatedly has said it does endorse so-called ""vaccine passports,"" grappled for months over whether to mandate vaccinations as a condition of lifting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-developing-plan-require-foreign-visitors-be-vaccinated-official-2021-08-04 country-specific restrictions, officials told Reuters.
On Tuesday, the White House announced it would lift restrictions at its land borders and ferry crossings with Canada and Mexico for fully vaccinated foreign nationals in early November. They are similar but not identical to requirements announced last month for international air travelers.
Unvaccinated visitors will still be barred from entering the United States from Canada or Mexico at land borders.
Canada on Aug. 9 began allowing https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-canada-idCNL1N2OV1MH fully vaccinated U.S. visitors for non-essential travel.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Reuters last week the United States will accept the use by international visitors of COVID-19 vaccines authorized by U.S. regulators or the World Health Organization.
The White House, which held a meeting late Thursday to finalize the Nov. 8 date, faces some remaining questions, including how and what exemptions the Biden administration will grant to the vaccine requirements. Children under 18, for example, are largely expected to be exempt from the requirements, an official said.
U.S. Travel Association Chief Executive Roger Dow said declines in international visits since the pandemic started resulted in more than $250 billion in lost income. 
Dow said in a statement that the Nov. 8 date ""is critically important for planning - for airlines, for travel-supported businesses, and for millions of travelers worldwide who will now advance plans to visit the United States once again.""
The White House announced on Sept. 20 that the United States would lift restrictions on air travelers https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/us-relax-travel-restrictions-passengers-uk-eu-november-source-2021-09-20 from 33 countries in early November. It did not specify the date at the time. 
Starting Nov. 8, the United States will admit fully vaccinated foreign air travelers from the 26 so-called Schengen countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Greece, as well as Britain, Ireland, China, India, South Africa, Iran and Brazil. The unprecedented U.S. restrictions have barred non-U.S. citizens who were in those countries within the past 14 days.
The United States has allowed foreign air travelers from more than 150 countries throughout the pandemic, a policy that critics said made little sense because some countries with high infection rates were not on the restricted list, while some on the list had the pandemic more under control.
The White House said last month it would apply vaccine requirements to foreign nationals traveling from all other countries.
Non-U.S. air travelers will need to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight, and will need to show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. Foreign visitors crossing a land border will not need to show proof of a recent negative test. 
The new rules do not require foreign visitors or Americans entering the country to go into quarantine. 

Americans traveling overseas must still show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test, and unvaccinated Americans will face stricter testing requirements. They will also be subject to restrictions in countries they plan to visit, which may include quarantines.
The CDC plans to issue new rules soon on contact tracing for international air travelers.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) on Friday reported a 66% surge in third-quarter profit that smashed expectations, as Wall Street's biggest investment bank rode a record wave of M&A activity and initial public offerings. 
The bank posted profits of $5.28 billion up from $3.23 billion a year ago, capping a stellar quarter for Wall Street lenders, which have benefited from a rebounding U.S. economy, soaring equity markets and a global deal-making bonanza. 
Shares of Goldman Sachs were up 2% in mid-morning trading. 
Global M&A volumes have shattered all-time records, with deals worth over $1.5 trillion inked by the world's biggest investment banks in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
Goldman comfortably held its top ranking as the world's leading bank in M&A advisory, according to the Refinitiv data.
Those surging M&A fees drove Goldman Sachs' overall financial advisory revenue up 225% to $1.65 billion, while underwriting revenue, which has been boosted by a rush of private companies looking to go public, surged 33% to $1.90 billion. 
All told, Goldman's investment bank boasted its second-best quarter ever, with total revenue of $3.70 billion, and executives said they expect revenues to continue to be strong.
""I remain optimistic about (opportunities),"" Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said on a call with analysts. ""Activity levels remain high particularly in investment banking.""
Earnings per share were $14.93 from $8.98 a year earlier, outstripping the $10.18 per share analysts had predicted, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. 
Goldman's global markets trading business, which accounts for roughly 41% of overall revenue, reported revenue of $5.61 billion, up 23%. 
The bank has been steadily expanding its prime brokerage business, where it handles trades for hedge funds, picking up clients and assets as other banks have trimmed their prime divisions. Additionally, it has gained market share when it comes to financing clients' equity investing, according to its quarterly report.
Those gains in prime brokerage and equity financing helped Goldman roughly double its equity trading revenue this quarter to $3.1 billion from $2.1 a year ago. That was higher than rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which reported trading revenue of $2.87 billion and is typically number one in this line of business.
Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit rose 38%, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reported a 24% rise.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which were likewise buoyed by deal fees and equities trading, increased profits by 48% and 64%, respectively. All the banks handily beat estimates. 
""Clearly, upside was anticipated given what we'd seen from peers, but not this much upside,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Susan Roth Katzke wrote in a note to investors on Friday. ""The beat was broad-based.""
CONSUMER BUSINESS
Goldman's consumer business, though small, has been key to its diversification strategy.
As part of Chief Executive David Solomon's strategy to build alternative revenue streams, Goldman is doubling down on Marcus, its consumer bank.
Since taking over from Lloyd Blankfein in 2018, Solomon has looked to diversify revenue, with more focus on consumer banking, mass-market wealth management and cash management.
Net revenue in Goldman's consumer banking unit rose 17% to $382 million, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances.
Total loans increased 28% to $143 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, a strong result in a mixed quarter for loan growth across Wall Street.
JPMorgan said on Wednesday that loans were up 5% across the bank compared with last year, while Citi was broadly flat.

Bank of America and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) reported declines in loan growth year-on-year.
Total revenue surged 26% to $13.61 billion in the quarter, handily beating estimates.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 02:08PM ET</span>",Wall Street banks set to profit again when Fed withdraws pandemic stimulus,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street banks have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic-era trading boom, fueled by the Federal Reserve's massive injection of cash into financial markets. 
With the central bank nearing the time when it will start winding down its asset purchases, banks are set to profit again as increased volatility encourages clients to buy and sell more stocks and bonds, analysts, investors and executives say.
The Fed has been buying up government-backed bonds since March 2020, adding $4 trillion to its balance sheet, as part of an emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The strategy was designed to stabilize financial markets and ensure companies and other borrowers had sufficient access to capital. It succeeded but also resulted in unprecedented levels of liquidity, helping equity and bond traders enjoy their most profitable period since the 2007-09 financial crisis.
The top five Wall Street investment banks -  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) - made an additional $51 billion in trading revenues last year and in the first three quarters of 2021, compared with the comparative quarters in the year prior to COVID, according to company earnings statements. 
Pandemic-era trading boom Pandemic-era trading boom https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BANKS/RESULTS-TRADING/byvrjrjlnve/chart.png 
The trading bonanza, along with a boom in global deal-making, has helped bank stocks outperform the broader market. The KBW Bank index has risen by 40% in the year-to-date compared with a 19% advance in the S&P 500.
Now, banks with large trading businesses are expected to profit a second time as the Fed starts to withdraw the stimulus, prompting investors to rejig their portfolios again.
""As investors look to position based on that volatility, that creates an opportunity for us to make markets for them. And obviously that would lend itself to improved performance,"" Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters this week.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled in late September that tapering was imminent. An official announcement is expected in November and the central bank has signaled it will look to halt asset purchases completely by mid-2022 - a timetable seen by some investors as aggressive.
Banks have already benefited from enhanced volatility since Powell's comments in late September, which led to a spike in Treasury yields and a decline in equity markets. That led to a pick-up in trading volumes at the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth quarter, executives say. 
""It is possible we will see bouts of volatility associated with the tapering,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya said in an interview Thursday, adding that she doesn't expect a repeat of 2013's 'taper tantrum.'
At that time, the Fed's decision to put the brakes on a quantitative easing program sent markets into a frenzy as investors dumped riskier assets in favor of 'safe havens,' leading to a spike in government bond yields and sharp falls in equity markets.
Fed officials are confident of avoiding that scenario this time around by giving markets enough advance warning of their intentions. 
""The sweet spot is where you have some volatility but not enough to disrupt the broader capital markets which have been an important contributor to healthy trading results over the past year,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan.
Third-quarter results from the biggest U.S. banks this week showed strong performances in equities trading, boosted by stocks hitting record highs, but a more subdued showing in bond trading reflecting calm in those markets. 

Investors are anticipating activity will ramp up again in the run-up to tapering, when it eventually begins. 
""It will certainly be a positive,"" said Patrick Kaser at Brandywine Global Investment Management. ""Volatility is a friend to trading businesses.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Suspected ransomware payments totaling $590 million were made in the first six months of this year, more than the $416 million reported for the whole of 2020, U.S. authorities said on Friday, as Washington put the cryptocurrency industry on alert about its role in combating ransomware attacks.
The U.S. Treasury Department said the average amount of reported ransomware transactions per month in 2021 was $102.3 million, with REvil/Sodinokibi, Conti, DarkSide, Avaddon, and Phobos the most prevalent ransomware strains reported.
President Joe Biden has made the government's cybersecurity response a top priority for the most senior levels of his administration following a series of attacks this year that threatened to destabilize U.S. energy and food supplies.
Seeking to stop the use of crypto currencies in the payment of ransomware demands, Treasury told members of the crypto community they are responsible for making sure they do not ""directly or indirectly"" help facilitate deals prohibited by U.S. sanctions.
Its new guidance said the virtual currency industry plays an increasingly critical role in preventing those blacklisted from exploiting virtual currencies to evade sanctions.
""Treasury is helping to stop ransomware attacks by making it difficult for criminals to profit from their crimes, but we need partners in the private sector to help prevent this illicit activity,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.
The new guidance also advised virtual currency exchanges to use geolocation tools to block access from countries under U.S. sanctions.
Hackers use ransomware to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing. They stop only after receiving hefty payments, typically in cryptocurrency.

This year, gangs have hit numerous U.S. companies in large scale hacks. One such attack on pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline led to temporary fuel supply shortages on the U.S. East Coast. Hackers also targeted an Iowa-based agricultural company, sparking fears of disruptions to grain harvesting in the Midwest.
The Biden administration last month unveiled sanctions against cryptocurrency exchange Suex OTC, S.R.O. over its alleged role in enabling illegal payments from ransomware attacks, officials said, in the Treasury's first such move against a virtual currency exchange over ransomware activity.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 01:22PM ET</span>","Eyeing higher inflation and volatility, investors turn more selective - fund managers","By Aaron Saldanha and Lisa Pauline Mattackal
(Reuters) - Global investors are looking harder for pockets of opportunity and becoming more selective in their fixed income and equity allocations, some fund managers told Reuters, anticipating volatility spurred by quicker inflation and uncertainty around central bank policy. 
""There are a lot of moving parts globally and within the United States, that should create some volatility and opportunity heading into 2022,"" Lisa Hornby, head of U.S. Multi-Sector Fixed Income at asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR), told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding ""stagflation"" is increasing as a potential risk. 
""Very few markets look cheap right now, there are pockets that still offer value, but those are fewer and further between,"" she said, pointing to corporate and municipal debt that should benefit from post-COVID economic reopenings and selected emerging market bonds. 
Similarly, Ashley Fagan, global head of ETF, Indexing, Smart Beta Strategic Clients at Amundi, told the Forum she expects more macroeconomic volatility and higher inflation, advocating hedges such as gold to protect portfolios. 
While remaining pro-risk, Fagan recommends a defensive position on U.S. and European government debt, and Schroder's Hornby is moderating risk levels across fixed income portfolios. 
Overall, investors are cashing out of broad U.S. market indexes and shifting to high quality stocks and financials, Fagan said, and in fixed income, they were preferring shorter-duration bonds. 
Most investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce a tapering of its asset purchases at its November meeting - a move Hornby sees already fully priced into bond markets - but more uncertainty surrounds when the central bank will hike interest rates. 
Both the U.S. and UK government bond yield curves have flattened in the past week, indicating concern over how policymakers will balance rising inflation with a fragile economic recovery. 
Graphic: U.S. yield curve: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxorxkepx/US%20yield%20curve.png 

Hornby sees the Fed being more cautious and maintaining accomodative policy longer than markets currently expect, and thus yield curves are likely to steepen and the benchmark U.S. 10-year yield may trade closer to 1.75%.
Bond funds focused on inflation-protected debt clocked their biggest inflows in more than two months over the past week, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard both announced launches of more selective bond ETFs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. House Democrat who oversaw a massive investigation into the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX said on Friday the indictment of a former chief technical pilot should not be the end of the accountability in the two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
""Senior leaders throughout Boeing are responsible for the culture of concealment that ultimately led to the 737 MAX crashes and the death of 346 innocent people,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Mark Forkner, 49, was set to be arraigned after being indicted by a grand jury in Texas on six counts of scheming to defraud Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars for the plane maker.
""Mark Forkner’s indictment should not be the end of the accountability for this colossal and tragic failure,"" DeFazio said. 
Boeing did not immediately comment. A lawyer for Forkner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Congress approved legislation to reform how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifies new airplanes and DeFazio said the agency ""must work urgently to implement the bipartisan legislation.""
DeFazio's September 2020 report said the MAX crashes ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""
The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 which killed all 157 aboard.

Robert Clifford, a lawyer representing families of relatives killed in the Ethiopian crash, said the Forkner indictment ""is a corporate whitewash... This inexcusable type of corporate greed goes far beyond (Forkner) at the company that haphazardly made these aircraft in an effort to increase profits.""
In January, Boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in fines and compensation after reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department over the MAX crashes, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 12:47PM ET</span>","U.S. banks see wealth management boom on borrowing, new assets","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks' wealth management businesses put in another stellar performance in the third quarter, buoyed by record levels of new money flowing into accounts and surging demand from clients to borrow against their investment portfolios.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). each reported double-digit growth in wealth management loan balances and revenues this week. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic devastated large chunks of the economy and put millions out of work, extraordinary government measures aimed at mitigating the economic blow have also boosted the fortunes of the wealthy by pushing down interest rates and driving a massive stock market rally. 
Global financial wealth soared to a record high of $250 trillion in 2020, according to a June report by Boston Consulting Group. 
That has increased demand for money managers, increased the value of assets managed by these brokerages, and made it more appealing for customers to borrow.
""At the high net worth end of the spectrum, lending products have been very healthy and you're seeing that at firms like Morgan Stanley where wealth management loan balances are up over 30% year over year,"" said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities.
Morgan Stanley's wealth management business reported revenues of $5.935 billion, up 28% from last year. Wealth management loan balances reached $121 billion, up 33% year-on-year, mostly from clients taking out mortgages and borrowing against their investments.
A booming area of lending for wealth management brokerages, so-called securities based loans or lines of credit, allow clients to borrow up to a certain percent of the value of their investment accounts to spend on anything except more securities. As those investment accounts have grown in value, so have loans. 
Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management reported record revenues of $4.5 billion, up 19% over last year, while loan balances grew 10% to top $133 billion. 
At JPMorgan's asset and wealth management business, revenues 21% to $4.3 billion, while average loans rose 20% from last year.
Both Bank of America and JPMorgan said the primary driver of loan growth was securities based loans, followed by mortgages and custom loans.
Morgan Stanley, which gets around half of its revenues from wealth management, said net new assets rose by 89% to $135 billion in the third quarter from the prior quarter, helped in part by the acquisition of a group of retirement advisers that brought $43 billion in fee-based assets to the bank.
Bank of America reported that, over the past year, it has brought on more than $112 billion in net new assets across its global wealth management business.
Merrill Lynch also added 4,200 net new households, the bank said. 

Goldman Sachs, which has a smaller wealth management unit catering to the extremely rich, said wealth management net revenues jumped 40% from last year to $1.64 billion, while loan balances were also up 40% to reach $42 billion. 
JPMorgan does not break out net new assets for its asset and wealth management business.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday refused a petition by the U.S. Department of Justice to put on hold Texas's restrictive abortion law, which bars the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the law could stay in effect pending ""expedited"" further proceedings in the high profile legal challenge. 
The Texas abortion law, which took effect on Sept. 1, makes no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.
It also lets ordinary citizens enforce the ban, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide an abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. Critics of the law have said this provision enables people to act as anti-abortion bounty hunters.

The Justice Department has argued that the law impedes women from exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy that was recognized in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide.
The department also argued that the law improperly interferes with the operations of the federal government to provide abortion-related services.

Thermo Fisher (TMO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Turkcell Iletisim (NYSE:TKC) are examples of this. So, we think they are well-positioned to dodge market volatility and as such should be a good addition to one’s portfolio now. Read on.Last week, the Senate’s approval of a compromise bill helped avoid a U.S. debt default. Also, according to a Factset report, more S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance for the third quarter. However, the market remains volatile because ongoing supply chain disruptions and rising oil prices are adding fuel to an inflationary environment.
Furthermore, the spread of the COVID-19 cases continues to concern investors regarding the pace of the global economic recovery. According to a Bankrate survey, most top experts believe that a stock market correction is likely within the next year.
Amid current volatility, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX), and  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri  A.S. (TKC) could be good additions to one’s portfolio. Their less-than-one beta and solid growth attributes could help them dodge the volatility.

They each still look undervalued at their current price levels. Read on.The price of U.S. crude recently rallied to seven-year highs, fueled by the restrained supply from oil-producing countries amid rebounding demand. Oil prices have risen more than 16% since the start of September. Furthermore, high natural gas prices are adding to the oil price spike.
Also driving the rally is OPEC+’s decision to stick to its earlier agreement to increase the worldwide supply by a limited amount, ignoring the heightened demand. The White House has called for more support from oil-producing countries to address the price spike.
The thriving oil industry has attracted immense investor attention, causing several energy stocks to become overvalued.

Novares, which makes plastic components used in one in three vehicles worldwide, is seeking compensation for the cancellations that have left its stocks piling up.
""We have counted 2,000 sudden customer production halts since the start of the year, easily one hundred with less than 48 hours' notice,"" Novares CEO Pierre Boulet told Reuters.
He said the company would rely on commercial talks, not legal action, to be compensated.
The situation has been especially tense in Europe, Boulet added, highlighting the firm ""could not be responsible"" for carmakers' financial constraints.
The global chips shortage and supply chain snags have forced carmakers still recovering from last year's coronavirus disruptions to again pause production, as they compete for supplies with the sprawling consumer electronics industry. 
Toyota said earlier on Friday it would cut its November production by as much as 15%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Skoda Auto warned it ""would significantly cut, or even suspend"" its production from Monday.

The automotive sector had hoped for improvement by the fourth quarter, but issues in supplying components from Asia could last into early 2022.
""Some of our clients are very polite, they warn us in advance and are ready to compensate the extra costs, but some only want a power struggle"" said Boulet. ""We are in a macho and somewhat selfish world.""

247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>",Snap Shares Outpace Facebook’s With Faster Growth and Less Controversy,"(Bloomberg) --  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). shares have been soaring throughout 2021, and recent stumbles by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., its biggest social-media competitor, have made the stretch of outperformance even more stark.
The parent of Snapchat has gained over 50% this year, more than double Facebook’s nearly 20% advance. The gap has been especially sharp over the past month, with Snap rising about 2% as investors bet that its upcoming results will mark another quarter of robust growth. Facebook is down more than 10% over the same period, floundering amid accusations that content spread on its platforms is toxic, and prospects of tighter regulation.
Among other social-media stocks,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). is up about 17% in 2021 while Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc. has tumbled 20% on concerns over user growth.
“Snap’s growth has really helped it stand apart from its peers, and it is continuing to see strong usage and engagement,” said Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “At the same time, Facebook is dealing with trust issues. Because Snap is more about messaging and entertainment than sharing news, it is less tied to concerns over misinformation or corporate governance.”
While Facebook is no stranger to controversy, recent news has been decidedly negative. A high-profile whistleblower said the company puts profits over the safety of its users, and one of its earliest investors said Facebook had lost people’s trust “for good reasons.” Facebook’s apps also suffered a lengthy outage earlier this month, during which time use of Snapchat surged more than 20%, according to Sensor Tower data.
On Friday, Snap was little changed and Facebook fell more than 1%, even as the Nasdaq 100 Index was posting gains. A representative for Snap declined to comment. Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Growth Story 
Snap’s 2021 outperformance can be traced in part to February, when it forecast years of revenue increases above 50%, a target it easily exceeded in subsequent quarterly reports. The company’s third-quarter results will be released on Oct. 21, and Wall Street is looking for growth above 60%.
Facebook is a much larger company than Snap, with more than 1.9 billion daily active users, compared with 293 million for Snap in its latest quarter. Its revenue is expected to near $30 billion this quarter, compared with $1.1 billion at Snap. 
Despite that larger scale, it is also a reliable growth name, with investors expecting revenue will rise more than 35% when it reports Oct. 25. However, the company throughout 2021 has warned that changes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s privacy policy will be a drag. 
Diminished Data
The revisions -- which restrict data collection on iPhones, diminishing Facebook’s ability to sell targeted ads -- contributed to the stock falling after its most recent report in July. More weakness came from a September blog post by Facebook that acknowledged the impact on advertisers was more than expected.
In a note dated Oct. 11, Evercore ISI wrote that Apple’s change had diminished Facebook’s competitive advantage over peers in the digital-advertising space. “This ‘leveling of the playing field’ could be a benefit to alternative direct-response ad platforms like Snap and TikTok, because their relatively lower ad prices, due to less precise targeting and measurement, may now make more economic sense for advertisers,” wrote analyst Mark Mahaney.
On Friday, Mahaney added Facebook to the firm’s tactical underperform list, writing that among its peers, it is facing “some of the greatest risk to Street estimates this quarter,” in part because of Apple’s policy.
Wall Street analysts are about equally positive on the two stocks. Facebook’s consensus rating -- a proxy for its ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings -- is 4.48 out of five, compared with Snap’s consensus rating of 4.55. However, the average analyst price target for Facebook points to gains of nearly 30% in the stock. The return potential for Snap is less than half that, at almost 14%.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 11:26AM ET</span>",Exclusive-China looks to lock in U.S. LNG as energy crunch raises concerns -sources,"By Chen Aizhu, Jessica Jaganathan and Scott DiSavino
SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major Chinese energy companies are in advanced talks with U.S. exporters to secure long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG)supplies, as soaring gas prices and domestic power shortages heighten concerns about the country's fuel security, several sources said.
At least five Chinese firms, including state major Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Corp and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) and local government-backed energy distributors like Zhejiang Energy, are in discussions with U.S. exporters, mainly Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) and Venture Global, the sources told Reuters. 
The discussions could lead to deals worth tens of billions of dollars that would mark a surge in China's LNG imports from the United States in coming years. At the height of a Sino-U.S. trade war in 2019, gas trade briefly came to a standstill. LNG export facilities can take years to build, and there are several projects in North America in the works that are not expected to start exporting until the middle of the decade.
Talks with U.S. suppliers began early this year but speeded up in recent months amid one of the biggest power-generating, heating fuel crunch in decades. Natural gas prices in Asia have jumped more than fivefold this year, sparking fears of power shortages in the winter.
""Companies faced a supply gap (for winter) and surging prices. Talks really picked up since August when spot prices touched $15/mmbtu"", said a Beijing-based senior industry source briefed on the talks.
Another Beijing-based source said: ""After experiencing the recent massive market volatility, some buyers were regretting that they didn't sign enough long-term supplies."" 
Graphic: China's natural gas imports since 2018: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/dwpkrrkwjvm/China%20gas%20imports%20since%202018%20and%20Asia%20spot%20prices.jpg 
Sources expected fresh deals to be announced over the coming few months, after privately controlled ENN Natural Gas Co,, headed by the ex-LNG chief of China's largest buyer, CNOOC, announced a 13-year deal with Cheniere on Monday.
It was the first major U.S.-China LNG deal since 2018. 
The new purchases will also cement China's position as the world's top LNG buyer, taking over from Japan this year.
""As state-owned enterprises, companies are all under pressure to keep security of supply and the recent price trend has deeply changed the image of long-term supplies in the mind of leadership,"" said the first Beijing-based trader.
""People may have taken the spot (market) as the key in the past, but are now realizing that long-term cargoes are the backbone.""
CHEAPER U.S. GAS
The sources declined to be identified as the negotiations are private.
Sinopec declined comment. CNOOC and Zhejiang Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Venture Global and Cheniere both declined comment. 
""We expect more deals to be signed before year-end. It's primarily driven by the global energy crunch and prices we're seeing now... U.S. supplies now stand out as attractive,"" said a third Beijing source briefed on the talks. 
U.S. cargoes used to be expensive versus oil-linked supplies from Qatar and Australia for example, but are cheaper now. 
A deal at $2.50 + 115% of Henry Hub futures, similar to ENN's deal according to traders, would be roughly about $9-$10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on a delivered basis into Northeast Asia. This includes an average shipping cost of $2 per mmBtu for the U.S.-China route. 
Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence with consultancy Poten & Partners said Chinese companies are heavily exposed to Brent-related pricing for LNG and the U.S. purchases give some diversity to the pricing.
Asian spot gas prices are currently trading at above $37 per mmBtu after reaching a record high of over $56 earlier this month. 
Traders expect prices to go higher in winter when demand typically surges.
Chinese buyers are scouting for both near-term shipments to cover demand this winter and long-term imports as demand for gas, seen by Beijing as a key bridge fuel before reaching its 2060 carbon-neutral goal, is set for steady growth through 2035.

It's hard to estimate a total volume of the deals being discussed, sources said, but Sinopec alone could be eyeing 4 million tonnes annually as the company is most exposed to the spot market versus domestic rivals PetroChina and CNOOC, said a third source.
Traders said Sinopec is in final talks with 3 to 4 companies to buy 1 million tonnes a year for 10 years, starting from 2023, and is looking for U.S. volumes as part of the requirement.
Delays in LNG export projects in Canada, in which PetroChina owns a stake, and Mozambique, where both PetroChina and CNOOC have invested, also made U.S. supplies attractive, sources added.
North American LNG exporters have been adding to capacity because of demand in major Asian economies.
Cheniere, the largest exporter out of the United States, said in late September it expects to announce ""a number of other transactions"" that will support their going forward with the Corpus Stage 3 expansion next year. 
Venture Global is building or developing over 50 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG production capacity in Louisiana, including the 10-MTPA Calcasieu, which is expected to cost around $4.5 billion and start producing LNG in test mode in late 2021.

However, some buyers remained cautious. 
""There is a lot of hype in the market and nobody knows for sure how long this supply crunch would last. For companies that do not have fresh demand in the next year or two, it's better to wait,"" said a separate Chinese importer.

Therefore, we believe Chinese stocks NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) and Weibo Corporation (NASDAQ:WB) are well-positioned to soar in price in the coming months. Let’s discuss.
A virtual summit by U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, which is expected to be held before the end of this year, could address issues at the heart of U.S.-China rivalry. Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies believes that although this summit indicates only a “limited thaw” in the bilateral relationship, it could help stabilize U.S.-China competition and help avoid misunderstandings.
Chinese technology stocks surged in price last week, driven by the news of the planned virtual summit between the two nations and a sense of relief as U.S. policymakers averted a Congressional debt ceiling standoff to avoid a default. In addition, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said there could be investment opportunities on both sides, especially in the areas of capital markets, technology, cybersecurity, and climate change, even if there is a minimal material improvement in the relationship between the two countries. So this could be an opportune time for investors to bet on Chinese stocks.
We think Chinese stocks NetEase, Inc. (NTES) and Weibo Corporation (WB) could be good bets now because they are well-positioned to generate solid returns on a better U.S.-China relationship.

253,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 10:47AM ET</span>","Alcoa Surges On Higher Aluminum Pricing, Dividend And Buyback Program","Aluminum supplier  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) surged in Friday morning trading following a strong Q3 earnings report and the initiation of a dividend program for the first time as a newly constituted company.
The company reported $1.76/share in earnings, or $2.05 on an adjusted basis, both a sequential improvement and a reversal from losing money in Q32020. Its revenue growth was driven by a sequential increase of 13 percent in the average realized third-party price of primary aluminum, another reminder of commodity price inflation over recent months.
Alcoa’s quarter produced $352M in cash flow, and the company also called out its improved balance sheet, with no debt maturities until 2027.
Alcoa CEO and President, Roy Harvey, said, “The strategic work we’ve been implementing across our Company has helped us effectively capture the benefits from very strong market fundamentals and deliver another excellent quarter with record profitability. Today, Alcoa is stronger and better poised for the future, and we plan to continue our positive momentum and consistently deliver value through the commodity cycle.”
It could be with this in mind that the company instituted a dividend and buyback program. While the quarterly dividend starts at $.1/share, or an annual yield of .7% at the post-earnings share price, the $500M share buyback may be meatier, as it would cover roughly 4.75% of the shares outstanding if executed at the current price.
More significant to investors may be the company’s comments: “Based on our view of markets and expected cash flows, we believe these programs can be sustained through the commodity cycle,” Harvey said. CFO William Oplinger added, ““The share repurchase program will be financed by operating cash flows and cash on hand, as the balance sheet has continued to strengthen with proportional adjusted net debt is at its lowest level since the inception of our Company in 2016.”

The company pulled a test flight out of Q4 2021, rescheduling it until the completion of a “planned enhancement program for VMS Eve and VSS Unity,” two of its vehicles. They also announced that their commercial service is “now expected to commence in Q4 2022,” from a previous target of commencing in 2022.
Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic, said: “The re-sequencing of our enhancement period and the Unity 23 flight underscores our safety-first procedures, provides the most efficient path to commercial service, and is the right approach for our business and our customers.”
Reacting to the news, Bank of America’s Ronald Epstein dropped his price target on the company to $20 from $25, maintaining an underperform rating, and said: “Commercial operations are still expected by the end of 2022, however, we are uncertain about the company’s ability to forecast such a future and unknown event after the recent failure to call the timing right on a relatively-known short-term event.”
Meanwhile, per StreetInsider, Truist analyst Michael Carmoli reiterated a buy rating and a $50 price target but acknowledged “a general lack of catalysts over the next 12 months could keep the stock range bound.”
Virgin Galactic went public via a SPAC run by noted investor Chamath Palihapitiya in late 2019, and has traded on excitement around space travel (for example) as well as meme stock momentum at times. At today’s trading levels, the stock is down 13% for the year and 67% from 52-week highs.
The company still sports a $4.8B enterprise value despite being largely pre-revenue, with $571K in revenue in the first half of the year, illustrating the excitement around space travel and the high expectations for the company.

Although the vaccine is currently not allowed for that age group, it has been authorized for use in children over 12 years of age in both the United States and the European Union. 
The companies earlier this month asked U.S. regulators to also grant emergency use authorization of the shot for young children, and an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to meet next month to review the data. 

While children are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, they can spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations more at risk of severe illness.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",Explainer-Germany's Nord Stream 2 gatekeeper: the long road until gas flows,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is completed and ready to pump Russian gas to Europe, but nothing is flowing yet because it is still awaiting clearance from Germany's energy regulator.
Europe's most controversial energy project, which is led by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), has faced resistance from the United States and Ukraine among others.
A move by the German regulator last week to ask the pipeline operator, Swiss-based Nord Stream 2 AG, for assurances it will not break competition rules suggests it could take several more months before the 1,200 km pipeline gets the green light.
WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?
Germany's Federal Network Agency - which regulates the country's electricity, gas, telecommunications, post and railway sectors - has until early January to come up with a recommendation on whether or not it will certify the pipeline that runs from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
While technical requirements have been met, the key sticking point is whether Gazprom will comply with European unbundling rules that require pipeline owners to be different from suppliers of gas flowing in them to ensure fair competition.
The Nord Stream 2 operator claims the rules are aimed at torpedoing the pipeline and last week scored a partial victory when an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended that Gazprom could challenge the EU rules.
The project's identically-sized sister pipeline, Nord Stream 1, has been exempt from unbundling rules since opening in 2011 because it was treated as an interconnector rather than as direct supplier.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION?
Once a three-member independent ruling committee at the network agency has made its recommendation it goes to the European Commission, which has another two months to respond.
If both bodies are in agreement that the pipeline fulfils all regulatory requirements then certification can be issued relatively quickly, but if they aren't the process could be further delayed.
Certification can be only given if both have worked out any differences that may arise, which means that it could take until spring 2022 before the pipeline gets certified and can officially start operation.
CAN THE AGENCY REALLY BLOCK THE PIPELINE?
Effectively, no. Even though certification is a requirement the network agency is quite limited in how it can prevent Gazprom from simply starting to pump gas right away.
Its toughest tool is a one-time 1 million euro ($1.2 million) fine on the operator if it starts operation without certification.
As a regulator it can also launch an investigation but any legal process is expected to be lengthy and will not result in a short-term prevention of gas flows.
Gazprom, meanwhile, said in August it expects Nord Stream 2 to deliver 5.6 billion cubic metres bcm, about a tenth of the pipeline's annual capacity, already in 2021 if supplies start in October.
WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES?
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in recent months, has made it clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that playing by the rules was vital in ensuring ongoing political support for the pipeline, two government sources familiar with the matter have said.
Merkel openly said that the political basis for operating Nord Stream 2 was Russia's commitment to continue to use Ukraine as a gas transit route in the future as well.
""Putin is smart enough to know that the sentiment among German politicians regarding the project will become rather problematic, so he should not provide any reason to endanger operations,"" one of the sources said.
IS THE NETWORK AGENCY POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT?
No. For its own recommendation the agency needs a binding assessment on supply security by Germany's Economy and Energy Ministry, of which it is a part.
""Certification can only be granted if the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy determines that granting certification will not jeopardize the security of gas supply of the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Union,"" a spokesperson for the agency said.
The Economy Ministry has said it is currently working on this assessment, but has not given a timeline for when it will be completed. Should it determine that operating Nord Stream 2 will put gas supply at risk the agency cannot certify it.
WILL GERMANY'S ELECTION HAVE AN IMPACT?
Until a new government is in place, Germany's Economy Ministry is led by Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel's conservative party, which has backed the pipeline.
Under Merkel, who is still running the country until a new coalition is formed, Germany recently struck a deal with Washington to allow the controversial pipeline to go ahead.
As a result, the threshold for the next government reversing the deal is very high, even in the likely event that the Greens - which have fiercely opposed the project - become part of the next ruling coalition, two people familiar with the matter said.

In addition, Olaf Scholz, who led the Social Democrats to victory in last month's election and stands a good chance to succeed Merkel as chancellor, has been in favour of the pipeline.

In addition, since the stock market is bracing for a year-end rally, some travel stocks should gain significantly. Specifically, we think InterContinental Hotels (IHG),  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW), and Mesa Air (MESA) are poised to deliver solid returns in the coming months. Read on.The travel and tourism market is expected to reach $924.28 billion by 2025, registering a 24.5% CAGR, but the industry’s year-over-year contribution to global GDP is expected to rise by less than one-third in 2021. Despite fears surrounding the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, nearly 54 million tourists crossed international borders in July 2021, the strongest results since April 2020.
With the rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines globally, and the economy’s reopening, the travel industry is expected to regain its momentum in the near term. Pent-up demand for travel ahead of the holiday season and the rising need for business travel as offices reopen should bolster the industry’s recovery. Moreover, since better days may be coming for the stock market as the end of October and beginning of November nears , many travel stocks could witness a rally.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet now on quality travel stocks InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG), SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW), and Mesa Air Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MESA).

LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange has told customers in Europe to draw up contingency plans in case the European Union severs their access to clearing houses in Britain after next June.
The EU has granted Britain so-called 'temporary equivalence' access since it cut ties with the bloc last December, allowing the LME and clearing houses run by the London Stock Exchange and ICE (NYSE:ICE) to continue serving customers on the continent until June 30, 2022.
""Given that we have been forewarned of the position, it is important that we take swift steps to mitigate the potential implications of this and ensure that alternative arrangements can be put in place in good time,"" the LME said in a memo on its website.
The LME, which trades and clears metals contracts, said it would work closely with members to ensure an efficient transfer of clearing or closing out of existing positions to minimise potential disruption.
Options include resigning membership of the LME and then trading and clearing contracts through another member of the exchange, the LME said.
The derivatives industry is increasingly worried about the market disruption the lack of access to the EU would cause to metals, interest rate and credit default swaps contracts worth trillions of euros and want clarity from Brussels as soon as possible.
EU pressure on banks to shift clearing from London to Frankfurt has had little impact so far as the bloc's regulators assess if such a move should be mandated in some way.
Although the LME is not part of this assessment, the end of equivalence would mean it too would be cut off from the bloc, where there are no alternative products for users to hedge their metal purchases.
SELECTIVE ACCESS?
Industry officials expect the EU to grant Britain a temporary extension, but with high volume interest rate and credit default swaps in euros excluded, meaning clearing would have to move to the bloc, perhaps over a ""transition"" period.
""That is what I expect to happen and I believe the European Commission is working on that now,"" said a senior EU banking official with knowledge of industry discussions with the bloc.
Doing nothing in the face of the limited shift in clearing to date would damage EU credibility, the official added.

A European Commission spokesperson said the focus is on reducing ""excessive reliance"" on market infrastructure outside the bloc to create an open, strong and resilient EU financial system.
""In particular, the goal is not to move or take business away from London but rather to build our own infrastructures,"" the spokesperson said.

Alitalia, which operated its last flight on Thursday, was part of the SkyTeam alliance with Air France, KLM and Delta. But ITA will have to negotiate a pact from scratch and could choose to team up with others, such as Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners.
""I am open to negotiate with everyone,"" Chairman Alfredo Altavilla said at a digital event to mark the debut of the airline. ""ITA has been created to be a strategic element in one of the large networks that already exist in the sector.""
""ITA can't be a stand-alone carrier forever,"" Altavilla said, although he said the new carrier would not sacrifice its Rome Fiumicino and Milan Linate airport hubs to please a future partner. 

ITA started flying in place of Alitalia on Friday, after the airline that was once a symbol of Italian style and glamour was finally grounded after years of financial losses and failed rescue attempts.
Despite buying the brand from Alitalia, the carrier will fly jets with a new blue livery with traditional green-white-red from the Italian flag as details.

Japan's leading carmaker said in a press release it would produce between 100,000 and 150,000 fewer vehicles in November than it had planned for a month that was meant see a rebound in lost output. 
That reduction comes after cuts in September and October as supplies of components from factories in Malaysia and Vietnam slowed because of increased COVID-19 infections there, forcing Toyota to trim its production target for the year to March 31 by 300,000 vehicles to 9 million. 
On Friday, the company stuck to that forecast, meaning it will have to ramp up production for the remainder of the business year, relying on a decline in COVID-19 infection rates in Southeast Asia to allow chip factories to raise output.
""I can't predict what is going to happen, but I think we are through the worst period of lower production risks,"" Kazunari Kumakura, an executive at the world's biggest carmaker, said during an online briefing.
Toyota wants to restart curtailed production in December https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-aims-make-up-some-lost-production-supplies-rebound-sources-2021-10-12 and is asking its component suppliers in Southeast Asia to boost supplies so it can claw back some lost production, three sources familiar with the carmaker's plans told Reuters earlier.
The total reduction in production from September through November will be as much as 910,000 vehicles, a Toyota spokesperson said. 
In North America, the reduction for November will range from 45,000 to 55,000 vehicles. 
The Japanese carmaker, which had hardened its supply chain against disruptions after a major earthquake hit Japan's northeast coast in 2011, was the last of the major global automakers to cut production because of parts shortages even as demand for cars rebounded. 
Car sales in China in September fell by a fifth from a year earlier because there were fewer vehicles for people to buy.

In addition to forcing chip factories to close, the pandemic has spurred stay-at-home demand for tablets and other electronic devices that has made semiconductors shortages worse. 
Toyota is still seeing robust demand for its vehicles and therefore wants to raise production in December, Kumakura said.

MILAN (Reuters) -New, state-owned carrier Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) took over from Alitalia on Friday, permanently grounding the 75-year old one-time symbol of Italian style and glamour after years of financial losses and failed rescue attempts.
An early morning flight from Milan landed in the southern city of Bari just before 0600 GMT to mark the debut of the new, downsized carrier that flies with the same green-white-red livery of its predecessor.
The traditional choice of popes, prima donnas and Italy's political elite, Alitalia has been run by state-appointed administrators since 2017 to avoid being liquidated.
The airline founded in 1946 passed through a dizzying succession of restructurings and changes of ownership.
The company has ended only one year in the black this century and the government has run to its rescue many times, spending more than 8 billion euros ($9.27 billion) just in the last three years.
ITA won Alitalia's iconic brand for 90 million euros, nearly one third of what Alitalia was hoping for, the carrier said late on Friday.
As has often been the case during its lifetime, Alitalia's last rites were surrounded by political dispute, with the far-right opposition party Brothers of Italy blaming Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government for its demise.
""Today we are losing another jewel, a company that has forged the history of our nation and ... made us proud to be Italian,"" said the party leader Giorgia Meloni.
After seeking to sell Alitalia to private investors, in 2020 Rome surrendered to the disastrous consequences of the pandemic for the airline sector and decided to create ITA from its ashes.
The new carrier, in which the government will invest 1.35 billion euros over three years, will start with 52 jets and 2,800 employees, compared with around 110 aircraft and a workforce of 10,000 for Alitalia.
Under a deal negotiated with the European Commission, there must be clear discontinuity between Alitalia and its successor, and the new carrier needs to be profitable by the end of its 2021-2025 business plan.
However, Alitalia's legacy of high costs, mismanagement and heavy political and trade union influence may be hard for ITA to shrug off.

The launch of a nimbler carrier leaves a question mark over the future of more than 7,000 Alitalia workers who will be put under a temporary lay-off scheme paid for by the government until at least the end of 2022.

LAS VEGAS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Global shipping and supply chain disruptions are making it harder for corporate planemakers and suppliers to meet resurgent demand for parts, according to industry executives and analysts. 
Disruptions, which are also hitting commercial aviation, are beginning to drive up costs and risk slowing down the aerospace industry's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
With private aviation traffic surpassing 2019 levels this year, some corporate planemakers and suppliers at a flagship business jet show in Las Vegas this week flagged warning signs about supply chain and labor hiccups.
    Their comments added to recent concerns expressed by Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury about mounting pressure on commercial aerospace's supply chain.
Aerospace has, so far, avoided the scale of supply woes faced by auto makers and machinery companies as planemakers Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus are producing fewer jets than before the pandemic.
But supply chain strains are increasingly becoming visible for the production of narrow-body jets, which have seen a pick-up in demand due to a recovery in short-haul trips, said Eric Bernardini, global co-head of aerospace, defense and aviation at consultants AlixPartners.
Easing travel restrictions and the lure of private flights have led to an unexpected surge in business jet traffic, filling seats for private operators and expanding order backlogs for planemakers, but straining supply of jets, parts and pilots. 
Planes produced by Cessna business jet producer  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) are flying around 20% more than in 2019, putting pressure on suppliers to keep up with the need to deliver replacement parts.
""We're in a healthier position compared to what it could be, but we are starting to see some issues,"" said Ron Draper, chief executive of Textron Aviation.
Draper said Textron is managing the hiccups, but is still ""seeing some suppliers pop up with capacity constraints."" 
Stirling Macfarlane, a segment manager in aerospace with PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG), said at the show that the maker of aircraft coatings and transparencies has faced some delays in receiving needed components.
Aerospace companies are experiencing shortages of semiconductor chip and plastics, and paying far more for raw materials like steel and aluminum, Bernardini said.
The input costs are going up at a time when the pricing power in commercial aerospace industry is constrained because of overall weak demand, making it harder for equipment makers and their suppliers to pass along the increased costs to customers.
The aviation industry on average paid 27% to 44% more for raw materials in the first half of this year compared to last year, according to data from AlixPartners.
Protecting profit margins is the ""number one worry"" for the industry, Bernardini said.
Companies are also struggling to find enough skilled workers to ramp up production and are battling shipping delays.
Adequate staffing levels are needed to meet anticipated production increases in 2022 and 2023, said Robert Martin, chief executive of lessor BOC Aviation at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Wednesday.
 Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) is keeping more parts available in its warehouses for customers, despite higher carrying costs, said Marsha Woelber, head of customer relations and aftermarket sales for the Brazilian planemaker. 
""We've staged more inventory at local warehouses around the world because we know there is disruption when you look at international cargo flights or shipping containers,"" she said.
Some U.S. states are taking steps to help ease the bottlenecks.
Oklahoma, for example, created a portal earlier this year that helps connect local suppliers with manufacturers, such as ones in aerospace that are looking to diversify their supply chain to help fill in the gaps. 

Draper said the challenge would be greater if production by commercial airlines returns to the levels of 2019, which could be a year or two away. 
""If Boeing and Airbus get back to the arms race they were in and absorbing a lot of capacity, we could face capacity constraints.""

272,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",Ex-Boeing 737 MAX chief technical pilot indicted for fraud,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former chief technical pilot for Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co was charged with fraud on Thursday for deceiving federal regulators evaluating the company's 737 MAX jet, hindering the ability to protect airline passengers and leaving ""pilots in the lurch,"" the U.S. Justice Department said.
Mark Forkner, 49, was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on six counts of scheming to defraud Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers to obtain tens of millions of dollars for Boeing, the government said.
Boeing declined to comment. A lawyer for Forkner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the indictment, Forkner, largely in the run-up to the Federal Aviation Administration's decision to approve the 737 MAX in 2017, provided the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group with ""materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information"" about a new part of the flight controls for the Boeing 737 MAX, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
The MCAS, a software feature designed to automatically push the airplane’s nose down in certain conditions, was tied to two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX over a five-month period that killed 346 people and led to the FAA's grounding the plane for 19 months, an action which was lifted in November 2020.
""In an attempt to save Boeing money, Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators,"" said Chad Meacham, the acting U.S. attorney for Northern Texas. ""His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency's ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 MAX flight controls.""
The FAA declined comment.
In January, Boeing agreed to pay https://www.reuters.com/article/boeing-737max-justice-int/boeing-to-pay-2-5-billion-to-settle-u-s-criminal-probe-into-737-max-crashes-idUSKBN29D07Q more than $2.5 billion in fines and compensation after reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Justice Department over the MAX crashes, which cost Boeing more than $20 billion.
The January agreement faulted Boeing's conduct and said it was holding the largest U.S. planemaker ""accountable for its employees’ criminal misconduct."" https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/boeing-charged-737-max-fraud-conspiracy-and-agrees-pay-over-25-billion
In January, Boeing admitted in court documents that through two former employees it deceived the FAA about the MCAS.
Prosecutors noted that a key FAA document lacked any reference to the MCAS, and as a result airplane manuals and pilot-training materials for U.S.-based airlines also lacked any reference.
One November 2016 message from Forkner said he was working at ""jedi-mind tricking regulators into accepting the training that I got accepted by FAA.""
If the FAA required pilot simulator training for MAX pilots, Boeing would have been required to pay Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) nearly $400 million to offset the simulator-based pilot training requirements, a 2020 U.S. House of Representatives report said.
In 2019, the FAA required simulator training before pilots could resume flying the MAX.

Forkner is charged with two counts of fraud involving aircraft parts in interstate commerce and four counts of wire fraud. He is expected to make his initial court appearance Friday in Fort Worth, Texas.
If convicted, he potentially faces decades in prison.

Germany and other governments in Europe are seeking to provide relief for consumers as gas prices skyrocket.
The reduction in the German levy, to 3.723 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), confirms a Reuters report on Thursday. It will not take effect until Jan. 1.
The government will help fund the cut with 3.25 billion euros ($3.77 billion) in revenue collected from carbon taxes.
The fee, which was reduced by 3.9% last year to help the economy out of the coronavirus slump, is collected under the renewable energy act (EEG) and paid to producers of wind and solar electricity installations.
The EEG fee makes up one-fifth of a consumer's energy bill.
Transmission system operators (TSOs) calculate the fee by continuously monitoring income from the EEG levy payments and the size of the account in which they are deposited, and by factoring in wholesale prices and anticipated feed-in of renewable power onto the grids.
They said that in 2022 renewable power production is expected to rise by 11 terawatt hours (TWh) to 239 TWh, worth 22.8 billion euros at expected market prices.
The TSOs are Amprion, 50Hertz, TransnetBW and Tennet.
Price comparison portal Verivox said a typical household consuming 4,000 kWh per year would save 132 euros on its annual bill. 
But this is only arithmetic, because the savings may not be passed on fully by suppliers.
""Because of high wholesale market prices and rising network tariffs, there will not be significant relief for households,"" it said.

Kerstin Andreae, of the German utility industry association BDEW, said the incoming German government should quickly abolish the EEG fee. ""That would relieve power customers and not least medium-sized industries permanently,"" she said in a statement.

275,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 05:16AM ET</span>","U.S. Senator Warren urges Amazon breakup, India retailers want probe after Reuters story","By Aditya Kalra and Steve Stecklow
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Indian retailers demanded a government probe of the company after a Reuters investigation showed the e-commerce giant had copied products and rigged search results in India.
The Reuters report https://t.co/PiVEqAgjY6, reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, found that the U.S. company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets. 
Wednesday's report showed that, at least in India, manipulating search results to favour Amazon’s products, as well as copying other sellers’ goods, were part of a formal strategy at Amazon – and that at least two senior executives had reviewed it.
The Reuters investigation drew bipartisan criticism of Amazon from U.S. lawmakers.
Linking to the story on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1448397325047566341 and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Warren, a long-time critic of Amazon, said ""these documents show what we feared about Amazon’s monopoly power — that the company is willing and able to rig its platform to benefit its bottom line while stiffing small businesses and entrepreneurs.""
""This is one of the many reasons we need to break it up,"" she said.
Warren, a prominent Democrat, advocated the breakup of Amazon and other tech giants in 2019 when she was running for president. Since then, as a senator from Massachusetts, she has continued to apply pressure on companies like Amazon. 
Ken Buck, a Republican on the House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee, also shared the story on social media, saying https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1448304840640237571, ""These documents prove Amazon engages in anticompetitive practices such as rigging search results and self-preferencing their own products over competitors.""
""More concerning, it contradicts what Jeff Bezos told Congress,"" the Colorado lawmaker said. ""Amazon and Bezos must be held accountable.""
Asked for comment on the reactions, Amazon issued a statement similar to one it provided for the Reuters investigation. 
""These allegations are incorrect and unsubstantiated,"" it said. ""We display search results based on relevance to the customers, irrespective of whether such products are private brands offered by sellers or not.""
Amazon said it ""strictly prohibits the use or sharing of non-public, seller-specific data with sellers, including with sellers of private brands,"" and investigates reports of its employees acting contrary to that policy.
The company did not comment on the criticisms by U.S. lawmakers or Indian retailers.
INDIA RETAILERS, START-UPS CONCERNED
In sworn testimony before the subcommittee last year, Amazon founder Bezos said the company prohibits its employees from using data on individual sellers to help its private-label business. In 2019 another Amazon executive testified that the company does not use such data to create its own private-label products or alter its search results to favour them.
The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed how the company's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from its India unit to copy products sold by other companies, then offered them on its platform. 
The company promoted sales of its private brands like AmazonBasics by rigging search results on its platform in India so that its products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results.”
A group representing millions of India's brick-and-mortar retailers said on Thursday the country's government must launch an investigation into Amazon.
""Amazon is causing a great disadvantage to the small manufacturers. They are eating the cake that is not meant for them,"" Praveen Khandelwal of the Confederation of All India Traders told Reuters. The group says it represents 80 million retail stores in the country.
Indian retailers say foreign e-commerce businesses like Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart indulge in unfair business practices that hurt smaller firms, allegations the companies deny.
The Alliance of Digital India Foundation, a nonprofit representing some of India’s biggest startups, said the practices detailed in the Reuters report were ""highly deplorable"", calling into question ""the credibility of Amazon as a good faith operator in the Indian startup ecosystem"".
In a blog post https://blog.adif.in/p/adif-amazon-reuters-ecommerce-fair-markets, the group urged the Indian government to take action against “Amazon’s predatory playbook of copying, rigging and killing Indian brands”. 

A top official in the economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, urged consumers to shun the company on Thursday.
""I call upon people of this country to #boycottAmazon,” Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said on Twitter https://twitter.com/ashwani_mahajan/status/1448525157476175879?s=20.

Cash-strapped Evergrande has been scrambling to divest some assets to repay creditors knocking on its doors. With more than $300 billion in liabilities, it has already missed three rounds of interest payments on its international bonds. 
The Financial Reporting Council said it had launched an inquiry into Evergrande's accounts for the full year of 2020 and the first half of 2021, and an investigation of PwC's audit of Evergrande's 2020 accounts. 
The FRC said Evergrande as of end 2020 reported cash and cash equivalents of 159 billion yuan ($24.73 billion), which did not cover its current liabilities of 1.5 trillion yuan, and had further borrowings of 167 billion yuan maturing in 2022. 
However, the accounts made no explicit statement about whether material going concern uncertainties existed before or after the effects of implementing plans Evergrande said it had to mitigate potential impacts on cash flow, it said. 
PwC expressed an unmodified audit opinion in its auditor’s report on the 2020 annual accounts, but made no reference to material uncertainties regarding whether Evergrande was a going concern, the FRC said.

Investing.com - Leonardo SpA ADR (OTC:FINMY)) shares have yet to bounce back after the heavy losses on Thursday. The stock is up a little over 1% at € 6.74 on Friday, after dropping -7% Thursday on reports of components issues in the  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner jet production over the past three years.
Per a report in the Wall Street Journal, the defect involves titanium parts that are weaker than they should be, which has led to a backlog of over $25B in inventory. It adds to challenges Boeing has faced over the 737 Max and subsequent U.S. government concerns.
Boeing said the supplies were provided by Leonardo, who in turn would have bought them from the Italian company Manufacturing Processes Specification.
The Italian defense company has defended itself, saying that Manufacturing Processes Specification has been “qualified also by Boeing"", and insisted, “Leonardo is the injured party and will not bear any potential costs associated with this issue”. Leonardo also confirmed that Manufacturing Processes Specification is no longer a Leonardo supplier.
Analysts recommendations still lean towards a Buy rating, with 9 analysts out of 16 collected by the MarketScreener platform recommending the purchase compared to 6 that remain on Hold, with an average target price of € 9.27, which would be 37% upside from the current price.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy considering extending bank merger incentives to mid-2022 - sources,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Valentina Za
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Treasury is considering extending by six months tax breaks for corporate mergers it first introduced to entice a buyer for troubled state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), two sources close to the matter said.
The scheme applies to all companies, but it benefits mostly banks and is a key plank of an incentive package the Treasury has tabled to sell MPS to stronger rival UniCredit.
The extension would give UniCredit more time to approve the purchase of ""selected parts"" of MPS it has been discussing with the Treasury since early August.
In their current form, the tax breaks Rome introduced with the 2021 budget allow banks to pay a fee to turn into tax credits so-called deferred tax assets (DTAs) stemming from past losses in the case of merger deals approved by directors or shareholders by Dec. 31, 2021.
The Treasury is now considering extending that deadline to June 30, 2022, the sources said.
UniCredit and MPS are still negotiating the terms of their deal. While a preliminary accord is expected in the coming weeks, according to several people close to the negotiations, the formal approval that unlocks the incentives would require longer.
UniCredit and MPS both declined to comment.
Italy's tax agency in September clarified the scheme can be tapped for multiple, separate merger deals, which bankers said potentially opened the door to three-way mergers were the incentives to be extended.
The Treasury at present is planning to leave unchanged a cap on the incentives set at 2% of the assets of the smaller bank involved in the merger, the sources said.
Earlier this year the Treasury tried to push through measures to extend the incentives and raise the cap to 3%, but a political pushback forced it to shelve the changes, which would have been very costly.
Sources said at the time the ministry could review the cap and the timeframe of the incentives at a later stage.
The scheme has met resistance within Prime Minister Mario Draghi's coalition where many politicians are against using taxpayers' money to spur bank mergers and could still try to block the Treasury's push to lengthen the incentives.
In its current formulation, the scheme entails a 2.2 billion euro ($2.6 billion) boost for a buyer of MPS. 
Analysts see the incentives as a key consolidation driver for the Italian market, where mid-sized lenders like Banco BPM and BPER Banca are under pressure to seek a tie-up after Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) last year snatched UBI, the healthiest second-tier player, to cement its domestic leadership.

France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) earlier this year took over regional bank Creval, benefiting from the incentive scheme.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 04:51AM ET</span>","Analysis-Deals, data buzz could help biotech shares exit Wall St's 'no man's land'","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sluggish U.S. biotech shares could require a wave of deal-making or exciting clinical trial results if the sector wants to join the stock market's party after lagging Wall Street's broad advance this year. 
More certainty about the direction of prescription drug regulation, including the prospects for tougher pricing legislation, also could bolster the stocks.
An index of S&P 500 biotech companies is up 2% so far in 2021, while the overall S&P 500 has gained more than 18%. A closely watched ETF that better measures small and mid-cap biotech companies -- the SPDR S&P Biotech (NYSE:XBI) ETF -- is down nearly 10% for the year, and 27% from its high reached in February.
About $2.5 billion has flowed out of healthcare ETFs on a net basis since Aug. 31, or about 3% of total assets of those funds, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) strategist Steven DeSanctis. In the week ending Oct. 6, the SPDR biotech ETF saw its biggest weekly outflow on record, according to Refinitiv Lipper data.
After a strong 2020 particularly for smaller biotech stocks, investors said the group was due to back off. But biotech shares have been lost in broad investment themes this year, market watchers said.
They cited a tug-of-war between stocks expected to shine in an improving economy, such as energy and banks, and big tech and growth shares that strengthened during economic unease. 
“It seems like healthcare, and biotech specifically, is sort of in no man’s land on a year-to-date basis,” DeSanctis said. “The swings in the market have either been, I want to own cyclicals and or I want to be defensive.”
Among large biotech stocks, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is down 10% so far in 2021, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has slumped 23%.
The S&P 500 biotech index trades at price-to-earnings ratio of 10.2 times forward earnings estimates, a 50% discount to the S&P 500's P/E ratio of 20.4, according to Refinitiv Datastream data.
“When you look at the large caps, the growth opportunities and the prospects there are a lot more in question than they have been historically,” said Marshall Gordon, senior healthcare analyst at Clearbridge Investments.
For smaller companies, investors often look for a pickup in acquisitions to help improve biotech valuations. Healthcare companies are sitting on almost $500 billion in cash, a record amount, according to Jefferies analysts. 
""If we start to see more M&A, that should help trigger more positive sentiment around the space,” said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
Not all biotech stocks have struggled this year. Shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and BioNTech, have surged more than 200% so far in 2021.
But recent industry setbacks could be souring sentiment: Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s new and controversial Alzheimer's treatment has had an uncertain launch, Apellis Pharma shares tumbled following disappointing data for its experimental eye drug, and U.S. regulators placed a hold on studies of Allogene Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ALLO)' cancer medicine.
Data in coming months from major medical conferences, including a hematology meeting in December, could reinvigorate interest in biotech, Manuelian said.
Regulatory obstacles also persist. SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note this week that it was ""difficult to see"" a broad rally in the biopharma group in part because of ""the enduring overhang of drug pricing regulation risks, which in our view is likely to last until the end of the year.""

Uncertainty about the Food and Drug Administration, the industry's main regulator for which President Biden has yet to nominate a permanent commissioner, may also be clouding the investing environment, investors said.
""There have been a number of regulatory decisions that have been surprising,"" Gordon said. ""There are concerns that FDA is either getting harder or is just less predictable.""

The development comes after South Korea amended the Telecommunication Business Act in August to try to curb the tech majors' market dominance and stop the big app store operators such as Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google from charging commissions on in-app purchases.
The law went into effect last month but Apple had told the South Korean government that it was already complying and did not need to change its app store policy, a Korea Communications Commission (KCC) official in charge of the matter told Reuters. 
""This goes against the purpose of the amended law,"" the official said, requesting anonymity as the KCC was still in talks with Apple on compliance. 
The regulator would ask Apple's South Korean unit for a new company policy giving greater autonomy in payment methods, and if Apple failed to comply, would consider measures such as a fact-finding probe as a precursor to possible fines or other penalties. 
Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Google had informed the KCC that it planned to comply with the law, including allowing third-party payment systems, and would discuss the matter with the regulator starting next week, the KCC official said. 
Google did not immediately reply to a Reuters' request for comment.
Jung Jong-chae, a lawyer specialising in antitrust matters, said Apple had more to lose than Google from the Korean regulation.

""Differences between Apple and Google in willingness to give ground may be because Apple controls everything from hardware to operating system (OS) to app market to payment system,"" he told Reuters. 
""And (Apple) has more to lose if its dominance breaks on any front, which could lead to calls for openness on other fronts.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African banks say they have to keep funding at least some coal projects for now because an immediate halt would put huge political and economic strains on a nation that relies on the most polluting of fossil fuels.
The top four banks have started to withdraw financing, with Nedbank and FirstRand setting deadlines of 2025 and 2026 respectively to end funding for new thermal coal mines. Both have stopped lending to new coal-fired power plants.
But the banks still finance existing coal mines and power stations. Absa and Standard Bank, South Africa's other two leading lenders, have left the door open to funding some new coal mining or power projects.
Although coal-related lending makes up a small portion of their loan portfolios, the financing is vital for keeping the lights on and tens of thousands of people employed in Africa's most industrialised economy.
The state-run power company Eskom relies mainly on ailing coal-fired power stations to supply 90% of South Africa's electricity. More than 90,000 people were employed in coal mines in 2020.
""The profits we make on fossil fuels are miniscule,"" FirstRand Chief Executive Alan Pullinger told Reuters.
""The easiest thing would be to say 'we're out',"" he said, but he added that such a step would force the already heavily indebted government to step in to prop up the sector.
Ending funding for coal is in the spotlight ahead of a U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
The fuel is a major driver of climate-warming emissions, but also a relatively cheap form of power generation relied upon by many emerging economies. 
LOCAL CONTEXT
South African banks say local conditions demand they still support the industry but they face growing pressure from international investors in the push to cut emissions and fewer insurers are now ready to share the risks linked to coal assets.
South Africa was the 12th largest emitter of climate-warming gases globally in 2019, with Eskom accounting for more than 40%.
""We are dependent on Eskom, so we can't stop funding Eskom, because we'll shut down our entire economy,"" an executive at one of South Africa's top lenders said.
Eskom's largest coal suppler is miner Exxaro. As a result, the executive said: ""Right now, from an economic perspective, we can't shut off Exxaro.""
Nedbank said efforts to address climate change had to consider the local context. Absa said coal finance would be reduced but it had to balance macroeconomic and social issues with climate needs.
Wendy Dobson, head of group corporate citizenship at Standard Bank, said the bank planned to set boundaries for its exposure to climate risk, which would lead to limits on the amount of lending for coal and other fossil fuels.

Taking too hard a line with governments reliant on fossil fuels could prove counterproductive, she added. 
Banks were highly unlikely to extend new financing to coal projects and should be more explicit about this, said Emma Schuster, climate risk analyst at activist shareholder group JustShare said.

Lenders were also allowed to seek permission to sell assets backed by residential mortgages in order to free up more loan quota, the news agency said, amid concerns that the liquidity and debt crisis at China Evergrande Group could spread to other developers.
China has been ramping up property market curbs since late 2020, introducing new measures to closely monitor and control the debt levels of developers.
But with economic growth cooling and new construction starts slowing, speculation has been rife over whether it would start relaxing those restrictions, as was done during past downturns.[ECILT/CN]

289,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2021 01:12AM ET</span>","Analysis-With boosters, masks and Green Pass, Israel sees a COVID-19 wave in retreat","By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Four months into one of its worst COVID-19 outbreaks, Israel is seeing a sharp drop in new infections and severe illness, aided by its use of vaccine boosters, vaccine passports and mask mandates, scientists and health officials said.
    Israel was struck by its fourth coronavirus wave in June, fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant.
Rather than imposing new lockdown measures, the government bet on a third booster dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech vaccine for people age 12 and up, mandated face coverings and enforced use of a “Green Pass” - proof of vaccination, recovery from the illness or a negative test for the virus - at restaurants and other venues, even for children.  
Since peaking in early September, daily infections in Israel have fallen more than 80%, with severe cases nearly halved.
    ""Day by day we are breaking the Delta wave,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Tuesday, crediting government policy for ""close, smart and flexible management allowing life alongside coronavirus.""
    Israel's ""Living with COVID"" strategy, which has not come without cost or controversy, has kept schools and the economy open.
The Israeli Health Ministry on Thursday presented the latest safety and effectiveness data https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-advisers-weigh-case-covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-2021-10-14 from its booster campaign to a panel of advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considering authorization of additional booster shots.
The data show that among people over 60 - the first group to receive boosters - infections began declining rapidly about two weeks after third doses were administered, while still climbing among other age groups. 
A data analysis by Doron Gazit and Yinon Ashkenazy of the Hebrew University's COVID-19 monitoring team showed the virus' reproduction rate - its ability to spread - began a sharp fall among each age group following the third shot. 
Two months into the Delta wave, vaccinated people over the age of 60 made up more than half of severe COVID-19 cases. The majority were over 70 with health conditions that put them at higher risk.
Since administration of boosters, mostly unvaccinated, often younger, people are bearing the brunt of serious illness. They make up about 75% of hospitalized patients in severe condition, while those vaccinated with two or three shots account for a quarter of such cases.
A third dose has so far been effective in curbing severe breakthrough cases among vaccinated people age 40 and up, according to the health ministry.
There is less available data for teens and young adults. However, the ministry said its findings so far show that a third dose has not increased the risk of myocarditis, a rare heart inflammation, in younger people. (Graphic: Confirmed Daily Infections, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ISRAEL-BOOSTERS/znvnezznnpl/chart.png) 
    'THE JURY IS STILL OUT'
Ran Balicer, who heads the government's coronavirus expert advisory panel, said a combination of measures curbed the Delta surge. 
""These include the masks mandate, the ‘Green Passes’, the massive testing both with PCR testing and rapid antigen tests. But undoubtedly, the most important impactful factor in bringing down the Delta summer surge was the mass vaccination campaign with booster doses,"" Balicer said.
In England, where boosters have been administered to roughly 5% of the population, masks have largely been abandoned and vaccine passports are not mandatory, COVID-19 cases are on the rise. 
Some scientists said Israel’s decision in late August to approve a third vaccine dose for young adults and teens was premature, lacking clear evidence of a benefit. They argue the focus should still be on convincing unvaccinated people to accept the shots.
The United States and several European countries have so far authorized boosters only for older adults, people with weakened immune systems or workers at high risk of coronavirus exposure.
The World Health Organization has pleaded with wealthier nations to hold off on boosters while many countries struggle to access vaccines. 
    ""Israel rushed, even gambled, when it came to approving a third dose for the whole population and not to specific age groups as other countries did,” said Hagai Levine, professor of epidemiology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
“In the midst of a pandemic you sometimes have to make a decision based on partial evidence,"" Levine said. Nevertheless, “the jury is still out on third doses for the entire population."" (Graphic: Coronavirus Fourth Wave, Reproduction Rate, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ISRAEL-BOOSTERS/xmpjollelvr/chart.png) 
    Bennett has been criticized by some scientists for rejecting tougher measures that would have kept Delta infections lower from the start. They included government health officials who feared the ""Living with COVID"" policy exacted too heavy a toll. 
    ""We have 1,400 people who died in this wave. So there are benefits to keeping the economy open and there is some cost to that,"" Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health at Israel's Health Ministry, told The Jerusalem Post conference on Tuesday. 
    By September, hospitals strained to care for COVID-19 cases that could have perhaps been avoided, doctors and health officials said. 
    ""It's a good policy, but it has its price,"" said Yael Haviv-Yadid, head of the critical care ward at Sheba Medical Centre, whose unit saw an influx of young, unvaccinated patients. ""The teams are very tired, burned out.""  
    So far, 3.7 million people have taken a third shot, more than a third of Israel's population.    

    ""Israel was the first country to deal with the combined challenge posed by the Delta variant and mass waning immunity, but it is definitely not the last"" Balicer cautioned. 
""Other countries that will be faced with this complex challenge will have to figure out their own balance,"" he added, ""and the costs can be high.""

(Reuters) -A panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unanimously voted on Thursday to recommend booster shots of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness or occupational exposure to the virus. 
If the FDA signs off on Moderna's booster, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make specific recommendations on who should get the shots. CDC advisers are scheduled to meet next week.
The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met on Thursday to consider the additional dose of the Moderna vaccine and will weigh whether to make a similar recommendation for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine on Friday. The vote to back Moderna's booster was 19-0.
""The data itself is not strong, but it is certainly going in the direction that is supportable of this vote,"" said Dr. Patrick Moore of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Moore said he voted in favor of Moderna boosters based largely on a ""gut feeling rather than truly serious data.""
Moderna shares were up nearly 3% at $330.71 after the vote.
FDA staff in documents posted on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-seeks-covid-19-vaccine-booster-clearance-older-adults-high-risk-2021-10-12 said data for Moderna's vaccine showed that the booster does increase protective antibodies. 
But they also said the difference in antibody levels before and after the shot was not wide enough by one measure of success specified by the FDA, particularly in those whose antibody levels had remained high.
Moderna is seeking authorization of a booster that contains 50 micrograms of vaccine, half of strength of its regular dose but still higher than the Pfizer/BioNTech shot using similar technology at 30 micrograms.
The booster would be administered to people at least six months after the initial two-shot inoculation.
U.S. health officials have been under pressure to authorize COVID-19 vaccine booster doses after the White House announced in August it planned a widespread booster campaign pending approvals from the FDA and the CDC.
Both agencies signed off on Pfizer/BioNTech boosters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-65-older-high-risk-2021-09-23 for certain high-risk adults last month. Since then, nearly 9 million people have received a third shot, the CDC reported on Wednesday.
The panel heard presentations from Israeli health officials that boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine helped curb the latest wave of infections in their country. 
In the presentation on Thursday, they said the booster program in Israel improved severe disease protection in people aged 40 and older.
""What we're seeing is a break in the epidemic curve in Israel,"" said Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, director of public health services at the Ministry of Health in Israel.
She said the booster program, which now includes 50% of the population among all age groups, is starting to reduce infections even among the unvaccinated in Israel.
Dr. Ofer Levy, a vaccine expert at Boston Children's Hospital and a panel member, noted that the United States and Israel are different populations and that the vaccine Israel used is different although similar to the Moderna shot.
Dr. Hayley Gans, a Stanford University Medical Center pediatrician and panel member, asked whether Israel's health ministry could tell how much of the country's waning Delta wave was attributable to the booster program and how much might have occurred without them.

""There is no question in my mind"" that booster shots were responsible for the change in Israel's epidemic curve, Alroy-Preis responded. 
In the United States, the Delta surge already has been begun to ease, with the seven-day average of daily COVID-19 cases falling 12% from the previous week, and the seven-day average of daily deaths down 5%. That is still more than 1,250 COVID-19 deaths a day, however, primarily among the unvaccinated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican U.S. senators led by Marco Rubio on Thursday called on the Biden administration to blacklist Honor, a former unit of embattled Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, describing the firm as a threat to national security.
In a letter dated Thursday, seen by Reuters, Rubio described Honor as essentially an ""arm"" of the Chinese government with newly unfettered access the same prized U.S. technology currently denied to Huawei. The letter adds to a growing chorus of China hawks calling for the blacklisting.
By spinning off the Chinese telecom giant's budget smartphone brand in November 2020, ""Beijing has effectively dodged a critical American export control,"" Rubio wrote in the letter also signed by Senators John Cornyn and Rick Scott.
""By failing to act in response, the Department of Commerce risks setting a dangerous precedent and communicating to adversaries that we lack the capacity or willpower to punish blatant financial engineering by an authoritarian regime.""
Honor and the Department of Commerce in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Huawei declined to comment beyond noting a prior statement that said it would not hold any shares or be involved in managing Honor following the spinoff. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the U.S. had kept ""smearing"" Huawei without presenting solid evidence to support its accusations.
The Trump administration placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in 2019, arguing the company posed a national security threat, which Huawei denies. Putting the company on the so-called entity list has meant its U.S. suppliers have had to obtain special licenses to sell key items like semiconductors to the firm.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was also barred from providing technical support to new Huawei phone models and access to Google Mobile Services, the bundle of developer services upon which most Android apps are based.
As sanctions against the company began to bite amid tighter controls, Huawei announced the Honor sale to a consortium of over 30 agents and dealers. 

In August a group of 14 Republican Congressmen led by Michael McCaul, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also called on the Commerce Department to blacklist Honor, alleging the company was spun off to evade U.S. export controls and to give Huawei access to blocked semiconductor chips and software. 
On Monday, Honor said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/Honorglobal/status/1447547538748280834 it had ""succeeded in confirming cooperation with a number of supplier partners in the early stage"" and that its Honor 50 smartphones would be equipped with Google Mobile Services.

Nippon Steel is seeking 20 billion yen ($176 million) in damages from each company, alleging the two firms have infringed on its patents on non-oriented magnetic steel sheets that are used in electric vehicles, it said in a statement. 
Two of Japan's manufacturing giants, the country's biggest steelmaker and automaker, slugging it out in court is a rare occurrence and signifies the high stakes involved in materials production as the global low-carbon revolution takes hold.
""Such expressions of dissatisfaction are unusual in Japan,"" Thanh Ha Pham, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in Tokyo, said on Friday. 
Toyota said in a statement to Reuters the suit was ""very regrettable"" and that it had found no patent infringement issues. 
""Electrical steel sheets are indispensable materials for automobile electrification and are one of our key products aimed at helping decarbonisation for cars, electrical products and power plants"" a Nippon Steel spokesperson said.
This is the first time Nippon Steel has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Toyota, the spokesperson added. Nippon Steel is a longstanding steel supplier for Toyota and other Japanese automakers. 
""We confirmed that there was no infringement of another company's patent before concluding a contract"" with Baosteel to supply electromagnetic steel sheets, Toyota said.
Baosteel said it did not agree with Nippon's claims and it would ""firmly"" defend its rights and interests.
Nippon Steel, the world's fifth-biggest steelmaker by output, also filed a petition for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Toyota from manufacturing and selling motor-driven vehicles that use the electrical steel sheets allegedly violating its patents.
The company decided to take legal action after it could not reach a resolution through discussions with both companies, it said.
The steelmaker declined to give further details, including the names of the Toyota products and the size of their sales.

Nippon Steel shares rose 0.1% on Friday, while Toyota was up the same amount as the Nikkei 225 rose more than 1%. Baosteel was down 0.3%.

(Reuters) -Johnson & Johnson on Thursday put into bankruptcy tens of thousands of legal claims alleging its Baby Powder and other talc-based products caused cancer, offloading the potential liabilities into a newly created subsidiary.
J&J (NYSE:JNJ) put the talc claims into an entity called LTL Management LLC, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday in North Carolina, according to the company and court records. J&J and its affiliates were not part of the bankruptcy filing.
Tens of thousands of plaintiffs have alleged J&J's Baby Powder and other talc products contained asbestos and caused cancer, which the company denies. The plaintiffs include women suffering from ovarian cancer and others battling mesothelioma.
J&J executed Thursday's corporate reshuffling through a contentious legal maneuver known as a Texas two-step bankruptcy, a strategy other companies facing asbestos litigation have used.
In that process, a J&J business split in two through a so-called divisional merger under Texas law. That transaction created LTL, the new entity saddled with J&J's talc liabilities, according to court papers filed Thursday.
J&J, with a market value exceeding $400 billion, said the talc cases would be halted while LTL navigates bankruptcy proceedings. 
The company's costs defending nearly 40,000 cases have approached $1 billion, according to bankruptcy-court filings Thursday. Settlements and verdicts have cost J&J about $3.5 billion more.
""We are taking these actions to bring certainty to all parties involved in the cosmetic talc cases,"" J&J General Counsel Michael Ullmann said in a statement. 
""While we continue to stand firmly behind the safety of our cosmetic talc products, we believe resolving this matter as quickly and efficiently as possible is in the best interests of the (company) and all stakeholders,"" Ullmann added.
Plaintiffs' lawyers decried the bankruptcy filing. J&J's ""bankruptcy gimmick is as despicable as it is brazen"" and ""an unconscionable abuse of the legal system,"" said Linda Lipsen, chief executive of the American Association for Justice, a trial lawyers' group, in a statement.
J&J said it would fund LTL's legal costs for talc cases in an amount later determined by a bankruptcy judge, with an initial advance of $2 billion. LTL has also received certain royalty revenue streams with a present value of more than $350 million to contribute to potential legal costs, J&J said.
HIGH-STAKES LITIGATION 
Reuters first reported in July that J&J was exploring offloading its talc liabilities and placing them into bankruptcy.
Thursday's move shifted high-stakes litigation over the safety of J&J’s talc from courtrooms across the United States to one legal proceeding before a federal bankruptcy judge who could potentially force a settlement among the blue-chip company and plaintiffs.
During earlier settlement discussions, a J&J attorney told plaintiffs' lawyers that the company could pursue the bankruptcy plan, which might result in lower payouts for cases that do not settle beforehand, Reuters previously reported.
In the weeks leading up to Thursday’s bankruptcy filing, lawyers representing women with cancer claims asked multiple judges to forbid J&J from executing such a maneuver, only to be turned down.
The company maintained in statements and in court proceedings over the summer that it had not decided whether to pursue the maneuver. 
A 2018 Reuters investigation found J&J knew for decades that asbestos, a known carcinogen, lurked in its Baby Powder and other cosmetic talc products. The company stopped selling Baby Powder in the United States and Canada in May 2020, in part due to what it called ""misinformation"" and ""unfounded allegations"" about the talc-based product.
J&J maintains its consumer talc products are safe and confirmed through thousands of tests to be asbestos-free.
In bankruptcy-court papers, lawyers for the newly created J&J subsidiary said the Chapter 11 filing was “necessitated by an unrelenting assault by the plaintiff trial bar, premised on the false allegations that the ... talc products contain asbestos and cause cancer.""

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear J&J's appeal of a Missouri court ruling that resulted in $2 billion of damages awarded to women alleging the company's talc caused their ovarian cancer.
J&J has prevailed in other recent talc cases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The attorneys general of 14 U.S. states sent a letter to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg asking if the top disseminators of vaccine disinformation on the platform received special treatment from the company.
The line of inquiry was generated after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen used internal documents to disclose that the social media platform has built a system that exempts high-profile users from some or all of its rules.
In the letter, which was sent on Wednesday, the 14 Democratic attorneys general said they are ""extremely concerned"" with recent reports that Facebook maintained lists of members who have received special treatment, and want to know if the ""Disinformation Dozen"" were part of those lists.
The Center for Countering Digital Hate describes the ""Disinformation Dozen"" as 12 anti-vaxxers who are responsible for almost two-thirds of anti-vaccine content circulating on social media platforms. 
Facebook spokesman Alex Burgos pointed to earlier comments by the company that it had removed over three dozen pages, groups and Facebook or Instagram accounts linked to those 12 people, including at least one linked to each of the 12, for violating its policies. It has also applied penalties to some of their website domains.
COVID-19 disinformation has proliferated during the pandemic on social media sites including Facebook,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube. Researchers and lawmakers have long accused Facebook of failing to police harmful content on its platforms.
In July, President Joe Biden said social media platforms like Facebook ""are killing people"" for allowing misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on its platform. https://reut.rs/3iZ9ZVC

Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents and has called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them.
The letter was sent by the attorneys general of Connecticut, California, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.

""It has been another difficult quarter operationally and ... we recognise the opportunity to raise our performance,"" said chief executive officer Jakob Stausholm.
The miner now expects 2021 Pilbara iron ore shipments at between 320 million tonnes (mt) and 325 mt, down from a previous range of 325 mt to 340 mt.
The downgrade puts Rio on course to lose its spot as the world's biggest iron ore producer to Brazilian rival Vale S.A.. 
""Another disappointing quarter for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) as the company struggles to regain operational momentum,"" broker RBC said in a research note. 
Rio said a tight global supply chain added to its difficulties, while headwinds from China's regulatory tightening could spark further volatility.
Iron ore prices have nearly halved since hitting a record peak in mid-May, with demand hurt by China's steel output curbs and a sharp slowdown in the country's property activity due to a regulatory crackdown. [IRONORE/]
Still, Rio shipped 83.4 mt of the steel-making commodity in the three months ended Sept. 30, 2% higher than the 82.1 mt shipped last year. 
However, Pilbara iron ore production was 4% lower, hurt by heritage management, brownfield mine replacement tie-ins and project completion delays.
Rio's destruction of the 46,000 year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters last year had led to a leadership overhaul of the company and a national inquiry.
Rio also delayed first production for the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia by three months to January 2023. Joint venture partner, Canada's Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ), on Thursday estimated additional funding required for the project had ballooned to $3.6 billion.

Delays to development of what will be one of the world's largest copper mines has antagonised the Mongolian government, which owns a 34% stake, and fuelled a funding spat between Rio and Turquoise Hill.
Rio Tinto shares were down 1% in morning trade in a slightly firmer broader market.

Settlement of most of the lots is expected in the current half ending Dec. 31, the airline said in a statement.
""We'll use these funds to help pay down debt that we've built up during the pandemic,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. ""The strength of this sale and its impact on our balance sheet means we can get back to investing in core parts of our business sooner.""
Qantas shares were trading 2.3% higher at 00:00 GMT, ahead of a 0.5% gain in the broader market. 
Qantas said it had also entered talks with LOGOS about potential future development options for the sites being acquired, including a dedicated precinct for the airline and the sale of additional land near the lots being sold.
The airline said it expected to complete the evaluation of those proposals in early 2022 and if an agreement was reached, it had the potential to raise the total value of the deal to more than A$1 billion.
LOGOS said the purchase was backed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority via the LOGOS Australia Logistics Venture as well as pension fund AustralianSuper.

It plans to develop the site into a logistics, e-commerce and last mile logistics hub. On completion, the development is forecast to have an end value of A$2 billion, LOGOS said.

MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS is closing its brokerage in Mexico, said three people familiar with the matter, following in the footsteps of other large global financial institutions that have opted to leave Latin America's second largest economy.
The reasons for the closure were not immediately clear. It was also not known if UBS would pull other local services.
Two of the sources said UBS will maintain a presence in Mexico, but manage operations from other regions. 
""We remain fully committed to our business in Mexico,"" UBS said in a statement. ""To ensure alignment with our global strategic priorities, we review all of our businesses regularly to identify growth opportunities and to generate operational efficiencies.""
UBS noted it hired Gustavo Galvan-Duque early this year as head of Wealth Management for Mexico and would keep looking for ""local talent."" Galvan-Duque did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bloomberg originally reported on UBS' plans to withdraw its brokerage. 
In July, Mexican financial authorities said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) had decided to close their offices in Mexico, sending a sign to analysts that global players were losing interest in a largely stagnant domestic market.
""It's related to the lack of movement, and also that the investment environment is not the most favorable,"" said wealth advisor Jonathan Zuloaga of Columbus, a Mexican investment consultancy. 

He added that the climate under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in 2018, has not helped. The leftist has clashed with the business sector over decisions such as canceling the construction of a new airport and changing rules in the energy sector. 
""The fact that there has been so much animosity from the beginning of the current administration towards the private sector is not a good sign,"" Zuloaga added.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -The United Steelworkers union (USW) urged locked-out workers at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s Beaumont, Texas, refinery to reject a company contract offer in a vote scheduled for Tuesday, according to a union statement reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.
""The union is in the process of educating its members on the details of the offer and is asking the members to stand together and vote no to this sub par offer,"" the union said in a message to 650 locked-out members of USW Local 13-243 in Beaumont.
The upcoming contract vote is the first to be taken by workers at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant since negotiations began in January and the workers were locked out on May 1.
Bryan Gross, USW international representative, confirmed the statement was issued by the leaders of local 13-243. Gross declined further comment.
An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Exxon has said the workers were locked out to avoid a disruption from a possible strike. The company has been running the refinery at reduced production levels with supervisors and temporary replacements.
The USW continues to oppose Exxon's proposal to eliminate job seniority, which gives workers a say in job assignments.
The union also said Exxon's contract proposal would lead to some jobs being eliminated in the next three years. The statement also laid out positions that would not receive pay increases this year and in coming years.

The ratification vote will take place two weeks after the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) received a petition with signatures from 30% of the Exxon workers calling for removal of the union.
The NLRB is in the investigation and regional determination phase of reviewing the removal petition, which could lead a vote some time in the future, according to the agency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Space exploration company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc said on Thursday it is delaying its commercial space travel service to the fourth quarter of 2022 and will not conduct another planned test flight this year.
Virgin Galactic said ""commercial service is now expected to commence in Q4 2022."" Shares in the company fell 13% in afterhours trading.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sept. 2 had barred Virgin Galactic from flying its SpaceShipTwo pending completion of a report into the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space.
Branson was among six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the July flight, soaring more than 50 miles (80 km) into space. 
The FAA on Sept. 29 closed its mishap investigation into the July 11 Virgin Galactic Unity 22 launch, which deviated from assigned airspace on descent, and lifted a grounding order it had imposed earlier. 
Virgin Galactic had said in September it was planning another SpaceShipTwo flight from New Mexico, Unity 23, pending technical checks and weather. The company said last month the earliest it expected ""to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid October.""
But Virgin Galactic on Thursday said it will now begin its planned enhancement program first and will conduct the Unity 23 test flight after this work is complete and before starting commercial service.
The enhancement program is designed to improve vehicle performance and flight-rate capability.

The company said on Thursday one recent laboratory-based test ""flagged a possible reduction in the strength margins of certain materials used to modify specific joints.""
The company added the ""new lab test data has had no impact on the vehicles, our test flight protocols have clearly defined strength margins, and further analysis will assess whether any additional work is required to keep them at or above established levels.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 jumped on Thursday, its biggest daily percentage advance since early March, as companies including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UnitedHealth climbed following strong results, while data on the labor market and inflation soothed fears over the outlook for higher rates.
The technology sector jumped 2.3%, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost, with shares of  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rising.
Shares of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Morgan Stanley also gained after they topped quarterly earnings estimates. The rebounding economy allowed them to release more cash they had set aside for pandemic losses, while sizzling deals, equity financing and trading added to profits. The S&P bank index jumped 1.5%.
Also, UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) climbed 4.2% after the health insurer reported results and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast on strength from its Optum unit that manages drug benefits.
Adding to optimism, data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week fell close to a 19-month low, and a separate report showed producer prices eased in September.
Data from recent inflation reports suggested COVID-driven price increases may have peaked. Still, Federal Reserve policymakers remain divided over inflation and what to do about it.
""Some of the things that worried the market in September, and even last week, as far as the inflation aspect and higher interest rates and the Delta variant, maybe have lessened,"" said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio.
""Not that it's all over, but on a temporary scale at least, you can make a case for it trending in the right direction.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 534.75 points, or 1.56%, to 34,912.56, the S&P 500 gained 74.46 points, or 1.71%, to 4,438.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 251.79 points, or 1.73%, to 14,823.43.
While the S&P 500 registered its biggest daily percentage gain since March 5, the Nasdaq notched its biggest since May 20 and the Dow its biggest since July 20.
Gains were broad-based, with all but one S&P 500 sector rising more than 1%. 
Shares of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc ended up 3.2% after a panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted to recommend booster shots of its COVID-19 vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older and those at high risk of severe illness.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc jumped 7.4% after the drugstore chain reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted profit above estimates and forecast growth of 11% to 13% in the long term.
U.S. companies are expected to report strong profit growth for the third quarter, but investors have been keen to hear what they say about rising costs, labor shortages and supply problems.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.97-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 46 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.26 billion shares, compared with the 10.8 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Port of Los Angeles is beginning the hard work of convincing terminal operators, importers, warehouses owners and trucking firms to embrace moving more cargo at night. 
""It's not a single lever we can pull today to open up all the gates,"" Executive Director Gene Seroka said on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the White House gathered stakeholders including retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), logistics firms  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and electronics supplier Samsung (KS:005930). The companies pledged to use more overnight workers to ease the backups at the Los Angeles and Long Beach port complex that is the No. 1 gateway for trade with China.
We're ""trying to squeeze every minute, every hour of efficiency out of this port that we can,"" said Seroka. Most work is currently done during the day, although some parts of the operation already run 24/7. The White House said adding more overnight shifts could double available time to move cargo and union leaders are onboard. 
COVID-19 fueled demand for consumer goods while at the same time closing factories and ports. A shortfall of workers ranging from truckers to warehouse staff are driving up the cost of goods, contributing to product shortages, and raising alarms about a worsening global supply-chain crisis. 
The global supply chain ""was creaking along before the pandemic,"" said John Porcari, port envoy for the White House Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force. 
The health crisis laid bare weaknesses in a brittle global supply chain built for predictable, just-in-time cargo flows, he said. In many cases, it is ""your grandfather's infrastructure that we're working with."" 
STRESS AT EVERY LINK
The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach significantly lag Chinese rivals when it comes to port efficiency, according to a ranking prepared by the World Bank and IHS Markit.
Port terminals in China usually operate 24/7, many tasks are automated and labor slowdowns are rare, U.S.-based shipping industry consultant Jon Monroe said. 
Seroka and Porcari stressed that U.S. supply chain improvements will not come at the flip of a switch. Changes are needed at every link to ease the impact of unintended consequences, they said. 
The White House efforts announced Wednesday are expected to account for just 3,500 additional containers per week being moved at night - a tiny fraction of the 120,000 containers already moving each week. 
Meanwhile, there are 62 container ships waiting to unload some 500,000 containers at Los Angeles/Long Beach - and another 25 are scheduled to arrive in the next three days. 
Those vessels are carrying parts and components for U.S. manufacturers as well as seasonal goods for retailers racing stock up for the Nov. 26 kickoff of the make-or-break holiday selling season, Seroka said. 
Extended hours at Los Angeles/Long Beach could benefit Honda Motor Co, hit hard by the automotive chip shortage, and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), which is under pressure to get holiday toys to stores, according to Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence.
And the effort raises the question of where to put all the stuff.

The Greater Los Angeles area logged a record low vacancy rate of 1% for warehouses and other industrial space during the third quarter, according to  CBRE  Group (NYSE:CBRE), a commercial real estate services firm. 
""If we increase the capacity at the port, then we still have to find space to temporarily store goods in warehouses,"" said Douglas Kent, an executive vice president at the Association for Supply Chain Management.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of lawmakers, headed by Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and Republican Chuck Grassley, plan to introduce a bill that would bar Big Tech platforms, like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, from favoring their products and services.
Amazon, for example, has been accused of using data from third-party sellers to determine what products it would create.
Reuters reported on Wednesday, after reviewing thousands of internal Amazon documents, that the U.S. company's India operations ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands in the country, one of the company’s largest growth markets.
The latest bill is one of a slew introduced in this Congress aimed at reining in tech firms, including industry leaders Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Thus far none have become law although one, a broader measure to increase resources for antitrust enforcers, has passed the Senate.
This bill, which Klobuchar's office said would be introduced early next week, would be a companion to a measure which has passed the House Judiciary Committee. It must pass both houses of Congress to become law.
Klobuchar and Grassley's bill would specifically prohibit platforms from requiring companies operating on their sites to purchase the platform's goods or services and ban them from biasing search results to favor the platform.
""As dominant digital platforms -- some of the biggest companies our world has ever seen -- increasingly give preference to their own products and services, we must put policies in place to ensure small businesses and entrepreneurs still have the opportunity to succeed in the digital marketplace,"" Klobuchar said in a statement.

Klobuchar is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee while Grassley is the top Republican on the full committee. Co-sponsors include Democrats like Senator Dick Durbin, chair of the full Judiciary Committee, Richard Blumenthal, Cory Booker, Mazie Hirono and Mark Warner as well as Republicans Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), John Kennedy, Cynthia Lummis and Josh Hawley.
Antitrust advocate Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, praised the planned bill as an effort ""to turn the page on a failed era of antitrust enforcement.""

(Reuters) -U.S. Senator Joe Manchin has promised to block a proposed royalty for minerals extracted on federal land from advancing in the U.S. Senate's version of the hotly debated reconciliation package, a senate staffer said on Thursday.
Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat and chair of the Senator's Energy and Natural Resources committee, promised U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, that the royalty proposal would not be included in the Senate's final reconciliation language, according to Cortez Masto's office.
Manchin's office declined to comment.
The pledge to block the royalty proposal in committee and the full Senate is the latest example of Manchin's newfound role as a legislative powerbroker in the evenly divided chamber.
Last month, the U.S. House of Representative's Natural Resources Committee added language https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/us-miners-decry-mineral-royalty-plan-floated-congress-2021-09-16/#:~:text=The%20House%20of%20Representatives%20Natural,and%204%25%20on%20new%20ones to the proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending measure to set an 8% gross royalty on existing mines and 4% on new ones. Supporters project that the measure, which would also set a 7-cent fee for every ton of rock moved, would raise about $2 billion over 10 years.
It was designed to be one of the most-substantial changes to the law that has governed U.S. mining since 1872, which did not set royalties in order to encourage development of the western United States. 
Not every politician in the region, which has vast stretches of federal lands, was happy that the royalty plan could be blocked. ""Every day that goes by without a hard rock royalty in place means more toxic metals in our western watersheds,"" said Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. Royalties would support the cleanup of thousands of abandoned mines, Heinrich said. 
Mining companies support only a slight tweak in the law, but environmental groups have long urged charging the industry a fee to extract minerals on taxpayer-owned land.

Nevada produces more gold and silver than any other state and has lithium projects under development from Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, ioneer Ltd and others. Cortez Masto, who is up for re-election in 2022, has been one of few Democrats supporting the mining industry's position.
Tensions are rising in the United States over how best to procure minerals needed to produce renewable energy technologies. President Joe Biden has yet to take a public stance on the issue, though privately he has signaled plans to rely on allies for metals needed in electric vehicles, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden-mining-idCNL2N2NC32W earlier this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Thursday that some titanium 787 Dreamliner parts were improperly manufactured over the past three years, the latest in a series of problems to plague the wide-body aircraft.
The quality issue does not affect the immediate safety of flights, the company said, adding it had notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Boeing is working to determine how many planes contain the defective part.
Boeing said the parts were provided by Leonardo SpA, which bought the items from Italy-based Manufacturing Processes Specification (MPS). MPS is no longer a supplier to Leonardo, Leonardo confirmed. Shares in Italy's Leonardo extended losses and closed down 7%. Boeing shares closed down 2%.
Leonardo said in a statement the issues are ascribed to MPS. Leonardo said that MPS ""is under scrutiny by prosecutors therefore Leonardo is (an) injured party and will not bear any potential costs associated with this issue.""
Italian prosecutors could not be reached for comment late Thursday.
MPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. MPS is listed in Italy and some industry directives as Manufacturing Process Specification.
The parts include fittings that help secure the floor beam in one fuselage section, as well as other fittings, spacers, brackets, and clips within other assemblies.
Undelivered planes will be reworked, and planes already carrying passengers will go through a review process with Boeing and receive FAA confirmation. 
The defect was found as the planemaker grapples with other problems in its 787 that have caused it to cut production and halt deliveries since May.
Problems started in September 2020 when the FAA said it was investigating manufacturing flaws. Airlines using that model removed eight jets from service. 
Boeing was able to resume deliveries of the 787s in March after a five-month hiatus - only to halt them again in May after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method.

In July, the FAA said some Dreamliners had a manufacturing quality issue near the nose of the plane that must be fixed before Boeing can deliver to customers. 
Earlier this month Leonardo's chief executive said Boeing was expected to release an updated production plan for its 787.

The markets have been pretty choppy over the past couple of weeks as investors continue to monitor anything that could stop the bull market. The latest being ongoing price increases. High demand and supply chain obstacles drive the price of commodities higher, specifically oil and natural gas, leading to the recent pessimism in the markets.
However, I view these concerns as temporary as the economy has strong underlying fundamentals that should propel markets in the upcoming months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) said on Thursday the majority of its U.S. workforce must show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 under President Joe Biden's federal contractor executive order.
Verizon said thousands of non-union U.S. employees must be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8 under the executive order.
Verizon, a federal contractor, said it was in discussions with its unions about vaccination requirements for 30,000 U.S. unionized employees.
The company said retail employees and some other workers must be vaccinated by Feb. 1. Contractors, vendors, visitors and new hires who enter Verizon U.S. facilities must be fully vaccinated by Jan. 1.
The vast majority of Verizon's 130,000 employees worldwide are in the United States. The vaccine mandates will apply to nearly all its non-union employees.
Some ""home-based"" Verizon Consumer Group and others are excluded, the telecommunications company said.
""While we respect that within our workforce there are people with different beliefs and perspectives related to COVID-19 and the vaccine, we must comply with the government’s requirements, including those for federal contractors,"" Verizon said.
A growing number of federal contractors are complying with the Dec. 8 deadline.
 Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP), the top U.S. railroad operator, said on Wednesday it will require its 31,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated.
Last month, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said it will require nearly all of its 18,000 employees be fully vaccinated by Nov. 22.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, another federal contractor, said on Tuesday it will require COVID-19 vaccination for its 125,000 U.S. employees.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 04:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Senator Cotton delays vote on Biden's pick for powerful China job at Commerce,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Tom Cotton is holding up a vote to confirm Alan Estevez as the U.S. Commerce Department's undersecretary for industry and security until he gets answers to difficult questions about technology exports to China.
In a letter dated Oct. 14 and seen by Reuters, Cotton asks Estevez to commit to strengthening U.S. restrictions on exporting semiconductor software and technology to China and to accelerating the roll-out of new rules to tighten export controls for advanced technologies.
The letter, also signed by Republican senator Bill Hagerty, asks Estevez to consider extending a Trump administration rule - that currently only applies to Huawei - to blacklisted Chinese firms with links to the military or human rights violations. That rule further restricted access for the Chinese telecoms giant to advanced semiconductor chips. 
The job at the Commerce Department oversees exports to all countries but decisions over cutting-edge technology exports to China have given the position tremendous power over Chinese companies dependent on U.S. technology in recent years. 
The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Many industry watchers saw the choice of Estevez, a former Defense Department official with a limited track record on China, as a safe bet.
But Cotton - or any other senator - can hold up a fast-track confirmation process that requires consent by all 100 senators.
Since the Republican has not had the chance to question the nominee, he is pausing the confirmation process until he receives answers to the questions posed in the letter, a Cotton staffer said. 
Republicans are not the only ones holding up Estevez's nomination. Democratic Senator Bob Menendez came out against Estevez when the Senate Banking Committee took up his confirmation and also opposes expediting a final full Senate vote.
His opposition stems from the former Pentagon official's response to questions regarding returning oversight of U.S. firearms exports to the State Department. 
""I was not satisfied with Mr. Estevez's non-answers as to whether the Biden administration was planning to fulfill President Biden's campaign promise and finally reverse the Trump administration's dangerous stripping of oversight authority of U.S. firearm sales from the State Department's Munitions List to the Commerce Department,"" Menendez said in a statement. 
The Trump administration transferred jurisdiction on exports of semiautomatic pistols, assault rifles and related firearms from State to the less-restrictive Commerce Control List, which also eliminated congressional review for such sales. 
Estevez will be in good company. Other Biden nominees are being held up by Senator Ted Cruz, who is using the process to halt a Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, White House officials and Democrats in Congress say.
Estevez testified last month before the Senate banking committee, which later voted in favor of advancing his bid to the full Senate. 

During the hearing and under questioning from Hagerty, Estevez said he expected to keep Huawei on a blacklist unless ""things change"" and pledged to ""look at"" Honor, a former unit of Huawei, to see whether the Chinese telecoms giant was using the spun-off company to minimize or circumvent its own blacklist designation. Republican senators have called on the Biden administration to blacklist Honor.
In the letter on Thursday, the senators also asked for Estevez to say whether he thought the global spread of Huawei Cloud Services posed a data security and privacy concern for the United States, and whether Honor should be placed on the Commerce Department's trade blacklist.

Investing.com — On Thursday, an FDA advisory panel voted unanimously to give booster shots of  Moderna  's (NASDAQ:MRNA)  Covid-19 vaccine to people aged 65 and older and other vulnerable citizens. 
The non-binding decision got 19 yes votes after a two-day meeting based on whether available data on Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine booster supports a booster at least six  months after being vaccinated.
The FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee has brought Moderna's booster shot in line with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech’s vaccine, which was authorized for the same group less than a month ago.
As the approval has come from an advisory committee, the FDA doesn't have to follow its advice. However, it often does, and a final decision from the FDA could arrive in the next few days. A CDC advisory panel would then vote on the FDA's recommendation. 
Moderna's stock price jumped over 4% after news of the panel's approval. It closed Thursday's session at $331.88, climbing 3.23% from Wednesday."

Read on.Oil prices have rallied to multi-year highs, with U.S. Crude trading at its highest level since 2014. Rising demand amid supply restraints is the driving force behind the price rally.
Furthermore, in the World Oil Outlook (WOO) report, OPEC projects that oil’s share in world energy consumption will increase to more than 31% by 2025, while 80% of the incremental demand might materialize within 2023. Also, the United States Energy Information and Administration (EIA) anticipates world energy consumption to increase by 50% over the coming 30 years and petroleum and other liquid fuels to remain the primary energy source.

Short-sellers are bearish investors who borrow stocks, aiming to buy them back when the price falls to cover the loan and pocket the difference. 
Heavily shorted stocks were rallying on Wednesday and short-sellers were forced to leave bearish bets to curtail their losses, a situation known as a short squeeze.
""We believe institutional investors were forced to cover their shorts, either because they were de-grossing or because they feared that a rebound in risk sentiment could inflict pain on their short book,"" Vanda strategists Ben Onatibia and Giacomo Pierantoni said about Wednesday's session.
Some of the top shorted U.S. traded stocks, in terms of percentage of shares sold short, have been rallying recently, according to the latest data from S3 Partners. 
The top short, Big 5 Sporting Goods, with 41.5% of its float sold short, had risen almost 4% in the last three sessions but was down 0.5% on Thursday. Altimeter Growth Corp, with 36% of its shares shorted, was rallying 4% on Thursday with a sharp spike higher in trading volume.
Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK), which has 36% of its float shorted, was down 2.5% Thursday after rising 8% in the previous three sessions while WorkHorse Group, with 35% of its float shorted, was falling 2.5% Thursday after rising 10.6% in the last two sessions. 
Meanwhile, Wall Street's three major indexes were up more than 1% on Thursday after also gaining ground Wednesday. 
Highly shorted names also got high retail mentions on Reddit's WallStreetBets, the Vanda strategists said, noting that comments on such stocks on the forum was very close to the daily average in September and October.
Retail investors, however, had nothing to do with the short squeeze, the strategists said, as individual purchases of these stocks on Wednesday were a lot smaller than most days in September and October.
On WallStreetBets, an investor forum on Reddit.com, some commentators were pointing out on Wednesday that it was a rough session for bearish investors. 

""Out there somewhere is a bear crying…"" one WallStreetBets member wrote.
Vanda argued that if the short squeeze continues in stocks ""it could eventually lure retail investors to abandon crypto investments"" as they say ""that rotations between those two asset classes are very common.""

(Reuters) - The Delaware Chancery Court this week ruled that an activist investor's attempt to seize control of biotechnology firm CytoDyn (OTC:CYDY)'s board is invalid, marking a rare rebuke from a court that hears disputes over mergers and governance matters.
The court ruled that the activist group, which owns less than 1% of CytoDyn's stock, failed to comply with the company's bylaws and left out key information on a conflict of interest. ""These omissions, in turn, left their Nomination Notice fatally incomplete,"" the ruling, dated October 13, said.
The activist group, led by Paul Rosenbaum, wrote to the company, which is working on coronavirus treatments, on June 30 to say it planned to nominate five directors to the company's six-member board. They say the board enabled operational failures and presided over a sharp share price drop.
""We believe strongly that the Court’s ruling is fundamentally flawed and, as such, we are evaluating all possible alternatives,"" the group said.
The company rejected the group's notice letter, saying it failed to comply with company bylaws and was riddled with errors ranging from mistakes in the nominees' standard questionnaires to failing to properly disclose the group's funding.
The company is being represented by law firms Sidley Austin LLP and Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP while the activists are being represented by Greenberg Traurig LLP and Baker Botts LLP.
After the company rejected the nomination, the matter moved to the courts.
""Where the Plaintiffs ultimately went wrong here is by playing fast and loose with their responses to key inquiries embedded in the advance notice bylaw, the ruling said.
This is the first time a Delaware court has been asked to rule on a shareholder submitting a notice that failed to supply information mandated by the company's bylaws.

Boeing and regulators said earlier some 787 jetliner parts were improperly made over the past three years. They were supplied indirectly by Manufacturing Process Specification (MPS), as a sub-contractor to Leonardo.
In March, Boeing warned Spirit AeroSystems about suspected problems with parts at MPS and asked it to use alternative suppliers as it continued an audit of the Italian company's operations, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
It also asked Wichita-based Spirit to trace any MPS parts it had used back to 2017 and to treat them as ""suspect nonconforming,"" meaning they would be subject to further checks.
""Out of an abundance of caution while Boeing conducts further testing and evaluation, Boeing has also decided to consider all product processed by MPS to be suspect,"" it said.
Boeing and Spirit had no immediate comment on the letter. Boeing said earlier the problems did not pose any immediate safety issues to 787 Dreamliners already in service.
Brindisi, Italy-based MPS, a coatings supplier, did not respond to phone calls and an emailed request for comment.

MPS is also an approved supplier to Airbus, according to a list available via the planemaker's website.
A spokesperson for the European company had no immediate comment when asked whether it or its suppliers had recently used any parts involving work carried out by MPS.

Heung's price target represents a potential 55% upside to Li Auto's share price, which started the day at $29 and is currently up over 2%.
The Nomura analyst described the Chinese electric vehicle company as being ""renowned as one of the star domestic EV start-ups,"" alongside NIO (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV).
According to Heung, Li has differentiated itself from the pack with its extended-range-electric-vehicle (EREV), which he believes will ""allow more skeptical car buyers to dip their toes in the EV world"" without the need to worry about charging.
Heung believes that EREV's duel-power-sourced vehicles reduce common problems such as range anxiety and long charging queues. He also feels they allow OEMs such as Li to unlock regional markets with little or no recharging infrastructure.
Li's September delivery update revealed it delivered 7,094 Li ONEs in September, up 102.5% year over year. Additionally, the company's deliveries for the third quarter were 25,116, up 190.0% year over year.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) panel will meet on Nov. 30 to discuss safety and effectiveness of the drug, molnupiravir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who have tested positive and are at high risk for progression to severe illness. (https://refini.tv/3p1PETq)
The FDA typically follows the advice of its experts but is not bound to do so.
Merck earlier this week said it filed for U.S. emergency use authorization for molnupiravir, which it is developing with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The drug would become the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19, if cleared by the agency.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) are also racing to develop an easy-to-administer antiviral pill for the disease.
Merck's treatment cut the rate of hospitalization and death by 50% in a trial of mild-to-moderately ill patients who had at least one risk factor for the disease, according to data released earlier this month. 

The company has a contract with the U.S. government to supply 1.7 million courses at a price of $700 per course. The drugmaker also recently signed deals with Malaysia and Singapore for supply of the drug.
Bloomberg News first reported on a U.S. FDA advisory committee review of the drug.

(Reuters) -Domino's Pizza Inc posted its first drop in U.S. same-store sales in over a decade on Thursday, as the world's biggest pizza chain grappled with a slowdown in delivery demand and a tight labor market that created a shortage of drivers.
As COVID-19 curbs ease, Americans have started to eat out at restaurants after more than a year of ordering food at home, slowing sales at Domino's that gets most of its business from deliveries and take-away orders.
Adding to its woes, Domino's also said a severe labor crunch in the United States dealt a blow to its business, forcing it to reduce store operating hours and compromise on delivery service times.
To address the labor shortage, Domino's Chief Executive Officer Richard Allison said the company would maximize the number of deliveries a driver could make per shift.
""I don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. Why can't we keep them turning to the store back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour,"" Allison said on a call with analysts.
The Michigan-based company said stimulus check benefits rolling off also helped lead to a 1.9% fall in same-store sales at its U.S. restaurants during the third quarter.
That was off analysts' estimate of a 1.89% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, and a reported jump of 17.5% a year ago.
Compared with 2019, however, the pizza chain's U.S. same store sales were still up 15.6%.

Shares of the company rose 2% in afternoon trading, as it also reported an increase of 8.8% in its international same-store sales.
Domino's net income rose 21.5% to $120.4 million or $3.24 per share, beating estimates of $3.11 per share and alleviating some concerns that rising wage expenses were pressuring the company's profit margins.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday voted to revive a rule, left unfinished since 2015, that would expand the regulator's powers to clawback executives' compensation when a company had to restate its financials due to a compliance lapse.
The SEC said it would seek a further round of public feedback on the rule, which was mandated by Congress following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, with a view to finalizing the rule likely next year.
The SEC proposed a draft in 2015, but failed to finalize it. The effort to revive the rule is part of a broader push by the SEC, now controlled by Democrats, to crack down on corporate malfeasance by boosting its tools for penalizing executives.
Gary Genlser, the agency's chair, said in a statement that reopening the comment period provides the watchdog ""an opportunity to strengthen the transparency and quality of corporate financial statements, as well as the accountability of corporate executives to their investors."" 
If finalized, the measure would apply to public companies of all sizes and to any executive officer who performs policymaking decisions and who has received incentive compensation, including stock options, dramatically expanding the scope of the agency's existing clawback powers which were created in 2002.
The SEC could use the new power to recover compensation in excess of what the executive concerned should have received in the event a company has to restate its financials due to ""material noncompliance"" with securities laws.
It would apply to compensation paid in the three years leading up to the restatement - ""regardless of whether the misstatement was due to fraud, errors, or any other factor.""

It would also direct U.S. stock exchanges to establish listing standards that would require each issuer to develop and implement such a policy.
The SEC's five commissioners unanimously voted to reopen the comment period on Thursday, and proposed a more stringent interpretation of the rule than the previous 2015 proposal, including by reconsidering the scope of ""accounting restatement"" and ""reasonably should have concluded"" standard for triggering a look-back.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",Citigroup rides on Wall Street M&A boom to offset sluggish loan book,"By David Henry and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc, like its Wall Street peers, made the best of a boom in dealmaking to post strong quarterly profit on Thursday, fending off a weakness in its lending business, which the bank's management said would continue to be under pressure. 
A sizzling hot stock market and cheap borrowing costs have helped U.S. companies raise billions of dollars in debt and equity and funnel a big share of it into deals, for which they used large investment banks for advice.
The torrid pace of dealmaking boosted investment banking fees to an all-time record in the first nine months of the year, with banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citi and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) benefiting the most. 
""It was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade,"" Chief Executive Jane Fraser said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts.
The bank's investment banking revenue jumped 39% to $1.9 billion, helping offset a 16% decline in fixed-income revenue from a year earlier when there was unprecedented market volatility. 
Its profit got a big boost by the decision to ease $1.16 billion from its loan loss reserves. A year earlier it had added $436 million to the reserves to survive a potential impact from the pandemic.
JPMorgan, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) have also released funds. 
SLUGGISH LOAN BOOK
The reserve release along with a surge in deals helped Citi offset declines at its consumer bank due to lower interest income as customers saved up on cash during lockdowns and paid off loans. Net interest revenue declined 1% from a year earlier.
Executives said on Thursday that the bank had struggled to grow its lending business, even though consumer spending picked up during the quarter. 
""Healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure,"" CEO Fraser said.
However, the silver lining is that net interest revenue was 2% more than the second quarter, suggesting an end to the downward trend that started when the pandemic began and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero. 
Lower rates also hurt Citi's treasury and trade solutions business as revenue decline 4% even as it collected more fees and saw growth in trade loans.
Revenue from its branded cards in North America declined 1%. But on a positive note, cards purchase sales rose as consumer spending picked up. Spending for North America branded cards jumped 24% from last year.
Executives at other big U.S. banks have also said that consumers have started to show signs of taking on more debt as their cash balances diminish. 
The results included the impact of a loss on the sale of its Australia consumer banking business. Excluding that, overall revenue increased 3%, driven by the institutional business.
EXPENSES RISE 
For the three months ended Sept. 30, net income jumped 48% to $4.6 billion, or $2.15 per share, from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.65 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Operating expenses rose 5% to $11.5 billion as the bank spent more on technology and personnel to improve its control systems and comply with demands made by regulators a year ago.

Investors have been particularly concerned about Citi's expenses as it has not disclosed how much money and time it will take to meet the requirements of regulators and fix its systems.
Expenses for marketing credit cards have also been rising. Rival card-issuer JPMorgan said on Wednesday it could spend more on card marketing to attract spending from customers as the pandemic eases.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, is leasing more ships, buying containers and re-routing goods between warehouses as it works hard to mitigate a ""perfect storm"" of global supply chain disruptions which could last into next year, executives said.
The company, which earlier on Thursday reported record annual sales as locked-down consumers spent more than ever on their homes, is also reducing the number of versions of some products as it struggles with raw materials shortages to ensure its most popular items are available. 
""It is re-steering and re-routing. And on the retail side we have learned agility like never before because everyday you have to work with what you have. You have to find ways to solve customer needs with limitations that we have never seen before,"" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group which owns most IKEA stores.
Jon Abrahamsson, chief executive at brand owner Inter IKEA, told Reuters he expects the supply chain crisis to continue into 2022, with the biggest challenge currently to get goods out of China, where roughly a quarter of IKEA's products are made. 
IKEA's stores in North America are the hardest hit by product shortages, followed by Europe. To avoid disappointing shoppers, it is temporarily removing unavailable products from its websites and store showrooms, instead suggesting similar items. 
Brodin said no-one at IKEA had anticipated the current global supply chain crisis, and that there would need to be a preparedness in future for unexpected swings in supply.
""It's a perfect storm. (But) I think we are way past being surprised. This is the new normal for us. And when things stabilise we will have learned so much about agility and about sales steering,"" he said. 
A large share of IKEA's range is sourced relatively close to sales markets. Around 70% of products sold in Europe, where IKEA has the bulk of turnover, are produced on the continent. 
Inter IKEA said sales of products and services at all IKEA stores and online totalled 41.9 billion euros ($48.7 billion) in the fiscal year to end-August, up 6% from the previous year and 1% from pre-pandemic fiscal 2019. E-commerce grew by 73% to account for 26% of total retail sales.
Ingka said separately its retail sales rose 6% to 37.4 billion euros. That was 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels, Brodin said. 
""All over the world interest in life at home has become bigger,"" Brodin said. ""There is no sign of decline in demand in any of our areas as it is right now,"" 
On the current fiscal year, Brodin said he believed demand would remain high. ""It is also be a matter of how we manage to be agile across the whole value chain... I'm truly optimistic we have a good, strong year ahead of us."" 

He added that a new IKEA store, currently under construction, would open in a central Stockholm shopping mall this year.

(Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Thursday it would take majority stakes in two smaller health care providers for about $5.5 billion, as the second largest U.S. pharmacy chain shifts focus beyond its drugstores. 
Shares in Walgreens rose nearly 7% to $50.44 in afternoon trading after it reported fourth-quarter results that beat estimates, helped by easing pandemic-related restrictions and COVID-19 vaccine administrations at its stores.
The company said it would make a $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD, raising its stake https://reut.rs/3AGlbg2 in the primary care provider to 63%. It will also invest $330 million in post-acute and home care provider CareCentrix to take a 55% stake. 
Walgreens, which has more than 9,000 drugstores across the country, said these investments will support its new business unit that will provide pharmacy and primary care services in-store, at home, in the doctor's office and via mobile app. 
Rosalind Brewer, who took over as CEO earlier this year, said the deals will help Walgreens manage rising costs in high-risk patients. ""These are the same patients who frequently visit our stores and meet with our pharmacists,"" Brewer added. 
Walgreens said it expects adjusted earnings growth, at constant currency rates, to be flat for fiscal year 2022. 
The company aims to open at least 600 physician-led primary care clinics in more than 30 U.S. markets by 2025 and 1,000 clinics by 2027. 
Walgreens and VillageMD have 52 primary care practice locations with pharmacy and doctor offices together, and will have more than 80 such locations by the end of this calendar year, the company said.

Same-store sales at its U.S. pharmacies rose 8.8% in the fourth quarter, which included a 485 basis point boost from COVID-19 vaccinations, the company said. 
Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.17 per share, compared with Refinitiv IBES estimates of $1.02 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shares rallied on Thursday as strong bank earnings reports fired up investors' risk appetites, while the dollar and benchmark Treasury yields both paused their recent ascent to pull back from multi-month highs.
But soaring oil prices climbed yet again, keeping inflation pressures alive and supporting bets that central banks could tighten policies and hike interest rates sooner than expected.
In the United States, data that showed producer prices posting their smallest gain in nine months in September showed inflation risks were real, but perhaps not as dire as some imagined.
Indeed, any worries about rising prices were eclipsed on Thursday by signs that the economy and businesses are thriving, as the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped below 300,000 last week for the first time in 19 months.
The dollar, driven to a more than one-year high this week by growing bets on a U.S. interest rate rise in 2022, eased for a second day along with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which tends to drive global borrowing costs.
""So far bank earnings have been strong. It gives traders some hope we will see a strong earnings season,"" said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""But if we start to see poor guidance from companies, the market could come right back down.""

So, we think small-cap stocks CONSOL (CEIX) and  SilverBow  (SBOW), which have generated substantial momentum lately, are poised to continue advancing in the near term. Let's discuss.The energy sector started picking up momentum in late 2020. And the sector ended the second quarter of 2021 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a staggering 45.6% gain. And this impressive momentum shows no signs of slowing.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, crossed $80 per barrel last week for the first time since November 2014 amid heightened demand and tight supply. Natural gas prices are also at record-high levels, which is causing a greater demand for oil and fueling an already strong oil price rally. Analysts expect the supply deficit to continue, pushing the oil prices to even above $100 per barrel. Furthermore, the Department of Energy recently stated that it has no immediate plans to ease the price rally. The industry trends have lately been motivating investors to bet on energy stocks.
Because the price momentum is not expected to end anytime soon, we think red-hot small-cap energy stocks, CONSOL Energy Inc (NYSE:CNX). (CEIX) and SilverBow Resources, Inc. (NYSE:SBOW), which are currently trading above their respective 50-day and 200-day moving averages, could be solid bets now.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Private equity firm HIG Capital has agreed to pay nearly $20 million to resolve claims a mental health company it owned billed Massachusetts' Medicaid program for services provided by unlicensed and unqualified staff.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Thursday's settlement was the largest of its kind with a private equity firm, whose healthcare investments have drawn increased scrutiny.
HIG Capital will pay $19.95 million, while two former executives associated with the mental health company, Peter Scanlan and Kevin Sheehan, will pay an additional $5.05 million.
They did not admit wrongdoing, and their lawyers had no immediate comment.
The settlement stemmed from an investigation prompted by a whistleblower lawsuit in Boston federal court against South Bay Community Services, which operated several mental health clinics in the state.
The whistleblower, former South Bay employee Christine Martino-Fleming, filed the lawsuit under the False Claims Act and the state's equivalent law. 
South Bay was acquired in 2012 by HIG's mental health company Community Intervention Services, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
Healey joined the lawsuit in 2018 and accused South Bay of employing unlicensed, unqualified and unsupervised personnel at its 17 facilities in violation of state regulations governing MassHealth, the state's Medicaid Program.
South Bay nonetheless billed MassHealth as if the mental health services were provided by qualified, properly supervised staff, defrauding the program in the process by submitting false claims for payment, the lawsuit said.
South Bay received $125.4 million from 2009 to 2017 from MassHealth, the state alleged.
In addition to suing South Bay and HIG, Healey also sued Scanlan, South Bay's founder and former owner, and Sheehan, who was Community Intervention Service's chief executive.
South Bay previously in 2018 agreed to pay $4 million to settle the claims against it.

Investing.com –  Caterpillar  stock (NYSE:CAT) rose 3% on Thursday as a Cowen analyst rated it outperform because of a megacycle being underway in construction and infrastructure development.
The stock was off its 8-month lows after analyst Matt Elkott pegged it to touch $241, which is 24% higher than its current level of nearly $195.
Elkott expects valuations to secular trends associated with what is sometimes described as the fourth industrial revolution, the growing service revenue, and increasing involvement in technology.
The analyst sees a $35 billion revenue opportunity for Caterpillar from autonomous solutions in the next decade. The analyst expects the company to generate 33% of its total revenue from the U.S. infrastructure bill alone.
The analyst said the Street isn’t yet appreciating the fact that an expansion of this magnitude would bring with it the first time in 14 years that Caterpillar achieves growth in all the key metrices of revenue, gross and operating margin, and EPS for three consecutive years.
Revenue is expected to grow 30% and 15% in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
The maker of construction and mining equipment will declare its third-quarter earnings on October 28.
The shares have underperformed the broader indices. At the time of declaring its second-quarter results in July, the company had predicted softer margins in July to September.
The company's adjusted operating profit margin was 14.1% in April to June. That said, compared with the third quarter of last year, this profit margin is seen higher."

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group Inc said it expected COVID-19 to have a smaller impact on its profit next year as infections decline and more people get vaccinated, sparking a rally in the shares of U.S. health insurers.
The company, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Thursday also put to rest concerns of an impact from the Delta variant in 2021 by raising its profit outlook. 
A surge in infections in July and August caused by the more infectious variant had increased hospital costs, but cases have declined since then. 
Chief Financial Officer John Rex said current market estimates were ""beginning to calibrate"" the company's 2022 outlook. Analysts expect UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) to post adjusted earnings per share of $21.60, according to Refinitiv data. 
""Investors were waiting to get that visibility into the company's framework around 2022 and clearly the company provided a confident initial outlook for next year,"" Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.
While not every health insurer has had the same momentum as UnitedHealth, its comments bode well for the rest of the sector, he added.
UnitedHealth shares surged 6%, while rivals  Humana Inc  (NYSE:HUM),  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) and  Centene  (NYSE:CNC) Corp were between 2% and 3% higher.
UnitedHealth said it expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share between $18.65 and $18.90, compared with $18.30 to $18.80 previously. It maintained its forecast for a COVID-related hit at $1.80 per share.
The insurer said the profit outlook accounted for a possible surge in high-cost procedures that had been delayed during the Delta surge and were slowly returning to normal levels.

The postponement of the procedures helped it beat earnings expectations for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
The company reiterated its long-term earnings per share growth outlook of 13% to 16%.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 12:11PM ET</span>",European stocks rise past two-week highs on earnings optimism,"By Sruthi Shankar and Susan Mathew
(Reuters) - European stocks rose on Thursday, hitting the highest in more than two weeks as investors bet a steady economic recovery from the pandemic-induced slump will support corporate earnings despite signs of elevated inflation.
Mining shares jumped 3.3%, their biggest daily gain in three months, technology stocks rallied again and the pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.2%. 
European chipmakers, including ASML, Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) and BE Semiconductor, were among the top gainers in the tech sector after Taiwan chip giant TSMC posted a 13.8% jump in third-quarter profit due to booming demand for semiconductors.
China's factory gate inflation rose in September to a record high on soaring commodity prices. Many still hope inflation will be transitory, but supply chain disruptions, a global energy crisis and labour shortages have fuelled concerns that central banks could raise interest rates sooner, accelerating plans for a gradual exit from the pandemic-era stimulus.
""Equity markets appear to have shaken off their caution of recent weeks,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. Upbeat results from Wall Street banks, big European names such as LVMH and SAP, as well as TSMC reinforced the view of a global economy still moving in the right direction, albeit at a slower place, he said. 
""Having dropped back in an orderly fashion into earnings season, it seems stock markets have now reached a level at which investors are once again happy about buying the dip...""
Optimism around the earnings has seen the STOXX 600 narrow the gap to its all-time highs to 2%.
Analysts expect third-quarter profit for STOXX 600 companies to climb 46.7% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data, with energy companies enjoying the biggest revisions. 
Among individual stocks, French advertising group Publicis gained 2.7% after it raised its outlook for 2021 as a global shift towards digital media and e-commence helped third-quarter organic growth exceed market expectations. British rival WPP (LON:WPP) rose 0.5%.
Danish food ingredients maker Chr Hansen dropped 6.7% after fourth-quarter profit cam in below estimates.
SAP gained 2.9%, the biggest boost to the tech sector, after the German software firm's shares jumped nearly 4% in the previous session following a strong quarterly report.

The biggest drag on the STOXX 600 was AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), down 0.5%. Europe's drug regulator said it had started a real-time review of the drugmaker's antibody-based COVID-19 therapy.

Investing.com – Beyond Meat stock (NASDAQ:BYND) rose 1.5% on Thursday as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) said it would start testing a McPlant burger in eight U.S. outlets next month.
McDonald's stock gained 1% as well.
The fast-food chain said it will run the test as long as supplies last. Going by customer response, the retailer will be better placed to understand the impact of introducing a plant-based burger on its operations.
The two companies have jointly developed the plant-based burger. The fast-food giant is already selling the burgers in Sweden, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and the U.K.
In an industry where consumers are finicky and reluctant to change, McDonald’s has been slow in testing out meat substitutes and plant-based meat to its menu. New menu items add more complexity to kitchens and supply chains and make the tasks that much more complex for staff."

(Reuters) - Vietnamese automaker Vinfast will begin taking pre-orders in the U.S. market for its VF (NYSE:VFC) e35 and e36 electric SUVs in the first half of 2022 and expects to begin delivering them by the end of the year, global Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said.
""It's still early to make any sales predictions, but VinFast will unveil two of our latest EV models, which are VF e35 and VF e36, at the 2021 Los Angeles auto show this November, thus marking our official introduction to the American market,"" he said in an email to Reuters. 
The company expects to begin delivering its first EVs in Vietnam starting in December, said Lohscheller, a former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Opel executive who was named to his position at Vinfast in July.
The automobile arm of Vietnam's largest conglomerate, Vingroup, Vinfast has an office in California and expects to inaugurate 60 U.S. showrooms next year, he said.
Vinfast has grand ambitions to launch EV sales in the U.S. and European markets next year, taking on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and other automakers. Funding that plan is Vingroup, which was founded as an instant noodle business in post-Soviet Ukraine and now has interests spanning real estate, resorts, schools, hospitals and smartphones. 
Founded in 2017, Vinfast is aiming to compete on vehicle size and price. The carmaker's vehicles will also come with a battery leasing scheme that means the cost of the battery, one of the most expensive components of an EV, will not be included in the final price.
VinFast, with an assembly plant in Vietnam, is planning to conduct most of its U.S. sales online. Lohscheller said the company will ""keep an eye on the possibility of a manufacturing facility in the U.S.""
The company has targeted global EV sales next year of 15,000 vehicles, down from its prior goal of 56,000 due to the global semiconductor chip shortage.

To fund its growth, Vinfast has said it is eyeing a public listing in the United States.
""VinFast has a plan for an IPO in the U.S., but specific timing will depend on the market and other conditions,"" Lohscheller said. ""We will reveal more information at an appropriate time in the future.""

Indeed, Wall Street analysts expect these stocks to rally by more than 40% in price in the near term. So, let’s take a closer look at these names.Last week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged, led by a decline in large tech stocks, including Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, according to a CNBC report, ""tech weakness is a major buying opportunity for investors."" Moreover, Invesco’s Kristina Hooper said, “Technology over the longer term is going to benefit from increased corporate spending.”
According to a Forrester report, U.S. tech spending is expected to grow by 6% this year and 6.8% next year, which should help the tech industry grow further. The industry is also expected to grow due to consistent innovations in advanced technologies that are applicable across several industries.
Wall Street analysts expect tech stocks NeoPhotonics Corporation (NPTN), Zix Corporation (ZIXI), and Pixelworks, Inc. (PXLW)—which are priced below $10 per share—to rally by more than 40% in the coming months. So, we think it could be wise to add these stocks to one’s watchlist.

Futu fell 15% and Up Fintech fell 23% on the Nasdaq.
According to an analysis on the website of the official People's Daily the Reuters report referred to, they could violate data privacy rules, and also run compliance risks.
Futu and UP Fintech don't have brokerage licenses on the mainland but enable mainland China individuals to invest in overseas stock markets such as the U.S. and Europe. Citizens can simply open accounts online after submitting personal information related to ID cards, bank cards and tax records. The People’s Daily piece wondered where the data goes once it’s collected.
The world’s second largest economy will implement the Personal Information Protection Law from November 1, complementing the Data Security Law, in regulating cyberspace and safeguarding national security, Reuters said.
Tighter compliance for online brokerages is one in a series of steps the Chinese authorities have undertaken over the last few months to regulate internet entities and increase oversight of the end-use of private data. There has also been a broader policy push towards more equitable distribution of wealth and greater welfare.
Steps have included less commission being charged by online food delivery chains and cab aggregators, more rest for cab drivers, regulating time children spend on online games and increased scrutiny of casinos in Macau.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Thursday it sanctioned banking group UBS AG $500,000 for failing to retain certain audio recordings for the time required under regulations.
""The order finds that as a result of failures in UBS’s audio retention systems, the firm deleted over 1,000 hours of audio data after one day, including voice recording files that were required by CFTC regulations to be retained for one year"", the CFTC said in a statement. The order requires UBS to pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty.
As of July 2019, UBS began prematurely deleting, after only one day of retention, files that included voice recordings containing pre-execution swaps trade information that were required to be retained for one year, the CFTC said. 
It said a UBS technology analyst believed the voice recordings were test files that did not need to be retained and re-designated those files which reset the retention period from five years to one day, the CFTC added.
In December 2019, UBS inadvertently learned about the premature deletion of these audio files from its systems. The bank then did an internal review. The analyst's error resulted in deletion of over 1,000 hours, or roughly 2.76% of total U.S. recorded volume, during July 8, 2019 through Dec. 23, 2019.

The deleted files included voice recordings containing pre-execution swaps information such as quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions, trading, and prices that lead to the execution of swaps, all of which are required by CFTC regulations to be retained. 
Upon discovering its potential violation of CFTC regulations, UBS promptly self-reported this violation to CFTC, the commission said, adding that the bank cooperated in the investigation.

Investing.com —   Grove  Inc (NASDAQ:GRVI) a hemp, health, and wellness company, said Thursday that it has launched a wholly-owned division named Upexi to go after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eCommerce businesses.
Grove shares opening 57% higher than Wednesday's close at $7.93. The rally has continued after the open, with its stock currently trading at $8.17, up 63%.
Grove made a name for itself in the CBD/cannabis space and has begun to branch out into other markets, recently acquiring Vitamedica, an online nutraceutical company.
Upexi will be Grove's eCommerce division, acting as a suitor to business owners looking to sell. 
""With Upexi, potential sellers will be able to access Grove’s programmatic ad technology, in-house digital marketing experts, and direct partnership with a team of expert Amazon PPC buyers who fine tune listings or start from scratch,"" the company said in its statement. 
According to Market Pulse, funding has poured into Amazon aggregator businesses since last year, with the amount raised climbing to $10 billion. Thrasio, an Amazon aggregator business, recently raised over $2 billion and could be valued at up to $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.
Grove CEO, Allan Marshall, set out the company's strategy: ""Amazon aggregation has been a goal for us since the beginning. We’re hoping to add 10+ Amazon and Ecommerce businesses to the portfolio over the next year, and another 10 the following. We want to reward people for what they’ve done and give them the ability to see their brand grow under Grove. In many cases, we hope to attract the Amazon/ecommerce experts behind these brands and continue to add talent to our team.”"

Stellantis disclosed to the press late last month that Opel's Eisenach plant would shut for at least three months due to ongoing global chip shortages.
Last week, Stellantis confirmed that it was considering splitting off both the Eisenach plant and Opel's largest plant in Ruesselsheim, Germany into separate legal entities, after newspaper Handelsblatt reported discussions were underway.
The governments of Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and Thuringia, the states where Opel's three German plants are located, were not told about either decision ahead of the information being made public, the state premiers said in their letter to Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, seen by Reuters.
""You yourself, Mr Tavares, at the former PSA Group had ensured open and honest communication with representatives of states with Opel locations about your plans for Opel Germany,"" the letter from Malu Dreyer, Volker Bouffier and Bodo Ramelow, dated Oct. 14, said. 
""We are turning to you with this letter out of concern, before the trust is lost through further unexpected news from Stellantis' side.""
France's PSA Group acquired Opel in 2017 and implemented deep cuts which led the company to turn a profit for the first time in nearly two decades within a year. PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler earlier this year to form Stellantis, now the world's fourth-largest carmaker. 
Stellantis' CEO Tavares has made clear the need to streamline Stellantis' 14 brands and ease a global overcapacity problem, but he has previously promised that his endeavours to turn around Opel would not involve factory closures.

However, last week union officials said they feared the company would renege on this promise in light of the chip shortage, which Tavares has previously said he expects will last well into mid-2022.
The German state premiers asked Tavares to set a date for a video call with them to discuss Stellantis' plans.

Furthermore, a proposed infrastructure spending bill in Congress is being delayed. So, given current market volatility, we think Dow Jones stocks  Caterpillar  (CAT) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), which retreated more than 10% in price in the third quarter, are best avoided now. Read on.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a volatile week last Friday, ending the week close to flat on October 8. The benchmark slipped 8.69 points, or less than 0.1%, to 34746.25. The market volatility is being driven primarily by rising inflation concerns and Congressional negotiations on the U.S. debt ceiling. In addition, U.S. consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low in September, owing to rising COVID-19 cases that threaten the global economic recovery.
A much-awaited infrastructure bill is expected to boost the U.S economy and benefit the industrial sector. However, the U.S. House of Representative delayed its planned vote on the bipartisan bill as democrats failed to come to an agreement.

As such, we think renewable energy stocks Azure Power (AZRE), PowerCell Sweden (PCELF), and Beam Global (BEEM) could now be good additions to one’s watch list. Further, Wall Street analysts expect these names to rally 60% or more in price the near term. Read on.According to International Energy Outlook 2021, renewable energy will be the primary source of new electricity generation through 2050. Renewables’ share of energy consumption is set to grow from 15% in 2020 to 27% in 2050 due to falling technology costs and changing government policies, which will compel the electric power sector to use renewable energy sources to meet surging electricity demand.
Many countries have pledged to seek carbon neutrality under the Paris Agreement, which should bode well for the renewable energy sector. For example, President Biden has stated his goal is to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. The global renewable energy market is expected to reach $1,977.6 billion by 2030, growing at an 8.4% CAGR from 2021 to 2030.
Given this backdrop, Wall Street analysts expect renewable energy stocks Azure Power Global Limited (NYSE:AZRE), PowerCell Sweden AB (publ) (PCELF), and Beam Global (BEEM) to rally by more than 60% in the coming months. So, it could be wise to add these stocks to your watchlist now.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's new body overseeing accounting rules following Brexit said it was braced for a ""lot of noise"" from the 1.7 trillion pound ($2.33 trillion) insurance sector about measures to increase transparency of financial positions and performance.
Departure from the European Union meant Britain had to set up its own body to endorse international accounting rules, a task previously undertaken by Brussels, with the first big test next month involving insurance accounting rule IFRS 17.
Pauline Wallace, a 30-year veteran in accounting who is interim chair of the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB), said the body will consult in November on endorsing the rule which comes into force globally in January 2023.
""We are running against quite a tight deadline,"" Wallace told Reuters.
The UKEB must take into account the long-term impact of an accounting rule on the UK economy and its competitiveness compared with Europe and elsewhere, with government keen for Britain to bolster its attractiveness as a global investment centre following Brexit.
IFRS rules are written by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for use in over 140 jurisdictions and are endorsed at the national level for use.
IFRS 17 represents one of the biggest changes for insurers in decades, shining a light into a ""black box"" of balance sheets whose opaqueness has put off many investors.
Wallace said the consultation will ask if IFRS 17 should be applied as written by the IASB, adding that she has not heard any calls for major 'carve outs'.
""We can also not endorse. That is the nuclear option. I don't think that's anything anybody wants,"" Wallace said.
She expects a ""lot of noise"" from industry, especially over the treatment of with-profits funds.
""The insurance industry is very good at making their views known. Insurance companies are not the only stakeholders in this. Investors are very keen to see better accounting in insurance,"" she told Reuters.
The Association of British Insurers said it had no comment on IFRS 17 at this stage.

Following heavy lobbying from Europe's insurance sector, the EU is putting some contracts into shorter time brackets, a key demand from insurers in southern Europe.
Wallace said she was not hearing calls for a similar move in the UK.

(Reuters) -Morgan Stanley delivered a bullish outlook Thursday after reporting third-quarter earnings which were comfortably ahead of market expectations, driven by record investment banking and M&A advisory revenues.
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said investment banking pipelines remained healthy across sectors and regions and the current deal momentum is expected to continue.
""The investment bank, itself, and M&A, is on fire,"" Gorman said in an interview with CNBC after the results. ""We've got global GDP growth, enormous fiscal stimulus, record low interest rates. People want to transact.""
Global mergers and acquisitions have touched a new high as deals totaling $1.52 trillion were announced in the three months ended Sept. 27, a 38% growth from a year ago and higher than any quarter on record as per Refinitiv data.
Net revenue from institutional securities, which houses  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s sales and trading and investment banking units, the bank's largest reporting segment, rose 22% to $7.5 billion from a year earlier.
Revenue at Morgan Stanley's investment banking unit, comprising advisory, equity and fixed income underwriting businesses, came in at $2.85 billion, compared to $1.71 billion a year ago. That included a record $1.27 billion from its advisory business as it closed more deals.
Morgan Stanley is positioned third in the global M&A league tables, which rank financial services firms based on the amount of M&A fees they generate, trailing behind rivals  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
Fees from equity underwriting stood at $1.01 billion, with the bank acting as an underwriter on a few most anticipated stock market debuts, including Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rival Freshworks Inc, restaurant software maker Toast Inc and Federer-backed shoemaker On Holding AG.
Morgan Stanley's quarter was further strengthened by a 25% rise in revenue in its wealth management business, driven by higher asset levels and growth in net interest income, which is a result of its E*Trade acquisition and strong client activity. 
Return on tangible common equity was 19.6%, well above the bank's two-year target of between 14% and 16% that it had set in January. The figure measures how well a bank is using its capital to produce profit. 
As it lacks a big consumer lending unit, Morgan Stanley has been able to weather the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The bank brought down its provision for credit losses to $24 million for the third quarter from $111 million a year earlier. 
Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $3.58 billion, or $1.98 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $2.6 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. 
Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.68 per share, according to Refinitiv data. 
Net revenue rose to $14.75 billion in the third quarter, compared with $11.72 billion a year earlier.

Shares in Morgan Stanley, which have risen by 47% year-to-date, were down 0.5%, in line with other U.S. banks. 
Gorman said he expects the Federal Reserve to begin tapering soon.

(Reuters) -Bank of America Corp beat estimates for third-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by strong growth across its businesses which executives said they expected to continue next quarter.
Growth in loans and leases, higher spending on credit and debit cards, and strong equity-trading and M&A activity helped the bank record a 64% rise in earnings. 
Net interest income (NII), which measures how profitably a bank can lend out depositors' funds, rose nearly 10% to $11.09 billion. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s NII hit a low in the third quarter last year, but executives said they were optimistic it would continue to rise this year and next.
""We are expecting modest NII growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter,"" the bank's Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said. ""(It) is going to depend on loan-to-deposit growth, and we expect both of those to continue to grow, consistent with a growing economy. 
""One could expect, I think, robust improvement in NII in ... the full year 2021 versus the full year 2022.""
Average loans and leases, excluding those from the government-backed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), grew by 2.3% in the third quarter from the prior quarter, although that figure fell 4.3% from last year. 
Still, nearly every loan product grew some in the quarter, and the bank issued around 1 million more credit cards, further fueling that growth. 
""We had loan growth in every loan product at the company. It was very broad based,"" ""We are optimistic about future growth.""
BofA shares were up nearly 2.5% in mid-morning trading.
Combined spending on credit and debit cards was up 21% to $201 billion in the quarter, the bank said.
Revenue from its equities division rose 33%, driven by growth in client financing activities and strong trading performance.
The second-largest U.S. bank by assets released reserves of $1.1 billion in the quarter. It had set aside tens of billions of dollars last year to cover possible loan defaults, which it has steadily been releasing as the economic outlook improves.
Bank of America's revenue jumped 12% to $22.8 billion.

Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $7.26 billion, or 85 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $4.44 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 71 cents per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - From beef bowls in Tokyo to fried chicken in London, consumers are starting to feel the pinch from the surge in costs coursing through the global economy.
The rebound as coronavirus restrictions are eased has exposed supply chain shortages, with firms scrambling for workers, ships and even fuel to power factories, threatening the fledgling economic recovery.
Britain's biggest chicken producer said that the country's 20-year cheap food binge is ending and food price inflation could hit double digits.
""The days when you could feed a family of four with a 3 pound ($4) chicken are coming to an end,"" Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of the 2 Sisters Group, said.
Shortages of warehouse workers, truckers and butchers as the world's fifth-largest economy deals with Brexit as well as COVID is exacerbating strains being felt globally by international business.

Jon Abrahamsson, chief executive at Inter IKEA, told Reuters IKEA warns supply chain disruptions likely to last into 2022 he expects the crisis to extend into 2022, with the biggest challenge getting goods out of China, where around a quarter of IKEA products are made.
IKEA said stores in North America have been hardest hit by product shortages, followed by Europe.
In the United States, President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged the private sector to help ease blockages that are threatening to disrupt the U.S. holiday season.
Biden said the Port of Los Angeles would join the Port of Long Beach in working round-the-clock to unload about 500,000 containers, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and other big retailers would expand overnight operations to help out.
Even in Japan, where weak growth has meant that prices of many things - as well as wages - have not risen much in decades, consumers and businesses are facing a price shock for basics such as coffee and beef bowls.
Japan's core consumer inflation stopped falling in August, snapping a 12-month deflationary spell. Economists and policymakers expect to see recent price rises reflected in data over the coming months.
With central bankers on high alert and inflation in Spain, Ireland and Sweden hitting 13-year highs, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde repeated that the upswing in Europe is seen as temporary and said there were no signs of it becoming embedded in wages.
""The impact of these factors should fade out ... in the course of next year, dampening annual inflation,"" Lagarde said. 
Euro zone inflation is expected to hit 4% before the end of the year, twice the ECB's target, and a growing number of economists see it remaining above target throughout 2022.
COLD FRONT
Dwindling power supplies suggest a bleak winter outlook in some parts of the world.
As northern China chills, coal prices held near record highs, with power plants stocking up to ease an energy crunch that sent factory gate inflation in the world's second-largest economy to an at-least 25 year high in September.
Meanwhile, Coal India, the world's biggest coal miner, said it had temporarily stopped supplying non-power users as India battles one of its worst ever power supply deficits.
China's power crisis, caused by shortages of coal, high fuel prices and booming post-pandemic industrial demand has halted production, including at factories supplying big brands such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Weak demand is capping consumer inflation, however, forcing policymakers to walk a tightrope between supporting the economy and further stoking producer prices.
There are few signs of any energy cost reprieve, with Brent crude oil futures above $84 a barrel on expectations that soaring natural gas prices will drive a switch to oil to meet winter heating needs.
The International Energy Agency said the crunch could boost oil demand by half a million barrels per day (bpd).
""Higher energy prices are also adding to inflationary pressures that, along with power outages, could lead to lower industrial activity and a slowdown in the economic recovery,"" the IEA said in its monthly oil report.
Top economic institutes cut their joint forecast for 2021 growth in Germany, Europe's largest economy, to 2.4% from 3.7% as supply bottlenecks hamper output. 
German government and industry sources told Reuters on Thursday that the government plans to ease the pressure on consumers from rising energy bills by cutting the surcharge which helps fund renewable energy investment by 43% next year.
And in Singapore two energy providers, including one of the largest independents, are exiting the market while at least three others have stopped accepting new clients due to rocketing wholesale energy prices, company sources told Reuters.
Meanwhile, the White House has been speaking with U.S. oil and gas producers about helping to bring down fuel costs, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The average U.S. retail cost of a gallon of gasoline is at a seven-year high, and winter fuel costs are forecast to surge.
CHIPS DOWN
Dutch navigation and digital mapping company TomTom warned that supply chain problems in the auto sector could last well into 2022.
""Collectively we have underestimated how big the supply chain issues, and especially for semiconductor shortages, have been or have become"", TomTom Chief Financial Officer Taco Titulaer told Reuters.
A global semiconductor chip shortage has forced carmakers still recovering from coronavirus to halt production again.
Italian-American vehicle maker CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) said on Wednesday it will temporarily shut several European agricultural, commercial vehicle and powertrain manufacturing plants because of problems procuring components.
Soaring demand is, however, proving a boon for some.
Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reported a near 14% jump in third quarter profit.

TSMC and Taiwan have become central to efforts to resolve the global chip shortage, which has also hit manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and consumer appliances.
Some companies, such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp are intensifying efforts to restart production. The Japanese carmaker hopes to do so in December with a rebound in shipments from pandemic-hit suppliers, three sources told Reuters.

Investing.com – Walgreens stock (NASDAQ:WBA) fell 3.5% Thursday on concerns it’s paying too much for an additional stake in primary-care provider VillageMD.
Walgreens will invest $5.2 billion in VillageMD to raise its shareholding to 63% from 30%, a stake that cost it not more than $1 billion less than a year ago.
VillageMD company expects to clock $1.3 billion in revenue in 2021.
With the help of the acquisition, the pharmacy chain aims to offer full-service primary care practices with physicians and pharmacists all under one roof at a large scale. VillageMD will open clinics inside Walgreens stores.
The purpose is to open at least 600 Village Medical at Walgreens primary care practices in more than 30 U.S. markets by 2025 and 1,000 by 2027, Walgreens said in a note.
VillageMD currently operates over 230 practices across 15 markets. Walgreens and VillageMD have 52 co-located primary care practice locations, and will have more than 80 open by the end of this calendar year, the note said.
The acquisition overshadowed the company’s fourth-quarter results beating estimates.
Fourth-quarter sales increased about 13% from last year, to $34.3 billion, driven by 13.5 million Covid vaccinations it provided, almost double the approximately 7 million it had estimated for the August quarter.
The current quarter will be looking at strength from booster doses for adults that have been approved and a likely nod for vaccination in younger children.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",Factbox-Front runners in development of antibody drugs against COVID-19,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) are among the biggest players to have developed COVID-19 treatments using a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies.
Lab-made monoclonal antibodies mimic natural antibodies in fighting off infections. Unlike vaccines they do not rely on the body to create an immune response, and can therefore help individuals with weak or compromised immune systems.
Below is an outline of where the major drugmakers are in the development and regulatory process:
ASTRAZENECA
* AstraZeneca's AZD7442 is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies given in two sequential injections and aimed at preventing and treating COVID-19.
* On Oct. 5 it requested emergency use approval (EUA) from U.S. regulators as a preventative drug.
* On Oct. 11 it said it would also submit the new treatment data to global health regulators.
* On Oct. 14, the EU drug regulator said it had started a real-time review of the therapy.
TRIALS:
* In June, the drugmaker said a late-stage trial had failed to provide evidence that the therapy could stop individuals exposed to the virus from contracting it.
* In August, another trial showed the therapy reduced the risk of people developing any COVID-19 symptoms by 77%.
* On Oct. 11 data showed AZD7442 reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 or death by 50% in non-hospitalised patients who have had symptoms for seven days or less.
SUPPLY DEALS:
* AstraZeneca said in March it would supply up to 500,000 more doses of the therapy to the United States, extending a prior agreement made in October for 200,000 doses. The deal is contingent on an EUA from the FDA.
* The British government also has an in-principle agreement for over a million doses.
ELI LILLY & CO 
* U.S. pharmaceutical group's treatment, a combination of the antibodies bamlanivimab and etesevimab, is meant for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
* In February it was granted EUA by the FDA for treatment of patients at high risk of severe illness who have not been hospitalised or require oxygen therapy.
* The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services paused distribution in June after the drug failed to show effectiveness against several COVID-19 variants, but resumed it to some states at the end of August.
* In September, the FDA revised its EUA to also include use in at-risk patients who have been exposed to the virus.
TRIALS:
* The combination helped cut the risk of hospitalisation and death in patients by 70%, early data from a late-stage trial showed in January.
* January data from a trial of one of the therapy's components, bamlanivimab, also showed it could cut the risk of infection by 80% for nursing home residents.
SUPPLY DEALS:
* Eli Lilly announced in September an agreement with the European Commission to supply up to 220,000 doses.
* The U.S. bought 100,000 doses of the dual antibody cocktails in February, followed by 388,000 doses of etesevimab in September. The country had already committed to buying a total of 1,450,000 doses of bamlanivimab alone.
GLAXOSMITHKLINE
* GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) partnered to develop the COVID-19 antibody drug sotrovimab.
* In May, the FDA granted sotrovimab an EUA for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older.
* The EU's drug regulator backed in June its use for patients at risk of severe disease who do not need supplemental oxygen.
* It received approval as a COVID-19 treatment in Japan in September.
TRIALS:
* The treatment resulted in a 79% reduction in risk of hospitalisation for more than 24 hours or death due to any cause, a late-stage study showed in June.
SUPPLY DEALS:
* The EU signed in July a contract with GSK for the supply of up to 220,000 doses of sotrovimab.
* It also signed a deal to supply 10,000 doses to Canada.
REGENERON
* The single-dose antibody cocktail Ronapreve, known as REGEN-COV in the United States and developed by Regeneron and Roche is a combination of two antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab), and can be taken via injection or infusion. 
* Mid-July, Japan became the first country to authorise the treatment, swiftly followed by the United States and Britain.
* REGEN-COV has now received emergency approval from more than 20 countries for both the prevention and treatment of the virus. 
* On Oct. 11, the EU drug regulator said it was evaluating the cocktail for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. 
TRIALS:
* In June, a late-stage trial showed the cocktail reduced the risk of death by 20% for hospitalised patients whose own immune systems had failed to produce a response.
* Earlier in April, it was revealed that REGEN-COV helped cut the risk of symptomatic infections by 81% among people in households where another member had become ill.
* The cocktail has also been found effective in preventing COVID-19 in people exposed to those infected, while a separate study indicated it could combat the Beta variant.
SUPPLY DEALS:

* As of September, the U.S. government has purchased nearly 3 million doses.
* In June, the EU secured 55,000 doses through a contract covering 37 European countries, including Britain and other non-EU nations.

The fund, dubbed HOPE, aims to raise 500 million euros ($581 million) from both professional investors and small savers, who can invest as little as 1,000 euros.
Italian households held net financial assets of 3,809 billion euros at the end of 2020, according to the Bank of Italy. Amid the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, deposits rose by 85 billion euros last year, more than twice the average increase of the previous five years.
""The idea behind HOPE is to funnel Italy's huge private savings into the country's real economy to fuel economic growth,"" HOPE CEO Claudio Scardovi told Reuters.
Backers of the project also include Italy's top insurer Generali (MI:GASI), banks Banco BPM, BPER and BNL, the Italian arm of France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Sponsors have provided financing to get the venture off the ground and some have also given a preliminary commitment to invest in the fund when it launches.
""Italy needs to grow to sustain its public debt, which is being financed in part by other euro zone members such as Germany and France through the European Central Bank,"" Scardovi said. 
Extraordinary economic support measures deployed by Rome during the COVID-19 crisis have lifted Italy's public debt, one of the world's largest, to 2,726 billion euros - more than 1.5 times the country's domestic output.
The country, plagued by chronically sluggish growth, is banking on the post-pandemic recovery to lower its debt burden.
Private equity funds are enjoying a boom phase as investors hunt for returns amid negative rates and sky-high valuations on financial markets awash with cheap liquidity.
""Inflation is upon us and investing in unlisted real assets is the best defence strategy against it,"" Scardovi, formerly at consultancy AlixPartners, said.

""We want to give ordinary Italians access to the private equity universe ... by putting a share of their savings in a diversified portfolio with exposure to corporate, but also real estate and infrastructure."" 
HOPE, which targets a double-digit rate of return on its investments, is awaiting a green light from Italian market regulator Consob in early 2022, before it starts distributing its products through the financial institutions that backed it.($1 = 0.8611 euros)

Investing.com — Hydrogen-electric vehicle maker Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) shares rose 0.7% on Thursday after it announced a collaboration with transportation company PGT Trucking.
After completing a demonstration program, the collaboration between Nikola and  PGT  (NYSE:PGTI) includes a letter of intent (LOI) to lease 100 Nikola Tre heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).

(NYSE:MATX), could be great bets now. So, let’s examine these names.Following a disappointing August, the U.S. economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, versus a 500,000 projection by Dow Jones, which has fostered pessimism among some investors. This, along with several lingering issues, could keep the market under pressure in the near term.
The stock market continues to exhibit extreme volatility, as evidenced by the CBOE Volatility Index’s (VIX) significant increase over the past three months, due to inflation concerns and doubts about the economic recovery. Growth stocks are usually ideal for dodging short-term market fluctuations, however. And the government’s continuing fiscal and monetary support to the economy, along with the potential that the forthcoming third-quarter earnings season will be encouraging, could further boost returns of growth stocks poised to deliver solid earnings.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on HCA Healthcare Inc. (HCA), Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID), Korn Ferry (KFY), and Matson Inc. (MATX) because they possess solid growth attributes and are well-positioned to deliver solid earnings.

The decision by the human medicines committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to begin the rolling review was based on early results from clinical studies, the regulator said https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-evusheld-tixagevimab-cilgavimab. It did not say when a conclusion was expected.
The move to start a real-time review, so called because data is evaluated as it is made available, came roughly a week after the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker sought emergency approval from U.S. authorities. 
While vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, AstraZeneca's biotech compound, to be branded as Evusheld, contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection. 
The medicine has been proven to work among people who are not infected and was also shown this week to save lives and prevent severe disease when given as treatment within a week of first symptoms. 
""EMA will evaluate more data on the quality, safety and effectiveness of the medicine as they become available,"" the European Union's (EU) watchdog said, adding the review would continue until AstraZeneca can formally submit an application for approval.
AstraZeneca has said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/astrazeneca-files-us-approval-drug-prevent-covid-19-2021-10-05 that talks regarding supply agreements for Evusheld, also known as AZD7442, are ongoing with the United States and other governments. 
There are some COVID-19 therapies based on the same class of medicine as AstraZeneca, called monoclonal antibodies, that aim to treat rather than prevent the illness. They are sold by rivals Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and GSK-Vir outside the EU to stop the disease from worsening during early, milder stages of the infection.

Other antibody-based COVID-19 treatments under a real-time review by the EMA are GSK-Vir's treatment, Sotrovimab, and Lilly's cocktail. Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s remdesivir is the only drug, of any kind, to be approved in the EU https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines/covid-19-treatments for COVID treatment.

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) fell 1.3% on Thursday after a report in The Wall Street Journal pointed to more troubles in its Dreamliner 787 planes.
According to the WSJ report, the new problem involves certain titanium parts that are weaker than they should be on 787s built over the last 3 years. The discovery adds to the list of issues that have plagued the wide-body planes.
The titanium issue, found by the company as part of a continuing audit, doesn’t pose an urgent safety risk to planes currently flying, Boeing and regulators have determined, the WSJ report said.
Boeing has delivered 12 units of 787-9 series models and 2 units of 787-8 series so far in the current calendar year. A note issued by the company in July said it expected to deliver fewer than half of the 787s currently in inventory this year.

381,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>","Wall Street Rises at Opening After Jobless Claims, PPI Relief; Dow up 300 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday after encouraging economic data showing labor market strength and less inflation at the factory gate than had been feared.
A mixed bag of earnings from the country's biggest banks was enough to allow broad advances in all three major indices, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 297 points, or 0.9%, to 34,674 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1%.
Earlier, the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell to their lowest since the start of the pandemic, at only 293,000, the first time they have been under 300,000 since March 2020. Of equal importance for a market currently obsessed with the inflation outlook was the announcement that the producer price index rose only 0.5% on the month and 8.6% on the year. While the latter still represents the fastest rate of factory gate inflation in many years, both numbers were lower than expected and - as with consumer prices - the rate of monthly price increases is slowing markedly from earlier in the year. 
The numbers relieved some of the pressure on stocks from the bond market, where long-term interest rates have been rising steadily in recent weeks. By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was back down at 1.54%, its lowest in a week. 
A flurry of earnings from banks had mixed effects on their stock, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) the pick of the bunch. BofA stock rose 1.4% after the investment bankers at its Merrill Lynch arm generated a record $654 million in revenue in the quarter, up 65% from a year earlier.  Net interest income from the bank's core lending business also grew more than expected.  
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) also reported a strong quarter but not strong enough to stop its stock falling 0.4%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell by 0.4% after showing a fall in net interest income in its quarterly results, driven by customers using high cash reserves to pay down debts. The same issue had been cited by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday in its own results.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock, meanwhile, fell 1.6% after it disclosed another $250 million fine for shortcomings in its efforts to repay customers to whom it had previously missold products.
Elsewhere, ADRs of Chinese online brokerage Futu (NASDAQ:FUTU) fell 13.8% to a 10-month low after a report in the Chinese People's Daily said that it will be at risk from regulatory action as a new law on data privacy and compliance takes effect. 
ADRs of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) rose 2.0% after the chipmaker said its capacity would remain tight all through next year. The read-across for pricing power at other chipmakers also lifted Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock by similar amounts. ADRs of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch-based company that makes chipmaking equipment, rose 3.6%."

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. commercial electric vehicle maker Electric Last Mile Solutions Inc (ELMS) on Thursday said it has signed a battery supply deal with China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL). 
Financial terms of the deal, which runs through 2025, were not disclosed. CATL's batteries power the Class 1 small delivery vehicle that ELMS began building last month at its plant in Mishawaka, Indiana.
The companies are also exploring a setup where CATL would have a U.S. plant that would make battery cells and ship them to the ELMS plant in Indiana for assembly into battery packs, an ELMS spokesman said.
""We reached an important milestone to secure battery capacity in an extremely challenging supply environment,"" ELMS' deputy chief financial officer, Rob Song, said in a statement. 
Battery makers are boosting production to meet soaring worldwide demand as carmakers accelerate the shift to electric vehicles to comply with tougher emission rules aimed at tackling climate change. 
CATL, which supplies numerous global automakers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), has not announced where it would open a U.S. plant, but last year purchased a facility in Glasgow, Kentucky. Kentucky state officials in September 2020 offered incentives to CATL for a potential battery pack plant there. 
Ningde, China-based CATL, which already has U.S. sales offices, has previously declined to comment on plans for the American market. President Joe Biden has made it a priority to support the rollout of electric vehicles to make the United States competitive with China.
Under the deal with ELMS, CATL will provide lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries using a simpler cell-to-pack technology. The LFP chemistry is less expensive and safer than cobalt- or nickel-based cathodes in other batteries. 

In August, Troy, Michigan-based ELMS, which went public in June through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), said despite impacts from COVID-19 and industry-wide supply chain problems it was on track to build 1,000 vans this year.
Following the small van, which has a starting price of $34,000 before federal tax credits, ELMS plans to build a larger Class 3 truck in the second half of 2022.

The figure is a sharp increase on a United Nations target to mobilise $100 billion a year, BlackRock said in a report, adding emerging markets were ""essential"" to ensure the world succeeds in limiting global warming.
The issue is expected to form a central plank of discussions at the next round of global climate talks, due to start in Glasgow on Oct. 31, where all countries are being urged to accelerate their efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
BlackRock said to reach the target financing, public bodies would need to contribute $100 billion a year in grant-equivalent financing, which could in turn be leveraged with additional public and private sector investment.
Despite multilateral institutions working for years to help fund projects that would help prepare for and mitigate the impact of climate change, so far they had had only ""limited success"" in attracting private capital.

The main barrier to investment was the extra risk involved in investing in emerging markets, including political, legal, regulatory and macroeconomic risk, it said.
To fix the problem, public investors would need to be prepared to take on more of the risk and assume a greater exposure to potential losses.

(Reuters) -Canada's  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) Corp said on Thursday it would buy weed gummies maker Wana Brands for $297.5 million, as the world's biggest pot producer looks to expand in the U.S. cannabis market.
Demand for pot edibles such as gummies has risen during the pandemic, as people stuck at home turn to cannabis-related products for relaxation and entertainment.
""The categories that resonate the most with consumers, particularly in THC space are gummies and beverages, we continue to look at other ways of consumption but these two seem to be the ones that are taking off,"" Canopy Chief Executive Officer David Klein told Reuters.
Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC is the ingredient in marijuana that gets you 'high'.
Wana sells gummies in the U.S. state of Colorado and licenses its intellectual property to partners who manufacture, distribute and sell Wana-branded gummies in states including California, Arizona, Illinois, Michigan and Florida.
Canadian pot producers are looking at cross-border expansion, as the industry has garnered investor interest with some U.S. states legalizing pot and on increased expectations for federal marijuana reform.
""We remain more bullish than others in the regulatory front and feel that our ecosystem in the U.S. is strong enough to grow even without federal permissibility happening in the short term,"" Klein added.
U.S.-listed shares of Canopy, which are down 46% so far this year, rose nearly 2% to $13.55 in premarket trade.

The acquisition will provide Canopy access to Wana's vertically integrated facility in Colorado and its licensing division, the company said, adding that it would continue operating independently in the state until the deal closes. 
The transaction is structured as three separate option agreements allowing Canopy Growth a call option to acquire 100% of the membership interests in each Wana entity, the company said in its statement.

(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co posted a nearly 60% rise in third-quarter profit that beat market estimates, as it released funds set aside to cover potential loan losses due to the pandemic and reined in costs tied to its years-old sales practices scandal.
The fourth-largest U.S. bank has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 as it looks to improve governance and oversight, with the Federal Reserve also capping its assets at $1.95 trillion.
The lender, which has paid more than $5 billion in civil and criminal penalties, on Thursday reported a $250 million hit for the third quarter after a top U.S. banking regulator fined it for shortcomings in its earlier efforts to pay back previously harmed customers.
Overall, non-interest expenses fell to $13.3 billion from $15.23 billion a year earlier. The bank's non-personnel expenses declined by $2 billion, or 30%, mainly due to lower restructuring charges and COVID-related costs.
The lender reported a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. The fall in provisions lifted its net income to $5.12 billion, or $1.17 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $3.22 billion, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.
According to Refinitiv estimates,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) earned $1.22 per share excluding items, compared with the consensus estimate of 99 cents per share.
Its shares rose 1.3% in pre-market trading.
Bank executives have repeatedly signaled that the worst of the fallout from the scandal was behind them, and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf has made cost cuts a cornerstone of his turnaround plan, targeting $10 billion in savings annually over the long term.
Issues however remain. A federal judge earlier this month rejected the bank's bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders about its ability to rebound from the scandals.
""The recent OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) enforcement actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority,"" Scharf said in a statement.
""I believe we are making significant progress, and I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years, though we may continue to have setbacks along the way.""
LOAN WEAKNESS
Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month said the bank's asset cap would stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems, suggesting Wells Fargo had a ways to go before it would be allowed to expand.
The cap has curtailed the loan and deposit growth needed by the bank to boost interest income and cover costs.
Wells Fargo's average loans fell 8% to $854 billion, slipping for the fifth straight quarter. Soft loan demand combined with low-interest rates also hurt its net interest income, which dropped 5%.
Average loans in consumer banking dropped 14% in the quarter, while commercial loans slipped 12%.

But credit card point of sale volumes within the consumer and small business banking unit rose nearly 25% to $26.5 billion. Wells Fargo also reported higher consumer and business debit-card transactions, with purchase volumes rising more than 15% to $118.6 billion. 
Total revenue fell 2% to $18.8 billion for the bank that has fewer ways to cushion declines in revenue from low-interest rates due to its relatively small capital markets business.

Stellantis, formed at the start of the year by the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, announced in May that it would completely restructure its European dealers' network as it seeks to adapt to changes in the industry brought by electrification, including a boom in online sales, and achieve promised post-merger synergies.
Stellantis will end all current sales and service contracts with European dealers for its 14 brands, with effect from June 2023.
The company is still exploring options for how to structure future relationships with dealers but is moving towards an ""agency model"", European sales chief Maria Grazia Davino said, referring to an arrangement where carmakers take more control of sales transactions while dealers focus on handovers and servicing, no longer acting as the customer's contractual partner.
""To be transparent, we are still building this up,"" Davino said at an autos conference in Nuertingen, near Stuttgart. ""We are going in the direction of an agency model."" .
As of June 2023, significant changes will be made to the European Union's Block Exemption Regulation (BER), which has granted antitrust exemptions to carmakers allowing them to operate franchise networks where they can dictate who sells their products and where.
Stellantis, which has 14 brands including Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot, Opel, Jeep and others, issued termination notices to all current sales and service dealers in June, but contracts will remain valid for another two years.
The world’s fourth largest carmaker has promised more than 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in annual synergies and said 7% of them would be driven by savings on sales operations and general expenses.
The company did not specify at the time what future contracts would look like, but highlighted that the decision for a change was taken in anticipation of growing online sales and new market players such as e-commerce platforms.

It is not yet known whether this process will lead to a reduction of Stellantis’ network in Europe.
Stellantis said in May that the network restructuring will not involve dealers of Stellantis luxury brand Maserati and those in the United States, home of some of the group's most popular brands such as Ram and Dodge.

Barrick, the world's second-largest gold miner by reserves, also reiterated its annual output forecast, saying that fourth-quarter production was set to be the strongest of the year.
In the three months ended Sept. 30, total preliminary gold production rose to 1.09 million ounces, from 1.04 million ounces in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected a figure of 1.14 million ounces, Refinitiv data showed.
The output was underpinned by a nearly 55% jump in production of the yellow metal at the Veladero mine after it commissioned expansion works at the site. 
The miner's copper production rose 4.16% sequentially to 100 million pounds. 
The company said the third-quarter realized copper price was expected to be 5% to 7% below the average market price of $4.25 per pound, mainly due to adjustments that reflect the downward trend in copper prices during the quarter.
It estimated all-in sustaining costs, a key industry metric, to be 4% to 6% lower sequentially for both gold and copper.

It also said output at the Hemlo mine in Canada was expected to be below its annual outlook as the ramp-up of underground development had slowed due to COVID-19 movement curbs.
Barrick, which hopes to restart the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea this year after resolving a standoff with the government, is slated to report third-quarter results on Nov. 4.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines on Thursday announced an expansion of its transatlantic service next year, adding five new destinations to capitalize on pent-up travel demand.
U.S. carriers are buoyed by the Biden administration's decision to reopen to fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries, including most of Europe, in November.
In 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic, transatlantic routes accounted for up to 17% of passenger revenues for the big three U.S. carriers - United, Delta and American.
The airlines have said they have seen a surge in bookings since the White House announced the lifting of the travel restrictions last month. United has said that it expects the transatlantic route to have the busiest ever summer next year.
In May, the company will start new flights from Washington to Amman in Jordan, New York to the Azores, and New York to Bergen in Norway. In June, it plans to start flights from New York to Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands.
Anticipating an increase in travel demand, the Chicago-based carrier is also planning to add more flights to Munich, Milan, Berlin, Rome and Dublin.

""We will be flying to more destinations across the Atlantic than ever in the company's history,"" said Patrick Quayle, senior vice president of international network and alliances at United. ""We are confident that bookings across the transatlantic will be the best.""

DUBAI (Reuters) -One of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s top dealmakers, who helped advise oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) on its initial public offering (IPO), is leaving to join the investment banking arm of Banque Saudi Fransi.
Motaz Alangari, who is based in Riyadh, is leaving the Wall Street Bank after more than five years leading its Saudi investment banking business, according to a Morgan Stanley memo seen by Reuters.
He will join Saudi Fransi Capital as head of the investment banking team, said a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as the matter is not public.
A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Banque Saudi Fransi, which is 16.2% owned by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holding, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Investment banks operating in the Gulf are beefing up their presence and demand for investment bankers is on the rise amid a deals bonanza as economies recover from last year's COVID-19 linked contraction.
Alangari was involved in some of Morgan Stanley's largest deals in the region including Aramco's record $29.4 billion IPO. More recently, he was involved in the public share sale of Solutions by STC, a unit of Saudi Telecom, which raised around $966 million in September. 
""During his time at Morgan Stanley, Motaz has helped greatly develop our franchise in Saudi Arabia, working tirelessly to promote the firm's interests in the kingdom across divisions,"" the memo circulated on Wednesday said. 
He was previously at Samba Capital, the investment banking arm of Samba Financial Group, which was merged with National Commercial Bank to create Saudi National Bank earlier this year.

Deal activity in the Gulf region has been booming in the last two years, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as governments seek to monetise assets and diversify their economies away from oil. 
Saudi Arabia's Capital Markets Authority said in September that around 45 companies were waiting for approval to list.

Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, released $1.1 billion of reserves in the quarter as the bank grew more confident in the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and less concerned about loan defaults. That boosted its profits by 58%, to $7.7 billion. Revenue rose 12%, to $22.8 billion.
Consumer banking, wealth management and investment banking operations all grew at BofA. In consumer banking, deposits rose as more people opened accounts. Credit and debit spending rose, too, helped also by growth in digital banking.
The global wealth management business was strong as more people engaged BofA to manage their funds, boosting fee income. Loan balances were higher at the end of the quarter. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management added around 4,200 net new households while private banking added around 275 net new relationships, BofA said.
Strong capital markets, heightened demand for advisory services in investment banking and those related to fund-raising and restructuring, boosted fee income in the division. BofA’s total investment banking fees increased 23% to near-record levels of $2.2 billion, the bank said.
At Wells Fargo, net income rose 59% to $5.12 billion, and it released $1.7 billion from loss reserves. Total revenue fell 2.5% due to lower loan balances, decreasing yields on assets and lower mortgage banking revenue.
The quarter was a little challenging for the fourth largest U.S. lender, particularly in its mortgage business under the consumer and small business banking umbrella. There were fewer originations and the fee income from that fell, too.
Growth in advisory fees from corporate and investment banking made up for the hit in trading activity in fixed income, currency and equity. Fees rose 16% over last year in the bank's wealth management business.

The UnitedHealthcare unit’s third-quarter revenue rose 11% to $55.9 billion.

The fund, named ""Thomson Reuters Ventures,"" is part of Chief Executive Steve Hasker's plan to transform the provider of news and information to professionals into what it calls a ""content-driven technology business."" 
The fund will focus on companies in their Series A and Series B investment rounds.
Thomson Reuters wants to identify companies than can help its customers ""deliver more value"" to their customers - whether that be machine learning for better prediction, or automating for better efficiency, said Pat Wilburn, Chief Strategy Officer at Thomson Reuters.

Wilburn will serve as executive director of the fund.
Thomson Reuters said in August that at the end of the second quarter $700 million remained from a $2 billion mergers and acquisitions budget. It said it had a ""robust"" pipeline of targets in areas such as automation and small-to-medium cloud-based and software-as-services businesses.

402,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 06:12AM ET</span>","China real estate shares, bonds hit by Evergrande concerns","By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares and bonds of Chinese real estate companies slid on Thursday, reflecting uncertainty about how a debt crisis will play out at China Evergrande Group and the wider property sector as another developer was hit by a rating downgrade.
Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities and 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week.
The world's most indebted developer, which has been trying to sell assets to raise funds, appeared to have made small progress towards that goal when Qumei Home Furnishings Group announced in a filing on Thursday that it will buy out Evergrande group's 40% stake in their furnishings joint venture for 72 million yuan ($11.18 million). 
But in a sign of its continued cash flow problems, municipal officials in Changchun said Evergrande has yet to make $28 million payment for land it acquired in the northeastern city earlier this year.
Other Chinese developers have also warned they could default on bond payments, and rising risks on Wednesday led credit rating agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) to downgrade two of the sector's bigger companies, Greenland Holdings - which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers - and E-house. S&P also said it could cut their ratings further.
On Thursday, Fitch Ratings issued the latest downgrade, cutting Modern Land (China) Co to a single-C rating after the developer said it was seeking consent from investors to extend a bond's maturity date by three months. 
Investors have been hoping China would ease monetary policy to stabilise its wobbly recovery, but data on Thursday showed China's annual factory gate prices rising at the fastest pace on record in September due to soaring raw material costs.
Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said persistent inflationary pressure would limit the scope of any monetary policy easing.
""But the most important policy in the property sector is not monetary policy, but the regulation related to leverage and bank loan supply to developers (and) home buyers,"" he said.
""Therefore I think the government still has the option to loosen those policies to help the property sector,"" Zhang said.
""The big question is whether they are willing to do so. So far their policy stance seems quite firm.""
On Thursday, a sub-index tracking shares of Chinese property developers ended the day down 3.88%, while the broad CSI300 blue-chip index slipped 0.54%. Property shares have fallen nearly 20% this year, compared with a 5.7% fall for the CSI300.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said China property shares would remain volatile in the near term. 
""News on marginal easing will likely cause a short-term rebound, which, however, may not be very sustainable due to the likely ongoing concerns on the offshore bond market,"" they said.
""A more sustainable rally may happen in January 2022 when banks have more front-loaded quota to extend credit to developers/mortgages."" 
Graphic: China property share index https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gdpzywdymvw/image-1634186092929.png 
LIGHTNING RODS
In China's onshore bond market there was still a lot of price volatility, with bonds of developer Shanghai Shimao listed among both the biggest gainers and biggest losers on the day by the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
""Property bonds are lightning rods,"" said a director at a local brokerage. Apart from the risk of debt contagion from Evergrande, higher mortgage rates - part of official efforts to rein in surging housing prices - are hitting the industry, he said. ""Fundamentally, the high turnover of real estate companies is gone.""
In international debt markets, data provider Duration Finance showed Greenland Group Holdings' 6.75% June 2022 bond was trading down more than 3 points at 60.175 cents, and Xinyuan Real Estate's 14.5% September 2023 bond slumped nearly 8 points to 63.9 cents.
Markets in Hong Kong were closed on Thursday for a public holiday.
Worries about the potential for spillover of credit risk from China's property sector into the broader global economy kept the spread - or risk premium - on investment-grade Chinese companies, which tend to have the most solid finances, near its widest in more than two months late on Wednesday. 

The spread on the equivalent high-yield or junk-rated index that tracks companies such as Evergrande pulled back on Wednesday, but remained close to all-time highs.

Investing.com – Publicis stock (PA:PUBP) traded 3% higher in Paris as the advertising giant raised its annual forecast again after all its markets grew in double-digits in the third quarter.
The company said organic growth for the year is now seen in the 8.5%-9% range compared to the 7% as per previous forecast. Operating margin is expected to top 17%. The company upgraded guidance for all its key performance indicators.
The fresh guidance comes as corporate profits have expanded, allowing companies to increase their discretionary spending to attract more consumers.
Publicis’ U.S., Europe and Asia markets all grew between 10% and 12.5% in the third quarter. This was owing to large and prestigious client wins like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Ferrero, Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) and TD Bank (TSX:TD).
“Q3 has been a busy quarter,"" the company said.
Publicis’ net revenue in the third quarter was 2.62 billion euro ($3.03 billion), up 12% on-year.
Compared to 2019, while organic growth in Europe and Latin America was flat, North America, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa grew. In the U.S., both digital and traditional media expanded.

Evergrande bought the land through local developer Changchun Jitao Real Estate Development Co for 601 million yuan ($93 million) in an auction on June 17, part of a series of coordinated sales by 22 of China's biggest cities. 
Evergrande, which did not respond to a Reuters request for comment, has been strapped for cash with over $300 billion in liabilities. 
It failed to pay nearly $150 million worth of coupons on three bonds due on Monday, after missing two other bond payments in September.
The local developer paid a deposit of 120.3 million yuan but has yet to fully make the next round of payment equal to 50% of the transaction price, the Changchun Natural Resources and Planning Bureau said in a statement to Reuters when asked to confirm the sale. 
Changchun Jitao Real Estate was required to pay the 50% within 30 days of the sale, but has only paid 20%, the bureau said in a faxed statement. 
It still owes about 180 million yuan ($28 million), Reuters calculations show. 
Changchun Jitao Real Estate has been urged to make the 50% payment in full, the bureau said in a statement dated Oct. 11. 
Payment for the rest of the deal is not due yet, it said. 

The plot of land, measuring 116,519 sq m (28.8 acres), is the only piece of land that Evergrande has bought this year in auctions conducted by 22 cities, which include Beijing and Shanghai, according to a Reuters analysis of public notices.

Investing.com – Taiwan Semiconductor stock (NYSE:TSM) traded 2.7% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the chipmaker lifted its annual forecast after another strong quarter for its chip-making factories.
The company raised its revenue growth forecast for 2021 to about 24% compared to its previous estimate of above 20%, citing sustained strong demand from various consumer industries.
The world’s largest contract manufacturer of chips said it expects revenue of as much as $15.7 billion in the three months ended December. Gross margin could come in as high as 53%, it said
TSMC supplies components to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well. Demand for its chips that go into cars, mobiles, laptops and gadgets of various hues has been at a historic high for more than a year due to a confluence of factors.
The pandemic has driven a combination of work-from-home and work-from-office lifestyle, leading corporates and individuals to equip their rooms with more devices.
While demand has boomed, supplies have remained constrained,not least because factories in China, Vietnam and other southeast Asian hubs have been shut for extended periods to contain the spread of the virus.
Such shortages are making themselves felt even for the biggest buyers. Apple is preparing to cut shipments of its new iPhone 13 by 10% due to component shortages, Bloomberg reported this week. In Europe on Thursday, industrial group CNH said it would shut several of its European agricultural, commercial vehicle and powertrain manufacturing facilities temporarily due to the same factors.
“We expect TSMC’s capacity to remain very tight in 2021 and throughout 2022,” Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said on a conference call, according to Bloomberg.
The company’s third-quarter net profit jumped about 14% to T$156.25 billion ($5.6 billion), beating expectations. Net sales climbed around 16% to T$414.67 billion, falling just short of estimates."

LONDON (Reuters) - The era of breakneck growth for electric scooter firms is giving way to more selective expansion focused on profits as they face tougher regulations, more demanding customers and wary insurers.
Hurt badly by global coronavirus lockdowns last year, companies offering by-the-minute rental of e-scooters say ridership is soaring to pre-COVID 19 levels among urban consumers eager to avoid public transport or taxis.
But that doesn't mean the app-based industry is returning to the free-wheeling, pre-pandemic world where ""micromobility"" firms were loosely regulated and raked in money from investors. 
Scooter firms now face cities that are using licensing to limit the number of operators, consumers demanding better software and vehicles, and insurers leery of safety risks. 
This is forcing up costs and will push the low-margin industry towards further consolidation. Some smaller providers have already been snapped up, including Boston-based Zagster, bought by transport technology company Superpedestrian in 2020, and San Franciso-based Scoot, taken over by Bird Rides in 2019. 
""It really takes scale to get the economics to work,"" says Travis VanderZanden, CEO of Santa Monica-based Bird, which is due to go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Switchback II Corp. ""So I think we're going to see some of the smaller players fall by the wayside.""
Bird is a global player that expects revenue to double in 2021 from a pandemic-hit 2020, and then double again to $400 million in 2022. That is still small compared to a car-based ride hailing company such as Uber (NYSE:UBER), which had gross revenues of $4.1 billion in 2019.
Bird's planned merger - which will go to a Switchback II shareholder vote on Nov. 2 - values the company at $2.3 billion, about 20% below its January 2020 price tag, according to startup data platform PitchBook. Lime, also a global player, saw its valuation fall nearly 80% during a June 2020 funding round from one less than a year earlier. 
While the pandemic battered valuations at the top, an analysis by Reuters found it also cut off funding for many smaller e-scooter providers.
""There are a lot of companies that can't invest in hardware, can't invest in safety features and can't invest in training,"" says Wayne Ting, CEO of Lime, whose investors include Uber. Lime acquired Uber's micromobility unit Jump.
The current environment is a far cry from 2017 when electric scooters accessed through smartphone apps first appeared in large numbers. A flood of new providers created ""Wild West competitions"" as predominantly European cities hosted unlimited numbers of vendors, said Candice Xie, CEO of Chicago-based Veo, which operates in more than 40 U.S. cities. 
""A lot of companies raced to the bottom in order to get market share,"" she said. 
Vehicles were dumped on streets from Detroit to Paris, and the term ""scooter blight"" was born. 
Early rental scooters ""were consumer grade and not built for a high level of utilization,"" said Voi Scooters CEO Fredrik Hjelm. Stockholm-based Voi operates nearly 100,000 scooters across western Europe. 
NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN
Now, cities and countries have tightened regulations, creating tough bidding processes for licences aimed at limiting the number of scooter providers.
Copenhagen temporarily ejected all scooter providers earlier this year while it rewrites its regulations. 
Some U.S. cities, including Columbia, Missouri, and Winston-Salem in North Carolina, have allowed e-scooter providers to return with more oversight after expelling them.
Large scooter providers say awarding licences to a few major players with track records guarantees better service and allows them to operate larger fleets profitably.
""This has become a game of slim margins and scaling up,"" said Voi's Hjelm. ""And it's far better to have fewer operators with greater density."" 
Britain has launched trial projects for e-scooter providers in certain cities - but with speed restrictions, and users must have a driver's licence.
""We're determined to make sure safety is at the core of our trial and that it works for everyone,"" said Helen Sharp (OTC:SHCAY), head of Transport for London's e-scooter trial for three operators: Lime, Tier and Dott.
To meet London requirements, Berlin-based Tier has developed software to stop its scooters accessing certain busy roads. 
""You might just be able to push it, but it wouldn't be easy,"" said Tier's UK and Ireland head of cities, Georgia Yexley.
But better scooters and software drive up costs. 
Fred Jones, Tier's regional general manager for northern Europe, said the company's scooters can now last five years and have 83 replaceable components to extend their lifespan. 
""That costs a lot, not just the scooter, but the parts and skilled labour to service them,"" Jones said. ""If you don't get that right, the economics won't work.""
Ensuring they do is key for funding.
Silicon Valley venture capital firm Autotech Ventures avoided micromobility firms until this year when it bought into Chicago's Veo and another unidentified firm.
""Veo has taken a disciplined approach to growth, achieving impressive unit economics and much higher profitability than virtually all of its peers,"" said AutoTech Ventures managing director Dan Hoffer.
According to PitchBook, in the first half of 2021 venture capital deal activity in the micromobility sector fell to $1.4 billion from $4.6 billion in the same period in 2020.
WARY INSURERS 
Another problem for would-be e-scooter providers is insurers see e-scooters as inherently more dangerous than bikes or cars. ""Riders are particularly vulnerable, more so than cyclists,"" said Martin Smith, technical claims manager for motor at  Aviva  (LON:AV), a large UK insurer that does not cover e-scooters. 
Regular motor insurers such as AXA UK, Admiral and Unipolsai also avoid e-scooter providers, leaving them to specialist players, such as Zego. Bird CEO VanderZanden said to get lower insurance rates it uses data from the 300 cities it operates in globally, highlighting the benefits of scale. 

It has also added physical safety features like a double brake and developed software to boot irresponsible riders off its service - all running on its own operating system.
""Having amazing vehicles is one thing,"" VanderZanden said. ""But you need data to show insurance companies to make this work.""

408,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 05:17AM ET</span>","TSMC announces chip plant in Japan, flags 'tight' capacity throughout 2022","By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan chip giant TSMC announced on Thursday plans to build a new factory in Japan to meet long-term appetite for chips and said, near-term, tight supplies will likely continue into 2022 amid booming demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), said it would set up a chip plant in Japan that will use older chipmaking technology, a segment currently under a severe supply shortage due to robust demand from automakers and tech companies. But production from the plant is only likely to begin by late 2024.
The company and Taiwan in general have become central in efforts to resolve a pandemic-induced global chip shortage, which has forced automakers to cut production and hurt manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and consumer appliances. 
""TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading edge and speciality technologies to support their demand,"" Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, after the company posted higher-than-expected profits in the third quarter.
He said the expansion plan in Japan was pending approval from the company's board and declined to disclose details such as expenditure and capacity.
TSMC posted a net profit of T$156.3 billion ($5.56 billion) in July-September, well above the T$149 billion average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. That was 13.8% higher than the same period of last year. 
Advanced chips made by TSMC, formally known as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, are used in everything from high-end smartphones like Apple's newly unveiled 5G iPhone 13, to artificial intelligence, cars and a wide variety of lower-end consumer goods.
Wei said TSMC's capacity will remain ""tight"" this year and throughout 2022, adding its chip pricing will ""remain strategic not opportunistic to reflex our value creation"".
""Our third quarter business was mainly supported by strong demand across all four growth platforms,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said, referring to strong chip demand including those for smartphones, cars and ""Internet of Things"" - the concept of connecting household devices to the Internet.
""Moving into fourth quarter 2021, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5 nanometre technology."" 
The company lifted its revenue growth forecast for 2021 to about 24%, versus an earlier forecast of above 20%, citing an ""industry megatrend"" of strong chip demand. 
Wei said the company has entered a period of ""higher structural growth"" and set a long-term target of ""50% and higher"" for its gross margins. 
TSMC's revenue for the quarter climbed 22.6% to $14.88 billion, in line with the company's prior estimated range of $14.6 billion to $14.9 billion.
For the quarter ending in December, TSMC forecast revenue of $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion, compared with $12.68 billion in the same period a year earlier. 
TSMC shares have risen about 8.5% so far this year, giving the company a market value of $526.3 billion, more than double that of competitor and client  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).

They closed up 0.4% on Thursday, broadly in line with a 0.2% rise in the broader market.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 03:12AM ET</span>",Marketmind: No escaping the inflation beast,"A look at the day ahead from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
It doesn't seem to matter where you look these days, that long asleep beast - inflation - is clearly wide awake.
Data on Thursday showed China's factory gate prices grew at their fastest pace on record in September, a day after figures showed another solid increase in U.S. consumer prices.
The take away from markets is that transitory or not, central banks are likely to respond to higher inflation sooner rather than later.
And with minutes from last month's Federal Reserve meeting showing policymakers' growing concern about inflation, investors have again brought forward rate-hike expectations.
Fed Funds futures have pulled forward expectations for the first hike from late in 2022 to almost fully price a 25 basis point hike by September.
In addition, money market pricing suggests the Bank of England could move before year-end, the cautious European Central Bank could tighten next year and the overtly dovish Reserve Bank of Australia could raise rates by end-2023 -- a trajectory that doesn't gel with the central bank's guidance.
Singapore's central bank on Thursday unexpectedly tightened monetary policy, citing forecasts for higher inflation.
Markets, having priced in higher inflation and a tighter monetary policy outlook, appear to be in a calmer mood in early Europe. Asian shares rallied overnight, European and U.S. stock futures are higher too. U.S. Treasury yields, while a touch higher, are holding below recent multi-month highs. 
Still, China property shares fell as investors fretted about a debt crisis in the sector.
The Turkish lira, at record lows versus the dollar, is also in the spotlight after Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan dismissed three central bank officials. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
- BOJ policymaker rules out stimulus withdrawal even after economy recovers
- Taiwan's TSMC posts 13.8% rise in Q3 profit on global chip demand surge
- Japan dissolves parliament, setting stage for general election
- Data: Spain harmonized inflation rate(Sept), Canada manufacturing sales (Aug)
- United States: Initial Jobless Claims (Oct), Jobless Claims 4-week Average, PPI (Sept), NY Fed Treasury Purchases 22.5 to 30 years, 4-week and 8-week T-Bill Auction

414,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 03:12AM ET</span>",Telstra and Australian govt finalising bid for Digicel's Pacific assets -sources,"By Colin Packham and Paulina Duran
CANBERRA/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) Corp Ltd is close to completing a deal to buy the Pacific operations of telecommunications firm Digicel Group in partnership with the Australian government, two sources familiar with the bid told Reuters on Thursday.
Telstra said in July it was in talks to buy the Pacific business in a deal that would see Australia contribute the bulk of the funding - a plan widely viewed as a political move to block China's influence in the region.
""It is fairly imminent. I can't put a timetable on it but the deal is almost done,"" said an Australian government source. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to talk about the deal.
Digicel, founded by Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien, is the largest mobile phone carrier in the Pacific with operations in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and Tahiti - the most lucrative being those in Papua New Guinea.
Australian broadcaster Nine Entertainment has previously reported that Telstra will spend between A$200 million and A$300 million of its money and the government will contribute A$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion).
A Telstra spokesperson declined to comment. Telstra's CEO Andrew Penn last month told investors that any outlay from the company would likely be limited to the ""low hundreds of millions"".
Digicel last year denied an Australian newspaper report it was considering a sale of its Pacific business to state-owned China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd.
A sale to a Chinese company would be a cause of concern for the Australian government amid strategic competition between U.S. allies and China in the Pacific region.
Australia has ramped up its presence in the Pacific through the creation of a A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) infrastructure financing facility and via its membership of the Quad group - which includes the United States, India and Japan - to counter China's expanding interests in the Indo-Pacific.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2021 03:00AM ET</span>",Chinese tech workers disclose working hours in criticism of '996',"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A campaign calling on workers at Chinese tech companies and other high-profile firms to log their working hours on a public internet page has gone viral, in the latest backlash against a culture of overtime.
Organised by four anonymous creators who described themselves as recent graduates, the ""Worker Lives Matter"" campaign calls on employees at tech firms to enter their company name, position, and working hours in a spreadsheet posted on GitHub. 
As of Thursday morning, more than 4,000 people who said they worked at tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd and ByteDance had registered their data.
Employees have since also created separate spreadsheets for specific sectors such as real estate, finance, and foreign companies. 
A majority of the entries on the spreadsheet show that while a five-day week is the norm, many staffers work 10 to 12 hours a day.
One of the creators said in a post that they hoped the list would be an effective reference tool for workers when choosing jobs. 
In another post, the team argued that the ""996"" practice of working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week was rife and working hours were at internet firms were often opaque.
""We hope to make a contribution to the boycott of '996' and the popularization of '955',"" said one of the creators on China's question-and-answer site Zhihu in a post viewed 6 million times. ""955"" mean 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week. 
Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Long work hours are a hot topic for China's tech workers and others among the young, white-collar class.
The issue first gained attention in 2019, when tech workers launched a similar online campaign against ""996"". 

In recent months, criticism of long hours has gained traction because of a government crackdown on tech companies that has shone a spotlight on their treatment of workers.
This year, companies including TikTok owner ByteDance, short video platform Kuaishou and food delivery giant Meituan have cut compulsory weekend overtime. China's top court in August described ""996"" as illegal.

Earlier this month, the world's largest farm equipment maker and the UAW union reached an agreement after weeks of negotiation on wages and other benefits, but 90% of the union's workers voted against the deal.
The tentative deal covered about 10,000 production and maintenance employees across 14 facilities in the United States.
""Pickets have been set up, and our members are organized and ready to hold out and fight for a contract they believe meets their needs,"" Ron McInroy, director of UAW Region 4, said on Thursday.
Separately, Deere said it remained committed to reaching a new agreement, adding that it had not yet estimated when it would complete negotiations.
The now-rejected offer would have given 5% wage hikes for some workers and 6% for some others. The proposed deal had also called for 3% raises in 2023 and 2025.
The workers understand that they had to make concessions on some benefits in the past and now they want to get some of it back at a time when Deere is doing ""very well financially"" and labor shortages persist industry-wide, a source familiar with the talks told Reuters.
Deere, which has about 27,500 employees in the United States and Canada, had earlier said its operations would continue as normal.
The strike is set to take place in the middle of the U.S. corn and soybean harvest season, at a time when farmers are struggling to find parts for tractors and combines.

The last strike against Deere by the UAW was in 1986 when workers sat out for 163 days.
The company, due to report full-year results late November, has forecast a record net income of $5.7 billion to $5.9 billion.

(Reuters) - French advertising group Publicis raised its outlook for 2021 on Thursday as a global shift towards digital media and e-commence helped its third-quarter organic growth exceed market expectations.
Demand for digital advertising helped Publicis, which has sought to attract new customers by promising targeted campaigns based on large pools of data, return to organic growth this year for the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic.
Publicis, home to ad agencies such as Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi, said it had also benefited from new business wins during the third quarter, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT).
The world's third-largest advertising group behind Britain's WPP (LON:WPP) and U.S.-based Omnicom now expects organic growth of 8.5% to 9% this year, up from a previous 7% forecast.
""The continued outperformance of our data and tech capabilities once again demonstrated our ability to capture a disproportionate share of the shift in client investment towards digital media, commerce and DTC (direct-to-consumer),"" Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun said in a statement.
Its digital business Sapient reported 20% organic growth in the United States, which is Publicis' biggest market and the source of more than half of its revenues, with data company Epsilon 13% above last year's level.
""Epsilon's potential for development outside the U.S. is very interesting,"" Sadoun told reporters when asked about the unit's dependency on its home market.
""We have a small base today (internationally), between 5 and 8% of revenues ... but this base is already growing at 40% over the first nine months.""
Underlying sales in the United States grew by 10.9% in the quarter, while Asia-Pacific posted 12.5% growth. Sales in Europe rose by 10% from last year and regained pre-pandemic levels.
At group level, underlying sales rose by 11.2% to 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion) in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, and exceeded 2019 levels by 5%.

Analysts had expected organic growth of 7.8% for the quarter, a company-provided consensus forecast showed.

(Reuters) - People who got Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine as a first shot had a stronger immune response when boosted with vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc/BioNTech SE or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, a study run by the National Institutes of Health showed on Wednesday.
The study, which is preliminary and hasn't been peer reviewed, is the latest challenge to J&J's efforts to use its COVID-19 vaccine as a booster in the United States. 
The study, which included more than 450 adults who received initial shots from Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson, showed that ""mixing and matching"" booster shots of different types is safe in adults. Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are based on messenger RNA while J&J's uses viral vector technology.
It comes as an advisory group to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is preparing to meet later this week to discuss the merits of a booster shot for Moderna and J&J vaccines. 
FDA officials on Wednesday said J&J's regulatory submission for its planned booster raised red flags including small sample sizes and data based on tests that had not been validated.
U.S. health officials have been under pressure to offer advice on booster doses of the J&J and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines after the White House announced in August it planned to roll out boosters beginning last month for most adults.
The NIH study contrasted the safety and immune response of volunteers who were boosted with the same type of shot they had been given for their initial vaccination with those who received a different type of shot as a booster.
Mixing and matching doses for a booster produced similar side effects to those seen in primary inoculations and raised no significant safety concerns, the study said. 
The study of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the United States showed that using different types of shots as boosters generally appeared to produce a comparable or higher antibody response than using the same type.

The trial took place in 10 U.S. cities and used a total of nine combinations of initial shots and boosters.
Mixing booster doses ""may offer immunological advantages to optimize the breadth and longevity of protection achieved with currently available vaccines,"" researchers wrote in the study.

The announcement comes as the administration is looking to bolster the nascent industry as part of a plan to address climate change by decarbonizing the power sector by 2035.
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the division of the Interior Department that oversees offshore wind permitting, will hold up to seven lease sales by 2025 in the Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Mexico, and off the coasts of California, the Carolinas and Oregon, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said during a speech at an industry event in Boston. 
The administration is also pursuing sales in the New York Bight, an area of shallow waters between New Jersey and Long Island, New York, and the Central Atlantic. Thus far most offshore wind leases have been issued for waters off the coast of Northeastern states.
""I look so forward to our future together and to making so much progress that we will be unstoppable,"" Haaland said at the American Clean Power Association's wind energy conference.
President Joe Biden earlier this year set a goal to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy -- enough to power 10 million homes -- by 2030. BOEM aims to review at least 16 offshore wind project plans by 2025.

That build-out would be extremely quick for a nation that only permitted its first commercial-scale offshore wind farm this year.
In her speech, Haaland said the administration would make a decision in the coming weeks about what would be the nation's second major project, Orsted (OTC:DOGEF)'s South Fork wind farm in waters between Rhode Island and Long Island.

The announcement came after a media report said the British drugmaker's vaccine, Vaxzevria, will no longer be manufactured in Australia due to demand for vaccines of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). [nL4N2R91XR]
Pfizer and Moderna have established a market dominance by using mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine technology to fight the pandemic.

CSL, in a brief statement, added that more than 20 million of the doses have already been produced, and it is expected that the remaining production will be completed early next year.
Cafes, gyms and restaurants in Sydney welcomed back fully vaccinated customers earlier this week after nearly four months of a lockdown, as Australia aims to begin living with the coronavirus and gradually reopen with high rates of inoculation.

If no agreement is reached by 12:01 a.m. PDT on Oct. 18, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) which represents some 60,000 off-screen workers, including camera operators and make-up artists, will launch a work stoppage threatening to devastate major studios, IATSE President Matthew Loeb said.
In the hopes of reaching an agreement on a new contract before the Monday strike deadline, the union will continue bargaining with producers this week on issues such as reasonable rest periods, meal breaks, and pay increases for those at the bottom of the wage scale, Loeb said.
“However, the pace of bargaining doesn’t reflect any sense of urgency,” Loeb said in a statement. “Without an end date, we could keep talking forever. Our members deserve to have their basic needs addressed now.” 
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) said studios were working hard to negotiate a deal to keep alive the industry that has provided an at-home entertainment escape for so many people working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There are five days left to reach a deal, and the studios will continue to negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement for a new contract that will keep the industry working,"" Jarryd Gonzales, an AMPTP spokesman, said in a statement.Last week, 90% of IATSE members cast ballots and more than 98% of the votes returned were in favor of authorizing a strike. 
The union wants to reduce working hours that can stretch to about 14 hours a day as the demand for TV shows and films has increased, particularly for streaming platforms such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) , Disney+, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Video.

It seeks higher pay for workers on streaming projects, who get paid less than for work on mainstream and cable TV shows under an agreement signed in 2009, in the early days of streaming and online media.
During the most recent major strike in Hollywood - by film and television screenwriters for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 - all scripted shows were forced to shut down and television networks ran re-runs of comedies and dramas.

(Reuters) -Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Wednesday reported lower support than usual for two directors at its recent shareholder meeting, and greater support for a call to review the company's use of mandatory arbitration after a court decision in favor of a temporary employee who accused Tesla of racial discrimination.
The votes indicated growing shareholder dissatisfaction at the company.
In a securities filing Tesla said support for a shareholder resolution on how it handles arbitration matters rose to 46% of votes cast at its annual meeting last week, from 27% for a similar proposal in 2020. Both directors up for election this year also received less support than any did last year.
The nonbinding resolution on arbitration had asked Tesla's board to study the impact of its use of mandatory arbitration to resolve workplace complaints of harassment and discrimination. The issue drew more focus after a jury award of $137 million to a Tesla contract worker last week over workplace racism.
Tesla had opposed the resolution, arguing arbitration can benefit both parties of a dispute. The company did not immediately comment on the shareholder vote.
Other technology companies have scaled back or eliminated mandatory arbitration including Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. In April, nearly half of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) shareholders voted in favor of examining the bank's use of mandatory arbitration.
Kristin Hull, CEO of Nia Impact Capital who filed the resolution, called the higher support this year ""a huge improvement as we educate folks on why this matters for building an innovative team with a diverse and inclusive company culture.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk owns 23% of Tesla's shares, according to its proxy statement, meaning the measure would have passed aside from his votes, Hull said. 
Another measure tied to racial issues won a majority of support, with 57% of votes cast. Filed by Calvert Research and Management the measure asked Tesla to report in detail on its diversity and inclusion efforts. Tesla had opposed the measure, citing current and future reporting plans.

Wednesday's filing showed among the two company directors up for re-election last week, James Murdoch received support from 70% of votes cast, and Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, received support from 80% of votes cast. 
Directors at large U.S. companies typically receive 90% support or more. At Tesla, ""the director nominees in question should do some heavy thinking about the quality of their oversight and how they/the company can better communicate that to the market,"" said corporate governance consultant Francis Byrd of Alchemy Strategies Partners.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended higher on Wednesday, led by gains in shares of big growth names like Amazon.com and Microsoft, but JPMorgan shares fell along with other bank shares and weighed on the market.
The S&P 500 briefly added to gains following the release of minutes from the September Federal Reserve policy meeting.
U.S. central bankers signaled they could start reducing crisis-era support for the economy in mid-November, though they remained divided over how much of a threat high inflation poses and how soon they may need to raise interest rates, the minutes showed.
Earlier, a Labor Department report showed consumer prices increased solidly in September, further strengthening the case for a Fed interest-rate hike.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) fell 2.6% even though JPMorgan's third-quarter earnings beat expectations, helped by global dealmaking boom and release of more loan loss reserves.

(Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Wednesday pushed to ease supply chain logjams that are threatening the all-important U.S. holiday shopping season.
A port in Los Angeles will join Long Beach, California, to expand around-the-clock operations, the White House said. 
Consumer goods makers, delivery companies and retailers - which make most of their annual revenue in the last quarter of the year - put their weight behind the shift, meeting virtually with Biden and promising stepped-up operations. 
Attendees included top executives from Walmart,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS, Samsung  and  Home Depot. 
WALMART
The world's biggest retailer said it would increase its use of nighttime hours at the ports significantly and estimated that it could increase throughput by as much as 50% over the next several weeks. 
""As the ports move towards 24/7 operations, that’s just going to help increase our overall effectiveness and increase the volume of merchandise that we can move through those ports and get to customers,"" a spokesman said. 
TARGET
Target, which moves about half its shipping containers at night, has committed to increasing that amount by 10% during the next 90 days to help ease congestion at the ports
The big-box retailer said it ""fully supports investments to increase efficiency at our nation’s ports,"" including expanding infrastructure and increasing data sharing across industries to help with port traffic control. 
HOME DEPOT 
The company said it plans to ship up to 10% additional containers per week during the newly available off-peak port hours at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
SAMSUNG
Samsung (KS:005930) said it would ship nearly 60% more containers out of these ports by operating 24/7 through the next 90 days.
UPS
Delivery company UPS said it would increase its use of 24/7 operations and enhanced data sharing with the ports, which could allow it to move up to 20% more containers from the ports.
FEDEX

FedEx said it would combine an increase in nighttime hours with changes to trucking and rail use to increase the volume of containers it will move from the ports. 
The company said the changes could double the volume of cargo it moves out of the ports at night.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>","Volkswagen CEO warns a delay in shift to electric vehicles could cost 30,000 jobs - sources","By Ilona Wissenbach
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s CEO Herbert Diess told a supervisory board meeting in September that the company could lose 30,000 jobs if it transitioned too slowly to electric vehicles (EVs), two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Competition from new entrants to Germany's market, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), has pushed the company to speed up its transformation, Diess is said to have told attendees. 
The U.S. EV maker plans to produce 500,000 cars a year in Germany with 12,000 employees, while Volkswagen's 25,000 produce just 700,000 cars at its Wolfsburg plant.
A company spokesperson confirmed Diess' position that Tesla and others' presence in Germany heightened the urgency of transitioning to EVs, but denied that specific calculations had been made on how many jobs could be lost in the process.
""There is no question that we have to address the competitiveness of our plant in Wolfsburg in view of new market entrants,"" Volkswagen spokesperson Michael Manske said, pointing to Tesla and new Chinese automakers making inroads into Europe. 
""Tesla is setting new standards for productivity and scale in Grunheide,"" he said, referring to a Tesla factory under construction near Berlin which at peak capacity will produce 5,000 to 10,000 cars a week - more than twice the German battery-electric vehicle (EV) production in 2020.
""A debate is now underway and there are already many good ideas. There are no concrete scenarios,"" Manske said.
The statement by Diess was first reported by Handelsblatt.
A spokesperson for Volkswagen's workers' council said that while they would not comment on whether Diess made the remarks, ""a reduction of 30,000 jobs is absurd and baseless"". 
Another union spokesperson from the region of Lower-Saxony, which is Volkswagen's second-largest shareholder, said such cuts were ""out of the question"". 
EVs have far fewer parts than an internal combustion engine car and so require fewer workers to produce. According to one estimate, 100,000 jobs in the German autos industry could be lost by 2025 as a result of electrification.
Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant, the world's largest with over 50,000 employees, does not currently make EVs, but the company plans to produce an electric sedan there from 2026 under a plan named ""Project Trinity"".
Diess has previously said Tesla would fuel competition in Germany.
The German autos giant is also considering listing its car charging and energy business in addition to existing IPO plans for its battery division, Chief Technology Officer Thomas Schmall told Manager Magazin in an interview published on Wednesday.

Schmall said nothing had been decided yet and it would probably take up to two years before the new companies were established and ready for the stock market.
(This story corrects headline to show that delaying shift to EVs would cost jobs, not that shifting to EVs would cost jobs.)

Avoro Capital, which owns 7% of Acceleron stock, had also shared that view on Merck's $11.5 billion bid for the company.
""A transaction now, at this price, is not compelling ... (the offer) does not compensate XLRN shareholders adequately, given Acceleron's strong pipeline and attractive long-term business prospects,"" Holocene said in a statement on Wednesday.
The deal would give Merck access to Acceleron's rare disease drug candidate, sotatercept, which the company expects could bring in billions of dollars in sales.
Merck did not respond to requests for comment.
Acceleron, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it fully supported the offer and there had been no further negotiation after it was accepted. 
""We are currently on track to achieve more than 50% shares being tendered as part of this tender period,"" said Todd James, Acceleron senior vice president, corporate affairs and investor relations, on a call with Reuters, noting that just over half of outstanding shares need to be tendered for deals to close.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Wednesday in choppy trade as investors saw an imminent end to ultra-loose U.S. monetary policy as a vote of confidence in the economy, while two-year Treasury yields hit 18-month highs on bets that policy tightening is in the offing.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve signalled on Wednesday it could start reducing its crisis-era support for the U.S. economy - which is set to grow this year at its fastest pace in decades - by the middle of next month, with a growing number of policymakers worried that high inflation could persist longer than previously thought.
General optimism about economic growth helped the S&P 500 to reverse losses late in the day to gain 0.30%, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.70% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.48%. 
Figures earlier had showed the U.S. consumer price index rising 0.4% last month, higher than an expected 0.3%, as Americans paid more for food, rent and a range of other goods, and highlighting the challenges of strained supply chains.
While some investors have worried that accelerating inflation that is compounded by soaring oil prices could retard economic growth and cause it to stagnate, sparking 'stagflation', analysts at JPMorgan argued on Wednesday that such fears were ""overblown.""
""Persistent inflation suggests we remain in a hot economy, which could prompt the Fed to move sooner,"" analysts from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said in a note.
""Historically, equity markets did well in periods of oil price increases, in particular those periods that followed a crisis,"" the analysts said. They recommended that investors allocate more cash to shares in the energy, materials, industrial and financial sectors relative to other investments.
Bets of tighter monetary policy flattened the U.S. yield curve.
The two-year Treasury yield jumped to 0.394%, a level last seen March 2020, before receding to 0.36%. Benchmark 10-year yields declined to 1.5403%, from 1.58% late on Tuesday. 
That left the spread between 10-year and two-year Treasury yields at around 118 basis points, the lowest in over two weeks.
A flatter yield curve dents banks' profitability and weighed on bank shares. 
Shares in JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) dropped 2.6% for the day despite better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.
The dollar, which has benefited from bets that tighter U.S. monetary policy would burnish its appeal as a higher-yielding currency, took a breather on Wednesday.
The dollar index fell 0.42% to 94.033 from a one-year high of 94.563 struck the previous day. A softer dollar helped the euro to jump 0.56% off a near 15-month low to $1.15945.
The Japanese yen, which has hovered at a three-year low against the dollar, also bounced back, rising 0.23% to 113.27 per dollar. 
Oil prices, which have been on a tear, also paused their rally, as some investors questioned whether inflation and other supply chain issues will crimp economic growth and ultimately energy demand.
U.S. crude fell 0.15% to $80.52 per barrel and Brent was at $83.27, down 0.18% on the day. 

Gold, usually seen as a hedge against inflation, shone as a softer dollar added to its strength.
Spot gold jumped 1.9% to $1,792.91 an ounce. U.S. gold futures climbed 1.92% to $1,792.00 an ounce.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) will now count activists and journalists as ""involuntary"" public figures and so increase protections against harassment and bullying targeted at these groups, its global safety chief said in an interview this week.
The social media company, which allows more critical commentary of public figures than of private individuals, is changing its approach on the harassment of journalists and ""human rights defenders,"" who it says are in the public eye due to their work rather than their public personas.
Facebook is under wide-ranging scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators over its content moderation practices and harms linked to its platforms, with internal documents leaked by a whistleblower forming the basis for a U.S. Senate hearing last week.
How Facebook, which has about 2.8 billion monthly active users, treats public figures and content posted by or about those figures has been an area of intense debate. In recent weeks, the company's ""cross check"" system, which the Wall Street Journal reported has the effect of exempting some high-profile users from usual Facebook rules, has been in the spotlight.
Facebook also differentiates between public figures and private individuals in the protections it affords around online discussion: for instance, users are generally allowed to call for the death of a celebrity in discussions on the platform, as long as they do not tag or directly mention the celebrity. They cannot call for the death of a private individual, or now a journalist, under Facebook's policies.
The company declined to share a list of other involuntary public figures but said they are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Earlier this year, Facebook said it would remove content celebrating, praising or mocking George Floyd's death, because he was deemed an involuntary public figure.

Facebook's Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis said the company was also expanding the types of attacks that it would not allow on public figures on its sites, as part of an effort to reduce attacks disproportionately faced by women, people of color and the LGBTQ community.
Facebook will no longer allow severe and unwanted sexualizing content, derogatory sexualized photoshopped images or drawings or direct negative attacks on a person's appearance, for example, in comments on a public figure's profile.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:01PM ET</span>","U.S. steelmaker sees prices easing, urges policymakers to keep curbs on imports","By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) -Steel prices, driven to nosebleed highs by surging demand, should start to ""erode"" by the first part of next year as COVID-related supply bottlenecks ease and new domestic production comes online, said Mark Millett, the chief executive of the fourth-largest U.S. steelmaker,  Steel Dynamics  (NASDAQ:STLD) Inc.
But the long-term health of the U.S. industry depends on avoiding a surge of imports, which have driven the downside of past boom-and-bust cycles for steelmakers, he added.
""We’re starting to see inventories rebuild a little and we’re starting to see import volumes pick up a little - so it would be natural to see pricing turn over"" in the first part of 2022, said Millett, who also chairs the Steel Manufacturers Association, the industry's main trade voice in Washington.
Demand for all types of metal plunged early in the pandemic but then recovered far faster and rose to higher levels than anyone expected. Now the focus is shifting to the Biden administration’s ambitious infrastructure plan, which would require large amounts of steel for construction projects and machinery, and create another boon for domestic producers, assuming the metal was purchased from domestic mills.
Price pressures have fanned out through the economy in recent months, impacting everything from food to used cars, as a result of pandemic disruptions. Inflation data for September out on Wednesday showed the annual consumer inflation rate ticking back up to its highest level since 2008, and the supply disruptions have prompted the White House to push the biggest U.S. ports to operate around the clock to ease congestion.
Millett said high steel prices shouldn’t hinder the government infrastructure plan. ""Once an infrastructure bill passes, you don’t suddenly see trillion-dollar projects arrive on your doorstep,"" he said. Instead, he predicts at least a year-long ""ramp-up"" period, which would allow the industry to overcome supply chain disruptions that have magnified shortages and added to pricing pressure.
U.S. producers, including Steel Dynamics and United States Steel (NYSE:X), are building new plants that will open over the next two years and the market will need imports in the future, said Millett, noting that historically the United States has imported steel equivalent to about 20% to 22% of domestic demand. The problem is when imports surge far beyond that, he said.
""When it gets up to 27-28%, and when it comes flooding in, that’s when pricing gets decimated,"" said Millett. ""The industry can’t earn its cost of capital.""
That’s why the industry is pushing to keep trade barriers in place that have helped insulate the domestic market. The United States is currently negotiating with the European Union over limits on imports of metal from that region’s producers.
Millett said the EU hasn’t ""been a major problem historically"" and that he believes the administration is looking at ways to agree on some type of quota that would prevent a ""surge"" of imports. ""As long as they fight hand-in-hand (with the U.S. industry) against the Asian, the Chinese threat, I think we can benefit,"" said Millett.
A steel industry source said the U.S. Trade Representative and the EU were edging closer to a likely agreement that would replace Section 232 tariffs with a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) arrangement that would allow duty-free entry of a set volume of EU steel, with tariffs applied to higher volumes.
The EU's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, has expressed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-eu-metals/eu-ready-to-look-at-north-american-style-metals-arrangement-with-u-s-trade-chief-says-idUSL1N2QU1TV openness to a quota arrangement similar to those that Canada and Mexico have with the United States, but said that a deal is needed by early November. Other EU officials have told Reuters that much depends on the volume of steel allowed duty free into U.S. ports. 
The industry source said that EU negotiators are seeking to base the quota on U.S. import volumes prior to the imposition of the 232 tariffs in 2018, while U.S. negotiators want to base the quotas on lower volumes after the tariffs were imposed. Spokespersons for the USTR and the EU could not immediately be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Union Pacific Corp said on Wednesday it will require its 31,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated under President Joe Biden's executive order requiring that federal contractors mandate vaccines by Dec. 8, except for employees who receive an approved exemption.
""As a federal contractor who ships goods supporting our nation's armed services, ... all employees are required to report their vaccination status or have an approved medical or religious accommodation by the federally mandated deadline,""  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), the top U.S. railroad operator, said in a statement.
Last month, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said it will require nearly all of its 18,000 employees be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Nov. 22.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, another federal contractor, said on Tuesday it will require its 125,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated by Dec. 8.
Major U.S. airlines have said they will also meet the deadline imposed on federal contractors, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp and Alaska Airlines, as has aircraft parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR).
The White House announced the Dec. 8 deadline for employees of federal contractors last month and the requirements are expected to cover millions of employees.
Government contractors International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp have also said they will require all U.S. employees to be vaccinated. The White House is adding clauses to future government contracts mandating inoculations.

The Labor Department separately plans to issue an emergency temporary standard (ETS) requiring employers with more than 100 workers to have them inoculated or tested weekly - a policy expected to cover more than 80 million workers.
The department sent the proposed ETS to the White House regulatory office on Tuesday.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, led by strength in tech amid worries that persistently elevated inflation could dent the recovery just as the Fed's September minutes signaled the taper of bond purchases could get underway as soon as next month. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.73%.
""Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December,"" the Fed minutes showed.
The minutes arrived after Labor Department reported that consumer prices in September rose more than expected.
The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month, above the 0.3% rise in August, and more than estimates of 0.3%. The uptick in consumer prices in September lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 5.4% from 5.3% in August.
Signs that price pressures are beginning to emerge in sticker areas of the economy such as rents and owners' equivalent rents will test the Federal Reserve's ongoing narrative that inflation remains transitory.
""[P]rice pressures are shifting to the stickier components and will make the Fed's 'transitory' thesis more difficult to defend,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
The 10-year inflation breakevens -- a key measure of inflation expectations over the next decade – climbed to 2.53%, the highest since May 2018. A further increase in the pace of the inflation could flip the relationship between bonds and stocks, and pressure the overall market lower. 
""Once [10-year breakevens] go above two and a half percent, stocks and bonds tend to move in the same direction,"" Christoph Schon, Senior Principal, Applied Research at Qontigo, told investing.com in an interview on Wednesday. ""If we were to see a further increase in breakeven inflation rates, then we could see an simultaneous sell off of the stock and bond market continue.""
Financials were the biggest drag on the broader market, paced by a decline the banking stocks as JPMorgan got the third-quarter earnings season underway.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reported Q3 earnings of $3.74 per share on revenue of $29.65 billion, compared with estimates of $2.92 on revenue $29.65 billion. Its shares fell more than 2%.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) also delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 3% higher.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) swung to a profit in the third quarter, but the airline warned that higher fuel costs will hurt fourth-quarter results. It's shares fell nearly 6%.
Energy cut some losses as oil prices recovered from session lows on expectations that demand will continue to strengthen.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was ""quite possible,"" that oil prices could top $100 per barrel.
Megacap tech was supported by fall in Treasury yields, but gains in the overall sector were kept in check by weakness in Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell about 0.5% after Bloomberg reporting, citing unnamed sources, that the tech giant it likely to cut iPhone 13 production by as many as 10 million units amid the ongoing global chip shortage.

Outside China, Amundi - which managed about 1.79 trillion euros ($2.07 trillion) in assets as of June 30 - is also seeing investors cut their exposure to U.S. equity benchmarks such as the S&P500, shifting instead to stocks with strong fundamentals as well as those in the financial sector.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's biggest lender Itau Unibanco Holding SA has lured 10 million consumers to its digital bank iti, tripling its client base since January, a bank executive said in an interview on Wednesday.
Itau's push to gain clients comes as fintechs such as Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc-backed Nubank and General Atlantic's Neon have been adding millions of clients from traditional banks, as well as the unbanked population.
iti's director Joao Araujo said it has targeted clients in regions where Itau has fewer customers, such as states in Brazil's North and Northeast.
""We're perfectly in the game,"" said Araujo, citing competition with newcomers.
The digital bank, which had some 3 million customers at the start of the year, is mainly focused on people in low income brackets who are mostly shunned by traditional lenders in Brazil, which has a population of 213.7 million people.

Roughly 80% of iti's clients are new to Itau, indicating that the digital bank is not cannibalizing the lender's clientele. More than half of iti's consumers are also below 30 years old.
iti launched a physical free-of-charge credit card in March, an item offered by all neobanks in Brazil.

(Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists said on Wednesday they did not receive enough data in time to do their own analysis of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s application for a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, but the agency's review of company studies raised some red flags.
Advisers to the FDA will meet on Oct. 15 to assess the risks and benefits of a booster shot of J&J's vaccine, which is currently given as a single dose.
In its review, FDA scientists repeatedly noted the limitation of small sample sizes of many of the company's studies. 
They noted that data J&J used to support administering a booster six months after the initial shot relied on a test to measure immune response that has not been validated and was possibly not sensitive enough.
That mismatch in assessment tools would make it challenging to make meaningful comparisons with data from the company's larger two-dose booster trial.
Agency scientists also noted that there were insufficient cases of COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant to estimate how effective the vaccine is against the coronavirus mutation now dominant globally in that larger J&J trial evaluating two doses of the vaccine given nearly two months apart. 
U.S. health officials have been under pressure to offer advice on booster doses of the J&J and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 vaccines after the White House announced in August it planned to roll out boosters beginning last month for most adults, pending approvals from the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The FDA and CDC last month signed off on boosters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-65-older-high-risk-2021-09-23 of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for certain high-risk adults, but reviews of the Moderna and J&J shots were delayed until the companies could produce more data.

The FDA on Tuesday released its assessment https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-seeks-covid-19-vaccine-booster-clearance-older-adults-high-risk-2021-10-12 of Moderna's booster application ahead of a meeting of expert advisers on the topic on Thursday. Neither assessment made a recommendation to the panel on whether the data supports use of booster shots.
Independent vaccine experts at the meeting on Friday will hear presentations from the FDA and J&J scientists, and be asked whether company data supports use of a booster dose at least two months after the initial shot. They also will be asked to assess whether a J&J booster given six months after the first shot may result in a more robust immune response.

At the time of writing, Progenity shares are trading at $2.10. They initially rose to a high of $2.49 earlier in the session, retracing soon after.
The biotechnology firm said the patents relate to its ingestible technologies for the delivery of therapeutics through the gastrointestinal tract.
The first patent is named “Ingestible device for delivery of therapeutic agent to the gastrointestinal tract,” and is regarding techniques and devices for delivering a therapeutic agent into gastrointestinal tissue.
The second patent is to treat inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. 
Additionally, it received a third patent entitled “Treatment of a disease of the gastrointestinal tract with a SMAD7 inhibitor,” and a fourth under the title of “Treatment of a disease of the gastrointestinal tract with a chemokine/chemokine receptor inhibitor.”
All four of the patents fall under Progenity's GI-targeted therapeutics portfolio, which comprises more than 170 issued patents and continuing applications.
“We believe we hold one of the most robust ingestible device patent portfolios,” said Eric d’Esparbes, interim CEO of Progenity.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor's global chief operating officer said on Wednesday the South Korean automaker wants to develop its own chips to reduce reliance on chipmakers. 
A global shortage of semiconductors, triggered partly by surging demand for laptops and other electronic products during the pandemic, has shuttered some auto production lines globally this year.
Hyundai temporarily suspended some factories, but the company’s global COO Jose Munoz told reporters the worst has passed for the industry chip shortage, adding Hyundai had the ""toughest months"" in August and September. 
""The (chip) industry is reacting very, very fast,"" Munoz said, adding Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is investing a lot of money to expand capacity. 
""But also in our case, we want to be able to develop our own chips within the group, so we are a little bit less dependent in a potential situation like this,"" he said.
""This takes a lot of investment and time, but this is something we're working on."" 
He said the company's parts affiliate Hyundai Mobis would play a key role in the in-house development plan. 
He also said Hyundai Motor aims to deliver vehicles at the level of its original business plan in the fourth quarter, and offset some of its production losses next year. 
Along with  Toyota  and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Hyundai is among a handful of automakers which increased global sales despite the chip shortage. 
Hyundai decided not to cut orders during the pandemic, after seeing the Asian markets recover more strongly than expected, Munoz said. 
Munoz, president of Hyundai Motor North America, said the company is on track to produce electric cars in the United States in 2022, and is looking into both enhancing its existing factory in Alabama and increasing its production capacity.
He said the U.S. government needs to extend a proposed $4,500 tax credit incentive to U.S. electric vehicles made at non-union factories as well as union ones.

""American workers are the same,"" he said. ""We would like this to be equal for all.""

JPMorgan’s third-quarter profit was 24% higher than the same period last year, and the bank’s average loans and deposits rose, as did credit-card spending, helping JPMorgan’s lending income rise 2.5% from the second quarter.
On a call with analysts, executives were cautiously optimistic that the economy is finally on a healthy path after 19 months of pandemic-related illness, business closures, travel restrictions and stay-at-home trends. They predicted loan demand may not substantially change until next year at the earliest, but were encouraged by early signs that the world is getting back on track.

By the end of 2022, people are forecasting 4% unemployment, wages are going up, jobs are plentiful. Getting out of COVID, we should all be thanking our lucky stars.""
Analysts were enthusiastic about the signals that customers are getting back to spending and investing.
""While the (loan) numbers aren't big, we think people will be excited to be at or near an inflection point,"" Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to investors. 
JPMorgan's shares fell nearly 2.6% Wednesday, after touching an all-time high last week of $171.51, suggesting investors may be taking profits. Shares of other major banks  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Well Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) fell between 0.2% and 1.7%.
Investors often see JPMorgan not just as a big American bank, but as a symbol of how well the global economy and markets are doing. It has a substantial presence in almost all conventional lending businesses – from mortgages to commercial loans – one of the largest investment banks on Wall Street and insights into multinational corporations through its capital markets and treasury services operations.
The highlight for JPMorgan’s third quarter was its Corporate & Investment Bank division, where advisory fees almost tripled due to strong performance in M&A and equity underwriting, fueled partly by a spate of initial public offerings.
During the quarter, JPMorgan maintained its position as the second-biggest provider of worldwide M&A advisory after  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), based on fees, according to Refinitiv.
JPMorgan’s decision to release $2.1 billion from credit reserves also bolstered its profit. Dimon and many analysts and investors tend to remove reserve fluctuations from “core” their earnings analyses, because they are based on accounting standards and do not reflect new money coming in the door.
Overall, JPMorgan's profit rose to $11.7 billion, or $3.74 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $9.4 billion, or $2.92 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the reserve release and an income tax benefit, its profit would be $9.6 billion, or $3.03 per share.
Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.00 per share, according to Refinitiv.
JPMorgan’s revenue rose 2% to $30.4 billion in the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $29.8 billion.
The bank maintained its guidance that it sees net interest income for the year to come in around $52.5 billion.
JPMorgan’s shares were down 2.3% in morning trading, with other major banks falling as well. Its shares rose about 5% in the weeks leading up to results, along with other major banks, on hopes of higher interest rates following commentary from the Federal Reserve.
DEALMAKING PICKS UP
Capital markets businesses helped big Wall Street banks through the pandemic, as investors scrambled to react to news about the pandemic and companies needed help raising capital or hedging businesses risks. More recently, as trading revenue has abated, dealmaking activity has picked up, with companies deciding to combine or go public through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and fledgling companies listing shares for the first time.
JPMorgan’s Corporate & Investment Bank division reported a 6% rise in net revenue, to $12.4 billion. Its Consumer & Community Banking division reported a 2% decline in net revenue, to $12.5 billion. Those two businesses toggle for largest by revenue, depending on the quarter.
The lender’s Commercial Banking operation reported an 8% increase in net revenue, to $2.5 billion, while Asset & Wealth Management reported a 20% rise to $4.3 billion.
On a conference call with analysts, management primarily fielded questions about JPMorgan’s economic outlook and what the quarter’s statistics suggest about the next few quarters. They wanted to know when the bank’s lending income would pick up, and how it might deploy all the cash it has on hand.

For instance, card spending has ticked up dramatically, which would ordinarily be a good sign for banks. But it has not always translated into higher profits, because individuals saved money during the pandemic while they were stuck at home, allowing them to pay down balances and stay current on bills – thereby avoiding interest payments or late fees.
Other large U.S. banks including Bank of America, Citigroup,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Morgan Stanley will report results on Thursday, while Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most prolific deal maker, will round out the earnings season on Friday.

Since leaving British Airways parent company IAG (LON:ICAG) last year to run the International Air Transport Association, Walsh has continued to bang the drum against passenger charges at Britain's busiest airport, Heathrow. 
Addressing an audience at the Aviation Club in central London, he said Heathrow was trying to place the financial burden of the COVID-19 crisis on its customers by proposing to raise airport charges by 90% to 42 pounds per person.
""This time 'round when you see what it is that Heathrow is trying to do, it just jumps off the page,"" Walsh said. 
Heathrow, which last year lost its crown as Europe's busiest hub to Paris, is owned by investors including Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp. 
Walsh, who has a reputation as a bruiser in dealing with unions and suppliers, said the higher charges would fund bigger dividends for Heathrow shareholders.
He called on Britain's regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to protect consumers by pushing back against the airport's ""outrageous behaviour."" 
""The recovery of the UK's travel and tourism industry impacts millions of jobs. They cannot be held hostage to the intransigence of what is effectively a greedy monopoly hub airport,"" he said. 

""I cannot see how almost doubling the charge at Heathrow is in the interest of consumers, particularly as we're trying to recover the industry."" 
Heathrow could not immediately be reached for comment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should not decouple from the global semiconductor supply chain in its efforts to create a European chipmaking ecosystem and be self-sufficient, the Netherlands warned this week.
Global supply chains, a business model that has proven popular for the past 30 years, have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading governments around the world to consider bringing manufacturing operations closer to home.
The European Commission, the EU executive, in September proposed a European Chips Act covering research and production capacity, prompted by the chip shortage that has disrupted the auto industry, medical devices makers and telecoms providers.
The EU relies on Asian-made chips and has a diminished share in the supply chain, from design to manufacturing capacity.
Decoupling from the global supply chain would be a mistake, the Netherlands said in a paper published on the government website, pointing to the success of Dutch companies ASML, the world's leading producer of advanced chipmaking tools, and chipmakers NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) and Besi.
The European Chips Act ""requires acknowledgement that decoupling of the global semiconductor value chain is an illusion,"" the paper said.
""European interests are best served by an open ecosystem that remains focused on attracting investment, accelerating innovation and adding market value. Diversification and mutual interdependence promote resilience and prevent one-sided dependencies.""

The Dutch also proposed the creation of instruments to prevent unwanted key strategic takeovers of chipmakers.
The Commission's 2022 work programme foresees the Chips Act adopted in the third quarter of next year.

VAN HORN, Texas (Reuters) -Having made a career out of playing an explorer of the cosmos, William Shatner - Captain James Kirk of ""Star Trek"" fame - did it for real on Wednesday, becoming at age 90 the oldest person in space aboard a rocketship flown by billionaire Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin, an experience the actor called profound.
Shatner was one of four passengers to journey for 10 minutes and 17 seconds to the edge of space aboard the white fully autonomous 60-foot-tall (18.3 meters-tall) New Shepard spacecraft, which took off from Blue Origin's launch site about 20 miles (32 km) outside the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.
The crew capsule returned to the Texas desert from the suborbital flight under parachutes, raising a cloud of dust. Shatner emerged gingerly from the capsule in the desert silence, appearing reflective as the others celebrated by cheering and popping champagne bottles. 
Bezos was on hand and embraced Shatner, who was wearing a cap and a blue flight suit with the company's name in white letters on one sleeve.
""What you have given me is the most profound experience I can imagine,"" Shatner told Bezos as the two chatted for several minutes. ""I am so filled with emotion about what just happened.""
The all-civilian crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness, having traveled about 65.8 miles (106 km) above the Earth's surface - higher than the internationally recognized boundary of space known as the Karman Line, about 62 miles (100 km) above Earth. 
It marked the second space tourism flight for Blue Origin, the company Bezos - the Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and current executive chairman - founded two decades ago. Bezos flew aboard the first one in July.
Shatner - who embodied the promise of space travel in the classic 1960s TV series ""Star Trek"" and seven subsequent films - said he had prepared himself for experiencing weightlessness, but was stunned at the dramatic contrast of the beauty of the blue Earth and the blackness of space.
""You're looking into blackness, into black ugliness,"" Shatner said. ""And you look down, there's the blue down there - and the black up there - and it's just, there is Mother Earth.""
""This is life and that's death, and in an instant, you know - whoa - that's death,"" Shatner said. ""That's what I saw.""
""Is that the way death is?"" Shatner asked.
Before the flight, each astronaut rang a bell and then entered the capsule atop the rocketship, with Bezos closing the hatch. Winds were light and skies were clear for the launch, conducted after two delays totaling roughly 45 minutes.
Joining Shatner were former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, clinical research entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin vice president and engineer Audrey Powers https://www.blueorigin.com/news/shatner-powers-announced-ns18.
'BEAM ME UP'
Shatner, who turned 90 in March, has been acting since the 1950s and remains busy with entertainment projects and fan conventions. He is best known for starring as Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the starship Enterprise on ""Star Trek.""
During the opening credits of each episode of the series, he called space ""the final frontier"" and promised ""to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.""
""Beam me up,"" Shatner's character would tell the Enterprise's chief engineer Scotty, played by James Doohan, in a memorable catchphrase when he needed to be transported to the starship.
Shatner's participation helped generate publicity for Blue Origin as it competes against two billionaire-backed rivals - Elon Musk's SpaceX and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc - to attract customers willing to pay large sums to experience spaceflight.
The flight represented another important day for the nascent space tourism industry that, according to UBS, could reach an annual value of $3 billion in a decade. 
Blue Origin had a successful debut space tourism flight on July 20, with Bezos and three others aboard on a trip lasting 10 minutes and 10 seconds. On that flight, pioneering female aviator Wally Funk https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pioneering-female-aviator-wally-funk-is-americas-new-sweetheart-2021-07-20 at age 82 became the oldest person to reach space. The previous record was set in 1998 when pioneering astronaut John Glenn returned to space as a 77-year-old U.S. senator. 
Branson inaugurated his space tourism https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/virgin-galactics-branson-ready-space-launch-aboard-rocket-plane-2021-07-11 service on July 11, riding along on a suborbital flight with six others. SpaceX debuted its space tourism business https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/spacex-capsule-with-worlds-first-all-civilian-orbital-crew-set-splashdown-2021-09-18 by flying the first all-civilian crew to reach Earth's orbit in a three-day mission ending Sept. 18.

In his annual address to world leaders last month, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized ""billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.""
Asked about Shatner's flight, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday that Guterres ""very much continues to believe what he said in the General Assembly.""

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Wednesday, but data showing inflation remained elevated kept a lid on the upside just as the Federal Reserve's September minutes signaled the central bank could taper its bond purchases as soon as next month. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.25%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.59%.
""Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December,"" the Fed minutes showed.
The minutes arrived after Labor Department reported that consumer prices in September rose more than expected.
The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month, above the 0.3% rise in August, and more than estimates of 0.3%. The uptick in consumer prices in September lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 5.4% from 5.3% in August.
Signs that price pressures are beginning to emerge in sticker areas of the economy such as rents and owners' equivalent rents will test the Federal Reserve's ongoing narrative that inflation remains transitory.

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) also delivered a beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 3% higher.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) swung to a profit in the third quarter, but the airline warned that higher fuel costs will hurt fourth-quarter results. It's shares fell nearly 6%.
Energy cut some losses as oil prices recovered from session lows on expectations that demand will continue to strengthen.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was ""quite possible,"" that oil prices could top $100 per barrel.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 02:07PM ET</span>",Ford Motor Co no longer has Rivian board representative,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co, which has repeatedly touted its strategic relationship with electric vehicle maker Rivian, no longer has a representative on the startup's board of directors ahead of its going public.
While an announcement was never made, Ford executive Alexandra Ford English left the Rivian board in May according to documents Rivian made public on Oct. 1 ahead of its planned initial public offering. Ford vice president Doug Power replaced English in June, and left the board in September.
""Rivian is a strategic investment and we're still exploring ways for potential collaboration with them. We don't have anything to announce today,"" Ford spokesman Ian Thibodeau said on Wednesday.
Ford, which holds a stake greater than 5% in Rivian according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had a seat on the Rivian board when it was a private company, but that would not continue as Rivian went public, Thibodeau said. 
English, daughter of Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, joined Rivian's board in May 2020, replacing Joe Hinrichs after he left Ford. At the time English was added, Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe cited her passion for mobility and electrification, as well as her connection to the company's long family role in transportation. 
Rivian declined to comment on Wednesday beyond documents it filed with U.S. regulators, citing the quiet period ahead of its IPO. In the SEC filing Rivian said, ""Following this offering, none of our stockholders will have any contractual rights to elect or designate members of our board of directors.""
When Ford said in March that English would join Ford's board, its press release identified her as the No. 2 U.S. automaker's representative on Rivian's board. She was officially elected to Ford's board in May and her exit from Rivian's board was in anticipation of that, a spokesman said. 
Ford executives have repeatedly stressed that the company's relationship with Rivian is strategic, but Ford's Lincoln division in April 2020 canceled plans to build EVs with Rivian, a move to save money during the pandemic.
Ford has invested more than $820 million in Rivian over two fundraising rounds, according to the SEC filing. The filing did not include information on the latest $2.5 billion funding round Rivian announced in July that also included Ford. 
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Cox Automotive, which also have Rivian stakes greater than 5%, still have board representatives. 

In May, Ford chief product platform and operations officer Hau Thai-Tang called Rivian a strategic partner and said Ford was still looking at using Rivian's products. 
In a February conference call with analysts, Ford CEO Jim Farley said, ""We love what R.J. is doing at Rivian. It's a strategic investment. It's not a transactional investment. We'll keep you updated, but that's a very fundamental bet.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian on Wednesday waded into the debate on mandating coronavirus vaccines, saying government directives are not the only way to make people get the jab.
""Mandate is only one way to get people vaccinated,"" Bastian told Reuters in an interview. ""It's a very blunt instrument.""
As part of efforts to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, last month signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to mandate COVID-19 shots for employees and get them vaccinated by Dec. 8. 
While supporters of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.
The White House on Wednesday said vaccine requirements have driven up COVID-19 vaccination rates by 20 percentage points.
The measure has drawn a sharp reaction from some Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday barring COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.
Abbott said the Biden administration was ""bullying"" many private entities into imposing vaccine mandates, causing workforce disruptions.
Rebuffing the governor, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) - both based in Texas - have decided to comply with Biden's executive order.
The vaccine diktats, however, are also being challenged in courts. Six employees of United Airlines, which was the first U.S. carrier in August to require vaccinations for all domestic employees, have filed a class action in federal court in Texas accusing the company of unlawfully denying religious and medical exemptions from the vaccine mandate.
Ahead of a hearing on Wednesday, the court on Tuesday temporarily restrained United from placing on unpaid leave any employee who receives religious or medical exemptions.
U.S. airlines have a number of federal contracts. Delta said the contracts are worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
However, the Atlanta-based company is the only major U.S. airline that has still not mandated vaccines for employees. Instead, the carrier has imposed a $200 monthly health insurance surcharge for unvaccinated staff.

The measure, in part, has helped increase staff vaccination rate to 90%. Bastian expects the rate to climb up to 95% in November.
""It's better if you can work collaboratively with your employees,"" he said. ""You can trust your employees to make the right decisions and respect their decisions.""

(Reuters) - The global chip shortage could be creeping its way to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s newest iPhone 13 smartphones, but analysts think that the technology giant can weather the impact by making up for any lost holiday sales with a stronger showing next year.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Apple is likely to slash production of its iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units and produce 80 million units of the new iPhone models by the end of this year, due to the chip shortage.
Apple had previously told investors that the chip shortage would affect its iPhone products but declined to comment on Tuesday.
Several Wall Street analysts, however, did not change their iPhone sales estimates following the news.
""The report does not inspire me to revisit my estimate on iPhone units sold,"" D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Tom Forte said.
According to Refinitiv IBES, analyst are expecting about 45 million units for the fourth quarter and 79.4 million units in the key holiday quarter.
""Apple enjoys market-leading customer retention/loyalty
such that any delay in production just pushes iPhone sales into future quarters,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a note.
Apple also has sway over its component vendors, given its enormous buying power, and that means while it may not be able to purchase as many parts as it wants, it will likely get more than its rivals.
""While we believe Apple gets preferential treatment from the supply chain and is best positioned among hardware providers, it is nonetheless not immune to the extreme circumstances being felt ahead of the holiday selling season,"" said Angelo Zino, an analyst with research firm CFRA.
For most of last year, Apple had insulated its cash cow - the iPhone - from the shortages by prioritizing components to the popular product.
The global chip shortage has, however, hurt Apple's ability to sell Macs and iPads. In July, the company warned that it would start affecting iPhone production and forecast slowing revenue growth.
Shares of the company have fallen about 3% since its warning in July and were down about 1% on Wednesday. 

Jeff Fieldhack, research director for Counterpoint Research, said the reported Apple production cut could also be part of the iPhone maker's normal launch process of over-ordering devices to be prepared for an initial customer rush and then trimming orders as sales trends become clearer.
Fieldhack added that iPhone 13 sales appear to be healthy and higher than last year's iPhone 12.

Investing.com – Delta Air Lines stock (NYSE:DAL) slumped 5.4% Wednesday as the airline’s warning of a fourth-quarter loss was too much to take for traders even as it managed to report its first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic.
Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian blamed record high crude prices for the company’s pessimism. US WTI crude WTI/USD for November delivery crossed $82 a barrel Monday to touch a multi-year high.
“While demand continues to improve, the recent rise in fuel prices will pressure our ability to remain profitable for the December quarter,” Bastian said in a note.
Bastian told Reuters (TSX:TRI) fuel costs alone accounted for nearly 20% of Delta's adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter. According to the CEO, every 5-cent increase in fuel prices drives up its expense by about $40 million.
Delta President Glen Hauenstein said the airline expects total December-quarter revenue to recover to the low 70s percentage relative to 2019 quarter’s $11.4 billion.
Capacity during the ongoing quarter is seen getting restored to 80% relative to the same period of 2019.
The carrier said its September-quarter revenue recovered two-thirds or 66% of 2019 levels on the back of a continued improvement in travel demand. A capacity that is 71% restored delivered adjusted operating revenue of $8.3 billion.
Remuneration from  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) in the quarter crossed $1 billion, up 1% compared to September-quarter 2019.
September-quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $216 million.
According to the company, transatlantic traffic improved the most, a result of both U.S. and Europe easing limits on air travel. Premium cabins outperformed main cabin in the most recovered entities. Paid premium cabin load factors were better too. This should only improve, the airline said, as premium revenue in other entities improves with the return of business and international travel at scale.
Corporate demand was stable but fell short of expectations as businesses delayed the reopening of offices.

The growth of the software industry is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF’s (XSW) 37.9% gains over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 27.4% returns.
Since current market volatility caused by factors including an expected increase in interest rates and rising Treasury yields could lead to high-priced popular tech stocks suffering a price decline in the near term, we think lesser-known tech stocks with sound financials—Viavi Solutions Inc. (VIAV) and Commvault Systems, Inc. (CVLT)—could be ideal bets to cash in on the industry tailwinds.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 12:52PM ET</span>",U.S. SEC officials lay out more aggressive stance with Corporate America,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday signaled it would take an increasingly aggressive stance with corporate executives and gatekeepers, including a greater focus on seeking guilty admissions and bars from industry.
In remarks highlighting the importance of building investors' trust in Corporate America and financial markets, SEC enforcement director Gurbir Grewal said the agency will be seeking these remedies, marking a turn in strategy for the top U.S. markets regulator and the latest example of a shift under new leadership since President Joe Biden took office in January.
Too many corporations, executives and gatekeepers such as lawyers and auditors are not playing by the rules, failing to implement procedures for compliance, and or outright covering up fraud, Grewal said. Such misconduct undermines public trust, he said.
""We will, in appropriate circumstances, be requiring admissions in places where accountability and acceptance of responsibility are in the public interest,"" Grewal said at an industry conference.
Historically, many of the agency's resolutions with public companies, financial firms and executives are finalized without the parties admitting or denying the agency's charges. In 2013, the Democratic SEC chair outlined a policy of pushing for more admissions of guilt in response to criticism that the long-time practice of no-admit settlements erodes public confidence and undermines accountability. 
But academic research shows the remedy was still used very infrequently and saw little change when SEC enforcement officials under the Trump administration signaled a shift away from that strategy.
On Wednesday, SEC officials signaled other changes afoot in their plans for addressing market misconduct, highlighting that failure to maintain required communications or using technology that allows messages to disappear may be seen as spoliation of evidence. That would raise the stakes for corporate actors.
Officials also outlined a push for tighter timelines during enforcement negotiations and a plan to empower front line staff, rather than top enforcement officials, to reduce the potential opportunities for firms or individuals to submit arguments and defense submissions.

When seeking credit for cooperation, corporations will not earn leniency for merely complying with their obligations to produce documents, said Sanjay Wadhwa, the SEC's deputy director of enforcement. They will need to meaningfully advance the ""quality and efficiency"" of the investigation, he said.
""Cooperation is not the mere absence of obstruction,"" he said.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. FDA gives marketing nod to an e-cigarette for the first time,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday allowed  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) Plc (BAT (LON:BATS)) to market its Vuse Solo e-cigarettes and tobacco-flavored pods, making it the first-ever vapor product to get clearance from the health regulator.
The FDA said the approval came after analysis of data from the manufacturer that showed that using Vuse's tobacco-flavored products could help users reduce exposure to harmful chemicals emitted by combustible cigarettes. 
""Today’s order represents an important moment for Reynolds,"" a British American Tobacco spokesperson said, referring to the company's American unit R.J. Reynolds Vapor Co, which had filed for Vuse's marketing approval. 
The FDA granted permission to R.J. Reynolds to market its Vuse Solo closed electronic nicotine-delivery device and two accompanying tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods, which have a nicotine strength of 4.8%, which is roughly equivalent to a pack of cigarettes.
Nicotine is a chemical released during the combustion of tobacco and is the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush. It isn't immediately clear what diseases it causes.
The agency denied the company's request to sell flavored products for failing to demonstrate they would appropriately protect public health. An application to keep selling a menthol version continues to be evaluated, however. 
The FDA's decision comes on the heels of a 2021 survey conducted by the CDC that indicated that an estimated 2.06 million U.S. middle and high school students are still using e-cigarettes, with Vuse and Juul among the most popular brands. Most users said they used flavored products, with fruit, candy and desserts among the most common.
A broader U.S. study tracking adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 for three years showed that adolescents who used e-cigarettes before trying any other tobacco products were more than four times as likely to be smoking traditional cigarettes within a couple of years compared to those who tried any vapes.
The BAT Group spokesperson said FDA's ""market denial orders"" were for five flavored products that were currently not being sold in the market and said it was carefully studying the ""FDA's limited concerns"" with those applications. 
BAT last month announced that Vuse was now the No. 1 global vaping brand by retail sales in the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Germany, which account for an estimated 77% of the closed system vapour market. 
BAT said it is now awaiting approvals for its other e-cigarette products, including Vuse Alto, whose marketing approval application was submitted nearly a year after Vuse Solo, and Vuse Vibe and Ciro, whose applications ""share a foundational science"" similar to Vuse Solo.
""We remain confident in the quality of our applications,"" the spokesperson said. 
In September, the FDA delayed its decision on whether BAT rival Juul and other major manufacturers including BAT could sell their e-cigarette products in the United States, as it weighed the public health impact of the products. 
The FDA on Tuesday also imposed strict digital, radio and television advertising restrictions on R.J. Reynolds.

Juul did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
BAT shares were up marginally in afternoon trading.

(Reuters) - European stocks rose on Wednesday as upbeat earnings forecast from German software group SAP and robust quarterly sales for French luxury goods maker LVMH helped soothe worries about inflation.
After some weakness at open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index hit two-week highs, and closed up 0.7%, as did the German DAX. France's CAC 40 rose 0.8%. 
A decline in banks led to UK's FTSE 100 gaining only 0.2%, while lender heavy indices of Spain and Italy lagged. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) kicked off third quarter earnings in the United States with earnings trumping expectations, but its shares and the broader banking sector there fell. [.N][.L]
Europe's most valuable tech company SAP rose almost 4% after it raised its full-year outlook for a third time following a strong quarterly showing as more customers shift their IT operations to the cloud.
French luxury goods maker LVMH added 3.2% as sales at its fashion and leather goods division rose strongly in the third quarter but overall revenue growth in Asia and the United States eased after a stellar first-half performance.
Also helping sentiment was data that showed China's export growth unexpectedly accelerated in September.
Meanwhile, inflation data from the United States showed a solid rise in September, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to start tapering in November. U.S. federal funds futures priced in an interest rate hike by September, 2022 after the data.
""Inflation is the main factor capable of shifting stock markets in the upcoming months,"" said Alberto Matellán, chief economist at Spanish insurer MAPFRE Inversión. 
""The recent rebound is due to external shocks... By responding to external shocks, the spike in inflation should be temporary and subside when these shocks do."" 
Worries about central banks exiting their pandemic-era stimulus, a global energy crunch and signs of elevated prices have all dampened the outlook for economic recovery, with the STOXX 600 cutting monthly gains to trade up about 1% after stumbling 3.4% in September. 
Third-quarter profit for STOXX 600 companies is seen rising 46.7%, as per Refinitiv IBES data, after a 152.6% jump in the previous quarter, with energy and industrial companies driving the biggest gains.

Investing.com – Sun Country Airlines stock (NASDAQ:SNCY) plunged 8% Wednesday as the company said one of some of its existing backers will sell 8 million shares or around 14% of the company’s equity.
At the current price of $31.60, the offering will fetch the sellers around $253 million.
The underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1.2 million shares of the company from the sellers.
If that happens, the total size will comprise 16% of the company’s outstanding equity and help the sellers raise around $291 million from the sale.
Sun Country Airlines is not selling any shares and will not receive any proceeds from the proposed offering, the company said in a note.
Such a large sale of a company’s shares tends to depress prices in the short-term as equity goes out from one hand to generally more than one.
It may not be true but a large cashing out of an existing shareholder also tends to convey a sign of under-confidence in the company’s ongoing operations and management. Of course, investors cash out when their expected rate of return on the investment has been made and when they have to return cash to their own shareholders."

Though the bill is currently stalled in the Senate, the Biden administration is expected to push for its approval in the coming weeks. Hence, quality steel stocks  Schnitzer Steel  (SCHN) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) could deliver significant upside in the near term. Plus, we think the recent price dips in these stocks represent a perfect buying opportunity. Let’s discuss.The infrastructure plan approved by the Senate less than two months ago is currently stalled because some Democrats refuse to support its passage unless an additional $3.5 trillion in welfare and climate change spending is approved. However, President Biden asserted that “we're going to get it done” after a surprise visit to Congress last week.
Due to steel's extensive use in construction, the potentially transformative infrastructure spending opens enormous growth prospects for the steel industry. Furthermore, with the economy’s reopening, increased construction and manufacturing activity should continue to drive steel demand. According to the World Steel Association, the global steel demand is expected to increase 3.8% year-over-year in 2021.
Given this backdrop, we think steel stocks Schnitzer Steel Industries (NASDAQ:SCHN) and United States Steel Corporation (X), which have suffered price declines lately, could now be great bets to cash in on the industry tailwinds.

The regulators cautioned that data was limited and they relied on the company’s own analysis for some of the findings, rather than conducting their own study.
The regulator’s view comes in response to the company’s request for authorization of its booster dose.
So far, the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) booster is the only to have been approved for administering to those above 60 and other high-risk people.
Along with J&J’s request, the FDA has before it a request from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) for its booster dose.
The J&J shot is the only one in the U.S. carrying a single-dose application. All others are two-dose vaccines.
J&J recommends that a booster be given six months after the initial shot, though it could be given as early as two months also after the first.

The Orion Assembly plant in Michigan has been idled since August 23 and will be down through at least the end of this month.
GM was forced to suspend sales of the EVs, halt production at its Michigan factory and order a recall of all such cars made since 2016 due to the risk of fires from the high-voltage battery pack.
GM said on September 20 that battery production for the Bolt had resumed and that battery replacements were expected to begin in mid-October.
As per Tuesday’s announcement made by GM, battery-supplier LG Electronics (KS:066570) has agreed to cover almost the entire cost of the American carmaker’s recall of Bolt EVs.
GM said the pact with LG will help it offset $1.9 billion of $2 billion in charges associated with the recalls.

Nevertheless, despite the U.S. Senate’s approval of a compromise bill, which allows for a short-term $480 billion increase in the nation’s debt ceiling and helped the country avoid a debt default, market volatility is very high owing to an inflationary environment and industrial supply chain issues.
According to a Bankrate survey, most top experts believe a stock market correction is likely next year. Moreover, last month, the ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki said, “Giant stock market crash coming October.” Against this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in inverse ETFs because they profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark.
So, if one agrees with Kiyosaki’s market collapse prediction, one could add inverse ETFs ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ), ProShares Short Dow30 (DOG), ProShares Short Russell2000 (RWM), and Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 1X Shares (SPDN) to one’s portfolio.

In addition, supply chain constraints are expected to muddy the industry’s near-term prospects. Therefore, we think homebuilding stocks D.H Horton (DHI),  NVR Inc . (NYSE:NVR),  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL), and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) are best avoided now. Read on.Mortgage rates hit a three-month high last week as bond markets responded to the Federal Reserve's statement that it would ""soon"" start reducing its fixed-asset purchases. The average contract interest rate jumped to 3.14% from 3.10% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the highest rate since July.
Mortgage applications to purchase a home declined 13% year-over-year, negatively impacting companies operating in the housing business. Furthermore, impending Fed tapering moves, potential changes to monetary policy, and ongoing supply chain constraints are expected to dampen the homebuilding industry’s near-term prospects.
Given the industry’s gloomy growth prospects, we believe homebuilding stocks D.H Horton Inc. (DHI), NVR Inc. (NVR), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL), and KB Home (KBH) could suffer a downtrend in the near term. So, these stocks are best avoided now.

The digital sports entertainment and gaming company has also reached an agreement with Turner Sports, which includes Bleacher Report, to be the exclusive sportsbook and daily fantasy sports provider for their coverage of the NHL.

“The NHL has some of the most passionate fans in all of sports and we are delighted to be working with the league once again, while developing a rich and engaging viewership and content experience that matches this fanbases’ enthusiasm through our deal with Turner,” commented Jason Robins, CEO, chairman and co-founder, DraftKings.

The suit is the latest development in an issue that first came to light earlier this year, and is a setback for the bank which has been working to restore its public image. 
At issue are allegations that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) may have mis-sold risky investment bank products to customers in Spain and elsewhere, a matter that the bank is investigating internally
The Ibiza-based company, Palladium Hotel Group, said in court documents dated Sept. 30 that Deutsche's bankers sold products knowing that the hotel executives ""did not have any (or any significant) experience in dealing with complex financial derivative transactions"".
Deutsche Bank said in a statement: ""Palladium's claim is without foundation and we will be vigorously defending ourselves against it. Palladium is a sophisticated investor with extensive experience of using derivatives."" 
The lawsuit states that it concerns hundreds of transactions that occurred between 2014 and 2019, and that the company executive involved had ""placed trust and confidence"" in the Deutsche banker who marketed the deals.
""They were exceptionally difficult for anyone other than a highly sophisticated and experienced market participant such as DB, and in practice impossible for a corporate client"" like Palladium to assess, the suit states.
Deutsche Bank said it did not expect to see further claims the size of Palladium's.

The Financial Times first reported about the suit, which was filed in British court. Palladium declined to comment.

Kroll, who has previously served as an investment banker at JP Morgan with a focus on the automotive industry, will assume his new role on Oct. 25. He replaces interim CFO Rebecca Roof, who will stay on in a transition role through Dec. 31.
Lordstown and fellow EV maker Nikola, both of which went public via acquisitions by special-purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), have become a target of short-seller Hindenburg. Both saw their founders subsequently resign.
In June, Lordstown founder and CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned. The resignations had come as the company's board reported conclusions from an internal investigation into claims made by short-seller Hindenburg.
Lordstown still faces a lot of scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to its merger with a SPAC, and statements it previously made about pre-orders for its vehicles.
The company in August, filled the first of the two vacant C-suite positions by appointing Daniel Ninivaggi as CEO, handing over the reins to the former employee of investor Carl Icahn, who had said his focus will be on making sure Lordstown successfully rolls out its pickup trucks in the face of intense regulatory scrutiny.

Kroll, 46, most recently served as chief administrative officer for Hyzon Motors, which has also been a target of short-seller Blue Orca in recent weeks. The company has, however, rejected the short-seller's report, saying it was inaccurate and misleading.
Shares of the company, which is doubling down its efforts to roll out its first pickup truck, were up 1.2% on Wednesday. They have slumped about 75% this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. auto safety regulators asked Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc why the electric-car maker has not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
To date, NHTSA has identified 12 crashes that involved Tesla vehicles using the advanced driver-assistance systems and emergency vehicles. NHTSA said most of the incidents took place after dark.
NHTSA wants Tesla to disclose its ""technical and/or legal basis for declining"" to issue a recall.
In a separate letter, NHTSA asked Tesla about its ""Autosteer on City Streets” which the company also refers to as ""Full Self-Driving” (FSD) released in October 2020, and raised concerns about limits on disclosure by drivers of safety issues.
""Despite Tesla’s characterization of FSD as 'beta,' it is capable of and is being used on public roads,"" NHTSA said.
Some users have posted social media videos that showed apparent issues with the FSD system.
NHTSA wants Tesla to disclose its ""criteria and timeline for allowing access to customers who have requested consideration in Tesla’s FSD Beta Request.""
NHTSA added it was aware of reports that participants in Tesla’s FSD early-access beta release program ""have non-disclosure agreements that allegedly limit the participants from sharing information about FSD that portrays the feature negatively. ... Even limitations on sharing certain information publicly adversely impacts NHTSA’s ability to obtain information relevant to safety.""
NHTSA said its actions ""demonstrate its commitment to safety and its ongoing efforts to collect information necessary for the agency to fulfill its role in keeping everyone safe on the roadways, even as technology evolves. ... We will act when we detect an unreasonable risk to public safety.""
NHTSA asked about Tesla's distribution last month of functionality to certain Tesla vehicles intended to improve detection of emergency vehicle lights in low-light conditions, and Tesla’s early October release of the ""Full Self-Driving Beta Request Menu option.""
NHTSA noted that the law says automakers must issue a recall ""when they determine vehicles or equipment they produced contain defects related to motor vehicle safety or do not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard.""
The safety regulator said the updates were to help detect flashing emergency vehicle lights in low-light conditions ""and then responding to said detection with driver alerts and changes to the vehicle speed while AutoPilot is engaged."" 
Tesla must respond by Nov. 1 to NHTSA's letter.

Tesla did not immediately comment. Its shares were up slightly in midmorning trading on Wednesday.
In February, Tesla agreed to recall 135,000 vehicles with touch-screen displays that could fail and raise the risk of a crash after NHTSA sought the recall, warning it could result in the loss of rearview or backup camera images, exterior turn-signal lighting, and windshield defogging and defrosting systems.

Investing.com –  Plug Power  stock (NASDAQ:PLUG) climbed 11% Wednesday after an upgrade by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and green hydrogen deals the company struck with Airbus (PA:AIR) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).
Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd upgraded the stock to overweight with a revised target of $40, an upside of around 21% from the stock’s current level.
Byrd sees positive risk-reward from current levels with three catalysts driving the stock’s outperformance.
The company has announced several strategic partnerships recently, a development the analyst is enthused by. He also pointed out to around $4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, accelerating revenue growth and the potential for significant upside from legislative support as other reasons for his optimism in the stock.
According to the analyst, green hydrogen will play a crucial role in decarbonization, and he believes Plug Power is one of the best positioned to benefit from future demand for the fuel and related technologies given its vertical integration strategy, scale, and expertise.
Incidentally, the company announced two more deals today to further the use of green hydrogen.
The deal with Airbus aims to decarbonize air travel and airport operations with green hydrogen. Under this pact, the two companies will select a U.S. airport to serve as the first ‘hydrogen hub’ pilot airport in North America, serving as a case study for hydrogen infrastructure scale-up at other airports.
Plug Power and Airbus will also consider setting up a range of joint projects as part of this partnership to further pioneer the deployment of green hydrogen infrastructure for aviation, at scale.
The agreement with Phillips 66 will explore ways to deploy Plug Power’s technology within the former’s refineries and other operations."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), a business group, sued the U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday for refusing to enforce a Trump-era rule reining in companies that advise investors on how to vote in corporate elections.
Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission finalized restrictions on proxy advisers by requiring they give companies a chance to view their recommendations and disclose conflicts of interest. But the agency's new Democratic leadership has said that it will review that rule and will not enforce it in the meantime.
NAM general counsel Linda Kelly said this constitutes an unlawful reversal of the Trump-era rule.
The lawsuit marks the first major showdown between corporate interests and the SEC under the leadership of its new chair, Gary Gensler, and is the latest installment in an ongoing battle between corporate America and the proxy advice industry. 
A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.
U.S. business interests have for years pushed for a crackdown on proxy advisers, which have the power to swing votes in corporate director elections and on hot-button issues such as climate change, gender pay equity and lobbying.
NAM, which filed the lawsuit with equipment supplier Natural Gas Services Group (NYSE:NGS) Inc in the western district of Texas, wants the SEC to start enforcing the rule, Kelly said.
""Our members are starting to get ready for next proxy season,"" Kelly said, referring to the slew of corporate annual meetings that take place beginning early next year.
""In the regulatory process, this whipsawing undermines the predictability regulated entities are looking for and capital markets need.""

Natural Gas Services has been thwarted in efforts to correct information put out by proxy advisers, Kelly said, leading the company to band together with NAM on the legal challenge.
Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc and Glass, Lewis & Co have said that the Trump-era rule would delay the advice they send out to investors and limit their independence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors said Wednesday it will extend a production halt of its electric vehicle Chevrolet Bolt for two additional weeks as it works to accelerate production of new battery modules and prioritize recall repairs.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules and to address fire risks. GM's Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which builds the Bolt, has been idled since Aug. 23 and will be down through at least the end of October.
GM also said it will cut an additional three weeks of production of the Chevrolet Equinox at its Ramos Assembly plant in Mexico due to the global shortage of semiconductors.
GM said Tuesday its battery partner, South Korea's LG Electronics Inc, agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion estimated costs and expenses associated with the Bolt recall.
The U.S. automaker did not say how much LG would pay but said it will recognize an estimated recovery in the third-quarter earnings that will offset $1.9 billion of the total charges associated with the recall.
It follows announcements earlier in the day by GM's battery suppliers LG Chem Ltd and LG Electronics that the two South Korean firms will shoulder a combined $1.2 billion of costs associated with the recall.
GM said on Sept. 20 that battery production for the Bolt had resumed and that battery replacements were expected to begin in mid-October.

GM said LG has implemented new manufacturing processes and has worked with GM to ""review and enhance its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward.""
Within about 60 days, GM will launch a new ""advanced diagnostic software package that will increase the available battery charging parameters over existing guidance,"" it said.

Thus, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound copper stocks  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) (NGLOY) and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) to take advantage of their current share price dips. Let’s discuss.Copper prices slumped from a $10,747.50 record high price in May on investors’ concerns surrounding the global economic recovery with the continued spread of the COVID-19 Delta. Also, weakened output from China has contributed to weak momentum in copper prices.

Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) hit $9,268 per tonne, up 2.5%, on October 7. And analysts expect rising demand to fuel a price rally soon. Furthermore, in May Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) anticipated that copper prices could hit $20,000 per metric ton by 2025.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher but quickly turned negative on Wednesday, despite earnings from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others that all came in ahead of expectations. . 
Earnings beats, achieved in some cases largely by one-offs, were offset by the release of consumer inflation data that showed prices still running at an uncomfortably high level.
By 9:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 109 points, or 0.3%, at 34,269 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. All three indices had started the week with two days of losses, partly on fears that the inflation numbers would force the Federal Reserve to take quicker action on interest rates. 
Consumer prices rose by 0.4% on the month and by 5.4% on the year, in both cases 0.1% above expectations. The core prices index rose 0.2% on the month and 4.0% on the year, in line with expectations, but only thanks to a second sharp drop in airline fares in September as the summer wave of Delta-variant Covid-19 dampened enthusiasm for flying. 
Covid didn't stop Delta Air Lines from delivering a profit, which even after adjusting for government support and other exceptional items came in at $194 million. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 4.0% however, as investors reacted to its warning that fuel prices could pressure its margins in the current quarter. 
However, it was JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), the bellwether for a U.S. banking sector that is itself taken as a proxy for the U.S. economy, that grabbed headlines. The stock fell 2.0% after the bank relied heavily on the release of over $2 billion in reserves to beat street forecasts for earnings per share. Underlying performance in the bank's lending business was comparatively weak, and even the red-hot M&A advisory business cooled from a record second quarter. Revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities fell to its lowest in nearly two years.
JPMorgan's numbers were also saved by a strong performance from its asset management operations, as the public continued to throw money at buoyant equity markets in particular. That was also evident in Blackrock's quarterly numbers, which showed both assets under management and fee income rising more than expected. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) stock rose 2.5% but is still more than 10% off its summer peak.
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.2% after a report said it is planning to cut production of its flagship new iPhone 13 by over 10% due to component shortages, while hydrogen fuel cell company  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) rose 9% after getting an upgrade from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts and announcing a new partnership with Airbus."

LONDON (Reuters) - A group of banks that partnered with the London Metal Exchange (LME) to launch gold and silver futures in 2017 is preparing to abandon the project after hoped-for volumes did not materialise, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Such a move would end an attempt by the LME, which dominates industrial metals trading, to capture part of London's bullion market, which is the world's largest with gold worth some $17 trillion changing hands last year. 
The LME launched the contracts with partners including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who agreed to promote trade in them in return for 50% of revenues generated.
The project partners had hoped tightening regulation would push bullion trading in London away from over-the-counter (OTC) deals between banks and brokers to exchanges, which regulators see as safer and more transparent.
But the biggest dealers, which include JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC, shunned the contracts, and after Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), one of the LME's partners, closed most of its commodities business in 2019, trading dwindled to nothing.
Three sources at banks partnered with the LME said they would meet in coming months. Two said if nothing had changed they would pull out. The third said it was clear the contracts had not been successful and the LME deal was up in the air. 
""There's not been anyone who is keen on keeping it,"" one of the sources said, adding that his bank was paying ""a couple of hundred grand a year"" to maintain the contracts and had millions of dollars locked up in a default fund for them.
The deal with its partners had an initial term of five years, LME chief executive Matt Chamberlain told Reuters. ""It's very possible they choose not to continue after 2022,"" he said. 
Others that partnered the LME are ICBC Standard, Natixis, proprietary trader OSTC and the World Gold Council (WGC), an industry body.
""The World Gold Council strongly believes in increasing transparency and investor accessibility to gold. This is why we support LME precious and will continue to collaborate across the industry on similar initiatives,"" Mike Oswin, WGC's global head of market structure and innovation, said in a statement.

Although the contracts had a positive start, with 14.3 million ounces of gold worth around $20 billion and 121 million ounces of silver worth about $2 billion trading on the LME in September 2017, activity then began to fall. 
In 2019 and 2020, a bullion price rally pushed trading in London and on New York's Comex exchange to record levels, with about a billion ounces of gold changing hands in each venue in March 2020. The LME's contracts have not traded since mid-2020. 
Last year, the LME's partners wrote the value of the project down from $2.5 million to zero, the accounts of a company set up by the partners show.
""There wasn't enough critical mass from banks who wanted the market to go on exchange and go cleared compared to perhaps some other banks who wanted it to stay OTC,"" said Chamberlain.

Despite the failure of the contracts, sources involved in them and at banks that did not use them said trading in London was likely to eventually go on exchange because that is what regulators want. 
""In a few years, someone will try this again,"" one said.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 09:26AM ET</span>",BlackRock profit beats estimates though asset growth stalls,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Sohini Podder
NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackRock Inc topped third-quarter profit estimates helped by robust performance fees and strong demand for its actively managed and sustainable funds, even as volatile markets hindered the world's largest money manager from growing its assets under management. 
Asset managers have benefited from rising global financial markets in recent quarters as investors put money to work, making the most of the post-pandemic economic reopening, driven by progress on vaccinations and strong fiscal and monetary aid.
But with financial markets wobbling during the second quarter - the S&P 500 Index ended the quarter about flat, its worst quarterly performance in six quarters - money managers, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), included, have had a tougher time growing assets.
BlackRock ended the past quarter with $9.46 trillion in assets under management, up from $7.81 trillion a year earlier, but about flat from the second quarter of this year. Some analysts had expected the investment giant to top $10 trillion in assets.
""It's not time to pop the champagne on the $10 trillion mark yet, that's probably a couple of quarters off,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.
Revenue rose 16% to $5.05 billion, helped by technology services revenue growing 13% to $320 million. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts attributed strength in revenue to robust performance fees which came in at $345 million, compared with Jefferies' estimate of $220 million. 
BlackRock's long-term net flows for the quarter stood at $98 billion, helped by continued momentum in its ETFs and active strategies.
The firm logged 9% organic fee growth for the quarter, its sixth straight quarter in excess of their 5% target.
""Organic growth was broad-based, spanning our active platform as well as in each of our ETF product categories,"" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a statement.
""Demand for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) remains strong, with $31 billion of inflows across our sustainable active and index strategies,"" Fink said.
Adjusted net income rose 19% to $1.69 billion, or $10.95 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier. 
Analysts on average had expected the company to report a profit of $9.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""This was good quarter for them, but it wasn't a blowout quarter,"" Edward Jones' Sanders said.
Still, the fund manager's size and reach into every corner of the market, equity, fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, places it in a favorable position relative to smaller peers, analysts said.

BlackRock's shares are up 15.9% for the year, compared with a 33.1% gain for a  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States.
BlackRock shares were up about 1% in trading before the bell on Wednesday.

Known for its fuel-efficient internal-combustion engines, Honda sold over 1.6 million vehicles in China last year.
The new brand will be called ""e:N Series"" and it plans to roll out 10 models with partners GAC and Dongfeng Motor over the next five years, Honda said.
Its two joint ventures, GAC-Honda and Dongfeng-Honda, plan to build new EV-only assembly plants that are expected to begin production in 2024.  
The planned new models will use a new vehicle operating system and are being developed based on an auto product platform designed for electric vehicles.
Honda will set up an e:N Series section in all its existing retail stores. 
Over time, Honda also plans to set up dedicated e:N Series retail stores but did not provide detail on that plan.
Honda has roughly 1,200 Honda brand stores currently.

China's sales for electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles are expected to reach three million this year, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said on Tuesday.
Honda will continue to sell existing gasoline-powered models even after 2030, it said.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 09:12AM ET</span>",Chinese property firms suffer fresh downgrades amid Evergrande crisis,"By Andrew Galbraith and Marc Jones
SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - The rumbling crisis at China Evergrande Group and other major homebuilders drove debt market risk premiums on weaker Chinese firms to a record high on Wednesday and triggered a fresh round of credit rating downgrades. 
Evergrande, which has more than $300 billion in liabilities and 1,300 real estate projects in over 280 cities, missed a third round of interest payments on its international bonds this week, and other firms have also warned they could default. 
Rating agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) delivered fresh downgrades to two of the sector's bigger firms, Greenland Holdings - which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers - and E-house, and warned it could cut their ratings further. 
The $5 trillion property sector accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics. In the clearest sign yet that global investors' worries are growing, the spread - or risk premium - on investment grade Chinese firms, which tend to have the most solid finances, jumped to its widest in more than two months.
The spread on the equivalent high-yield or 'junk'-rated index that the likes of Evergrande are part of surged to a new all-time high of 2,337 basis points. That drove the yield - which reflects how much firms would have to pay to borrow - to an eyewatering 24%.
""We see a risk that a disorderly correction in the property market could cause sharp price declines, hitting the personal wealth of homeowners,"" Kim Eng Tan, a credit analyst at S&P Ratings, said in a report.
""Such an event could also contribute to large-scale losses by investors in wealth management products, and the contractors and service firms that support the developers.""
Evergrande did not pay nearly $150 million worth of coupons on three bonds due on Monday, following two other missed payments in September.
While a 30-day grace period means the company has not technically defaulted, investors say they are expecting a long and drawn-out debt restructuring process.
Bonds issued by developers including Shanghai Shimao Co Ltd China Aoyuan Group and Country Garden Properties Group fell between 1.6% and 7.4%, according to exchange data, while Kaisa Group - the first Chinese real estate firm to default back in 2015 - saw some of its dollar-denominated bonds drop to as low as 35 cents on the dollar, pushing their yields to nearly 60%. 
Kaisa has $3.2 billion of international bonds to repay next year, second only to Evergrande which has $3.5 billion
An equity sub-index tracking A-shares of property firms fell 0.7% compared with a 1.2% rise in China's blue-chip CSI300 index.
""We continue to maintain an underweight position in the real estate sector for our China equity portfolios,"" said Virginie Maisonneuve, Global CIO Equity at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""We have no plan to add in the near-term,"" although she added Beijing should be able to contain the problems.

WALL OF DEBT
Evergrande's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co, faces a 121.8 million yuan onshore bond coupon payment on Oct. 19 and Evergrande has another $14.25 million dollar bond coupon due on Oct. 30.
Debt pressures extend far beyond Evergrande. Chinese property developers have $555.88 million worth of high-yield dollar bond coupons due this month, and nearly $1.6 billion due before year-end, and Refinitiv data shows at least $92.3 billion worth of such maturities next year
Evergrande's mid-sized rival Fantasia has already missed a payment and Modern Land and Sinic Holdings are trying to delay payment deadlines that would still most likely be classed as a default by the main rating agencies.
""These stories have challenged the notion that Evergrande is one of a kind,"" analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a note.
While China's policymakers will likely be able to avoid a ""doomsday scenario"", the overextended property sector will continue to weigh on the world's second-largest economy, they said. 

""Even following an orderly restructuring of the worst-affected developers with minimal contagion to the financial system, construction activity would still almost inevitably slow much further.""

502,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 09:07AM ET</span>",Rocking down to Electric Avenue? Good luck charging your car,"By Nick Carey and Tina Bellon
LONDON (Reuters) -European and U.S. cities planning to phase out combustion engines over the next 15 years first need to plug a charging gap for millions of residents who park their cars on the street.
For while electric vehicle (EVs) sales are soaring in Europe and the United States, a lag in installing charging infrastructure is causing a roadblock.
Often cash-strapped local authorities have other priorities than a kerbside network of charging points which would allow owners to ensure their EVs are always topped up.
And while that leaves a potential gap for the private sector, it is one that few EV charging startups, who have been early adopters in other locations, are focused on.
""It's really difficult to tackle on-street residential charging, so there's really not many companies that have,"" Hugh Mackenzie, chief operating officer at Trojan Energy, said. 
Trojan has developed a charger, which is being tested on residential streets in two London boroughs, where EV owners insert a short pole into sockets sunk into the pavement and then plug in their car.
Tim Win, an Uber (NYSE:UBER) driver who charges his Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Leaf every day, is using the system in Brent, north London.
""After I've been driving all day I just want to come home and plug in,"" said Win, 39, who previously used a nearby EV fast charger to charge up in 20 minutes but sometimes had to wait in line for nearly an hour.
A ""cabbie"" using one of London's new electric black taxis told Reuters he often has to drive between charging points, losing valuable custom as he does, only to find they are either already in use or malfunctioning.
COST CURB
Like the roll out of fibre optic cable for ultra-fast broadband, urban on-street charging using solutions which include lamp post chargers or even wireless, will cost billions.
Solutions like Trojan's are expensive because they require grid connections. And because there are not yet enough EV owners to ensure a quick return, they are 75% subsidized by Britain's government. 
Trojan's chargers cost around 7,000 pounds ($9,520) to make and install, but Mackenzie says that if that can be cut to 4,500 pounds it will work for private investors.
But it still requires local authority buy-in.
""The biggest factor in whether kerbside charging is successful is whether you have an interested and engaged municipality,"" said Travis Allan, vice president for public affairs at Quebec City-based FLO, which has installed at least 7,000 kerbside chargers in Canadian and U.S. cities.
Yet even engaged local authorities like Brent, which is trying lamp post chargers and other solutions, simply lack cash. 
Tim Martin, Brent council's transportation planning manager, says lamp post chargers cost around 2,000 pounds and rapid chargers around 15,000 pounds, so subsidies are the only option. 
    ""The prospect of being able to fund them ourselves out of our own budgets is practically zero,"" Martin said.
Based on car registrations and parking permits, charging startup char.gy estimates there are between 5 million and 10 million cars in London, of which around 76% park on the street. 
Government figures show the total is around 40% for Britain's 33 million cars, while around 40% of Americans do not live in single-family homes with garages. 
And while the rise of car sharing services may reduce the need for on-street charging, it is unclear by how much.
Char.gy Chief Executive Richard Stobart estimates Britain will need half a million on-street chargers by 2030, when around half of the country's cars should be electric. Char.gy runs a network of around 1,000 on-street lamp post chargers in Britain that cost around 1,800 pounds to make and install. 
While government subsidies exist, Stobart said, local authorities often lack the resources.
""So they just dither and it takes forever,"" he added.
Ubitricity, a Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) business, is the British market leader, with just 4,000 chargers using lamp posts, which if they are close enough to the kerb and use LED lamps, have enough power to mostly charge an EV overnight.
Lex Hartman, ubitricity's CEO, estimates that in densely-populated areas, around 60% of Europe's car owners will need public charging.
""You will need chargers at home, at work, at the supermarket, you will need fast charging, but mainly you need charging everywhere,"" Hartman said. 
""If the infrastructure isn't there then people will hesitate to buy an electric car unless they are forced to,"" he added.
Europe has more than 90 million lamp posts, millions of which can be used for charging, said Hartman, whose ubitricity also runs a lamp post charger network in Berlin.
The European Commission knows urban chargers ""will be essential to convincing more and more consumers to go electric,"" and has formed an expert group to advise cities on how to deploy them, a spokesperson said.
'PAINFUL EXPERIENCE'
Some cities face a huge challenge.
New York state has set a goal for all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks to be zero-emission by 2035.
But New York City currently has just 1,580 charging plugs for around one million cars that rely on street parking. 
""Owning an EV in a large city like New York is a really painful experience,"" said Paul Suhey, co-founder of electric moped sharing startup Revel, which has launched the city's first fast-charging hub.
An April study commissioned by New York estimated electrifying its transportation would cost some $500 billion. 
In Los Angeles, which has the most chargers of any U.S. city, Blink Charging last year bought city-run EV car sharing network BlueLA, which has 100 vehicles and 200 charging stations.
Blink CEO Michael Farkas said local authorities want charging infrastructure in as many places as possible to encourage people to buy EVs, but companies cannot afford to shoulder the investments until ownership rises.
""You can't just have a field of dreams, you'll go broke unless the government wants to pay for it,"" Farkas said. 
Even in Norway, where state support put it at the forefront of the electric shift, rolling out on-street charging is tough.
    Oslo subsidizes larger public chargers and rapid chargers, investments that pay off within three to six years, Sture Portvik, who heads up its charging infrastructure efforts, said.
But making charging accessible for the 30% of car owners who lack designated parking in a city where bans on fossil-fuel cars will start in the next few years is a major challenge.

    ""It's extremely important that everybody, regardless of their economic background, gets to be a part of the green shift,"" Portvik said. ""And they will have to because in a few years they will have to sell their diesel car.""

Investing.com – JPMorgan stock (NYSE:JPM) traded 0.6% higher Wednesday in premarket as the bank beat estimates for third-quarter earnings, even as revenue fell short of expectations.
The bank released $2.1 billion in reserves it had booked earlier in the pandemic, in response to an improving economic environment. This helped net profit rise around 24% on-year to $11.68 billion. Revenue rose a mere 1.3% to $29.64 billion.
Corporate and investment banking was the bulwark of the bank, growing its revenue by 7% on-year to $12.39 billion as the pandemic fueled mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring across sectors. There was a high demand for advisory services and equity underwriting as capital markets remained buoyant with large number of initial public offerings, fund-raising, share issues and buybacks.
But it wasn’t a one-way street in the division as the bank came to service in more normal times.
While investment banking and equities revenue rose, revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities slipped 20%. Markets and securities services revenue fell 4% to $7.5 billion.
Sequentially, revenue in corporate and investment banking also fell from their second-quarter peak.
Revenue in the asset and wealth management business rose 21% to $4.3 billion, boosted by higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances.
Consumer and business banking revenue rose, thanks to higher deposit balances and client investment assets. But the home lending and card and auto businesses suffered. Servicing revenue in the home lending business fell while acquisition costs in the card business rose. As a result, on an overall basis, revenue in consumer and community banking business fell on-year as well as on a sequential basis.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian TV network Zee Entertainment is locked in a legal battle with its top investor Invesco after the U.S. firm, citing corporate governance concerns, called for the CEO's removal and a revamp of the company's board.
Zee has said it has tightened its governance, but the row is unabated just as one of India's biggest news and entertainment TV groups plans a merger with the local unit of Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp. 
Here is what the dispute is all about:
WHAT DOES INVESCO WANT?
Invesco's legal filings reviewed by Reuters - which are not public - show it wants changes at Zee in light of corporate governance and financial irregularities that have plagued the company, and have even been flagged by India's market regulator.
Invesco's Developing Markets Fund and its OFI Global China Fund LLC together own a near 18% stake in Zee. They have suggested six new independent board members to be appointed and the removal of Zee CEO Punit Goenka.
Invesco asked Zee on Sept. 11 to call an ""extraordinary general meeting"" of shareholders to consider its demands.
HOW ZEE VIEWS INVESCO'S DEMANDS
Zee on Oct. 1 rejected Invesco's request to revamp the board. Invesco then took the battle to India's companies tribunal, where it is trying to force Zee to call the meeting, saying Zee's behaviour is ""oppressive"". A tribunal has ordered Zee to respond before Oct. 22.
The Indian TV giant says that it has implemented corrective plans to address concerns raised by the market regulator and that it follows the ""highest standards of governance"". 
It remains unclear which way the shareholders will vote if a meeting is called, but Zee's founder Subhash Chandra, father of CEO Goenka, has accused Invesco of plotting a hostile takeover. 
""They want to take over the company against Indian laws,"" Chandra has said. Invesco has said good governance can help improve Zee's business.
IS THE ZEE-SONY DEAL AT RISK?
While Invesco was pushing for a shareholder meeting, Zee announced its talks with Sony. The terms say Goenka will be CEO of the merged entity, which will be majority owned by Sony. 
Invesco has in Indian tribunal hearings said it is not against the Zee-Sony plan, but its filing does criticize how the two entered into talks. 
The Sony deal would allow Chandra's family to raise their shareholding to up to 20%, from 4% now, Invesco said, adding that it was ""plainly an attempt to distract the general public"" and stall the convening of a shareholder meet.
BOLLYWOOD SUPPORT
A teary-eyed Chandra made a prime-time TV appearance on Zee's Hindi news channel, highlighting Zee's journey in India.
""I urge Invesco to behave like a shareholder not like the owner ... You want a fight, then I will fight back,"" he said. 
Zee, which has for years offered dozens of entertainment channels and shows in many local languages in India, is a household name. It is now finding support from Bollywood.
""Zee which was first Indian channel promoted by Indian nationalist ... (is) now hounded by American and Chinese investors. Pray Zee Entertainment remains in original Indian entrepreneur's passionate hands,"" film producer Boney Kapoor said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
BEFORE SONY: RELIANCE TALKS
Invesco, according to Zee, tried in February to forge a deal with parts of an Indian group in a move that would have allowed Goenka to head the new company and raised his family's stake in the merged firm. Zee did not name the group.
That deal did not go through, however, as Zee did not believe it was in shareholders' interest.
In response, Invesco accepted that it did facilitate talks, which it said were between Zee and Reliance, naming for the first time the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.

Invesco added that it would not seek a deal that would dilute long-term shareholder interest.
Reliance also confirmed it approached Zee for a merger with help from Invesco but said the talks fell apart as the investment firm did not agree with a demand from Goenka's family for an option to raise their stake later. It added that it had never resorted to any hostile transactions.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The new president of Germany's financial watchdog BaFin on Wednesday vowed to make further efforts to bolster supervision in Europe's largest economy amid criticism that current overhaul efforts don't go far enough. 
BaFin's reputation was battered after it failed to spot wrongdoing ahead of the collapse last year of the German payments company Wirecard, a former blue-chip hailed as a German success story and once worth $28 billion. 
The implosion shocked investors, business and political leaders in Europe's largest economy, and overshadowed the election campaign of German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, whose ministry oversees BaFin, as he was seeking to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Scholz in response vowed to give BaFin ""more bite"", with a change in top leadership and more powers to spot and investigate wrongdoing.
Mark Branson, in his first news conference since taking over the helm of BaFin, said he was impressed by the speed and breadth of the reforms. 
""But for me, this is only the beginning of BaFin's long-term development,"" said Branson, who was poached for the job from Switzerland's financial markets regulator. ""It will take time before we reach our objectives in all areas.""
New measures enacted this year to bolster BaFin include the creation of task forces to oversee companies with complex business models, more in-house accounting firepower and a reorganised unit for whistleblowers. 
In recent weeks, BaFin has announced an array of enforcement actions, including a 4.25 million euro ($4.9 million) fine for online bank N26 for failures related to money-laundering prevention. 
It also ordered the Frankfurt subsidiary of Russian state-owned VTB Bank to fix flaws in its controls, and it has delved into issues at fund managers DWS (DE:DWSG) and Allianz (DE:ALVG).
Activists and academics say it is too early to say whether the actions auger a tougher, more proactive regulator.
""But the initial message to take action seems to have reached Bonn,"" where BaFin is based, said Gerhard Schick, a former member of German parliament and a finance activist at lobby group Finanzwende.
Still, BaFin's challenges loom large, experts say. 
Hans-Peter Burghof, a professor at the University of Hohenheim, said Branson is a good fit for the job, but as a single person at the top of the institution faces an uphill battle to enact change.
He needs a new crew of finance experts rather than a raft of lawyers, he added.
""A high level of crisis and loss of reputation might make the institution more receptive to changes, but ... they have this lawyer culture that will be very hard to break. I think Branson has a very hard task"".
Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance expert at Frankfurt's Goethe University and adviser to the finance ministry, said that BaFin needs greater independence from Berlin in order to restore credibility.
As part of the finance ministry, BaFin may face too much influence from politicians if supervision efforts rub against their goals, he said. 

An additional fault with BaFin's structure, according to Finanzwende's Schick, is the organization's supervisory board, which includes members of lobbies for banks and insurers that BaFin oversees. He said industry associations should be listened to but not sit on the board.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock traded 0.7% lower in Wednesday’s premarket trading as concerns mount that the ongoing shortage of chips may finally come to hit production of iPhone13.
According to a Bloomberg report, the company is likely to cut its projected iPhone 13 production targets for 2021 by as many as 10 million units, or over 10%, as prolonged chip shortages hit its flagship product. 
The company had expected to ship 90 million new iPhone models in the last three months of the year, but it’s now settling for a lower number, telling manufacturing partners as much. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Apple’s key supplier of components, are struggling to deliver, the report said. The iPad-maker is facing component shortages from other suppliers as well.
Apple gets display parts from Texas Instruments, while Broadcom supplies wireless components. 
Thanks to its heft as the world’s biggest company and one of the biggest buyers of chips, screens and most components that go into mobiles and laptops, the company had so far managed to ride out the shortage.
The lack of supplies is already reflecting in delayed deliveries of the iPhones, which were only launched last month. Orders won’t be delivered from Apple’s website for about a month and the new devices are listed as “currently unavailable” for pickup at several of the company’s retail stores, Bloomberg said.
The shortage of chips worldwide has been a feature of the economy for more than a year now with no early resolution in sight. The chip industry has been unable to respond to a surge in hardware demand from economies fueled by pandemic-related stimulus programs.  
Chip-making is a cutting-edge technology sector and new capacity take time to build. Supply of raw materials that go into chips is also an issue as very few countries have them. While demand has boomed, factories in China and Vietnam have stayed shut for longer due to pandemic-related curbs."

509,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 07:12AM ET</span>",Analysis-Giving up control pays big for private equity executives,"By Chibuike Oguh and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Changes in the share structure of KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc that strip the private equity firms' founders of voting control are making them and their employees wealthier, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings. 
Founders and executives at KKR, Apollo and Carlyle were awarded payouts worth $560 million, $584 million and $346 million, respectively, as part of relinquishing special voting shares, the filings show.
KKR said on Monday it would eliminate the dual-class share structure that gives its executives -- including founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts -- voting control, in order ""to align the interests"" of its leadership with shareholders. 
The new ""one share, one vote"" regime would make the executives' voting rights proportional to the shares they own, representing collectively a 31.7% stake in KKR. 
Yet as part of a complex web of mergers of corporate entities to do away with the dual-class share structure by 2026, KKR will give its executives 8.5 million newly issued shares currently worth about $560 million, according to regulatory filings. 
KKR is obligated to make the payout under a tax receivable agreement (TRA) inked with its founders more than a decade ago, the filings show. The agreement, adopted separately by all major private equity firms when they went public, forces KKR to pay out 85% of the value of the tax benefits it has amassed through good will, amortization, depreciation and related tax credits to its executives.
The exchange of KKR executives' special voting shares for common stock triggers the payout under the TRA, the New York-based firm said in one filing. 
It would be the last payout to KKR executives made under the TRA, which will be abolished as part of the reorganization, the filing states. The $560 million payout is equivalent to a 1% drop in KKR's first-half after-tax distributable earnings per adjusted share and represents a 4% decline in its book value per adjusted share as of June 30, according to one filing.
Private equity firms have often turned to TRAs because, as part of their deal-making, they often dabble in initial public offerings, which allow the private equity firms to pass on to themselves the value of tax benefits of companies they own that are taken public.
The private equity firms stand apart from how most companies end dual-class stock arrangements. Meal delivery provider Blue Apron Holdings (NYSE:APRN) Inc, for example, converted into one class of common stock last month without any windfall for its executives. Asset manager Victory Capital Holdings (NASDAQ:VCTR) Inc similarly eliminated its dual-class structure last month. 
Robert Willens, a tax expert and professor of finance at Columbia Business School, said KKR executives had the discretion to forfeit the payout owed under the TRA.
Even so, he said that some KKR investors may be happy because the executives did not exercise their right to ask for future payments they stood to receive from KKR under the TRA before agreeing to abolish it.
""(The KKR executives) did undoubtedly leave some money on the table,"" Willens said.
A KKR spokeswoman pointed to a filing showing that a committee of KKR's independent board directors unanimously approved the transactions for dissolving the dual-class share structure, which was done to ""increase the rights of our common stockholders"" and ""enhance corporate governance at KKR."" She declined to comment further. 
APOLLO, CARLYLE
Apollo's founders and executives secured a payout of at least $584 million over four years in similar fashion under its TRA when the firm announced in March it would eliminate its dual-class structure, regulatory filings show. The executives elected to receive the payout in cash rather than Apollo stock.
A source familiar with the matter said the payout was worth only half the value of the accrued tax benefits owed to the founders, who agreed to forego the other half in the interest of Apollo's shareholders. 
Carlyle was the first among the major publicly listed private equity firms to get rid of special voting rights for its executives in 2019. The change triggered a $346 million cash payout over five years for the Carlyle executives under its TRA, filings show. 
A Carlyle spokeswoman declined to comment.
The use of TRAs by private equity firms attracted U.S. lawmaker scrutiny in 2007, when Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc disclosed in its initial public offering that its executives could receive tax benefits totaling $863.7 million over the next 15 years under the arrangement. 

However, Congress never passed into law proposed legislation that would have taxed TRA payments as ordinary income. The use of TRAs expanded in popularity, and some private equity firms used them to extract value from portfolio companies they take public. 
Blackstone has kept its dual-class share structure, leaving CEO Stephen Schwarzman in control.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Hit South Korean show ""Squid Game"" has officially become Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s biggest original series launch, the streaming service said on Wednesday. 
The nine-part thriller, in which cash-strapped contestants play childhood games with deadly consequences in a bid to win 45.6 billion won ($38 million), has become a worldwide sensation for Netflix since its launch less than a month ago.
The dystopian drama has inspired countless memes, Halloween costumes of the ubiquitious green tracksuits worn by contestants and real world recreations https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/seller-basks-squid-game-fame-his-sweet-deadly-treat-2021-10-01 of the various games.

""Squid Game has officially reached 111 million fans — making it our biggest series launch ever!"" Netflix posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The series reached that total in just 27 days, since its release on Sept. 17, easily outpacing U.K. costume drama ""Bridgerton"", which was streamed by 82 million accounts in its first 28 days. 
Netflix gives limited information on viewing figures for its platform and cuts the data it does provide in various ways. The 28-day debut figures it released for Bridgerton and other shows included any account that watched an episode for at least two minutes.
Netflix co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told a tech conference in California last month said the streaming service was surprised by how popular ""Squid Game"" has become.
""We did not see that coming, in terms of its global popularity,"" he said.
The series was so popular that South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband sued Netflix https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/skorea-broadband-firm-sues-netflix-after-traffic-surge-squid-game-2021-10-01 to pay for costs from increased network traffic and maintenance work because of the surge in viewers.

Investing.com – LVMH stock (PA:LVMH) traded more than 2% higher in Paris as sustained high demand for luxury helped the French group go past the estimates for the third quarter.
The fashion and leather goods business division, owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Kenzo, reached record levels over the period, posting organic growth of 38% over the third quarter of the pre-pandemic 2019. The division accounts for almost three-quarters of annual operating profit at LVMH and close to half of its revenue.
It brought in 7.45 billion euro of the total 15.51-billion-euro revenue ($17.91 billion) at LVMH in the third quarter. The Group said it is confident the current growth will continue.
On a year-on-year basis, organic revenue growth in the fashion and leather goods business was 24%.
Other business grew too, alleviating fears that the Chinese authorities' new policy of reducing inequality would hit consumption in a key market. Previous campaigns against ostentatious spending by China's new elite have only ever had fleeting impacts on sales there. 
Perfumes and cosmetics, and watches and jewelry grew sales by 19% and 18%, respectively, from a year earlier, the latter boosted by the long drawn-out acquisition of Tiffany. 
In an environment marked by a limited recovery in international travel and the closure of many points of sale, the major brands continued to rely more than is usual on online sales via their own websites, the company said.
Wines and spirits grew strongly in the U.S., Europe and China, its biggest markets. The business recorded 10% growth in organic revenue from the 2020 quarter.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>","Asia's airlines ramp up flights, offers as tough COVID travel curbs ease","By Jamie Freed and Aradhana Aravindan
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific airlines have lost billions of dollars this year, with jets grounded in COVID-19 transportation freezes. Now, as some of the world's strictest pandemic-related travel rules begin to ease, they're ramping up flights and ticket offers.
Asian travel agencies and carriers told Reuters they're seeing a surge in bookings and travel enquiries as countries like Malaysia and Vietnam allow domestic flights to resume from this week after months of strict lockdowns.
India is lifting a domestic capacity cap, while Singapore, Thailand and Fiji are opening without quarantine to vaccinated international travellers from select countries.
While airline industry group IATA does not expect a significant improvement in Asia-Pacific international travel until ""later in 2022 https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/iata-sees-sharp-fall-airline-losses-2022-2021-10-04/#:~:text=The%20losses%20for%202021%20were,from%20%24126.4%20billion%20estimated%20earlier.&text=%22We%20are%20past%20the%20deepest,told%20the%20group's%20annual%20meeting"" - predicting cumulative losses of $11.2 billion this year, narrowing to $2.4 billion next year - carriers from AirAsia Group to VietJet Aviation, Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY), Fiji Airways and Qantas are already increasing capacity. 
""The most important thing is practically all governments in the Asia-Pacific region with maybe one or two exceptions are abandoning their COVID-zero strategies and moving to a sort of COVID-normal framework,"" said Association of Asia Pacific Airlines Director General Subhas Menon.
""Vaccination rates are also beginning to ramp up.""
While curbs are easing, a full return to normal operations is a long way off. IATA estimates global aviation industry losses from the pandemic will be a towering $200 billion for 2020-2022, and losses in Asia alone were close to $50 billion in 2020. International travel in the Asia-Pacific region was at around 4% of 2019 levels in August.
And though the relaxation of restrictions will open the way for some tourism, initially it will mean a comparative trickle: Thailand expects only around 100,000 foreign visitors this year, down from nearly 40 million in 2019. 
Still, there's pent-up demand from those who have longed to be able to take a break overseas.
Dickson Ng, a 24-year-old consultant based in Singapore, said he plans to travel to Europe in January.
""We don't know if these VTLs (vaccinated travel lanes) could be rescinded, right now there's opportunity and there's COVID fatigue, so I think getting out of the country will be a good thing,"" he said.
Meanwhile Fiji Airways has had thousands of bookings since the country on Sunday announced it would open borders to vaccinated travellers from some destinations on Dec. 1, the vast majority from Australians, an airline spokesperson said.
BARGAINS VS. PRICE HIKES
Some carriers are already promoting bargain fares.
Vietnamese low-cost carrier VietJet is offering some free domestic one-way tickets, excluding taxes and fees, while Malaysia's AirAsia has fares as low as 12 ringgit ($2.88) as it ramps up flights.
AirAsia said traffic to its mobile app had surged by more than 140% since the government relaxed domestic travel rules.
But Singapore has capped the number of arrivals under its VTL programme at 3,000 a day in total, a tiny fraction of pre-pandemic traffic - a move that has kept ticket prices higher.
Singapore tour agency Chan Brothers Travel said enquiries had increased 50-fold in the last week since VTLs were added to more countries including South Korea, the United States and Britain.
Return economy-class fares from Singapore to South Korea have nearly doubled to around S$1500 ($1,107.50) from S$800 previously, a spokesperson at Singapore's Dynasty Travel said.
""Some travellers may wait for the initial price surge for flights to pass, but we can expect quite a number of travellers taking to the skies by the first half of 2022,"" she said.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:32AM ET</span>",Europe's carmakers face raw material bottleneck for EV batteries,"By Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Major carmakers like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Stellantis have been racing to secure battery cell supplies in Europe, but may face a bigger challenge as they seek to go electric - finding enough battery raw materials. 
Failure to obtain adequate supplies of lithium, nickel, manganese or cobalt could slow the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), make those vehicles more expensive and threaten carmakers' profit margins.
""There is a serious question as to whether supply can keep up with demand across the battery supply chain,"" says Daniel Harrison, an auto analyst at Ultima Media. 
Until recently, Europe was seen as having lost the battery race to the dominant Asian manufacturers like CATL in China, South Korea's LG Chem, and Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY), says Ilka von Dalwigk from EIT InnoEnergy, which has set up a company network funded by the European Union in the ""European Battery Alliance"". 
""Nobody saw that as a problem,"" says von Dalwigk. ""The thinking was that we can import battery cells."" 
But forecasts from banks like UBS that EV sales would soar over the coming decade shook the political establishment and carmakers, and forced a rethink of battery production. 
PLENTY OF BATTERY PLANTS 
This was followed by EU funding programmes worth billions and major battery plant announcements by car manufacturers and suppliers. Volkswagen alone plans six battery plants in Europe, while Daimler will build four with partners.
Recently, battery cell factory announcements have come thick and fast, and EIT InnoEnergy now lists almost 50 planned projects in the EU. 
If all those plans become reality, local production should meet demand around 2030. About 640 gigawatt hours (GWh) would be available, enough for average annual production of 13 million cars. 
By 2030, Ultima Media estimates global worldwide supply at 2,140 GWh, with demand at 2,212 GWh. 
Ultima Media's Harrison projects Volkswagen's six planned plants would allow the Wolfsburg-based company to cover around two thirds of its own battery needs. 
SUPPLY CHAIN GAP 
The problem lies with raw materials like lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. 
Market experts from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI) speak of ""the great raw material disconnect"" - high investments in cell factories, but missing investments in raw material extraction. 
Within a year, the price for lithium carbonate has more than doubled, explains Caspar Rawles, head of price and data analysis at BMI. 
In the case of cobalt, where the largest deposits are located in Democratic Republic of the Congo and are sometimes extracted under miserable working conditions, an increase in price is also expected. 
At the very beginning of the supply chain, it takes around seven years for new mines to be developed. 
""Europe is not the only region that is raising its e-car targets and reducing CO2 emissions,"" said Rawles. 
A global race is under way. The automotive industry is currently experiencing painful production disruptions due to the shortage of semiconductors. 
Some carmakers, including Volkswagen, are trying to secure the supply of raw materials with exclusive supply contracts. 
So far, lithium has mainly come from Australia and Chile, cobalt from the Congo, and graphite from China. The largest processors of cathode and anode material are also located there, and in Japan. 
But imports can become more expensive due to tariff increases in trade disputes and interrupted by logistics problems, as a tanker accident that blocked the Suez Canal recently showed. 
And long journeys are bad for those focused on making batteries with as few CO2 emissions as possible. 
HOMEGROWN RESOURCES 
One answer is investments in raw material extraction in Europe - lithium is particularly available. 
Startup Vulcan Energy is working on obtaining lithium CO2-neutrally from thermal water in Germany's Upper Rhine plain and has already signed up  Renault  (PA:RENA) as a customer.
""We would need a lot of projects like Vulcan Energy - with one in every European country we would have a chance to build the supply chain in Europe,"" says Harrison. 
EIT InnoEnergy estimates by 2030 Europe could tap a quarter of the raw materials it needs, so is working on raising more money that could trigger further investments. 
Recycling is another option. But here, too, Europe lags far behind China. 
Currently, quality issues mean only 10% to 20% of demand could be met with recycled material, says von Dalwigk. 

There is a risk the shift to e-mobility will be slowed down, says Harrison. 
He adds, though, that he believes the European Commission and EU member states will have to take action - such as more subsidies for exploring reserves and recycling - ""because so much is at stake economically and ecologically.""

517,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Texas vaccine mandate ban likely to be trumped by federal law but could cause uncertainty,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott's ban on COVID-19 vaccine mandates will likely be superseded by the Biden administration plan to require shots for workers, but the dueling rules could take months to sort out in court, creating uncertainty for employers with business in the state.
The Republican governor signed an executive order on Monday banning private employers and other entities from imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, which he said threatened an economic recovery by disrupting the workforce.Some large employers are betting that federal law and President Joe Biden's vaccine mandates will trump Abbott's executive order. 
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), both based in Texas, said on Tuesday they would move ahead with plans to meet a Dec. 8 deadline for federal contractors to have their employees vaccinated.
""Companies recognize they have to comply with one or the other but not both, and the Texas order is more likely to be struck down than the federal order,"" said Steve Cave, a King & Spalding attorney who specializes in government contracts.
The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from interfering with valid federal laws. 
Abbott's order states that ""no entity in Texas"" can compel proof of vaccination by any individual, including employees or customers. Failure to comply could result in a fine of $1,000, although Abbott did not say how the order would be enforced.
Biden's administration announced on Sept. 9 a plan that will require about 100 million American workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. Many of the plans have yet to be detailed and do not yet have the force of law.
Biden, a Democrat, issued the mandate as his administration struggled to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans. Critics of mandates view them as unconstitutional and authoritarian, but proponents see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year pandemic and return to normalcy.
Businesses could choose to test Abbott's order by imposing mandates and then, if fined, challenging the fine in court.
Companies would likely argue they were complying with Biden's mandate, and legal precedents support federal law taking precedence over state law when they conflict, experts aid.
""This is going to turn into a fight about who has supremacy over the other and there's a game of chicken between Governor Abbott and the Biden administration,"" Cave said. 
'HAVING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE'
Florida offers an example of how it might play out.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd in August won a court battle over a Florida law forbidding it from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination, which the cruise line said it had to do to comply with federal health regulations. The judge called the company's argument ""compelling.""
Employers could face hurdles, however, in the Texas case.
The biggest part of Biden's vaccination plan relies on emergency workplace safety rules that will soon be issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 
Once those rules are written, 24 state attorneys general have pledged to fight them. 
Some legal experts suggested the OSHA rule could be blocked if challengers can show the government cannot prove there is a national ""grave danger"" as required by law. 
If OSHA's rule is tied up in court or determined to be invalid, it could make it harder to claim federal law should pre-empt Abbott's order.
Given the uncertainty, businesses could try to comply with both orders.
Kevin Troutman, an attorney in the Houston office of Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said businesses could allow employees to opt out of vaccines if they submit to weekly testing, which the Biden administration has said could be an alternative to vaccination.
""It could make the option of testing something more employers want to consider and implement more widely,"" he said. ""It requires more planning and attention and it creates more headaches.""

Brian Dean Abramson, a specialist and author on vaccine law, questioned if Texas would actually enforce the mandate ban by going after employers. But he said the threat was probably enough for most businesses to take action.
""The employer will be in a position of having to thread the needle of establishing a vaccine policy that doesn’t run afoul of what Abbott requires and run afoul of what the Biden administration is requiring,"" he said. ""But ultimately federal law will be supreme.""

518,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>","Flying taxis to take to the sky in mid-2020s, says UK's Vertical Aerospace","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Fed up with traffic jams? Imagine a world where your taxi takes to the skies and lands on top of your office building, recharges and sets off afresh.
That's the vision of Stephen Fitzpatrick, founder and CEO of Britain's Vertical Aerospace, which is set to raise $394 million in a merger with a blank-cheque New York-listed company, and who says his aircraft will be flying by the mid-2020s.
And he's not alone. Some of the world's most high-profile engineers and airlines believe Vertical is onto something with its plan for zero-emission mini-aircraft to almost silently take four passengers through the skies for up to 120 miles (193 kms).
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), aircraft lessor Avolon, engineers Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) and Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), as well as Microsoft’s M12 unit are investing in the merger, which is expected to complete by the end of the year.
Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy, Britain's no.3 energy retailer, said Vertical flights between London's Heathrow airport and its Canary Wharf financial district will take 15 minutes and cost 50 pounds ($68) per passenger. 
That potential is attracting airlines' attention. More than 1,000 VA-X4 aircraft have been pre-ordered by customers. Interest in the zero-emission aircraft comes at a time when aviation companies are under mounting pressure from investors to help decarbonize the sector and boost their environmental, social and governance scores. 
""We are going to sign deals. We're finding the appetite and the demand from airlines to be really strong,"" Fitzpatrick told Reuters. 
The biggest challenge for Vertical is certifying its aircraft, which Fitzpatrick said it is on track to do by the end of 2024, funded by new money from the merger. 
TEST FLIGHTS
Fitzpatrick first had the idea back in 2015 when he sat for hours in 10 lanes of gridlocked traffic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
Back then, there weren't many competitors, he said, but today analysts estimate there are more than 100 companies working on rival electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVOTL) aircraft. 
The VA-X4 is still in construction and will start test flights early next year. Fitzpatrick believes Vertical's partnerships will help it emerge as a winner. 
Using battery technology from the car industry, and tried and tested electrical propulsion units and motors, and backed by Honeywell's electronics, Fitzpatrick has ""no doubt"" that the VA-X4 will fly. 
Certification will depend on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). 
""The process of certifying the aircraft is known. The technologies are new, but the steps we need to go through are relatively similar to other aircraft,"" said Fitzpatrick, who has recruited senior engineers from both Airbus and Rolls-Royce.
Developing a new mode of transport comes with other challenges such as the infrastructure, but Fitzpatrick is confident. 
""We're already in discussions with, for example, Heathrow Airport,"" he said, pointing out of his office window to potential skyport locations on rooftops. 

As for convincing passengers, that's where airlines come in. 
""I think the brand association with trusted airlines is really going to help passengers embrace the new technology,"" he said.

The likely cut to output goals, reported by Bloomberg just as U.S. markets closed Tuesday, may cause sales to miss projections in the October-December period, Bank of America Corp. analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a note.
While BofA expects the technology giant’s September quarter sales to beat estimates, “constraints could more meaningfully impact the December quarter, where we expect Apple to come in below consensus,” said Mohan, who has a neutral rating on the stock.
Apple fell 0.6% in premarket trading, pushing the stock into correction territory, having fallen more than 10% from a September record. The company is the latest to face a setback from semiconductor supply constraints, which has been affecting industries from cars to phones. However, analysts at many Wall Street banks remain bullish on Apple, saying iPhone demand remains robust.
Apple’s potential production cuts also dented stock prices of suppliers such as Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) Inc., STMicroelectronics NV and Japan Display Inc. The ripple effects extended from Asia to Europe to North America.
“If Apple can’t meet near-term demand, the shortfall is likely to be even greater at competitors,” said Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, adding that the most significant bottleneck is probably in camera modules for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>",U.S. FDA staff says Moderna did not meet all criteria for COVID-19 boosters,"By Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) -Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday that  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong.
FDA staff said in documents that data for Moderna's vaccine showed that a booster does increase protective antibodies, but the difference in antibody levels before and after the shot was not wide enough, particularly in those whose levels had remained high.
The documents were released ahead of a meeting later this week of the FDA's outside expert advisers to discuss booster doses of the vaccine.
The FDA typically follows the advice of its experts, but is not bound to do so. A panel of advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet next week to discuss specific recommendations on who can receive the boosters, if the FDA authorizes them. 
""There was boosting, sure. Was it enough boosting? Who knows? There’s no standard amount of boosting that is known to be needed, and nor is it clear how much boosting happened in the study,” John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said in an email.
Moderna is seeking authorization for a 50-microgram booster dose, half the strength of the original vaccine given in two shots about four weeks apart. 
The company has asked regulators to clear a third round of shots for adults aged 65 and over, as well as for high-risk individuals, similar to the authorization gained by rivals  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech for their mRNA vaccine.
President Joe Biden's administration announced plans earlier this year to roll out booster doses for most adults, but some FDA scientists later said in an article in journal The Lancet that there was not enough evidence to support boosters for all. 
Data on the need for boosters has largely come from Israel, which rolled out the additional shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to large swaths of its population, and has provided details on the effectiveness of that effort to U.S. advisers. 
No similar real-world study populations exist for the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines.
The evidence for Moderna's booster appears to have ""a lot of holes,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, noting that the data provided was limited and offers no insight into how the boosters actually perform in people. 
""That is fairly short of what Pfizer had from Israel, where they had the full restoration of the vaccine effectiveness from the booster,"" Topol said.

The FDA's advisers will also consider booster doses for J&J's single-dose vaccine on Friday. The FDA has not yet released its briefing documents on those shots.
J&J has asked the FDA to authorize a booster at least two months after the initial shot. It said data suggests high-risk adults should receive boosters earlier, but that lower-risk individuals could benefit from waiting at least six months for their second shot.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>","As Evergrande default looms, what legal options do offshore creditors have?","By Karin Strohecker and Scott Murdoch
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - With China Evergrande Group's default deadline drawing closer, offshore bond investors in the property developer are pondering their legal options to safeguard their investments. 
Below are some factors at play as offshore investors, with some $20 billion of Evergrande debt outstanding, gear up to deal with the potential fallout from what could become China's biggest ever corporate default: 
DO EVERGRANDE'S OFFSHORE BONDS CARRY ANY GUARANTEE FROM ISSUER? 
Chinese legal rules prevent mainland-incorporated parent companies from guaranteeing their subsidiaries’ offshore debt without going through a registration and approval process.
To work around this, offshore corporate bonds, in many cases, are issued by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and feature a so-called keepwell structure.
The way many market participants worked around the lack of a guarantee was by using keepwell deeds - an undertaking to bondholders, and the offshore SPV which issues the debt, that the parent will make sure the SPV maintains a positive net worth and remains solvent.
The keepwell structure emerged in 2012-2013, according to Fitch, which cited data estimating that in 2020 more than 16%, or nearly $100 billion, of outstanding offshore bonds issued by Chinese corporates contained keepwell structures. 
IS THE KEEPWELL STRUCTURE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE? 
Chinese courts are widely seen to have broad discretion to refuse to enforce a keepwell, based on public interest.
""The fundamental question in front of investors is whether the keepwell agreement is enforceable and what difference that may make in the recovery process should the group default,"" said Matthew Chow at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings. 
Test cases for this structure have been few and far between.
Chow points to the case of Peking University Founder Group Co Ltd, where court-appointed administrators ruled last year that they would not recognise the keepwell deeds of the group's defaulted offshore bonds.
But in a separate case, an offshore bondholder in CEFC Shanghai International Group Limited (CEFC), who filed a claim in Hong Kong against the company for breach of the keepwell deed, secured a default judgment in its favour.
This decision was upheld last November on the grounds that enforcement would not be contrary to public interest, law firm Ashurst says. But it notes that a decision could have been different if proceedings had been contested. 
WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS? 
Given how entrenched Evergrande is in China's economy, some analysts voiced doubts over how enthusiastic Chinese courts would be to facilitate a payout to foreign creditors, potentially to the detriment of domestic ones.
David Billington, a restructuring partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, said creditors might have some other options. 
""Instead of enforcing the keepwell itself, the bondholders could put the offshore issuer company into liquidation or other insolvency process,"" Billington said. 
This would essentially mean the creditors take over the SPV that issued the bonds through a liquidator, who then would pursue the vehicle's claims against the Chinese parent company.
Such a move could improve the optics for the Chinese court, Billington said. 
""Instead of giving a judgment requiring a payment directly to a bunch of foreign creditors, the Chinese court would just be upholding a promise that a mainland parent gave to its subsidiary, which it failed to perform on.""
However, the nature of the issuers and the invisible hand of authorities can prove a stumbling block, said Karl Clowry, restructuring partner at Addleshaw Goddard in London.
""Evergrande is almost like a quasi-sovereign debt restructuring in that the significant stakeholders and the authorities are no doubt dictating what should be done, although with the sponsor still in place,"" he said.
""The hand of the government and authorities is never far away.""
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF OFFSHORE BONDHOLDERS MAKING CASH RECOVERY? 
Chinese restructurings are often complicated and not easily standardised, according to S&P. However, when it comes to dollar-bond defaults, out-of-court restructurings are common and allow creditors some leeway to strike a deal different to the one agreed with domestic creditors and on different timelines.
Tewoo Group completed an exchange and tender offer for its four U.S.-dollar bonds in December 2019 while the firm's onshore in-court debt restructuring was approved around a year later.
Even going through an in-court restructuring doesn't make always for comfortable reading when it comes to cash recovery rates - which depend on a multitude of factors from asset quality to equity ownership and complexity of the group structure.

Based on a review of nearly 50 defaulters going through in-court restructurings, S&P found investors saw an average recovery of 23.7%.
""Everyone is watching to see how this plays out,"" said a Hong Kong-based lawyer at a major western law firm. ""The result of this could impact the way restructurings are done here in the future.""

Investing.com – ADRs of SAP (NYSE:SAP) were trading higher by more than 5% in Wednesday’s premarket as the company raised its annual outlook for the third time - albeit modestly -  on the back of sustained strength in its subscription business. 
In a preliminary update ahead of its full quarterly results, the enterprise software-maker now expects 2021 Cloud and software revenue at 24 billion euros ($27.84 billion) at center of the guidance range, up 3% from its previous estimate of 23.8 billion euro.
Revenue from Cloud-based services is seen at 9.5 billion euros at midpoint, up from 9.4 billion euros given earlier.
The company said the transition to Cloud-based services, accelerated by the pandemic, shows no sign of letting up. Order backlogs for its Cloud services were up 24% at 8.17 billion euro, while backlogs for its flagship S/4HANA service were up 60% to 1.28 billion.
Business software providers have been major beneficiaries of the pandemic, as pressure to optimize business practices has increased and the adoption of hybrid working-from-home models has demanded greater capabilities from business IT systems. 
While transitioning to a subscription-based model has hurt the licensing revenues of 'Old Guard' software companies like SAP and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), the German company has increasingly compensated for that elsewhere. Total revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, while earnings per share adjusted for various one-off factors rose 2% to 1.74 euros. Reported earnings per share fell 10% from a year earlier to 1.19 euros.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 05:25AM ET</span>",New Caledonia's Prony to supply nickel to Tesla in multi-year deal,"By Melanie Burton and Gus Trompiz
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Prony Resources said on Wednesday Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc had agreed to purchase around 42,000 tonnes of nickel in a multi-year deal - a pact that is set to make the New Caledonian miner a key supplier of the metal to the U.S. electric car maker.
Prony, which bought the loss-making nickel operations in the French territory from Brazil's Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) this year, added it aims to produce 44,000 tonnes of nickel by 2024, double its expected 2021 output. 
Electric vehicle makers have made securing sufficient supplies of nickel - a key ingredient in automotive batteries - a top priority and are particularly keen to seek out sustainable and low-carbon nickel supplies.
The agreement with Tesla will make the carmaker by far Prony's largest customer, Antonin Beurrier, the miner's chief executive, said during a news conference.
The 42,000-tonne volume was indicative and could vary, he said, declining to specify the duration or other details of the deal.
The supply agreement with Tesla was negotiated by Swiss commodity trader Trafigura, a shareholder in Prony Resources, and signed last month, he added.
Tesla was already associated with Prony as an adviser on product and sustainability standards. The carmaker has also signed a deal to take supply from BHP's nickel operations in Australia earlier this year.
Prony initially expects its nickel to supply Tesla's battery supply chain in Asia, Beurrier said.
Its focus on producing an intermediate nickel product that can be processed for batteries has allowed Prony to benefit from rising nickel prices this year and become profitable in core earnings in recent months, he said. [MET/L]
However, a coronavirus outbreak in New Caledonia and planned maintenance are expected to hit output and profitability for the rest of this year, Prony said.
It also expects the nickel market to return to a surplus for four years from 2022, partly as top producer Indonesia will boost supply, before exponential battery demand outstrips supply again, it said.
Prony is 51%-owned by New Caledonia's provincial authorities and other local interests, while Trafigura has a 19% stake and the rest is held by a joint venture between Prony Resources management and investment firm Agio Global.
The miner is planning to borrow 220 million euros ($254.2 million) from the French state, subject to approval in France's 2022 budget, on top of a 200 million state loan earlier this year to help cover investments in production and improving waste treatment at its nickel site.
Prony will also choose in December a partner to develop a new electricity plant for the site to support a goal to halve its carbon emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2040, Beurrier said.

The future power plant will be solar-based and replace a current coal-fired installation, he added.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China readies plan to elevate status of antitrust unit - sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering boosting the status of its antitrust bureau within the market regulatory agency as it steps up a campaign against anti-competitive behaviour, two people familiar with the matter said.
Urged on by President Xi Jinping, the once low-profile State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has made headlines this year with a push to root-out and penalise anticompetitive behaviour, particularly in the vast online ""platform"" economy.
Under a new structure under consideration by the government, the antitrust bureau would become the National Antimonopoly Bureau and be elevated to deputy-ministerial status, while remaining within SAMR, said two people with knowledge of the plans.
The higher ranking would help antitrust investigators gain resources when examining mergers and acquisitions, the people said, strengthening their hand as Beijing seeks to rein in the power of corporate behemoths https://www.reuters.com/world/china/education-bitcoin-chinas-season-regulatory-crackdown-2021-07-27.
The proposed new structure, details of which have not been reported before, would also bolster SAMR's in-house capability to conduct research that it has previously had to outsource, according to the people.
Reuters reported in April that Beijing was planning to bulk up SAMR's antitrust workforce and delegate case reviewing power to its local bureaus.
Gan Lin, current deputy minister of SAMR, would lead the upgraded bureau within SAMR, the people said.
SAMR did not respond to a request for comment on the plans and Gan could not immediately be reached for comment.
The plan is subject to change and needs final approval of China's State Council, or cabinet, as well as the National People's Congress, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak with media.
The proposed status upgrade of SAMR's antitrust bureau comes after Xi in March cited the need to ""strengthen antitrust powers"" to rein in corporate giants that play a dominant role in the country's consumer sector.
Beijing has looked to European antitrust authorities as a model as it seeks to upgrade its antitrust capabilities, one of the people said. In August, SAMR's antitrust office said on its website that it had invited experts from the EU and United States to hold online courses for Chinese ""antitrust talents"".
""Compared to other major anti-monopoly enforcement authorities in the world, the authorities in China currently have fewer staff, which needs to be changed in the future,"" Wu Zhenguo, head of SAMR's anti-monopoly bureau, told industrial online journal The Antitrust Source in a July interview http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202107/t20210707_332370.html.
China has shed what was once a relatively laissez-faire approach to market regulation of the internet sector in dramatic fashion this year, including blocking mergers and imposing a record $2.75 billion fine on e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding for abusing its market position.
This month, it levied a $527 million fine on food delivery giant Meituan, also for abusing its market dominance.

Beijing has in the past elevated the administrative status of other regulatory bodies as its governance agenda evolved. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment was upgraded from a national bureau to a ministry in 2008, and later revamped with greater powers during a 2018 governmental overhaul.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 03:01AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Stagflation blues,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee. 
Even by the conservative standards of global organisations, the International Monetary Fund is known for its cautious forecasts. So, when the Fund cut 2021 growth forecast on Tuesday and said it was growing more concerned about entrenched inflationary pressures, there is reason for investors to take notice.
So ahead of the release of September U.S. CPI, the big data point of the day, markets are nervous. U.S. stock futures are in the red and major government bond yield curves retain a steepening bias. The growing stagflation fears indicate that risks from the data are asymetric; a higher print than the 0.3% forecast in a Reuters poll could lead to a bigger market reaction than a small miss. 
In some ways, it feels like the market is trying to call central banks' bluff on the “transitory inflation” mantra, with money markets in the developed world moving over the past week to aggressively price interest rate hikes
Indeed, according to Deutsche Bank’s latest monthly survey, for the first time since June, COVID is no longer perceived to be the biggest risk to the markets with the top spot taken by higher inflation and bond yields. 
Latest Asian macro data was a mixed bag, with Chinese export growth beating expectations, an unexpected decline in Japanese machinery orders and a fall in Australian consumer confidence.
So global stocks are not too far off May lows while a gauge of currency market volatility is creeping towards 2021 highs. However, the recent rise in Treasury yields has stalled for now and the dollar is on the backfoot against other major currencies
Wednesday also marks the unofficial kick-off of the U.S. corporate earnings season, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) the first major bank to report. Banks have had an impressive run this year, with shares outperforming the market by a wide margin but investors will listen out for what bank CEOs say on the outlook.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
U.S. Federal Reserve Minutes 
August Euro area industrial production, UK GDP returns to growth territory in August after contracting in July
Central bank speaker corner: BOE's Cunliffe, ECB's Visco 
German business software group SAP raised its full-year outlook for a third time on the back of a strong showing in the third-quarter.
Shares in THG Ltd lost over a third of their value on Tuesday just as the company gave a presentation to investors.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Rebuffing the Texas governor, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said on Tuesday they would comply with U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order to require that their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19 by a Dec. 8 deadline.
The two Texas-based carriers said the federal mandate superseded an order by Republican Governor Greg Abbott barring https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-bars-all-vaccine-mandates-state-2021-10-11 COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.
Southwest said it ""would be expected to comply with the President's Order to remain compliant as a federal contractor."" American said while it was reviewing Abbott's executive order, ""this does not change anything"" for the company.
Both carriers have asked U.S.-based employees to submit proof of vaccination by Nov. 24.
Biden issued his mandate last month as his administration struggled to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans. It covers all federal contractors.
While supporters of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.
Six employees of United Airlines, which became the first U.S. carrier in August to require vaccinations for all domestic employees, have filed a class action in federal court in Texas claiming that workers who sought exemptions from the vaccine mandate were subjected to intrusive inquiries about their medical conditions or religious beliefs, including a requirement that they obtain letters from pastors.
The court, which is due to hear the case on Wednesday, issued an order on Tuesday restraining the airline until Oct. 26 from placing on unpaid leave any employee who receives religious or medical exemptions from the company for COVID-19 vaccinations. 
The court also temporarily restrained United from denying any late requests for religious or medical accommodations.

In his executive order, Abbott said the Biden administration was ""bullying"" many private entities into imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, causing workforce disruptions.
In its response, the White House said on Tuesday that Abbott's order was out of step with businesses in the state. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the governor's decision was motivated by politics, not science.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Crisis-ridden  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is going on the offensive under new Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio by providing free services for investors in collapsed supply chain finance funds linked to Greensill, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters.
""This is a gesture of goodwill,"" the insider said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank plans to refund fees on most products and services to clients on a quarterly basis, the person said. This would cover standard brokerage fees as well as discretionary mandate fees, investment advisory fees and banking services. 
Fund of funds from other providers, for example, are excluded from the fee waiver. It was not yet clear how long the offer will last or how much it will ultimately cost.
The bank's $10 billion in funds linked to Greensill imploded in March when insurance cover lapsed, pushing the financing group into insolvency.
Credit Suisse has been working with advisers to help recoup the funds, some $7.0 billion of which had been recovered by the end of September.
Many clients who were sold the Greensill funds as products with a manageable risk reacted angrily, and some have taken legal action. Analysts have estimated the possible legal costs at $2 billion. 
""Credit Suisse acknowledges that this has been a difficult period for investors in the Supply Chain Finance funds. We continue to make good progress on recovering cash both from obligors and via insurance claims; however, recovery from the focus areas will take time to achieve,"" the bank said.
""We have therefore also been actively engaging with our clients in recent months to explore possible measures that would improve their situation. We have taken their feedback on board, explored the viability of a number of scenarios and, starting with clients in Switzerland, we are now able to grant special conditions as a gesture of our commitment to these important relationships,"" it added in a statement.
""FREE OPTION"" The bank is launching the fee waiver programme on Wednesday for clients whose accounts are booked in Switzerland, the source said. The offer will then be broadened out to other regions. The programme will cover the Switzerland, Asia-Pacific and International Wealth Management divisions for now. 
Management fees on the Greensill funds themselves have already been waived since March. 
Clients participating in the programme would not have to forego legal action, but would have to agree that any gain from legal action will be reduced by the amount of the reimbursement received.
""Essentially, this is a free option,"" the source said.
Customers who had already initiated legal proceedings were excluded from the programme. Reuters reported in March that the bank was considering compensating customers hit by the funds' collapse given the reputational damage and possible lawsuits. The funds' shares were held by around 1,000 professional investors and super-rich customers among the bank's core clientele. But the bank refrained from directly compensating clients for fear of setting a precedent. 
The bank has informed Swiss watchdog FINMA about the plan to waive the fees for clients. FINMA initiated formal proceedings against Credit Suisse over Greensill in March. Police also searched the bank's offices and confiscated documents last month in a probe the bank said was not directed against Credit Suisse.
Credit Suisse has commissioned its own investigation into the Greensill disaster. It is not known when the report will be published.

A report in July on a second debacle, the collapse of investment fund Archegos Capital that cost the bank $5.5 billion, was scathing.
Horta-Osorio wants to announce by year's end what impact the two incidents will have on its strategy and structure.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma, largely out of public view since a regulatory clampdown started on his business empire late last year, is currently in Hong Kong and has met business associates in recent days, two sources told Reuters. 
The Chinese billionaire has been keeping a low profile since delivering a speech in October last year in Shanghai criticising China's financial regulators. That triggered a chain of events that resulted in the shelving of his Ant Group's mega IPO.
While Ma made a limited number of public appearances in mainland China after that, as speculation swirled about his whereabouts, one of the sources said the visit marked his first trip to the Asian financial hub since last October.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of its regular business hours. Comments from Ma typically come via the company.
The sources declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints. 
Ma, once China's most famous and outspoken entrepreneur, met at least ""a few"" business associates over meals last week, said the people. 
Ma, who is mostly based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, where his business empire is headquartered, owns at least one luxury house in the former British colony that also houses some of his companies' offshore business operations.
Alibaba is also listed in Hong Kong, besides New York.
The former English teacher disappeared from public view for three months before surfacing in January, speaking to a group of teachers by video. That eased concern about his unusual absence from the limelight and sent Alibaba shares surging. 
In May, Ma made a rare visit to Alibaba's Hangzhou campus during the firm's annual ""Ali Day"" staff and family event, company sources have said.
On Sept. 1, photographs of Ma visiting several agricultural greenhouses in the eastern Zhejiang province, home to both Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant, went viral on Chinese social media. 
The next day, Alibaba said it would invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 in support of ""common prosperity"", becoming the latest corporate giant to pledge support for the wealth sharing initiative driven by President Xi Jinping.
Alibaba and its tech rivals have been the target of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on issues ranging from monopolistic behaviour to consumer rights. The e-commerce behemoth was fined a record $2.75 billion in April over monopoly violations.

Earlier this year, regulators also imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant, whose botched $37 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market would have been the world's largest.

(Reuters) -Apple Inc is likely to slash production of its iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units due to the global chip shortage, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company was expected to produce 90 million units of the new iPhone models by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg. The report https:// said Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) told its manufacturers that the number of units would be lower because chip suppliers including Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) are struggling to deliver components.
Shares of Apple fell 1.2% in after-hours trading, while Texas Instruments and Broadcom were both down about 1%.
Apple declined to comment. Broadcom and Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
In July, Apple forecast slowing revenue growth and said the chip shortage, which had started hitting its ability to sell Macs and iPads, would also crimp iPhone production. Texas Instruments also gave a soft revenue outlook that month, hinting on chip supply concerns for the rest of the year.
The chip crunch has put immense pressure on industries from automobiles to electronics, leading many automakers to temporarily suspend production.
With its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors, Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies, leading some analysts to forecast that iPhone 13 models released in September would have a strong sales year as consumers looked to upgrade devices for 5G networks.

Jeff Fieldhack, research director for Counterpoint Research, said the reported Apple production cut could also be part of the iPhone maker's normal launch process of over-ordering devices to be prepared for an initial customer rush and then trimming orders as sales trends become clearer. 
Fieldhack said iPhone 13 sales appear to be healthy and higher than last year's iPhone 12, and Counterpoint is not changing its estimate of 85 million to 90 million iPhone 13 sales for the fourth quarter.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Not so fast! Supply bottlenecks strain fashion chains,"By James Davey and Lisa Baertlein
LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Supply bottlenecks, slower product deliveries and higher freight and labour costs risk shifting the fast fashion industry into the slow lane, as shown this week by British online fashion retailer ASOS (LON:ASOS).
A business model that aims to bring new styles into stores every three or so weeks and where shoppers expect to see fresh, reasonably priced merchandise on each visit is discovering its limitations.
""When it comes to fast fashion, it's all about being first to market,"" said Gus Bartholomew, CEO and co-founder of SupplyCompass, a London-based firm that specialises in product development and delivery software for fashion brands.
""What we're seeing with most brands is that they're all still massively struggling with visibility and control around delivery certainty - knowing when things are going to be delivered and when things might be likely to go wrong and how that will actually impact them.""
Shares in ASOS fell 16% on Monday after it warned annual profit could fall by more than 40% this year, partly because it expects delays in getting stock from partner brands to persist into next year.
Less than two weeks before rival Boohoo warned its full year profit would be dented by higher freight costs. 
Attention will focus on Thursday on Fast Retailing, the Japanese parent of Uniqlo, when it reports quarterly financial results. 
The company said in late September that its clothing releases will be delayed due to COVID-19 lockdowns at partner factories in Vietnam.
Companies from Abercrombie & Fitch to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have seen their margins shrink in the last few months as they grapple with higher raw material costs and spend more on shipping.
Gap, American Eagle (NYSE:AEO), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Macy's (NYSE:M) are expected to post their slowest margin growth so far this year when they report third quarter results next month, according to Refinitiv data.
SLOW TRANSIT
Cheap supplies from Asia have been central to many fast fashion business models.
The downside of reliance on remote workforces has been exposed by increased transit times - Nike's Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said last month transit times to the United States from Asia have doubled to 80 days.
Added to that, garment factories in Vietnam, a hub for fast fashion producers, face a shortage of workers, particularly in facilities located in lockdown areas. 
""A big pain point is manufacturing in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and even in China,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData Retail.
Fast-fashion is ""a very time-sensitive segment, which leads to problems"" because it is hard to sell out-of-season stock.
Under the current circumstances, that could mean that by the time consignments get through, no-one wants them, while the risk is that stores will have little to offer during the major selling season that starts with Black Friday in November. 
On average, in the United States, about a third of Zara's black men's blazers were out of stock in the third quarter, as were over a fifth of all H&M women's white T-shirts, data firm StyleSage found.
StyleSage operates an online platform that monitors pricing to provide competitive intelligence to retailers.
H&M, second behind Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) in the global apparel market, relies on Asia for about 70% of its production, according to analysts. 
Supply disruptions hampered H&M  sales in September and Chief Executive Helena Helmersson told analysts and media on Sept. 30 that H&M was bracing for more delays in deliveries.
NEAR-SHORING
One solution is to reduce global exposure, which can also help to address pressure from investors focused on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors, including carbon footprints and workers' rights.
Spain's Inditex is much less exposed to Asia than its rivals, sourcing more of its products close to home.
Italy's Benetton is also turning away from globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs in Asia, in a shift, known as near-shoring, that could prove a lasting legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic.
For others, the time and cost of engineering a change is too great and in any case, profits have not been wiped out.
Despite the pressure, ASOS's adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin increased 70 bps to 5.3% in the year to August 31. Its medium term (3-4 years) target is ""at least"" 4.3%.
ASOS, which has rapidly expanded into a force in UK retail, sources the majority of its goods from China and India.
It also faces higher inbound freight and outbound delivery costs, duty costs related to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union and labour wage inflation.

On Monday, it said supply chain pressures were expected to continue to the end of February, resulting in longer lead times for imported goods and constrained supply from partner brands. 
""I think it (availability) will be patchy in terms of third party brands but we’re certainly building that up now and we’re still looking to have some decent (sales) growth over this first (half) period,"" Chairman Adam Crozier told Reuters.

There is also an option for four more aircraft with delivery in 2023, the Oslo-based carrier said in a statement late on Tuesday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to pay for costs from increased network traffic and maintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the U.S. firm's content, an SK spokesperson said on Friday. 
The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should ""reasonably"" give something in return to the internet service provider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for network usage despite generating explosive traffic. 
Netflix said it will review SK Broadband's claim, and seek dialogue and explore ways in the meantime to work with SK Broadband to ensure customers are not affected. 
The popularity of the hit series ""Squid Game"" and other offerings have underscored Netflix's status as the country's second-largest data traffic generator after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, but the two are the only ones to not pay network usage fees, which other content providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are paying, SK said. 
Netflix's data traffic handled by SK jumped 24 times from May 2018 to 1.2 trillion bits of data processed per second as of September, SK said, riding on the success of several Netflix productions from Korea including ""Squid Game"" and ""D.P."" 
SK Broadband said it lodged a lawsuit against Netflix for it to pay for using SK's networks since Netflix began using SK's dedicated line starting 2018 to deliver increasingly larger amounts of data-heavy, high-definition video content to viewers in Korea from servers in Japan and Hong Kong. 
Last year, Netflix had brought its own lawsuit on whether it had any obligation to pay SK for network usage, arguing Netflix's duty ends with creating content and leaving it accessible. It said SK's expenses were incurred while fulfilling its contractual obligations to Internet users, and delivery in the Internet world is ""free of charge as a principle"", according to court documents. 
But the Seoul Central District Court ruled against Netflix in June, saying that SK is seen as providing ""a service provided at a cost"" and it is ""reasonable"" for Netflix to be ""obligated to provide something in return for the service"". 
SK estimated the network usage fee Netflix needed to pay was about 27.2 billion won ($22.9 million) in 2020 alone, the court document said. 
Netflix has appealed against the ruling, court records showed, with fresh proceedings to start in late December. 
Netflix said in a statement on Wednesday that it contributed to the creation of about 16,000 jobs in South Korea stemming from about 770 billion won in investments, as well as an economic effect of about 5.6 trillion won. 
Ruling party lawmaker Kim Sang-hee said on Wednesday that out of South Korea's top 10 data traffic generators, 78.5% of the traffic came from foreign content providers, up from 73.1% a year earlier, with ""Google-YouTube and Netflix that account for the majority turning a blind eye to network usage fees"". 
In the United States, Netflix had paid a fee to broadband provider Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) for faster streaming speeds. https://reut.rs/2Y8wOzb

A Netflix spokesperson said in a statement it no longer pays Comcast for network access and it works closely with thousands of internet service providers around the world to ease network congestion and lower internet transit costs.

J&J has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a shot of its own single-dose vaccine as the booster dose. The FDA's advisers are set to consider the need on Friday.
The NIH will present the mix-and-match data to the FDA panel on Friday, Axios said.
There were limitations to the NIH data, according to the report. Neutralizing antibodies only prevent the virus from entering cells and replicating, and the report said it was unclear how long the response will last.
The NIH, FDA and J&J did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Two-dose vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc use the mRNA technology.

The health regulator's outside experts will also discuss the need for an additional dose of Moderna's vaccine on Friday. 
Scientists at the FDA have said Moderna had not met all of the agency's criteria to support use of booster doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, possibly because the efficacy of the shot's first two doses has remained strong.

SEOUL (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Tuesday its battery partner, South Korea's LG Electronics Inc, had agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion estimated in costs and expenses associated with the recall of Bolt electric vehicles.
The U.S. automaker did not say how much LG would pay but said it will recognize an estimated recovery in the third-quarter earnings that will offset $1.9 billion of the total charges associated with the recall.
It follows announcements earlier in the day by GM's battery suppliers LG Chem Ltd and LG Electronics that the two South Korean firms will shoulder a combined $1.2 billion of costs associated with the recall.
GM expanded the recall, which will replace LG battery modules due to the risk of fire, in August to more than 140,000 cars.
The agreement with LG is a major step for GM in resolving an embarrassing episode that forced it to ask Bolt owners parking in decks do so on the top floor or on an open level, and at least 50 feet away from other vehicles, due to the fire risks.
LG said the final recall costs are still subject to change, depending on the number of battery modules replaced.
""While the recall measures will (proceed) with complete replacement of battery packs and modules made for the early models of batteries, the more recently manufactured battery modules will be selectively replaced following diagnostic software screening,"" LG Chem's unlisted battery unit LG Energy Solution said in a statement. 
It said LG and GM conducted joint analysis and found two rare defects as the cause of the fires - a torn anode and a folded separator.
Replacement and repairing work are expected to begin this month and it is collaborating with LG to accelerate production of new battery modules, GM said.
GM and LG Energy Solution are building two joint-venture U.S. battery plants.
LG Chem and LG Electronics said on Tuesday that they booked most of their 1.4 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in costs in the July-September quarter although some were booked in the previous quarter.
For the latest quarter, LG Chem will take a charge of 620 billion won while LG Electronics, which assembles the cells into battery modules and packs, will book 480 billion won in costs.
Shares of LG Chem and LG Electronics closed up 4.2% and 3.3%, respectively, on Tuesday with investors relieved there was less uncertainty over the recall costs. GM shares closed up 1.5%, after rising more than 2% earlier in the day. 

LG Energy Solution added it plans to resume working on its initial public offering, which had been suspended in August due to the lack of clarity over the recall costs.

Inflation data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, will be released on Thursday. Concerns about indebted Chinese developers also increased as Sinic Holdings Group Co. Ltd. (HK:2103) became the latest one to warn of imminent default.
Hong Kong markets were closed due to a typhoon.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 0.11% while South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.15%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.12%.
U.S. shares were down, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares down as the company will likely cut its 2021 iPhone 13 production targets due to chip shortages.
Investors also nervously await corporate earnings releases due later in the week, with economic growth slowing and inflation increasing just as central banks prepare to begin asset tapering.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield slipped further below 1.60%, while the yield curve flattened. Crude oil paused its recent rally amid the ongoing global energy crunch.
“I think that some of these topics like inflation, the 10-year, COVID-19 variants, the future of corporate taxes, of course they are going to weigh on the market, but I still think that we are in an economic recovery,” Defiance ETFs chief investment officer and co-founder Sylvia Jablonski told Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell on Tuesday called on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to preserve all documents related to a testimony last week from company whistleblower Frances Haugen.
""The testimony ... raises significant concerns about whether Facebook has misled the public, federal regulators, and this committee,"" said Cantwell, a Democrat. ""This committee will continue its oversight and work to pursue legislation to protect consumers’ privacy, improve data security, and strengthen federal enforcement to address the digital harms that are the subject of these hearings.""
She asked Facebook to preserve and retain internal Facebook research referenced by Haugen and Facebook’s evaluation of the research; ranking or composition systems; experiments or recommendations to change those ranking systems and the impact of Facebook’s platforms on children and teenagers under the age of 18.
Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in response the company has ""absolutely no commercial incentive, no moral incentive, no company-wide incentive to do anything other than to try to give the maximum number of people as much of a positive experience as possible on Facebook.""
Cantwell's letter cited ""the potential danger that social media platforms pose for spreading divisive content was demonstrated, with horrifying consequences, by the role the Facebook platform played in fomenting ethnic violence against the Rohingya.""
She added ""the role of Facebook’s platform in the Rohingya tragedy illustrates the horrible consequences that failing to effectively limit the spread of divisive content on social media platforms can have in inflicting public harm."" 
Last month, a U.S. judge ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media giant had shut down, rejecting its argument about protecting privacy as ""rich with irony.""
Last week, the Commerce Committee harshly criticized Facebook, accusing Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.
Zuckerberg defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals.

Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them.
Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents.

The White House announced the Dec. 8 deadline for employees of federal contractors last month and the requirements are expected to cover millions of employees.
Government contractors International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp have also said they will require all U.S. employees to be vaccinated. The White House is adding clauses to future government contracts mandating inoculations.
Steve Cave, a King & Spalding attorney who specializes in government contracts, told Reuters last month he expects the order will affect tens of millions of U.S. workers or more.

The Labor Department separately plans to issue an emergency temporary standard (ETS) requiring employers with more than 100 workers to have them inoculated or tested weekly - a policy expected to cover more than 80 million workers.
But that has still not gone to the White House regulatory office for review, suggesting the ETS is still at least weeks away.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday, extending losses late as investors grew more jittery in the run up to third-quarter earnings, while a jump in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares helped support the market.
Adding to investor caution, the Federal Reserve is expected to release minutes on Wednesday from its last policy meeting, which market participants will scour for hints about when the U.S. central bank could begin tapering its massive bond-buying program.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in the red with the Dow down the most, weighed by healthcare and industrials.
Earnings unofficially kick off this week with results from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Wednesday and other banks to follow. JPMorgan's shares shed 0.8% on the day, while the S&P 500 banks index edged down 0.6%.
Analysts expect to see strong U.S. profit growth for the third quarter. But a number of companies have warned of issues and investors are worried about how supply chain problems and higher prices will affect businesses emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.
""For the most part, institutional portfolio managers are of the view - let's see what earnings look like and how much of a negative impact is being seen from shortages, higher rates and supply chain bottlenecks,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""A lot of those factors are currently reflected where equity prices are now.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 117.72 points, or 0.34%, to 34,378.34, the S&P 500 lost 10.54 points, or 0.24%, to 4,350.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 20.28 points, or 0.14%, to 14,465.93.
Six of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with communications services suffering the steepest percentage loss.
Tesla advanced 1.7% after data showed the electric vehicle maker sold 56,006 China-made vehicles in September, the highest since it started production in Shanghai about two years ago. The company's shares provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group rose 0.8% after the company estimated a smaller-than-expected adjusted loss for the third quarter and signaled improved bookings for the rest of the year.
MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) surged 9.6% after of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) upgraded the stock to ""outperform"" from ""neutral.""
 Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) gained 2.0% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) initiated coverage with a ""buy"" recommendation.
Investors also weighed comments from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, who said the central bank has all but met its employment goal for reducing its bond buying program. 
U.S. data showed the labor market remained tight, with a record number of Americans quitting their jobs and job vacancies numbering more than 10 million, stoking inflation fears as employers hike wages to attract and retain workers.
Wednesday's consumer price index report will attract attention from investors seeking clues about inflation.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 94 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.17 billion shares, compared with the 10.80 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

But while Camber Energy’s stock has almost doubled in price over the last six months, Clean Energy Fuels shares have gained approximately 8% in the last month. Several stocks that trend on Reddit are not viable long-term bets, making the recent uptick unsustainable in many if not most cases.

The stock has grossly underperformed broader indexes, such as the S&P 500, over the last 10 years, burning investor wealth in the process. Read on.One of the most important concepts for successful investing is portfolio diversification. In the event one has $100 or even $100,000 to invest, one needs to apportion investment capital according to risk appetite and gain exposure to multiple asset classes, such as equities, bonds, gold, real estate, and cryptocurrencies.
Further, one’s stock exposure should include companies across sizes and sectors. For example, a blue-chip large-cap company such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will offer investors a generous dividend yield. In contrast, a growth stock like  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) will help grow wealth at an attractive rate over time.
One can also diversify a portfolio by purchasing shares of companies such as Banco Bradesco (BBD) that have a bulk of their operations in another country, further diversifying overall risk. So, let’s see if Banco Bradesco stock should be part of one’s portfolio right now.

That means investors should consider growth stocks in sectors with the highest growth potential. Three great examples are as Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), Greif Inc. (NYSE:GEF), and  Westlake Chemical  Corporation (NYSE:WLK).A catalyst that I believe will positively impact stock prices in the fourth quarter 2021 is Q3 earning season which kicks off this week. This year’s first and second quarter finished with the average year-over-year earnings growth rates for the S&P 500 of 52.3% and 90.9%. While I don't expect that same kind of growth this quarter, growth is still expected to be strong. 
Right now, according to FactSet, the estimated year-over-year earnings growth rate for the third quarter is 27.6%. This would be the third-highest earnings growth rate since 2010. Considering that the actual figure has historically been a little higher than the estimate, the average growth could be as high as 35%, making it the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth above 30%.
If we dig deeper into the sectors with the highest growth estimates, Materials and Industrials are way ahead. That's why investors should consider stocks in these sectors, such as Ryder System, Inc. (R), Greif Inc. (GEF), and Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK) that have high estimated earnings growth for the third quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shares slipped on Tuesday in choppy trade, as investors waited for businesses to report how rising prices have hit their latest earnings, while bond yields spiked and the dollar shone on bets that monetary policy will soon be tightened.
Indeed, two U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers said on Tuesday that the central bank has kept pace with a planned move to reduce its bond buying program, cementing expectations that the Fed will start withdrawing its crisis-era stimulus as soon as next month.
Soaring oil prices largely held on to recent gains, while U.S. stock indices vacillated repeatedly between modest gains and losses before a flurry of third-quarter bank earnings reports from Wall Street on Wednesday and Thursday.
After watching oil prices steadily gallop higher in the past 18 months, many investors now worry that rising prices are exacerbating supply bottlenecks, weighing on businesses and crimping economic growth.
Coal prices are at a record peak, and while gas prices are off recent highs, they remain four times higher in Europe than at the start of the year. 
The impact of supply crunches in power and manufacturing components is showing up in data - figures on Tuesday showed Japanese wholesale inflation hit 13-year highs last month, British shoppers slashed spending, China recorded a 20% drop in car sales, and bottlenecks dragged German economic sentiment down for a fifth month.
""We are in a sort of a holding pattern until we see the results,"" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. 
""We are seeing some downgrades on U.S. growth, and the impact on businesses will be the thing to watch.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.34%, the S&P 500 lost 0.24%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.14%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.07% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.31%.
Oil prices were mostly steady. U.S. crude was little changed at $80.50 per barrel, while Brent crude rose above $84 a barrel briefly before shedding 0.5% at $83.27. 
With businesses hit by persistent supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures, the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the global economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is being constrained, and cut growth outlooks for the United States and other major industrial powers.
Given rising expectations that accelerating inflation will prompt central banks such as the Fed to rein in ultra-loose policies, benchmark bond yields rose in anticipation of tighter monetary conditions.
Two-year Treasury yields, which have climbed as much as 100 basis points in October along, jumped to 0.3419%, a level last seen in March 2020. 
In keeping with concerns that soaring prices could crimp economic activity and prompt central banks to raise interest rates down the road, the yield curve flattened, and benchmark 10-year yields retreated to 1.5751%, from 1.605% late on Friday. 
Treasury yields https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lbvgnonqlpq/Pasted%20image%201633986113887.png

The dollar index rose 0.149%, and a stronger dollar nudged the euro down 0.27% to $1.1526. The Japanese yen weakened 0.31% versus the greenback to 113.62 per dollar. 
Gold, usually seen as a hedge against inflation, shone on Tuesday despite dollar strength. 

Spot gold added 0.3% to $1,759.85 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.34% to $1,760.60 an ounce.

Tesla's expansion in Palo Alto came even after CEO Elon Musk announced last week that the company was moving its headquarters from Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas.
The person said Tesla does not have enough space for its current offices, which led the company to secure an additional site.
Earlier, real estate news provider the Registry reported Tesla has leased 325,000 square feet at 1501 Page Mill Road from HP Inc, citing sources with knowledge of the leasing market. 
Musk has said Tesla will keep expanding activities in California, including boosting output for its car factory in Fremont and its battery plant in Nevada by 50%. 
Musk, who had said the Texas move was due to lack of space at the Fremont factory and expensive housing prices in California, did not elaborate on how many people would move to Texas.

Tesla has 12,000 employees in the San Francisco Bay area, including 750 in Palo Alto, according to estimates by Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies. 
Neither Tesla nor HP were immediately available for comment. HP Inc, a pioneer of Silicon Valley, is headquartered in Palo Alto, but its spinoff Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has moved its headquarters to Texas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said it expects ""more normal"" operations on Tuesday after it canceled more than 2,200 flights since Saturday.
The U.S. airline said had approximately 90 cancellations on Tuesday out of almost 3,300 flights scheduled.
Southwest shares were up 1.3%.
The airline's massive cancellations over the weekend were not tied to any pilot protests over Southwest's decision last week to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for all employees by Dec. 8 under an executive order signed by President Joe Biden, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly told CNBC on Tuesday.
He said employee behavior had been ""all very normal... It just takes several days to catch up.""
In June, Southwest canceled hundreds of flights because of a computer reservation issue. The prior day in June, Southwest reported a separate issue that required a groundstop after its ""weather data provider experienced intermittent performance issues.""
""It's been a rough summer and I'm not offering any excuses,"" Kelly told CNBC. ""We definitely have some staffing challenges as well, so we have moderated our flight and accelerated our hiring plans.""
Kelly said, ""we were thinly staffed coming into the weekend and that certainly didn't help things."" 
Kelly said ""like a lot of companies, we definitely are having some hiring challenges. We're trying to get 5,000 people hired by the end of this year, we're about halfway there."" 
The Federal Aviation Administration said late Monday ""to be clear: None of the information from Southwest, its pilots union, or the FAA indicates that this weekend’s cancellations were related to vaccine mandates.""

Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott, responding to what he called ""bullying"" by the Biden administration, on Monday barred all COVID-19 vaccine mandates in the state by any entity, including private employers.
Southwest said on Tuesday it was aware of Abbott's order but said ""federal action supersedes any state mandate or law, and we would be expected to comply with the president's order to remain compliant as a federal contractor.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition agreed on Tuesday to create a five-member commission to investigate the situation at fertilizer producer Monomeros, which is being overseen by Colombian regulators, and then restructure the company.
Colombia's Superintendency of Companies, which performs inspection and oversight duties of businesses, said in September it would oversee the operations of Monomeros, a subsidiary of a unit owned by Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA.
The former chair of the board of the company then resigned, saying Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's demand for control of Monomeros further upset the company's finances and contributed to the regulator's intervention.
The commission, appointed by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, is authorized to travel to Colombia to investigate what caused the company's financial woes, said opposition leader Juan Guaido.
""This deal should lead to immediate action to protect the asset,"" said Guaido during a video meeting of the assembly. ""We can't avoid one or two bad apples, but it is possible to take action, denounce and make a clear distinction about what has destroyed this country.""
The board in control of the company was appointed by Guaido in 2019, when Colombia, the United States and dozens of others recognized him as Venezuela's rightful leader, labeling Maduro a dictator who rigged his 2018 re-election.
Maduro, asserting the election was fair, remains in office despite U.S. sanctions and diplomatic pressure while international mediators facilitate negotiations to end the political crisis.
Maduro has said he will use the negotiations to demand that Monomeros and U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, also controlled by the opposition, be put under his government's control. 

The commission will have 10 days to conduct its investigation, opposition lawmaker Juan Pablo Guanipa said during the session.
The assembly is expected to shortly name a new director for Monomeros.

(Reuters) -A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that New York state cannot impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on healthcare workers without allowing their employers to consider religious exemption requests.
U.S. District Judge David Hurd in Albany, New York, ruled that the state's workplace vaccination requirement conflicted with healthcare workers' federally protected right to seek religious accommodations from their employers.
The ruling provides a test case as vaccine mandate opponents gear up to fight plans by President Joe Biden's administration to extend COVID-19 inoculation requirements to tens of millions of unvaccinated Americans.
Vaccines have become highly politicized in the United States, where only 66% of Americans are vaccinated, well short of the initial goals of the Biden administration.
Seventeen healthcare workers opposed to the mandate sued, saying the requirement violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution and a federal civil rights law requiring employers to reasonably accommodate employees' religious beliefs.
Hurd agreed, saying the state's order ""clearly"" conflicted with their right to seek religious accommodations. 
""The court rightly recognized that yesterday's 'front line heroes' in dealing with COVID cannot suddenly be treated as disease-carrying villains and kicked to the curb by the command of a state health bureaucracy,"" said Christopher Ferrara, a lawyer for the workers at the conservative Thomas More Society.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, vowed in a statement to fight the decision, saying her ""responsibility as governor is to protect the people of this state, and requiring health care workers to get vaccinated accomplishes that."" 
At least 24 states have imposed vaccine requirements on workers, usually in healthcare. 

New York's Department of Health on Aug. 26 ordered healthcare professionals to be vaccinated by Sept. 27 and the order did not allow for the customary religious exemptions.
Hurd issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 14 in favor of the workers while he considered whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the July-September quarter totaled $18.5 billion, down 44% from the second quarter, even as it beat the five-year quarterly average M&A value. 
""The sense of urgency seems to have left the deal market,"" Enverus director Andrew Dittmar said. 
""Through the end of the year, we are likely to see mostly smaller-sized asset deals as companies trim their portfolios with the chance of an occasional larger public company merger or private E&P sale.""
Oil producer Conocophillips (NYSE:COP) led the quarterly ranks, the Enverus report showed, after it bought oil giant Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's assets in the Delaware Basin for $9.5 billion in September. 
Deals by private equity firms saw an uptick as they bought assets that oil companies deemed as non-core to their development plans, the report said, adding that such privately funded buyers increased their share of acquisitions to about one-fifth by value. 

These assets tended to lay outside oil-prolific areas like the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. 
""It was inevitable that the hungriest buyers and sellers would find their deals and activity would revert back toward the average. We seem to be hitting that inflection point,"" Dittmar said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) said on Tuesday that a vote to remove the United Steelworkers union (USW) from representing locked-out workers at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery would go forward no matter the outcome of a contract ratification vote next week by those same workers.
USW Local 13-243 announced on Monday night that Beaumont refinery and lubricant oil plant workers would take their first vote on an Exxon contract offer on Oct. 19, six months after they were locked out of their jobs and 10 months after negotiations began.
Since the lockout, Exxon has kept the 369,024 barrel-per-day refinery, which produces Mobil 1 motor oil, in operation at a reduced production level, with managers and supervisors supported by some temporary replacement workers.
The company has repeatedly criticized the length of time the union has taken to vote on the contract.
""Regardless of the status of a ratification vote, or end of the lockout, the employee-led decertification process will continue per the guidelines of the (U.S. National Labor Relations Board),"" Exxon said in a statement.
The union views the contract vote and decertification vote, which has yet to be scheduled by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), as two separate issues, said Bryan Gross, USW international representative, in Beaumont.
""We still have to represent the members,"" Gross said on Tuesday in a telephone interview. ""The decertification vote is still months away.""
At least 30% of the 650 workers represented by the USW at Beaumont have submitted a petition for decertification, for reasons that are unclear. The NLRB is verifying the signatures, Gross said.
The USW in April filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging Exxon had violated federal law by providing an employee with decertification materials. The NLRB has yet to rule.
An NLRB spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. 

""As for the company's offer, we think it's subpar,"" Gross said. ""But it's up to the members to decide.""
The USW has opposed Exxon's contract offer because it would eliminate job seniority and remove lead operators on units. Exxon in September modified its offer to increase job protection for lubricant plant workers.

A former U.S Air Force captain, Horn joined Disney in 2012 and led the integration of Marvel Studios, home to some of the biggest box-office successes worldwide. Horn also oversaw ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" - the highest-grossing domestic release in history.
Horn's departure is the latest in a series of management changes at Disney as the company shifts its strategy from big screen to streaming. In 2020, Bob Chapek took over as CEO, replacing Bob Iger who took on the role of executive chairman.
Disney named Horn chairman of Disney Studios in 2012 but he started splitting duties along with longtime executive Alan Bergman in the last two years. Horn led the unit as its chief creative officer most recently.

Before joining Disney, Horn was credited with the success of the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, ""Seinfeld"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"".
Other Disney executives who have announced plans to leave by the end of this year include Alan Braverman, Disney's general counsel, Zenia Mucha, the company's head of communications and Gary Marsh, the president and chief creative officer of Disney Branded Television.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>",China's property sector stalked by Evergrande default fears,"By Clare Jim, Andrew Galbraith and Marc Jones
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Debt-saddled Chinese property firms took heavy fire in bond markets on Tuesday, after the poster child of the sector's woes, Evergrande Group, missed its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and others warned of defaults. 
A wave of developers face payment deadlines before the end of the year and with Evergrande's fate looking increasingly bleak, fears are mounting of a wider crisis.
Weary Evergrande bondholders still haven't received almost $150 million worth of coupon payments that had been due on Monday, although there was little surprise after the firm had skipped two other payments in recent weeks. 
Evergrande didn't reply to a Reuters request for comment. It has maintained radio silence for weeks and markets are now counting down to a Oct. 18-19 deadline when it will be formally declared in default if it still hasn't stumped up. 
""It is pretty serious now and it looks like it is going to be long and drawn out process,"" said London-based Trium Capital fund manager Peter Kisler about Evergrande and the wider crisis. 
""I don't see the recovery being particularly high,"" he said referring to what Evergrande bondholders would get if Evergrande gets broken up. ""I think 20 cents (for every dollar of the bonds' original face value) is more or less fair."" 
The IMF said on Tuesday that China has the ability to address the issues linked to Evergrande's indebtedness, with the fiscal capacity and the legal and institutional tools.
The IMF's report, however, said that while contagion so far has been limited to other financially weak property developers and lower-rated firms, if the situation were to ""escalate, there is a risk that broader financial stress may emerge.""
Problems have already spread well beyond just Evergrande. 
Mid-sized rival Fantasia also missed a payment and Modern Land and Sinic Holdings are trying to delay deadlines that would still most likely be classed as a default by the main rating agencies.
Star stock picker Cathie Wood of ARK Invest seperately cautioned of an economic slowdown in China that could ripple through the global economy and weigh on commodity prices and growth.
LOOMING DEADLINES 
Refinitiv data shows there is at least $92.3 billion worth of Chinese property developers' bonds coming due next year.
Seaport Global's EM Corporate Credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said the key dates and payments to watch this year were:
Oct. 15 - Shimao $820 million
Oct. 15 - Xinyuan $229 million 
Oct. 18 - Sinic $244 million
Oct. 27 - Seazen Holdings $100 million
Nov. 8 - Central China Real Estate $400 million
Nov. 18 - Agile $200 million
Nov. 18 - Zhenro $200 million
Dec. 3 - Ronshine China $150 million
Dec. 7 - Kaisa $400 million
Dec. 17 - Fantasia $249 million 
The $5 trillion Chinese property sector, accounts for around a quarter of the Chinese economy by some metrics and is often a major factor in Beijing policymaking.
""We see more defaults ahead if the liquidity problem does not improve markedly,"" said brokerage CGS-CIMB in a note, adding developers with weaker credit ratings would find it very difficult to refinance debt at the moment.
Shanghai Stock Exchange data showed the top five losers among exchange-traded bonds in morning deals were all issued by property firms. 
Modern Land's dollar bond due for repayment in 2023 plunged 25% to 32.250 cents on the dollar, while Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, and Greenland Holdings, which wants to build western Europe's tallest residential building, both saw more savage selling.
It wasn't all one-way traffic. Sinic's bond due in 2022 rose 12% to 19.35 cents. That still left its yield - a proxy of its likely borrowing cost if it were to try and tap financial markets - at over 1,380%. Some of Central China Real Estate's bonds due next month also gained.
Modern Land, whose shares dropped over 3% to new low on Tuesday, asked bondholders on Monday to delay for three months a repayment due later this month, while Sinic said it would likely default next week.
BROADER FALLOUT?
Market indicators also show how contagion is slowly spreading to other high yield markets in the developing world.
Trium's Kisler highlighted how most emerging market companies whose yields were already around the 10% mark have been hit and even riskier sovereign markets like Ecuador may be suffering some blowback.
The cost of insuring against a China sovereign default also continued to rise on Tuesday, with 5-year credit default swaps - which investors typically use as a hedge against rising risk - hitting their highest since April 2020.
Shares of several other property firms, however, fared better as markets bet on more loosening of policies following northeastern city of Harbin's measures to support developers and their projects.

Top developers Country Garden and Sunac China both rose 2% despite a 1% drop in the wider market.
Evergrande's electric vehicles unit also jumped over 10% after it vowed to start producing cars next year.

567,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 04:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive-U.S. SEC opens inquiry into Wall Street banks' staff communications -sources,"By Chris Prentice and Jody Godoy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opened a broad inquiry into how Wall Street banks are keeping track of employees' digital communications, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
SEC enforcement staff contacted multiple banks in recent weeks to check whether they have been adequately documenting employees' work-related communications, such as text messages and emails, with a focus on their personal devices, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The industry ""sweep"" is a further sign that the SEC is ramping up enforcement under its Democratic leadership, and highlights the challenges Wall Street banks face keeping track of staff communications in the work-from-home pandemic era.
The SEC periodically conducts sweeps to quickly gather information on issues it suspects may be widespread. Sweeps can sometimes, although not necessarily, lead to formal probes.
The sweep appears to stem from a probe the agency has been conducting for some time into an individual financial institution, two of the sources said, without naming the firm. 
In August, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) disclosed that it had been fielding regulatory inquiries concerning its ""compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic messaging channels"" that the bank had not approved. It said it was discussing a ""resolution"" with regulators, without specifying which ones.
Spokespeople for the SEC and JPMorgan declined to comment. 
The SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, require broker-dealers to keep records of all business-related communications. Banks have to walk a fine line to comply with those requirements without infringing upon employees' privacy, said one of the sources. 
In the United States, there is no clear-cut legal basis on which an employer can demand to inspect employees' personal communications, while in other countries doing so may breach data protection statutes, the source said.
As a result, many financial firms ban the use of personal email, texts and other social media channels for work purposes, but keeping up with a proliferation of communication apps -- especially during the pandemic -- is a challenge for companies.
In a speech last week, the SEC's head of enforcement Gurbir Grewal warned that institutions should stay on top of the many ""issues raised by the increased use of personal devices, new communications channels, and other technological developments."" For speech - https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/grewal-pli-broker-dealer-regulation-and-enforcement-100621 

Failure to retain and produce communication records can impede regulatory investigations, Grewal said in the remarks.
Last year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fired two top executives due to the unauthorized use of WhatsApp to discuss work matters.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Tuesday, as investors had to contend with another day of wild swings just a day ahead of the start of quarterly earnings, and an update on inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.34%, or 118 points, the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.14%.
Investors continued to keep their powder dry, with just a day to go until major Wall Street banks kick off the quarterly earnings season in earnest.
Banking stocks are up about 40% for the year so far, as the favorable backdrop of rising rates continues to support the sector.  
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) reports third-quarter results Wednesday, followed by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Thursday.
Loan growth, which has slumped since the pandemic and been slow to recover, will likely be one of the closely watched metrics.
Big tech traded mostly lower, struggling to shake off the sluggish start to the week even as Treasury yields, the foe of growth stocks, fell.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in the red, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was in the green.
Apple, meanwhile, said it plans to launch an event on Oct. 18, during which the company could unveil new MacBook laptops and AirPods headphones.
Tech was also dragged lower by fall in iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), paced by a decline in Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) on concerns about margin pressures in the memory-chip market amid supply chain woes.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.6% following auction results that showed demand for the note remained strong.
Ahead of the inflation report due Wednesday, Fed members continue to flag above-trend inflation as a concern.
“Underlining inflation is indeed above the committees 2% objective,” Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Tuesday. “Severe and pervasive supply chain issues will probably last longer than initially expected.
Concerns about persistent inflation come at time when global growth is expected to slow, exacerbating investor fears of stagflation.
The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global gross domestic product by 0.1% to 5.9% for this year from 6.0% in July.
The U.S. is expected to report Wednesday that consumer price index for the 12 months through September rose by 5.3%. The sharp pace of inflation, however, will eventually fade as supply starts to catch up with strong demand.
""In the US, the growth slowdown has bottomed, the unemployment rate continues to decline, and much – though by no means all – of the surge in inflation will fade next year,"" Morgan Stanley said. 
""We find little in the outlook to support the theory [of US stagflation] and believe the role of demand is underappreciated,” it added.
In Washington, the House is expected to vote on and pass the $480 billion short-term debt ceiling hike later Tuesday, providing the U.S. with funding until early December. The legislative measure needs to be signed into law before the Oct. 18 deadline to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -More than 100 U.S. House lawmakers on Tuesday urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to keep a $4,500 tax credit incentive for union-built electric vehicles (EV) in a massive spending bill.
In a letter seen by Reuters, 107 Democrats urged Pelosi to retain the credit supported by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, the AFL-CIO and U.S. automakers. The $4,500 credit would provide a significant boost to Detroit's three automakers -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis.
""We strongly support leveling the playing field between non-union and unionized workforces by including the added $4,500 incentive to support union-made EVs,"" the letter said led by Representative Thomas Suozzi.
Suozzi said the incentives ""help guarantee that working men and women are an integral part of that success story.""
Pelosi's office declined to comment.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and foreign automakers do not have unions representing assembly workers in the United States and many have fought efforts to organize U.S. plants.
Last month, 12 major foreign automakers, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Honda Motor, Hyundai Motor and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor, urged Democrats to reject the proposed $4,500 tax incentive and have been lobbying lawmakers to reject the union incentive.
A House panel last month approved legislation to boost EV credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries.
The foreign automakers said the proposal ""would unfairly disadvantage American workers who have chosen not to join a union and produce more than half of all vehicles in the United States and the vast majority of American-made EVs.""
The tax credits, which are part of proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years.

The EV proposal also does away with phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible again, along with Tesla, although Tesla would not receive the $4,500 credit.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk suggested on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) last month the EV proposal was ""written by Ford/UAW lobbyists... Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank's will boost its climate financing goals by $20 billion to a new target of $100 billion for the 2019-2030 period and aims to launch its concept for retiring coal-fired power plants at the COP26 climate conference in Scotland next month, the lender's chief said on Tuesday.
The plans, disclosed by ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa in an interview with Reuters, increase a previous $80 billion goal for climate financing for developing countries in Asia for the decade announced in 2018.
""The fight against climate change will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific, and we are committed to serving as a climate bank and a long term climate partner for our region,"" Asakawa said.
The additional $20 billion in financing support will provide support for climate mitigation efforts including low-carbon energy sources, climate adaptation projects and private sector projects.
Asakawa said ADB now plans for $66 billion for climate mitigation financing through 2030, including for new energy storage, energy efficiency and low-carbon transportation investments. The Manila-based lender will plan for climate adaptation financing of $34 billion, including agriculture, urban and water adaptation projects. 
The bank also plans to boost its private sector operations to attract more private sector capital to finance new climate technologies and innovations, using $12 billion from its balance sheet to attract up to $30 billion in new private capital, due to increased demand for such financing, Asakawa said.
The plans were presented on Tuesday to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who had convened a meeting with multilateral development banks, including ADB and the World Bank, to discuss their efforts to boost climate financing in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.
COAL PLANT RETIREMENTS 
Reuters first reported https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/exclusive-citi-hsbc-prudential-hatch-plan-asian-coal-fired-closures-sources-2021-08-03 in August that ADB was working with major financial firms to develop a mechanism to buy up coal-fired power plants in Asia and retire them early to shrink the biggest source of carbon emissions.
Asakawa said the group has finished an initial feasibility study and is now embarking on a longer study of the concept in three target countries -- Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia.
The initial feasibility study provided a framework for the ADB to engage with a broad set of country, regional and global stakeholders to support the transition from coal to clean energy. Asakawa said that interest is growing among other developing countries to join the initiative at a later date.
ADB and its partners, including British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK), lenders Citi and HSBC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Real Assets, are aiming to complete and launch a pilot investment fund in 2022 and make its initial power plant purchase next year or early 2023.
The concept is not included in the ADB's overall climate financing goals, because most of the money will come from private investors and donor sources, including philanthropists, Asakawa said.
A study by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimated that retiring half the coal power plants in Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam would require as much as $55 billion in financing, requiring strong support from Southeast Asian governments to attract financing.
The ADB will announce the partnership to design and establish the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) at COP26. 

""Even now, some philanthropists have already shown interest in investing in this new initiative. So we plan to launch the ETM at COP26 in Glasgow,"" Asakawa said.
Asakawa added he hopes to be able to present the plans along with Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Philippines Finance Minister Carlos Dominguez.

Investors are bracing for comments by CEOs this earnings season, expecting to hear about the effects of rising energy costs, supply chain bottlenecks and scarce materials. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) kicks off the big bank earnings on Wednesday.
Reuters reported that analysts expect a 29.6% year-over-year increase in profit for S&P 500 companies in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday.
There are a number of economic reports this week, as well, including the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting. Investors will be scouring it for hints at the central bank’s thinking on the taper timeline.
This week also brings reports on consumer prices and retail sales. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. JP Morgan earnings
JPMorgan is expected to report profit per share of $3 on revenue of $29.86 billion for the third quarter. Analysts will be listening to CEO Jamie Dimon’s thoughts on the state of the economy, and the outlook for consumer and business borrowing.
2. Delta earnings
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) is seen posting a third-quarter profit of 16 cents and revenue of $8.41 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The travel industry has been struggling to recover from the pandemic, so analysts will be listening for what the airline says about bookings going into the holiday season and business travel trends.
3. Consumer prices
Core CPI is seen rising by 4% year-on-year in September, unchanged from August’s 4% increment. On a month-on-month basis, it is expected to have risen at a faster clip of 0.2% compared to August’s 0.1%. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
September consumer prices are expected to have risen by 5.3% year-on-year, the same pace as August’s. On a month-on-month basis also, CPI is seen having risen by the same rate as August’s 0.3%.

Those investors holding producers have had an even tougher time, with the Gold Miners Index (GDX (NYSE:GDX)) down 15% year-to-date. However, with many generalist investors throwing in the towel and even gold bugs beginning to rethink their loyalty to the trade, the end of the correction is likely near. This sense of despair is corroborated by bullish sentiment readings, which have dropped to their lowest readings since 2018. Let’s take a closer look below:

As evidenced by the above chart, gold is an emotional trade, with sentiment swinging from one extreme to another more than 14 times over the past decade. However, while we’ve seen multiple readings of extreme pessimism since 2012, all of these readings except one (Q3 2018) occurred in the 2012-2016 secular bear market.

LVMH, whose luxury products span Moët & Chandon champagne and Bulgari timepieces, said on Tuesday the popularity of its star labels Louis Vuitton and Dior helped its fashion and leather goods division, which accounts for nearly half of group sales, to report 24% growth.
Revenues for this business at the end of the quarter were 38% above their pre-pandemic, 2019 level, the same rate as in the first half. 
The luxury goods industry has bounced back strongly from the health crisis, even if international travel, a key growth driver in pre-pandemic times, has not fully resumed.
LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said revenue growth in Asia had been under pressure in August due to anti-coronavirus restrictions being partially re-imposed in some countries but said the group had not noticed a change in consumer behavior in China.
A call by China’s President Xi Jinping in August for ""common prosperity"" and wealth redistribution had prompted investors' to worry that Beijing might promote measures aimed at reducing the country’s wealth gap, curbing high-end consumption in the world's largest luxury market. 
""We don’t see any reason that this could be detrimental to the upper middle class that is the bulk of our customer base,"" Guiony said.
Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein, was positive on the strong revenue performance at the fashion and leather goods business.
""We believe this should comes as a relief to investors, especially after the August wobble in the sector and doubts on Chinese demand trends and even if other divisions reduce their growth versus 2019 in the third quarter.”
The company's performance showed a marked improvement in Europe in the third quarter, even without deep-pocketed visitors from Asia, as local travel resumed over the summer.
LVMH recorded 28% revenue growth in the United States, compared with a 60% rise in the first half of the year, and 12% in Asia, excluding Japan, compared with 70% in the first six months of the year. 
Guiony said the group had no supply chain issues given its manufacturing is largely based in Europe and also brushed off concerns about rising shipping costs, noting that the group has sufficient margins to cope.

Investing.com — Cryptocurrency exchange  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN) announced Tuesday it is planning to launch Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace for minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs.
Coinbase said its marketplace will make NFT's (or non-fungible tokens) more accessible through its user-friendly interface that will also include social features.
The company's shares are down almost 3% on Tuesday.
""Creating an NFT should be as simple as tapping a few buttons. Anything more complicated is a barrier to creativity. Coinbase NFT will be a peer-to-peer marketplace that empowers the imagination,"" the company said in a statement. 
The company will initially launch the platform with Ethereum based ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards with a plan for multi-chain support not long after. 
Sales of NFTs have surged this year, with NFT trading volume climbing to $10.67 billion in the third quarter of this year, a 704% increase from the second quarter, according to DappRadar. Ethereum accounted for 77.73% of the volume. Additionally, the blockchain industry as a whole grew 25% quarter-over-quarter. 
Other exchanges such as Binance already have NFT marketplaces, and the Coinbase NFT platform would help the company diversify its revenue and help ease the reliance on its exchange fees. 
""Our ambition with Coinbase NFT is to allow everyone to benefit from their creative spark; to contribute to a future where the “creator economy” isn’t a small subset of the “real” economy, but a central driver."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department Office of Inspector General said Tuesday it will audit the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) efforts to ensure adequate air traffic control staffing.
The inspector general's office noted that since March 2020, FAA has been forced at times to partially shut towers and radar control facilities because of COVID-19 cases and faces veteran controllers leaving for various reasons, including retirements. 
The audit will assess ""FAA’s efforts to ensure that critical air traffic control facilities have an adequate number 
of controllers.""
It will also ""identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FAA’s controller training program."" The FAA says U.S. airspace is the busiest and most complex in the world,.
The FAA employs about 13,800 air traffic controllers in more than 300 U.S. facilities.
In 2018, the FAA said that over the prior five years it had hired over 7,800 new air traffic controllers.

In 2020, the FAA faced numerous COVID-19 cases among controllers that forced the temporary closures of air traffic control towers, including at Chicago Midway and Las Vegas airports, which resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights. 
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson noted in a speech earlier that in 2020 the FAA ""created sterile teams of air traffic controllers and implemented cleaning and disinfecting protocols to keep people safe and the system going.

(Reuters) -  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) will cease all operations in military-ruled Myanmar and withdraw by the end of this year, the company said on Tuesday, the latest Western firm to pull out of the country in turmoil since a February coup. 
Responding to a query from Reuters about the status of its operations in the Southeast Asian country, the company said the decision was taken having assessed the long-term viability of its Myanmar business.
""Like any global company, we continuously evaluate our operations around the world,"" the company said.
""Having evaluated the long-term operational and commercial viability of our business in Myanmar, we have taken the decision to withdraw from the country and cease all operations."" 
Myanmar has been in chaos since the coup, ending a decade of tentative democracy and economic reform that followed the end of a half century of military rule in 2011 and years of crippling western sanctions. 
Many big companies in Myanmar initially expressed their commitment to the country in the weeks after the coup, but a months-long army crackdown on strikes and protests and the killing of more than 1,000 civilians has forced many firms to rethink. 
BAT (LON:BATS) did not elaborate on the reason for its decision to pull out of the country. 
BAT started operating in Myanmar in 2013, two years after a quasi-civilian government led by technocrats and retired generals embarked on sweeping reforms to lure investors. 

The country's fragile economy is now in dire straits, with the kyat currency losing more than 60% of its value last month, pushing up food and fuel costs. The World Bank has forecast an 18% contraction in gross domestic product this year.
The United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union have responded by imposing targeted sanctions on the military and its vast network of business interests.

By Arriana McLymore and Siddharth Cavale
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Season’s greetings from your favorite retailer come with a 2021-style postscript.  
That gift you want to get for your loved one? It may be out of stock. And the hot toy? It may not arrive in time for Christmas. 
Americans collectively are expected to spend as much as $1.3 trillion this holiday season https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/amid-supply-chain-snarls-retailers-pitch-early-holiday-shopping-2021-10-01, up from $1.19 trillion in 2020, according to Deloitte. But retailers are bracing for inventory shortfalls, as well as scarce labor at ports, driver shortages, rising warehouse expenses and higher prices.  
So they are encouraging shoppers to open their wallets early this year, inducing fear by highlighting what retailers describe as ""supply chain challenges,"" ""longer delivery times"" and ""lower inventories,"" in marketing materials. 
Surf- and skateboard-wear retailer Zumiez (NASDAQ:ZUMZ) Inc's website features a banner that reads: ""Don’t let out-of-stock items and shipping delays screw up your plans."" The mall-based retailer primarily sources merchandise from Asia, Mexico and Central America. It did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), which typically brings in about 20% of its merchandise from China, on Thursday sent a holiday marketing email to customers citing “global supply chain challenges” that they said would likely put a damper on holiday shopping plans. 
""We're anticipating that the hottest gifts may sell out on our site and that shipping could take longer than we’d all like,” Nordstrom President Peter Nordstrom and CEO Erik Nordstrom said in a joint emailed message to customers. Nordstrom declined to comment. 
In surveys by consulting firms, some shoppers have previously said they are concerned about stock availability and even that they already noticed empty shelves as far back as August. Although half of U.S. consumers surveyed in August by Sensormatic Solutions indicated that they would start their holiday shopping before November, there is no evidence of Christmas-related panic buying, at least not yet. 
The president of work-apparel retailer Carhartt told shoppers in an email Wednesday that it is aware of “longer delivery times and lower inventories,” and its own “inaccurate product availability” problems: “Now that fall is on the horizon, it’s time to start thinking about the holidays….we encourage you to get your order in soon for the best possible on-time delivery,” Linda Hubbard said.
Carhartt’s clothes are made in the United States and in Mexico. The company declined to comment.
Supply logjams are putting stress on all retailers but especially those -- including  Best Buy  Co (NYSE:BBY) , Gap’s Old Navy and Bed, Bath & Beyond -- that get much of their merchandise from manufacturers based in Asia and that tend to bring in the products on ships through Southern California ports https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-may-not-get-some-christmas-treats-white-house-officials-warn-2021-10-12. 
More than 60 container ships at anchor at Los Angeles and Long Beach ports could not unload holiday cargo as of October 11, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California, due to labor, truck driver and equipment shortages.  
Best Buy's Chief Executive Corie Barry  said in August that unprecedented demand could result in  ""some level of inventory constraints"" for the rest of the year,  adding that it has been  harder to get items such as home theaters and large appliances. 
The electronics chain said it expects to offer fewer holiday promotions than two years ago, even if they are elevated compared to last year. A spokesman for Best Buy declined to provide specifics.  
PEAK DAY, EVERY DAY
""The declining popularity of Black Friday, coupled with consumers starting their holiday shopping early, means that retailers and brands need to engage consumers throughout the season,"" Jill Standish, head of Accenture’s Retail Group said.
""It requires retailers to operate like its peak day every day.""
White House officials, scrambling to relieve global supply bottlenecks choking U.S. ports, highways and railways, warned Americans may face higher prices and some empty shelves this Christmas season

Walmart’s Sam’s Club said Friday it is offering more holiday events and holding them earlier in fall compared to 2020. But many analysts say they expect to see fewer doorbuster price promotions than usual in past holiday seasons because retailers simply may not have enough merchandise on hand in the first place. 
""There will be very limited supply behind those bigger discounts,"" said Kristin McGrath, a shopping expert at deals tracking website BlackFriday.com.

Moller-Maersk has suspended five employees as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on one of its ships run by a U.S. subsidiary, and said it was working closely with American authorities.
""We do everything we can to ensure that all of our workplace environments, including vessels, are a safe and welcoming workplace and we've launched a top to bottom investigation,"" said chief executive officer Bill Woodhour of Maersk Line, Limited in an emailed statement.
Maersk Line, Limited (MLL) is a U.S.-based subsidiary of the A.P. Moller-Maersk group working with the U.S. government to support military, government and humanitarian missions, it said on its webpage.
As part of the investigation, five crew members have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation, MLL said in the statement.
The firm said it was working with labour unions, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in Kings Point, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Coast Guard.
""We write today to express our unwavering support for the individual who has shared her story of a sexual assault that took place during Sea Year,"" said Polly Trottenberg, Deputy Secretary at the U.S. Department of Transportation, and Lucinda Lessley, Acting Administrator of the Maritime Administration, in a letter to the Kings Point community dated Oct. 2.
""Sea Year"" is a programme run by the academy where cadets gain expertise on ships, and Maersk Line, Limited participates in this programme, where it has trained 732 cadets since 2017.
A spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD), said it was aware of the alleged incident, adding that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) Superintendent had referred it to the Coast Guard Investigative Service on Sept. 28.

""We have zero tolerance for sexual assault and sexual harassment at USMMA and in the maritime industry,"" the spokesperson said.
""As we determine the appropriate steps required to increase and ensure the safety of USMMA students, we pledge to listen to and work closely with the entire USMMA community including students, parents and alumni.""

(Reuters) - A landmark agreement by 136 nations to impose a uniform 15% global minimum corporate tax does not carry with it a key credit risk for U.S. non-financial companies, rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday.
The multilateral deal reached last Friday, which was fueled by world leaders' desire to limit tax avoidance by multinational corporations, is expected to become effective in 2023.
Changes in tax laws stemming from the agreement may not necessarily lead to higher cash tax payments, due to exemptions, tax credits and issuers' ability to defer tax expenses, Fitch said in a note.
In addition to adopting the 15% minimum corporate tax, the agreement will partly re-allocate taxing rights for large, highly profitable companies to countries where they sell products and services.
In return, the deal requires countries to remove unilateral digital services taxes (DST) that largely targeted U.S. technology giants. It also prohibits new digital levies until the agreement becomes effective or by the end of 2023.
Negotiations over the withdrawal of existing digital services taxes after the deal should ultimately end the threat of tariff wars between the United States and several countries over the levies, U.S. Treasury officials said on Tuesday.
Growing prospects that a global corporate minimum tax rate will become a reality may cause multinational companies to reconsider legal structures and capital investments, Fitch said, adding that there was no guarantee it would be agreed to by lawmakers in the United States, where there is weak bipartisan support for any form of higher taxes.
Multinational companies with significant foreign earnings might prefer a global minimum tax instead of a disparate tax patchwork across countries, as a universal set of rules provides greater clarity for business planning, Fitch said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Business information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc is set to secure EU antitrust approval for its $44 billion takeover of IHS Markit Ltd, three people familiar with the matter said, taking it a step closer to becoming a data powerhouse.
The deal, announced last November, reflects the consolidation in the financial information services sector as companies race to create one-stop shops to lure the biggest clients and invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
S&P shares reversed earlier losses and were up 1% in early mid-trade after publication of Reuters' report on the approval, while IHS shares added gains to trade 1.3% higher.
S&P managed to address the European Commission's concerns with its offer to sell IHS' U.S. Oil Pricing Agency Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) and PetroChem Wire businesses, the people said. 
It struck the $1.15 billion deal with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) in August, subject to the closing of the IHS Markit acquisition.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to end its preliminary review of the IHS deal by Oct. 22, declined to comment. S&P Global and IHS declined to comment.
S&P Global ranks a distant third by annual revenue behind Bloomberg and Refinitiv, based data from on market research firm Burton-Taylor. While the acquisition of IHS Markit, the No. 8 player, would not change that ranking, it would accelerate S&P Global's growth.
The deal will combine S&P Global's credit ratings, market intelligence businesses and stock and energy benchmarks with IHS Markit's fixed income benchmarks and indices, bond pricing and reference data, and information on the natural resources, automotive and engineering sectors.
It will enable the distribution of IHS Markit products and services to S&P Global's 1 million desktop users.

The UK competition agency is also investigating the deal and will decide by Oct. 19.
 Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), parent of Reuters News, competes with Platts, Argus and OPIS in providing news and information to the oil markets.

(Reuters) -CureVac NV said on Tuesday it will give up on its first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate and instead focus on collaborating with GSK to develop improved mRNA vaccine technology.
The German biotechnology company's shares were off about 8% after earlier plunging as much as 13%, hitting their lowest since going public in August last year.
CureVac said it would abandon its application for approval from the European Medicines Agency for its first COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, after late-stage trials delivered disappointing results https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/curevacs-covid-19-vaccine-misses-efficacy-goal-mass-trial-2021-06-16 in June with 47% efficacy. 
Abandoning the vaccine will avoid a potential overlap with approval timelines for its most advanced second-generation candidates, it said. The move also allows the company to focus on the race for new variant-specific vaccines, and for combination shots that prevent two or more infectious diseases.
That will also see it try a technology employed by more successful rival BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), which modified the nucleosides - the molecules that determine the mRNA’s genetic code - to shield the vaccine against immune system attacks. CureVac had previously banked on non-modified mRNA. 
The earliest potential approval of CVnCoV would have come in the second quarter of 2022, when candidates from the second-generation vaccine programme were expected to progress to late-stage clinical development, CureVac said.
""In the ongoing transition from acute pandemic to endemic, our decision ... reflects expected changes in public health needs that our second generation can potentially address,” said Chief Executive Franz-Werner Haas.
The agreement CureVac signed to sell shots to the European Union will end, with no obligation to repay the 450 million euros ($519 million) received from the bloc, the company said.
The EU commission did not immediately reply to a request for comment on refunding clauses in the contract.
Financial commitments to contract manufacturers would be made public over the next few weeks, but any such burdens were minor, Haas said on call with reporters.
CureVac cancelled deals last month with two prospective contractors to make CVnCoV. It said it would seek to repurpose the remaining infrastructure for future products.
Human trials for its second-generation shot could start in coming months, with any regulatory approval seen in 2022. Animal trials so far showed them to be superior to CureVac's original COVID-19 vaccine.
The shot is the latest casualty in the drug industry's race to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 5 million people and infected more than 238 million. 
French drugmaker  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) SA also dropped plans for its own mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine last month because of the dominance achieved by BioNTech with U.S. partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc with shots using the technology.

Instead, it will pursue the technology, acquired as part of its takeover of Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO), in potential vaccines against influenza and other diseases.

U.S. carriers had tempered their outlooks for the September quarter as the Delta coronavirus variant slowed new bookings and drove up cancellations, but a recent fall in COVID-19 cases has raised hopes that passengers would be confident to fly again.
The Biden administration's plan to reopen the United States in November to air travelers from Europe has added to the optimism. The trans-Atlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the big three U.S. carriers.

LONDON (Reuters) - French food retailer Auchan explored a deal with a blank cheque company backed by telecoms mogul Xavier Niel and banker Matthieu Pigasse before a failed attempt to tie up with rival  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Discussions between the billionaire Mulliez family, which owns Auchan, and 2MX Organic - which was launched in December and pioneered Europe's market for special acquisition companies (SPACs) - were held over the summer, the sources said.
A tie-up would have given Auchan a listing, providing a currency to do deals and generate funds to revamp its hypermarket-focused business. But it would have been a leap for 2MX Organic, which raised money from investors pledging to build a European champion in organic food.
The talks failed to progress, however, as Auchan pursued an industry tie-up with Carrefour that could have generated cost savings and buying synergies, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
Auchan's move to combine with Carrefour and create a French market leader with 110 billion euros ($127 billion) of sales per year was called off in early October, leaving the firm empty-handed as talks with 2MX Organic are no longer active, the sources said.
A spokesman for Auchan denied discussions with 2MX Organic, adding the company was not for sale.
2MX Organic declined to comment.
Shares in 2MX Organic, which is also backed by entrepreneur Moez-Alexandre Zouari, spiked on their market debut on Dec. 9, making it France's biggest IPO in 2020.
Dubbed by its owners ""the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of responsible consumption"", 2MX Organic has been looking for a merger candidate since the start of the year, the sources said, but has struggled to find a suitable target amid waning market interest in SPACs due to a regulatory crackdown in the United States.
The sources said talks with Auchan were not resumed after the Carrefour debacle, with one adding 2MX Organic was now working on another project.
SPACs raise money on stock markets with the promise of buying private companies and helping them grow. But investor interest has waned after some poor performances and a rising number of class-action lawsuits as more deals have turned into flops.
""SPAC sponsors are getting desperate to find a target and have started looking at deals that they would have never considered before,"" one of the sources said. ""Some are trying to rejig their core focus to be able to fulfil their mission.""
In the third quarter, only 85 SPACs listed globally, raising $14 billion, down from 309 that raised $95 billion in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

Many SPACs have seen their shares fall so heavily they now trade below the $10 at which they were originally priced.

(Reuters) -European shares slipped on Tuesday as investors feared that soaring commodity prices would hamper a recovery in corporate profit. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1%, hovering about 4% below its August peak. Worries about a fallout from China's struggling property sector also remained after Evergrande missed its third round of bond payments in three weeks. [MKTS/GLOB] 
Mining stocks gave up some of Monday's strong gains as a rally in commodity prices eased, while automakers and travel sectors shed about 0.5%. [O/R] [MET/L] 
""The energy crisis is showing no signs of abating, which means considerable cost pressures on companies, and consumers facing the prospect of having less money in their pocket to spend on products and services, thereby having a negative effect on the economy,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Along with major central banks considering withdrawal of stimulus, expectations for the earnings season have been clouded. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday trimmed its 2021 global growth forecast to 5.9% from a previous estimate of 6.0%.
U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is set to kick off the earnings season on Wednesday. In Europe, France's LVMH will set the tone for luxury goods makers with its report later in the day.
Germany's DAX extended losses to a third straight session, down 0.3%. The ZEW indicator of economic sentiment in the country slipped for the fifth month in a row - the latest in a string of indicators showing supply bottlenecks holding back recovery in the continent's largest economy. 
The STOXX 600 is nearly flat on the month, in percentage terms, after shedding 3.4% in September. It is up about 14% so far in 2021. 
On the day, low-cost airline EasyJet fell 3.5% after it estimated a loss of above 1 billion pounds for the 12 months ended September.
Airbus slipped 0.5% as the world's largest planemaker's deliveries were flat in September versus the previous month.
Freight forwarder DSV inched up 1.6% after it raised its earnings expectations for the year, citing brisk business activity in the third quarter and continued tight capacity in the market.

Automakers were down 0.3% as data showed auto sales in China - a major trading partner of Europe - slumped 19.6% in September as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors and a domestic power crunch disrupt production.
Defensive sectors such as utilities and real estate were the among the few gainers.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Pentagon says hypersonic weapons are too expensive,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon wants defense contractors to cut the ultimate cost of hypersonic weapons, the head of research and development said on Tuesday, as the next generation of super-fast missiles being developed currently cost tens of millions per unit.
""We need to figure out how to drive towards more affordable hypersonics,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Heidi Shyu told reporters at the Association of United States Army conference in Washington. She said cost was something she ""would like to help industry focus on."" 
Currently, the U.S. uses cruise missiles which are mature technologies costing less than $5 million per unit to strike deep into enemy territory. But cruise missiles are inferior to hypersonic weapons because they have a shorter range, are far slower and more vulnerable to being detected and shot down.
Both  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) are working on hypersonic weapons for the Pentagon. 
The Pentagon's budget request in the 2022 fiscal year for hypersonic research was $3.8 billion which was up from $3.2 billion they year before.
In September, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency successfully tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound. It was the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013.
Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.

Shyu said ""if things start to progress in success stories and as we start to buy more than onesies twosies the price curve will come down.""
In July, Russia said it had successfully tested a Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world.

Investing.com – Airbnb stock (NASDAQ:ABNB) rose 5% Tuesday after Cowen upgraded it to outperform with a $220 target, an upside of more than 25% from its current price.
According to the brokerage’s Kevin Kopelman, the industry has likely undergone changes that are permanent and which the Street isn’t appreciating yet.
Kopelman pointed out that Airbnb pioneered the hotel-to-homes shift by creating a trusted platform for both urban apartments and vacation homes. At $47 billion in alternative gross booking value in estimates for the current year, Cowen estimates Airbnb at more than 50% share and growing among the global online travel agents.
The analyst estimates alternative lodging increased its market share of the global lodging industry by a little less than half to 33% now to nearly regain its 2019 peak of around $200 billion.
Kopelman expects the alternative lodging industry to hold on to its gains, assuming it to be only partially tempered by hotel-focused business travel recovery."

(Reuters) -The European Union may consider signing a supply deal with U.S. drugmaker Merck for its experimental COVID-19 pill, but only after the company starts the process of seeking approval for the drug in the bloc, a senior EU official said on Tuesday.
The oral antiviral treatment molnupiravir has been developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. If approved by regulators, it would be the first COVID-19 drug administered orally and also the first treatment for mildly ailing patients, whereas existing drugs are mostly used to treat the critically ill.
The EU would consider a joint procurement of molnupiravir, ""if Merck engages with EMA"", the EU official told Reuters, referring to the European Medicines Agency.
On Monday Merck applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States, which has already secured 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course. Washington has invested in the development of the drug.
Throughout the pandemic, the EU has signed advance purchase deals for experimental vaccines and drugs against the coronavirus before companies applied to EMA. But the EU official said that approach had now changed because the 27-nation bloc has entered a new phase in the health crisis.
ROLLING REVIEW
With about 75% of its adult population vaccinated, the EU is now signing advance deals only when drugs have at least begun a so-called rolling review with EMA, the official said. 
Under this procedure, the EU regulator assesses data as soon as they become available, instead of waiting for a formal application when all required information has been gathered.
A spokesman for the EU Commission did not comment on whether the start of a rolling review was a precondition to have an advance deal with a drugmaker. He repeated that, in theory, to launch a joint procurement, at least four EU governments and the European Commission would need to support it.
Last week, EMA said it would consider in the coming days whether to start a rolling review for molnupiravir. On Tuesday it told Reuters the rolling review had not yet begun.
A second EU official familiar with the process said the agency was expecting data from Merck soon, and only at that point it could begin the review.
Merck did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the matter.

The first EU official said talks with Merck had not yet started, and that the number of treatments the EU could secure would depend on several conditions, including pricing.
Under its advance purchase deals, the EU reserves a number of doses of a treatment or vaccine. EU states that decide to be part of the contract can buy their share of the reserved doses once the medicine has been authorised by the EMA or by a national regulator.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 11:42AM ET</span>",China launches new round of graft busting in finance sector,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's ruling Community Party turned its sights on the country's vast financial sector this month, kicking off a new round of a years-long campaign to uncover corruption and illegal dealings. 
The country's top anti-graft watchdog has started a roughly two-month inspection of more than 20 institutions including the central bank, the banking and insurance regulator, stock exchanges, commercial banks and asset-management companies, in its first coordinated inspection of the sector since 2015. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping is scrutinising the ties that state banks and other financial institutions have developed with big private companies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the plan.
The inspections are a comprehensive ""political examination"" of Party committees at the financial institutions and regulators, according to statements issued by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on Tuesday.
CCDI inspectors will be looking for any violation of political discipline - a Party euphemism for corruption. 
The inspections follow a call by China's top anti-graft official, Zhao Leji, in late September for in-depth inspections at the Party organisations of 25 state financial institutions and regulators. 
Since late 2020, Beijing has been advocating ""the prevention of disorderly expansion of capital"", kicking off a clampdown on tech giants and private education firms.
The campaign has been focused on preventing ""savage growth"" of some platform companies in a bid to deal with their monopolistic and unfair competition behaviours.
""The latest central inspection ... is certainly going to emphasize Xi's call of preventing the disorderly expansion of capital,"" said Feng Chucheng, partner of Plenum, an independent research firm.
""The Party leaders likely realized that they need a more comprehensive, top-down approach in managing systematic financial risks following the series of events since last year, including Ant IPO, Didi IPO, and the latest of property market,"" Feng said.
When the sector was last inspected in 2015, at least a few hundred bankers and executives were censured and even fired. Offences included organising prohibited internal banquets and accepting holidays from clients. 
In 2017, Xiang Junbo, the former chair of China's insurance regulator, was removed from his post after a probe of one of the most senior financial regulators in years. Xiang was sentenced to 11 years in jail in 2020.
In January this year, China executed Lai Xiaomin, the former head of the embattled China Huarong Asset Management Co, after he was found guilty of taking 1.79 billion yuan of bribes. 

On Monday, the CCDI said the former chairman and Party head at Chang'an Bank, based in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, had been expelled from the Party and public office due to corruption. 
In recent months, Chinese regulators have also taken aim at sectors ranging from technology to education and property, targeting some of the biggest firms in the country like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).

604,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>","Energy crunch stokes inflation, economic recovery concerns","By Muyu Xu and Shivani Singh
BEIJING (Reuters) - Authorities from Beijing to Delhi scrambled to fill a yawning power supply gap on Tuesday, triggering global stock and bond market wobbles on worries that rising energy costs will stoke inflation and curtail an economic recovery.
Power prices have surged to record highs in recent weeks, driven by shortages in Asia and Europe, with an energy crisis in China expected to last through to the end of the year and crimp growth in the world's second-largest economy and top exporter.
China on Tuesday took its boldest step in a decades-long power sector reform, saying it will allow coal-fired power plants to pass on the high costs of generation to some end-users via market-driven electricity prices.
Pushing all industrial and commercial users to the power exchanges and allowing prices to be set by the market is expected to encourage loss-making generators to increase output.
The impact of supply crunches in power and manufacturing components is showing up in data from Tokyo to London, adding to a deepening disquiet in global markets and underscoring the difficulty in cutting the world's dependency on polluting fossil fuels a month before global climate change talks.
A sell-off in global stocks and bonds extended into Tuesday, taking short-dated U.S. Treasury yields to 18-month highs, while world stocks fell for a third straight day on fears that energy prices were putting a dampener on economic growth.
Data on Tuesday showed Japanese wholesale inflation hit 13-year highs last month, while shoppers in Britain slashed spending and China recorded a 20% drop in car sales.
The International Monetary Fund cut growth outlooks for the United States and other major industrial powers citing persistent supply chain disruptions and pricing pressures.
China's latest reform follows a raft of measures including urging coal miners to boost output and manage electricity demand at industrial plants to tame the record-high coal prices and to ease the power crunch across the country, with utilities unable to keep up with post-pandemic demand.
And in a move that could push up already high global prices, India has asked power producers to import up to 10% of their coal needs and has warned states that their power supplies will be curbed if they are found selling electricity on power exchanges to cash in on surging prices.
India is the world's second largest coal producer, with the fourth largest reserves, but a steep surge in power demand that has outstripped pre-pandemic levels in Asia's third-largest economy means state-run Coal India's supplies are no longer sufficient. 
The Indian power ministry said it had directed power companies to boost supply to the capital Delhi, whose chief minister has warned of a potential power crisis.
And on Tuesday, residents of Bangalore, home to the technology operations of hundreds of global companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), were facing scheduled power cuts of over ninety minutes in the afternoon. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited said the city had sufficient power and the outages were to lay underground power cables.
'DO MORE'
Oil rose towards $84 a barrel on Tuesday, within sight of a three-year high, as a rebound in global demand after the COVID-19 pandemic caused price spikes and shortages in other energy sources. Coal has scaled record peaks and gas prices remain four times higher in Europe than at the start of 2021.
OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers led by Russia, is increasing output monthly to address recovering demand as it undoes curbs it put in place to support prices and oversupply.
The price of Brent crude has surged by more than 60% this year, supported by those OPEC+ supply curbs as well as record European gas prices, which have encouraged a switch to oil in some places.
Brent crude was up 24 cents or 0.3% at $83.89 a barrel at 0810 GMT. On Monday it reached $84.60, its highest since October 2018. U.S. oil gained 21 cents or 0.3% to $80.73 and on Monday hit $82.18, its highest since late 2014.
The sharp rise has meant OPEC+ has come under pressure from consumer nations, with a U.S. official on Monday saying the White House stands by its calls for oil-producing countries to ""do more"" to ease the situation.
A Russian official said on Tuesday that energy giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has started using its inventories to pump more natural gas into the pipeline network to stabilise surging prices.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in a BBC interview, rejected any suggestion that Russia was withholding gas from the European market. A group of European Parliament lawmakers has asked the European Commission to investigate Gazprom's role in the rising prices.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday the country wants to be a leader in green hydrogen by 2030 and build new, smaller nuclear reactors as part of a 30 billion euro ($35 billion) investment plan.

And in Japan, electricity prices have risen to nine-month highs this week as gains in global prices of oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal are starting to feed through to the country's $150 billion power market.
For Japan, which imports all but a tiny amount of its energy needs, higher oil, gas and coal prices are bringing back inflation, with wholesale prices at 13-year highs.

Investing.com -- Genome analysis company  Bionano Genomics  Inc (NASDAQ:BNGO) announced Tuesday that it has agreed on a $100 million cash and equity deal to acquire software firm BioDiscovery Inc.
Bionano shares rose 4% on Tuesday, to $5.34.
Part of the deal's equity payment is subject to a vesting period for ‘key employees.’ Meanwhile, a portion of the cash is dependent on fully integrating optical genome mapping (OGM) data into BioDiscovery’s software platform.
Bionano said the deal would broaden its market leadership in digital cytogenetics and comprehensive genome analysis. It will speed up the adoption of OGM, by simplifying the data analysis workflow through the integration of BioDiscovery’s NxClinical software solution.
Soheil Shams, the founder and CEO of BioDiscovery, will join Bionano as chief informatics officer.
“Over the last twenty years, BioDiscovery’s talented team has developed best-in-class software solutions to enable broader adoption of genomics technologies. NxClinical is one of the most promising tools that integrates NGS and microarray data across the genome in one consolidated view, and we are thrilled to welcome Soheil and his team to Bionano as we work to transform the way the world sees the genome,"" said Erik Holmlin, CEO of Bionano Genomics.
“This acquisition accelerates our efforts to make OGM ubiquitous by enabling us to simplify the assessment of clinically-relevant variants in cytogenomics applications, potentially reducing interpretation time per sample and expanding our reach into the discovery and translational research markets where the combination of NGS and OGM can reveal more answers in genetic disease and cancer research.”
The acquisition is expected to close before October 22."

607,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 11:14AM ET</span>","Boeing delivers 35 airplanes in September, 787 dry spell continues","By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday airplane deliveries rose to 35 in September as it benefited from an uptick in domestic travel, but its 787 program remains hobbled by structural defects.
That was 13 more planes than in August and 24 more than in September last year.
Of the 35 jetliners delivered last month, 26 were 737 MAX passenger jets and one was a P-8 maritime patrol aircraft to the U.K. Royal Air Force.
The closely watched monthly snapshot comes as Boeing tries to recoup billions of dollars in lost sales from the coronavirus pandemic, and move beyond a safety scandal caused by two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
Boeing also said it delivered 8 widebodies including one 747-8 freighter to  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), two 767 freighters to FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and one 767 tanker for the U.S. Air Force. 
For the year so far, Boeing has delivered 241 aircraft, up from 206 a month ago and 98 for the first nine months of 2020.
Of these, 194 were for its best-selling 737 MAX jets which returned to service in late 2020 following a near two-year safety ban.
But Boeing continues to grapple with structural defects in its bigger 787, which have caused it to cut production and halt deliveries. 
Total aircraft orders for September, after cancellations and instances where a buyer converted an order for one type of aircraft to another, stood at 22.
That included 16 737 MAX, six 777 freighters and a contract for five P-8 aircraft for the German Navy.

Boeing also said Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp canceled an order for one 787-9, while GECAS, or GE Capital Aviation Services, canceled an order for four 737 MAX jets. 
That brings orders for the year so far to 710, or 302 after cancellations and conversions, Boeing said.

And because oil prices are expected to continue moving higher, we think pipeline operators and oil-producing companies should garner big returns. However, considering Enbridge (NYSE:ENB)’s weak debt profile, is the stock a good choice now? Keep reading to find out.Canada-based  Enbridge Inc.  (ENB) is an energy infrastructure company with business platforms that include a network of crude oil, liquids, natural gas pipelines, regulated natural gas distribution utilities, and renewable power generation. The stock has delivered solid returns over the past year and year-to-date and is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
The supercharged oil price rally shows no signs of slowing, with oil prices now reaching multi-year highs. U.S crude rose above $80 per barrel for the first time since late 2014, marking a 125% gain since the end of last October. And last week, OPEC and its allies announced that they are firm on their prior agreement to raise production by a modest 400,000 barrels per day in November, which may not be enough to meet the current demand surge.
The global supply crunch is expected to push the oil prices higher. Analysts expect this momentum to continue through the winter, and oil prices could hit the $100 per barrel mark. As a leading energy infrastructure company, ENB should benefit from the oil price rally.

Investing.com — Nutriband (NASDAQ:NTRB) stock jumped 35% on Tuesday after it signed an exclusive manufacturing agreement with San Diego-based Diomics for its Diocheck patch, which monitors the presence of Covid-19 antibodies.
It can take several weeks for Covid-19 antibodies to circulate the body. The company said the goal of the patch, which bears a resemblance to a nicotine patch, is to monitor the gap between when an individual is given the Covid-19 vaccine and when antibodies are present. They also believe it can signal when the individual may also need a booster shot.
The test can report within 24 to 36 hours whether a person has a circulating level of Covid-19 antibodies. According to Diomics, a positive response will cause a change in skin color visible through the patch. It is expected to be effective for up to 2 weeks. Diomics has applied for approval of the Diocheck device by the Food and Drug Administration.
 Nutriband  shares were trading around $10.05 Tuesday morning.
Gareth Sheridan, CEO of Nutriband, said: ‘This exclusive contract with Diomics to manufacture Diocheck allows Nutriband and our contract manufacturing subsidiary, Pocono Pharma, to showcase our capabilities with innovative new patch technologies."""

Shares of energy stocks have risen due to these higher prices. With no end in sight, investor should consider Buy-rated energy stocks such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC (RDS.A), TotalEnergies SE ADR (TTE), and  BP PLC  ADR (NYSE:BP).Oil prices jumped above $80 yesterday and show no sign of slowing down. Brent crude rose 1.5% to close at $83.65 a barrel. The price of Brent crude even hit an intraday high of $84.60 today, its highest price since October 2018. As oil prices have been increasing, and energy companies' stocks have followed. 
This is being driven by the strong pace of the global economic recovery and producers not keeping up. OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, have held back from increasing supply even as prices have climbed. Plus, a global shortage of natural gas used to power businesses and homes may spill into the oil market.
So, the demand for oil and gas isn't going away anytime soon. That's why investors should consider adding energy stocks to their portfolios. I ran a screen for energy stocks in our database with an overall Buy or Strong Buy rating in our POWR Ratings system.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened moderately higher and then fell on Tuesday. There was little appetite for major moves ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, which begins in earnest with the major banks' reports later this week. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 75 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 was also down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%, all extending the losses they had made on Monday. 
Stock prices continue to be pressured by rising long-term interest rates as the bond market positions for a gradual withdrawal of support from the Federal Reserve: the 10-year Treasury yield rose to a new five-month high of 1.63% overnight and was trading at 1.61% by 9:45 AM, ahead of a key test of sentiment at the Treasury's note auction later in the day. 
Weighing on sentiment was a warning from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) strategists, who told clients in a morning note that the Federal Reserve may have a higher tolerance for a stock market selloff than it did during the Great Recession, given that inflation pressures are clearly building up.
""With tapering on the docket, the risk is the Fed put strike is lower than the market anticipates,"" the authors said. 
Adding to the general caution are suspicions that the upcoming season of earnings reports is going to show a sharp slowdown in earnings growth, if only because the previous quarter benefited from being measured against the depths of pandemic gloom. 
""After several quarters of huge beats, it’s possible that the growth rate for Q3 will be less stellar but still positive,"" said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).  He pointed to expectations that per share earnings will grow 'only' 28%, after gains of 54% of in Q1 and 96% in Q2 respectively.

LG Electronics supplied GM with battery modules made with cells produced by  LG Chemicals  ' (KS:051910) fully-owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution. The manufacturing problems occurred at LG Battery Solution’s plants in South Korea and Michigan.
In August, GM was forced to suspend sales of its Chevrolet Bolt EVs after it ordered another recall of the automobile due to the risk of fires from the high-voltage battery pack.

With these concerns in mind, analysts have downgraded Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU),  Allegiant Travel  (ALGT), and  Hawaiian Holdings  (NASDAQ:HA). So, we think these stocks are best avoided now. Let’s discuss these names.Despite witnessing a limited recovery in the first half of the year, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, followed by stricter travel restrictions, have stymied new bookings and increased cancellations of existing bookings. Although the industry is again seeing an uptick in passenger traffic with the easing of travel restrictions in various countries, analysts expect rising fuel costs and pressure on fares to result in bottom-line stress in the fourth quarter and beyond for most airlines. 
Although major airline operators should stay afloat owing to their efforts in switching to sustainable jet fuel, some could struggle. 
Thus, fundamentally weak airline stocks Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL),  American Airlines Group  Inc. (AAL), JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU), Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ:ALGT), and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (HA) have lately been downgraded by analysts, and we think these stocks are best avoided for now.

(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is ""firmly on track"" to spin off its consumer health business next year, the British drugmaker said on Tuesday, after Bloomberg News reported the unit could attract bids from private equity firms such as Advent, CVC and KKR.
The division, which makes Sensodyne toothpaste, and Advil and Panadol painkillers, could also draw interest from big pharmaceutical and consumer goods companies, the report said , citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. 
It added the unit could be valued at 40 billion pounds ($54 billion) or more. 
A GSK spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had received takeover interest in the division, a joint venture with U.S. drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE).
The report sent London-listed GSK's shares as much as 4.8% higher to 1,460.2 pence. 
""GSK is far advanced with its plan for the separation of Consumer Healthcare,"" the GSK representative said, adding the drugmaker was on course for the split in mid-2022. 
The company set out plans in June to turn the consumer arm into a separately listed company to focus on its underperforming drugs business, and has defended those plans after activist investor Elliott suggested some changes including that GSK remained open to potentially selling the consumer business.
""The feedback we have received from our shareholders is that they are very keen to own the new Consumer Healthcare company as a listed entity through the demerger ... The GSK board will fulfil its fiduciary duties to evaluate any alternative options,"" GSK's spokesperson said.
Under GSK's plan, shareholders will receive stock in the new consumer health group amounting to at least 80% of the 68% stake that GSK currently owns in it. Pfizer owns the remaining 32%.
New GSK would sell the remaining 20% stake ""in a timely manner,"" the group has said. Pfizer has also said it would seek to exit its shareholding.
Elliott, which in July confirmed holding a significant stake in GSK, said then that a conservative estimate would value GSK's shareholding in the consumer unit at about 34 billion pounds - working out to roughly 50 billion pounds overall. 
Brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) has valued it at 45 billion pounds.
Another activist investor, Bluebell Capital Partners, which holds a smaller stake in GSK, said last month the consumer arm should attract interest from trade buyers and, potentially, private equity investors.
Elliott has said a sale of the unit to an industry peer would command a ""meaningful premium"" to its estimated value due to potential synergies of up to 10% of the business's revenues.

Separately, Bluebell said in an open letter to GSK Chairman Jonathan Symonds dated Oct. 11, that both he and Chief Executive Emma Walmsley should be replaced, voicing disappointment over an Oct. 7 investor event.
""We completely reject the content and claims made in this letter, which are not representative of the discussion at the meeting or the majority of our shareholders' views,"" GSK said in response.

Investing.com – CureVac stock (NASDAQ:CVAC) plunged 15% in Tuesday’s premarket trading to its lowest since the start of the pandemic, as the company dumped its candidate Covid-19 vaccine to focus on the development of second-generation mRNA vaccine candidates in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).
The company said it is withdrawing its first-generation Covid-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, from the current approval process with the European Medicines Agency, admitting that it was too late to bring a first-generation drug to market now. As a result, the company’s advanced purchase agreement with the European Commission will also cease.
According to CureVac, the earliest potential approval from EMA would come only in the second quarter of 2022. By this time, the companies expect candidates from the second-generation vaccine program to have progressed to late-stage clinical development, it said in a note.
CureVac and GSK aim to secure regulatory approval for market readiness of an improved Covid-19 vaccine in 2022. The companies also plan to accelerate efforts to progress the development of modified mRNA vaccine constructs.
CureVac’s decision comes as worries over adequate vaccine supplies are on the wane globally, especially in the developed world.

GSK is under pressure from activist investors such as Elliott Management to improve shareholder returns.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung conglomerate chief Jay Y. Lee admitted in court on Tuesday to unlawful use of a controlled substance, as the executive's legal troubles continued despite his release on parole in August after a bribery conviction.
Lee appeared at the Seoul Central District Court where, in a short first hearing, he said he received propofol - a sedative used in anaesthesia - 41 times from 2015 through 2020.
His release in August had raised expectations of major decisions being taken at Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and its affiliates, including the location of a $17 billion chip factory being planned in the United States.
Prosecutors, who are seeking a fine of 70 million won ($58,327) and an additional fee of 17 million won, said that Lee had been administered propofol under the guise of a skin treatment or unrelated to a legitimate treatment. 
""This matter originated as for treatment, but I am deeply regretful,"" Lee said. ""I will ... make sure that this does not happen again,"" Lee told the small court, where about 15 people were present, adding he had not used the drug since his release.
Lee's lawyer told the court that Lee had received treatment for medical purposes, originally due to psychological pressure after the hospitalisation of his father and then as a result of the graft scandal and trial leading to his January conviction. 
The court ruling is scheduled for Oct 26.
Under South Korean law, the recipient of a controlled substance deemed to have been administered illegally is liable for prosecution, as well as those who administered the drug.
Staff at a clinic where Lee received the sedative, who are being tried separately, have denied wrongdoing.
Prosecutors were first made aware of the matter in 2020 but were advised to drop their investigation in March 2021 by an independent panel reviewing prosecution probes. They continued to seek a fine as recently as June before another police report of sedative use led the court to order a hearing.
As propofol is less likely to be misused than many other controlled substances, many similar cases of unlawful use have resulted in fines rather than jail terms. 
Lee was convicted in January of bribery and embezzlement and sentenced to 30 months in jail - including a year served before his sentencing. He has kept a low profile since he was paroled in August, with the presidential office calling for public understanding, citing hope that he will help the country produce ""semiconductors and vaccines"".
After his release, Samsung (KS:005930) said it would invest 240 trillion won in the next three years in fields such as chips and biopharmaceuticals.

Lee is simultaneously on trial accused of stock-price manipulation and accounting fraud related to the $8 billion merger of two Samsung firms in 2015.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>","Travel is recovering, UK's easyJet says after $1.5 billion loss","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) -European travel is reviving and easyJet (LON:EZJ) is increasing flights between now and December, the British airline said on Tuesday, after running up an annual loss of over 1 billion pounds during the pandemic.
For the autumn period, easyJet said that it would fly 70% of its pre-pandemic capacity, a jump from the 60% it had been aiming for only a month earlier, as demand for holidays surged, particularly in the UK where travel rules have been loosened.
Winter sun destinations such as Egypt, Turkey and the Canary Islands were popular, business travellers were returning to the skies, and easyJet's chief executive said that capacity would keep growing over 2022. 
""It is clear recovery is underway,"" CEO Johan Lundgren said on Tuesday. 
The brighter outlook represents a turnaround from the last year when pandemic uncertainty and travel bans pushed easyJet to an expected headline loss of between 1.135 billion pounds ($1.54 billion)and 1.175 billion pounds for the 12 months to the end of September. 
The results, due to be confirmed on Nov. 30, will in the best case scenario beat a consensus forecast for a loss of 1.175 billion pounds.
Shares in easyJet fell 1.5% to 638 pence by 0900 GMT, which Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said reflected the sense that some investors could be worrying about the broader economic situation for consumers. 
""I still believe that the demand picture is there for summer 2022,"" Simpson said. 
Seeking to boost its finances following the pandemic hit, easyJet in September launched a surprise 1.2 billion pound rights issue and also revealed it had rejected an ""opportunistic"" bid from an unnamed suitor, believed to be rival Wizz Air.
Lundgren said that while M&A was something that all chief executives look at, easyJet was focused on organic growth. 
""On a standalone basis, we've been very confident about where we are,"" he told reporters. 
Despite the improved outlook, easyJet cautioned that customers were booking closer to their travel date, meaning it could not provide guidance for 2022. It is not recommending a dividend for 2021. 
EasyJet's exposure to the UK, usually about half of its business with the European Union the other half, hurt it this year as Britain has kept stricter travel rules for longer, putting its recovery slightly behind Europe's biggest airline Ryanair. 

But Britain has recently relaxed those rules, scrapping some tests and its frequently changing traffic light system which deterred bookings. EasyJet said that the recent changes were helping booking momentum.

631,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Chevron Gains as it Promises to do More to Cut Carbon Footprint,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Chevron  stock (NYSE:CVX) traded 0.2% higher in Tuesday’s premarket a day after an eagerly-awaited company presentation avoided giving the oil and gas group firm targets for cutting carbon emissions.
As such, the U.S.'s second-biggest oil and gas company resisted pressure from shareholders who voted in May for such a target. 
Chevron said it aims to have net zero emissions from its operations by 2050. It has also set a target of reducing carbon intensity by 5% by 2028 from 2016 levels for the full lifecycle of its products. The latter target, for what is known as Scope 3 emissions, make up the majority of fossil fuel pollution.
Chevron has committed to invest $8 billion by 2028 in low-carbon investments and $2 billion in carbon-reduction projects. It has already announced plans to shift towards low-carbon businesses including renewables, carbon-capture technologies and hydrogen, against a backdrop of reports suggesting that Engine no. 1, an ESG-focused activist investor that has secured board seats at  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), is planning a repeat campaign with Chevron.
The developments again highlight the gap in governance and priorities between U.S. and European energy majors, which have been more susceptible to environmentalist pressure.
Last month, Shell (LON:RDSa) sealed a deal with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) to sell its Permian assets for $9.5 billion to focus on lower-carbon assets. Shell also announced plans to build one of Europe’s biggest biofuels facilities, a 820,000-ton per year unit in the Netherlands.
Bloomberg quoted the Dutch campaigner that filed the investor proposal, as calling Chevron’s new goal “disappointing tokenism.” Rather than a 5% reduction in Scope 3 intensity, absolute emissions need to come down by 40% by 2030 to have any chance of achieving the 2016 Paris Agreement, the group said, as per Bloomberg.

Investing.com – Southwest Airlines stock (NYSE:LUV) was set to extend its losses Tuesday as the carrier and its passengers continued to reel under flight cancellations for the fourth consecutive day.
The stock closed 4.2% lower Monday and traded 1.5% down in premarket trading.
The airline scrapped about 10% of its Monday flight schedule, following cancellation of some 1,800 flights over the weekend.
According to FlightAware, a flight-tracking site, some 360 Southwest flights were cancelled Monday.
Bad weather conditions, staff shortages and air traffic-related disruptions haven’t spared any airline, but Southwest has been the worst hit.
According to the airline, it was adequately staffed to handle the weekend traffic but ATC issues and bad weather conditions across Florida caught it unawares.
Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center, which controls airspace in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and North and South Carolina faced weather and staffing issues which made traffic management for airlines even more onerous on Friday.
According to Southwest’s initial projections, operations should have returned to normal by Sunday, but it didn’t turn out so.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Dubai ports giant DP World and Britain's development finance agency CDC Group on Tuesday said they planned to jointly invest up to $1.72 billion in logistics infrastructure in Africa over the next several years, starting with modernising three ports.
The investments will initially focus on expanding ports operated by DP World in Egypt's Ain Sokhna, Senegal's Dakar and Berbera in Somalia's breakaway region of Somaliland, CDC said.
State-owned DP Word has committed to investing $1 billion over the next several years, while CDC has committed $320 million and potentially investing up to a further $400 million.
The joint investments will eventually be expanded to other regions in Africa, in what DP World and CDC hope will accelerate inbound and outbound trade for the continent.
""We have an aligned vision with DP World in that we wanted to do this across the continent in as many ports as possible,"" CDC's Head of Africa Tenbite Ermias told Reuters.
The partnership plans to invest, along with ports, in infrastructure like container depots and business parks.
CDC will own minority stakes in the three ports, Ermias said, with DP World handing over some shares in each.
The expansion of the three ports would improve access to vital goods for 35 million people, including in neighbouring countries, support 5 million jobs and add $51 billion to total trade by 2035, CDC said. 

The partnership between DP World and CDC, who were both already active across Africa, is among a growing list of international and multilateral groups investing in the continent.

Since Hubilo started out as an events tech firm in India in 2015, its co-founders Vaibhav Jain and Mayank Agarwal have steered the company's aggressive growth in digital events after physical events were scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Hubilo's revenue dwindled.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp in December wants to restart production curtailed by component shortages with a rebound in shipments from pandemic-hit suppliers that may help it claw back around a third of output lost to supply disruptions, three sources familiar with the carmaker's plans said. 
Toyota last month cut its production target for the financial year to end-March by 300,000 vehicles to 9 million units because rising COVID-19 infections slowed work at parts factories in Malaysia and Vietnam, compounding a global chip shortage that has forced it and other big automakers to curtail output.
The Japanese carmaker has asked suppliers to make up for lost production so it can build an additional 97,000 vehicles between December and the end of March, with some considering additional weekend shifts to do so, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to talk to the media. 
""Nothing has yet been decided about production plans beyond November,"" a Toyota spokesperson said.
""COVID infection rates in Southeast Asia are dropping dramatically and people's concerns about production risk are easing,"" said Takashi Miyao, a researcher at automotive industry consultant Carnorama. ""It looks like the industry is emerging from a tunnel,"" he added. 

Toyota, which had hardened its supply chain against disruptions after the 2011 earthquake that devastated Japan's northeast coast, was the last of the major automakers to revise down production plans because of parts shortages. The pandemic forced component factories to close while also driving up demand for semiconductors that carmakers needed as people forced to stay home bought tablets and other electronic devices.
With too few parts, automakers have been unable to take advantage of a rebound in demand for cars in key markets such as China. Vehicle sales there in September dipped by a fifth from a year earlier.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Marketmind: The waiting game,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao.
So many question marks these days: will the inflation spike we are witnessing ebb? Will central banks resist temptation to significantly tighten policy? How much of a dampener is $80 oil for the world economy? Are China's property sector problems a sign of a wider malaise?
These narratives have kept world stocks seesawing ever since they hit record highs in early-September. Wall Street futures are down half a percent while European shares look set for an even weaker open. Big losses in Asia earlier, with Hong Kong down more than 1%.
On bonds, softer growth data is failing to derail a selloff; 10-year Treasury yields are up some 30 basis points in three weeks and on Tuesday, two-year yields touched 18-month highs.
The impact of soaring energy prices is showing up in dataprints -- even in Japan, wholesale inflation hit a 13-year high. British shoppers, meanwhile, upped spending by just 0.6% in September versus 3% in August (though fuel shortages peculiar to the UK probably had an outsize impact).
Another worrying piece of data is last month's 20% slump in Chinese car sales, which will likely ripple out to global auto shares. The Chinese slowdown could also make itself felt in Germany's ZEW index later in the day.
On the bright side, UK payrolls hit a record high in September, with a 7.2% rise in average weekly earnings in the three months to August.
All that comes just before third quarter earnings kick off. Remember several companies have already issued downbeat assessments of how higher prices will have impacted the bottom line. Q3 earnings were never expected to match the Q2 blowout but will they fall short even of the 30% growth expected of U.S. companies? The wait is on.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:
-China's Evergrande missed a third round of bond payments
-Japan wholesale inflation at 13-year high in September
- UK retail spending rose 0.6% in Sept vs 3% increase.
- IMF issues its updated World Economic Outlook
- ECB’s Chair of the Supervisory Board, Andrea Enria, board members Philip Lane, Frank Elderson,
- Bank of Korea holds rates, flags November hike
- German ZEW
- U.S. JOLTS job openings
- U.S. Treasury auctions $96 billion in 3-year and 10-year notes

Prayuth Chan-ocha late on Monday said more than 18 months of mandatory quarantine would end https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-end-quarantine-some-vaccinated-visitors-nov-pm-2021-10-11 next month for vaccinated arrivals from countries considered ""low risk"", including the United States, Britain and China. 
The stock exchange's tourism and leisure index jumped as much as 4.42% when markets opened on Tuesday, compared to a benchmark increase of 0.82%.
Gains were driven by a 4% rise in Airports of Thailand Pcl, Asia Aviation Pcl and Bangkok Airlines Pcl, which rose 5.59% and 3.42%, respectively.
Hotelier, Erawan Group Pcl increased nearly 7% and rival Asset World Corp climbed over 4%. 
Thailand's strict entry requirements had kept COVID-19 infection numbers low until this year, but at a huge loss to jobs and revenues in its vital tourism sector.
Since July, it has operated pilot projects on Samui and Phuket islands allowing for vaccinated visitors and this month reduced quarantine periods elsewhere. 
But arrivals have plummeted to a fraction of the nearly 40 million visitors in 2019, with tourism losing $50 billion in annual revenue, an 82% plunge.
Despite its stringent measures to keep the virus out, Thailand has recorded 1.7 million infections and 17,835 COVID-19 deaths, with 98% of its caseload since April. 
A third of its 72 million residents are vaccinated.
The announcement follows Britain's removal of Thailand from its travel red list https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-eases-travel-rules-countries-including-india-2021-10-07 last week.

Analysts said that although foreign arrivals may not increase quickly, domestic activity would be boosted.

The country's second-largest lender by market capitalisation said a protracted period of low rates, ""subdued"" financial markets and its exit from energy trading would lead to lower earnings at the unit. The bank gave no further explanation of its exit from energy trading.
""Overall we think it is a setback for management as they look to build credibility with investors,"" said  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) banking analyst Brendan Sproules. 
""Investors may raise questions around the timing as (interest) rates have been low for some time, and now potentially on the rise.""
Australian interest rates have been at record lows since November 2020 but economists expect they will start rising again as soon as next year. 
Westpac shares were 1.65% lower, after the bank said the A$1.3 billion one-off charge included provisions to pay out customers seeking remediation for wrongly charged fees, and costs associated with the sale of its life insurance unit.
The company cut the value of its Westpac Institutional Banking (WIB) unit by nearly A$1 billion after ""reducing risk in the division through the exit of energy trading, consolidating our Asian operations and reducing our correspondent banking relationships which have all impacted earnings"", it said in a securities filing.
""At the same time, medium term expectations of a prolonged low interest rate environment, subdued financial markets income and elevated compliance expenses have impacted WIB's earnings outlook,"" the bank added.
Payouts and other costs associated with settling customer lawsuits would add another A$172 million to the one-off charges, while selling costs and tax adjustments linked to the sale of its life insurance unit would add A$267 million to the one-off items.
""It was surprising to see they had more charges related to regulatory issues,"" said Adam Dawes, an investment advisor at Shaw and Partners Ltd. ""We expected Westpac had already accounted for and fixed all those remediation costs.""

The bank is scheduled to report annual results on Nov. 1, and was expected to post a cash profit of A$6.5 billion, according to the average forecast of 13 analysts polled by Refinitiv before the charges were announced, nearly triple the previous year's result which was impacted by COVID-19 loan repayment freezes and other macroeconomic shocks.

Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker reported domestic shipments of 52,153 units last month, following a near-50% jump in August. The automaker exported 3,853 vehicles from its Shanghai factory, China’s Passenger Car Association said on Tuesday. That meant Tesla’s total China shipments in September climbed 27% from August to 56,006.  
The increase is in line with the broader trend for the automaker, which delivered a record 241,300 cars worldwide in the third quarter. At last week’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk said Tesla’s Shanghai factory is now outproducing the Fremont, California plant.

In China, the back-to-back gain in shipments suggests Tesla is moving on from a run of bad publicity, starting in April when a protest by a disgruntled owner at the Shanghai auto show went viral on social media. That was followed by a spate of crashes and regulatory scrutiny of safety and customer service issues, and more recently a driver successfully suing Tesla for fraud over his purchase of a second-hand Model S.
The drop in exports follows a pattern of Tesla prioritizing overseas shipments in the first half of the quarter, before ramping up local deliveries in the latter half of the period.     
Overall retail sales of cars, sport utility vehicles and multipurpose vehicles and minivans fell 17% in September from a year earlier to 1.61 million units, the PCA data showed. 
Deliveries of new-energy vehicles, which include EVs and plug-in hybrids, soared 202% from a year earlier to 334,000 units last month.
“We see strong sales momentum for new energy vehicles going forward,” PCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu said. “Exports to the EU have been spurring overseas shipments.”

646,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Music streamers turn to telcos to make Africa pay,"By Nqobile Dludla and Supantha Mukherjee
JOHANNESBURG/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Africa, with its internationally recognised musical talent - and growing mobile phone use - is central to Swedish music streamer Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)'s plans to extend its reach to a billion customers. 
As African artists such as Nigeria's Burna Boy and South Africa's Black Coffee are streamed across the world, the continent was seen as an obvious choice and is the home to more than a third of the company's 85 new markets. 
The problem is payment on a continent where many people are more likely to have a mobile phone than a bank account.
That means Spotify's first task as it implements a plan announced in February to almost double its footprint is to win over the telecom companies that often equate to banks. 
Phiona Okumu, Spotify's head of music for Sub-Saharan Africa, told Reuters the company secured ""alternative payment methods"", namely M-Pesa, when it moved into Kenya in February.
Owned by Kenya's biggest telecoms operator, Safaricom, M-Pesa is used to send money, save, borrow and make payments for goods and services.
""A lot of African countries are unbanked so that means they don't use credit cards and this is very true for a lot of east African (countries) and in Kenya you use M-Pesa for the most part,"" Okumu said. Elsewhere in Africa, Spotify is seeking other collaborators.
""We are having conversations with the right partners to ensure that we are providing solutions to payment problems that several African consumers face in different parts of the continent,"" Okumu said. 
CHASING THE MOBILE MONEY
Irene Kophen, a Spotify premium user based in Kenya, said she prefers M-Pesa rather than bank cards because she thinks mobile money has made music more accessible. 
""Most of us have access to our phones, but not many of us have cards, or bank accounts,"" the 31-year-old told Reuters. 
Costs associated with opening bank accounts, the distance to financial institutions and the difficulty in meeting ""Know Your Customers"" requirements because of inadequate proof of address https://accuity.com/accuity-insights-blog/the-future-of-compliance-in-africa-how-to-satisfy-local-and-regional-needs-while-meeting-international-standards have added to the appeal of using phones to pay.
""The past few years have seen an emphasis on shifting towards expansion of innovative banking services through mobile technology to capture lower income segments and the unbanked,"" a spokesperson for South Africa's Absa bank said in an emailed statement. 
By 2020, sub-Saharan Africa had 548 million mobile money accounts, up 12% from 2019 - more than any other region in the world, mobile industry body GSMA said. 
That has provided banking access in a continent where about 43% of sub-Saharan Africans over the age of 15 had a bank account in 2017, according to the World Bank, which has not provided any more recent data.
WIN, WIN
Spotify's local rivals, such as Kenya-based and Danish-listed Mdundo and Nigeria headquartered Boomplay have also started to build ties with mobile operators.
Such partnerships are based on telcom providers selling music bundles that give customers access to a streaming company's premium service and exclusively-curated music mixes.
The collaboration can benefit both sides by boosting revenue and helping to increase subscribers, but for the streaming companies it is all-but essential.
""It is critical that streaming companies get this right, otherwise they will lose out on revenue from consumers who were willing, but unable, to pay them,"" Charles Stuart, PwC partner and director of Technology, Media and Telecommunications, said.
For the telecom companies, which also include Airtel Nigeria and Vodacom Tanzania, the partnership can help to achieve customer ""loyalty and stickiness"" by adding value, Stuart said.
MTN, Africa's largest mobile operator with 48.9 million active mobile money users, is integrating its mobile money service onto its MusicTime app to allow payments, Serigne Dioum, group chief digital and fintech officer of MTN, told Reuters.
""We're talking to players who are music-only players and also we're talking to players who have broader reach in music, video and gaming and who can position our digital services much better,"" MTN's Dioum said.
Boomplay, which has 60 million monthly active users, has allowed users to pay via mobile platforms such as M-Pesa and Tigo-Pesa in Kenya and Tanzania. 

It aims to roll out that option in Francophone countries, Tosin Sorinola, Boomplay's director of artiste and media relations, told Reuters.
Mdundo, which had 8.7 million monthly active users as of June, has three telecom partnerships in Nigeria and Tanzania, and expects one or two more similar deals before the end of this year, Chief Executive Officer Martin Nielsen told Reuters. ""When it comes to payments across Africa our key focus is bundling with telcos... because telcos are the ones who have this reach and access to people's pockets,"" he said.

The new retail bank targets a headcount of 25,000 employees and the job cuts will come about through natural attrition, which is estimated at 1,500 a year until 2025.
Announced in Sept 2020, the merger will create a single bank with one branch network, one head office and one IT system serving nearly 10 million clients.

SocGen, France's third-biggest listed lender, said the regrouped network will have around 1,450 branches in 2025 and that the regrouping of the branches will not involve an exit from any town.
The bank said that the restructuring is a pre-emptive approach to the multiple challenges facing retail banks, notably low interest rates, competition, new entrants and an acceleration in digital use due to the pandemic.

The company has a 30-day grace period before any missed payment would constitute a default, according to at least one of the bond’s offering memoranda.
China Evergrande’s Hong Kong shares have been suspended for trading since Oct. 4. Shares in Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd., the developer’s property-services arm, were also suspended on the same day.

(Reuters) - Global cement and concrete makers on Tuesday laid out steps to cut carbon dioxide emissions 25% by 2030 and to reach zero net emissions by mid-century, relying on more carbon-free energy, new chemistry and manufacturing technology, and carbon capture. 
Cement, the glue of concrete, accounts for about 7% of global carbon emissions, and the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) accounts for 80% of concrete made outside of China, and some companies within China. 
The United Nations COP26 climate conference next month is spurring many companies to make emissions pledges. The GCCA plan to meet the previously announced goal of net zero emissions by 2050 did not lay out costs or break down how much each step would cut in emissions.
The plan includes finding and substituting more alternatives to clinker, a binder of cement, more use of alternative fuels, new chemistry and manufacturing processes, carbon capture and storage, increased efficiency in concrete use and pushing governments to approve new forms of concrete and buy them.
In an interview with Reuters ahead of the announcement, GCCA Chief Executive Thomas Guillot said 10 industrial-scale carbon-capture plants pledged in its roadmap by 2030 would be built and paid for by members.
Industry experts have cited major hurdles around getting widely unavailable carbon-capture technology up to speed by 2050, including regulatory issues, safety concerns, cost and public acceptance.
Guillot acknowledged the barriers but said members were having conversations with governments and regulators, while the GCCA had taken the matter up with international bodies. Those conversations also included carbon pricing.
""In 10 years, we need to prove not only the technical feasibility, but also the economic feasibility"" of carbon capture, Guillot said. ""We are confident this will work.""
Jeffrey Rissman, Industry Program Director at California-based Energy Innovation, said the blueprint from the GCCA was ""surprisingly comprehensive,"" praising plans for clinker substitution and use of alternative fuels. But he warned that burning plastic waste as an energy source would not prevent CO2 from getting into the atmosphere.

Mexico's CEMEX, a GCCA member and North America's biggest concrete producer, said it was seeking government support for its carbon capture programs.
""Most of these pilot projects will begin operations between 2023 and 2024. All those that prove to be on the right path will go into the next stage for scaling them up,"" it said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Biden administration is considering a proposal that could allow some pork plants to slaughter pigs more quickly if they boost staffing, a union official said, after a U.S. court struck down a Trump-era rule that removed line speed limits.
The proposal put forward by Quality Pork Processors, operator of a large Minnesota slaughterhouse, and union officials could benefit companies like WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd's Smithfield Foods and JBS USA, the North American unit of Brazilian meatpacker  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY). 
Faster slaughtering would help them increase pork production at a time of high demand and soaring bacon prices.
Seven pork plants were initially able to operate without limits on line speeds after a 2019 U.S. Department of Agriculture rule change that did not need congressional approval. Six of the plants had previously received waivers to run at a faster pace.
A federal judge in March invalidated the policy and forced the plants to slow down following a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union lawsuit against the USDA over concerns about worker safety.
The second-biggest U.S. pig producer, Seaboard Foods, which did not previously have a waiver, sped up an Oklahoma pork plant last year under the 2019 rule. Workers told Reuters the faster line speeds increased injuries, and there were not enough employees to run faster production lines safely.
Under the new proposal, Quality Pork Processors would be able to speed up again if the USDA and unions agree staffing levels are high enough, said Richard Morgan, president of the UFCW local that represents the plant's workers. He said staffing levels could be monitored daily.
""The number of staffing would dictate what the line speed can be that day,"" he said. ""It's all about the staffing.""
USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said last week the USDA was considering Quality Pork Processors' proposal and that it could create the structure for waivers for five other facilities. He did not give details but seemed to refer to the facilities with waivers prior to the 2019 rule. 
""I’m happy that they are tying the line speeds to worker safety, but this is all backroom dealings and does not appear to take into consideration food safety whatsoever,"" said Zach Corrigan, senior staff attorney for Food & Water Watch.
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The USDA did not respond to subsequent questions, nor did Quality Pork Processors respond to requests for comment.
Workers at the company's plant would have more time off and be able to meet production goals more quickly if line speeds and staffing levels increase again, Morgan said. He noted that the workers, who are paid hourly, have been working six days per week to meet production targets. 

The plant's maximum slaughtering capacity dropped by about 7% to 17,700 pigs per week after the court decision took effect, said Steve Meyer, economist for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture. 
Nationally, the pork industry has lost 2.5% of its slaughtering capacity, the National Pork Producers Council said.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) -Planemakers are unveiling new orders and fresh models at the world's largest business jet show this week as they aim to cash in on a boom in private travel, but executives warn of headwinds due to a capacity crunch.
The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) show returns to an in-person format starting in Las Vegas on Tuesday, testing the strength of demand for jets following the emergence of COVID-19. The show will also shed light on the resilience of the aerospace supply chain, given strained logistics worldwide.
Brazil's Embraer said on Monday morning it signed a deal to sell 100 Phenom 300E planes for more than $1.2 billion at list prices to NetJets, with deliveries starting in 2023. 
U.S. planemaker Textron (NYSE:TXT) Aviation announced updates to the models of two of its Cessna Citation jets, the M2 and XLS.
Easing travel restrictions and the lure of private flights have led to an unexpected surge in business aviation, with traffic rising from 2019 levels. That is filling seats for private operators and expanding order backlogs for planemakers, straining the supply of jets, parts and pilots.
Craig Ross, head of California-based Aviation Portfolio, an adviser to business jet clients, said he is seeing cases of flights getting canceled because of a lack of pilots and delays from a shortage of plane parts for maintenance. 
That is occurring in an industry that charges top prices for reliability, with some private operators turning down business to protect service. 
""Everyone will be talking about the same thing: 'How do we deal with this demand,'"" said Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of private jet company VistaJet. ""I'm sure that's going to be a topic at every booth and every cocktail party in Vegas this year.""
One top supplier, Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON) , is predicting a 50% rise in business jet flight hours in 2021 over last year.
General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream Aerospace, one of the largest business jet makers, is not participating due to COVID-19. The U.S. planemaker recently announced two new jets, with its larger G800 set to clash with Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's Global 7500 and Dassault Aviation SA's 10X in a battle of flying penthouses.
It is a boon for private aviation, which has yet to rebound to the 1,300 aircraft delivered in 2008 before the financial crash, said aviation analyst Brian Foley in a recent note. 
Foley said he expects around 700 business aircraft deliveries in 2021, with a ramp-up in production expected to begin in 2022 as planemakers gain confidence the surge is sustainable. 
While Cessna business jet maker Textron Aviation is raising production to meet demand despite supply-chain challenges, Canada's Bombardier is waiting to see how orders evolve.
""We've rebuilt backlog and I like that price is re-firming. But it’s a question of supply and demand,” Bombardier Chief Executive Eric Martel said in a recent interview. 

Some planemakers are watching for signs of a bubble similar to the demand ahead of the 2009 economic crash, which left them on the hook with unsellable jets, said an executive at one corporate jet manufacturer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""Some are wondering is it real or is it 2007 over again?""

The comments marked a new development in a web of corruption probes of some of the world's biggest energy traders across several countries in Latin America. 
""We have found that some of these famous foreign companies were transporting contraband fuel and Trafigura's import permit has been suspended,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. He did not provide details.
Trafigura denied any wrongdoing in an emailed statement.
""Trafigura strongly denies that it is or has been improperly transporting and/or delivering fuel into Mexico. Trafigura complies with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including Mexico,"" it said.
""Trafigura has provided documents and evidence of compliance with applicable requirements to the relevant authorities and will continue to work with the authorities to clarify this situation."" 
Contraband can refer to products smuggled into Mexico or goods brought into the country under false documentation. Lopez Obrador said the attorney general's office was looking into the issue.
Mexico's energy ministry last month said four Trafigura fuel import permits were in the process of cancellation https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/mexicos-energy-ministry-suspends-several-trafigura-import-permits-2021-09-21 while one had expired. 
The company previously said the suspensions were not valid and that it follows the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. 

Mexico is also probing Vitol https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-mexico-probing-vitol-over-false-import-documents-tax-chief-2021-08-05, the world's largest independent energy trader, over ""irregularities"" in the documenting of its refined oil products entering Mexico that could lead to criminal charges for tax evasion.
Vitol has denied any wrongdoing, and previously said the allegations dated back a couple of years and are related to imports classified by another company with which it worked.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a choppy session lower on Monday as investors grew nervous ahead of third-quarter earnings reporting season.
Supply chain problems and higher costs for energy and other things have fueled concern about earnings, set to kick off with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) results on Wednesday.
Indexes reversed early gains after midday and added to losses just before the close. JPMorgan shares were down 2.1% and among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 along with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which fell 1.3%. The S&P financial index was down 1%, while communication services dropped 1.5%.
""The market is a bit cautious going into this earnings season,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Supply chain issues may have impacted earnings for a number of companies and certain industries more than others.""
While another period of strong U.S. profit growth is forecast for Corporate America, earnings are shaping up to be crucial for investors worried about how supply disruptions and inflation pressures will affect bottom lines. 
That could lead to more volatility on Wall Street following a bruising September. Analysts expect a 29.6% year-over-year increase in profit for S&P 500 companies in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 250.19 points, or 0.72%, to 34,496.06, the S&P 500 lost 30.15 points, or 0.69%, to 4,361.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 93.34 points, or 0.64%, to 14,486.20.
The energy sector also ended lower after hitting its highest since January 2020 earlier in the day. Higher oil prices have fed into concerns about rising costs for businesses and consumers.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.15 billion shares, compared with the 10.9 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Trading may have been slower due to the U.S. federal holiday Monday, with U.S. bond markets shut for the day.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are primed for another period of strong U.S. profit growth as third-quarter reports from Corporate America flow in starting this week. But as business continues to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic, new problems are arising that are taking center stage for Wall Street, including supply-chain snags and inflationary pressures.
In the run-up to earnings season, a number of companies have issued downbeat outlooks. FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) said labor shortages drove up wage rates and overtime spending, while  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) blamed a supply-chain crunch and soaring freight costs as it lowered its fiscal 2022 sales estimate and warned of holiday-season delays. 
""The pace of growth is decelerating, but still it's at a meaningful level,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. With the product and labor shortages and inflationary pressures, ""we'll be looking to see to what extent demand is there, and what does it mean for the important holiday spending period.""
Analysts see a 29.6% year-over-year increase in earnings for S&P 500 companies in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv as of Friday, down from 96.3% growth in the second quarter. The third-quarter forecast is down a touch from several weeks ago, a reversal of the recent trend for estimates. 
Third-quarter earnings growth was always expected to be much lower than the blowout gain of the second quarter, when companies had much easier year-ago comparisons because of the pandemic.
""We were going up at such a high clip. The positive revision momentum has lapsed,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of independent research firm The Earnings Scout.
Earnings season is kicking off this week with the big banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).

SUPPLY CHAINS, COSTS 
Investors are weighing the impact of sharply higher energy costs on businesses and consumers after a recent surge in oil and natural gas prices. While higher energy prices should be a boon for energy producers, they are an inflationary risk for many other companies like airlines and other industrials and cut into consumer spending.
U.S. companies have so far this year kept profit margins at record levels because they have cut costs and passed along high prices to customers. Some investors are anxious to see how long that can go on.
Third-quarter earnings arrive with the market still wobbly after a weak and volatile September. The S&P 500 in September registered its biggest monthly percentage drop since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. It was also the index's first monthly decline since January. 
Analysts are skeptical about how much is priced in.
""COVID-related supply chain issues have spread beyond consumer goods. And longer-term signs of global friction are easy to find,"" Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy at BofA Securities, and other BofA strategists wrote in a note on Friday. These issues are far from being fully priced into stocks, they wrote.
Also, while supply chain issues have grabbed investor attention, wage inflation is ""just as big of a headwind (if not bigger,"" BofA strategists wrote in a note Monday. Guidance from companies ""could be ugly,"" they added.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s analysts say that consensus earnings expectations also have not fully priced in the supply-chain constraints facing companies, making it much harder for companies to surpass estimates at the same rate as in recent quarters.
""Consumer Discretionary companies of all kinds are right in the cross hairs of the supply shortages, higher logistics costs and higher labor costs,"" they wrote. Those strategists see the equity market set for a bigger pullback, and say third-quarter earnings could determine how deeply the stock market dips.

However, considering the stock’s weak momentum over the past few months, is AES a good investment now? Let’s discuss.The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in Arlington, Va., is a diversified power generation and utility company. It owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to customers that include utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. The company’s global footprint spans more than 14 countries, operating more than 100 power plants. Shares of AES have gained 20%-plus in price over the past year. In addition, the stock is relatively stable, as reflected by its beta of less than 1.
The company is actively working to strengthen its renewable energy portfolio amid sustainability initiatives worldwide. Moreover, AES is seeking to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. Recently, it announced the acquisition of a 49.9% stake in AES Colón, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, increasing its ownership to 100%. LNG emits less carbon than other fuels. “This acquisition will contribute to maximizing the value of our regional LNG business through the development of important synergies and flexibility across our portfolio,"" said Juan Ignacio Rubiolo, President for AES' Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Strategic Business Unit.
In September, PetroVietnam Gas signed an agreement with AES to form a joint venture to operate an LNG terminal as part of a $1.3 billion LNG-to-power complex. Analysts expect structural global LNG demand to rise 14% by 2025. Also, the U.S.’ liquefaction capacity could rise by more than half, overtaking Australia by 2024. Given the upbeat demand projections, we think AES should benefit in the long term. However, these developments are not expected to generate immediate returns.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shares fell on Monday, having whip-sawed between gains and losses as soaring oil prices that hit multi-year peaks stoked fears about rising prices and tighter monetary policy, lifting the dollar to a near-three-year high against the yen.
A rally in basic material and energy shares on higher oil prices initially lifted major U.S. stock indices. But the gains faded as investors focused on the start of the U.S. corporate earnings season next week.
Some analysts anticipate businesses reporting slowing growth due to supply-chain snags and rising prices. They warned that this could lead to a drop in U.S. stocks.
""Whether the final chapter of the mid-cycle transition ends with a 10% or 20% correction in the S&P 500 will be determined by how much earnings growth decelerates or has to outright decline,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note.
""We are gaining confidence in a sharper deceleration but the timing is more uncertain.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.72%, the S&P 500 fell 0.69%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.64%.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index was little changed, edging up just 0.05%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.33%.
Heading into Tuesday, the mood in Asia could also be hit by news that Chinese property developer Evergrande may miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.
Oil prices, which had jumped on Monday on rebounding demand and cutbacks in supply, gave up some of their early gains but still ended the session higher. [O/R]
Brent crude rose 1.5% to $83.65 a barrel, after climbing as high as $84.60, its highest since October 2018.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude also added 1.5% to finish at $80.52, after touching its highest since late 2014 at $82.18.
Analysts are divided over whether energy supplies are tight enough to warrant oil testing $100 a barrel, but most seemed to agree prices are likely to stay elevated in the short-term.
That helped basic materials and energy stocks in the S&P 500. They jumped 0.96% and 0.88% respectively, Refinitiv data showed, outperforming the broader market.
Rising prices are also fueling bets that major central banks will tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later, lifting the dollar to a near three-year peak against the Japanese yen.
In the United States, investors expect the Federal Reserve to begin tightening policy by announcing a tapering of its massive bond-buying next month. This has hobbled the yen, which is typically sensitive to interest-rate differentials. 
The yen weakened 1.02% against the greenback at 113.38 per dollar, and the dollar index rose 0.238%.
A stronger dollar pushed the euro down 0.14% to $1.1551. 
Gold, usually seen as a hedge against inflation, fell as a stronger dollar offset any inflation-driven gains. Spot gold dropped 0.2% to $1,753.42 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.15% to $1,753.60 an ounce. 

Bitcoin, a barometer of investors' risk appetites, receded a touch but was still up a solid 4.4%.

Elliott, which is one of HTA's largest investors, said the company's longstanding underperformance compared to its peers has stoked frustration and shareholders want it to aim for a sale. HTA shares were up 2.1% at $32.38 in afternoon trading.
The news comes months after HTA Chief Executive Officer Scott Peters stepped down, which Elliot termed as ""abrupt and unexpected"".
""HTA faces a challenging stand-alone future given a disadvantaged ability to compete for acquisition targets, the inherently risky task of having to identify and integrate a new CEO and the difficult mission of repairing and rebuilding the company's culture,"" Elliott said in a letter to HTA's board.
HTA, which invests in real estate primarily consisting of medical office buildings, is presently headed by interim CEO Peter N. Foss. 
Investors believe that HTA should conduct the review, including solicitation of bids, before it makes a decision regarding its new CEO, Elliott said, cautioning the absence of such a review would make it difficult to attract a suitable candidate for the position.
Elliott said it was confident that ""highly credible buyers"" would make offers at a substantial premium to the HTA stock's current trading price. 
In response to the hedge fund's letter, HTA said it had held several discussions with Elliott representatives after it was first contacted by the firm and shared the information with its full board. (https://prn.to/2YHKgtX)

SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese property firms' bonds were hit with another wrecking ball on Monday as Evergrande looked set to miss its third round of bond payments in as many weeks and rivals Modern Land and Sinic became the latest scrambling to delay deadlines.
High-yield Chinese bond markets were routed once again as fears about fast-spreading contagion in the $5 trillion sector, which drives a sizable chunk of the Chinese economy, continued to savage sentiment.
Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping is launching inspections of financial institutions to see if private firms like Evergrande had been too close to state-owned banks, investment firms and financial regulators. Large lenders to Evergrande included financial conglomerate Citic, which is being scrutinized, the WSJ reported. Citic was not immediately available for comment.
Weary investors had been holding out little hope that Evergrande would suddenly stump up Monday's near $150 million of coupon payments, but the fact bondholders said they hadn't received anything this time either just bolstered expectations for a full-scale default.
""The key for offshore holders is the next couple of weeks and whether any payment or communication will come from the company in relation to its first missed offshore coupon,"" wrote Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst, UK & EMEA, at forex trading firm OANDA https://www.oanda.com/us-en in a research note on Monday. 
Erlam wrote that it was ""highly unlikely"" Evergrande would make the payment ""considering how the last two deadlines have gone"". 
A spokesperson for Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment
Once China's largest developer, the firm has more than $300 billion in liabilities that are now at risk.
The cash-strapped property developer's troubles and contagion worries have sent shockwaves across global markets and the firm has already missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.
CST Group Limited, an investment holding company on Monday that it sold 10.5% China Evergrande Notes and 11.5% China Evergrande Notes for $815,000 and $702,000.
Other signs of stress included smaller developer Modern Land asking investors to push back by three months a $250 million bond payment due on Oct. 25 in part ""to avoid any potential payment default.""
Sinic Holdings said it too was likely default next week as it didn't have enough financial resources to make its remaining bond payments this year. It has one at the start of next week, although that bond was already down 75%. 
Modern Land's April 2023 bond with a coupon of 9.8% plunged more than 25% to 32.25 cents on the day, according to financial data provider Duration Finance, while the company's shares have lost a third of their value over the last month.
Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property developer to default back in 2015, also saw some of its bonds slump to well under half their face value. R&F Properties and Greenland Holdings, which both have prestige projects in global cities like London, New York and Sydney, were also widely sold.
""It's a disastrous day,"" said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, highlighting how even some supposedly safer ""investment grade"" firms had now seen 20% wiped off their bonds.
""We think it's driven by global fund outflow .... Fundamentally, we are worried the mortgage management onshore hits the developers' cash flow hard,"" he added, referring to concerns people could stop putting deposits down on new homes. 
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) also highlighted how international investors were now demanding the highest ever premium to buy or hold 'junk'-rated Chinese debt. 
There is now a whopping 1,200 basis point difference between the bank's closely-followed JACI China high yield index and a similar index of investment grade AA-rated local Chinese market bonds, known as ""onshore"" bonds. 
""Evergrande's contagion risk is now spreading across other issuers and sectors,"" JPMorgan's analysts said. 
Another London based analyst who asked not to be named said: ""Slowly and gradually we are seeing the rest of the Chinese property sector fall apart"".
SHAKY FOUNDATIONS 
In equity markets, the Hang Seng Property and Construction sub-index fell 0.4% against a nearly 2% rise in the broader index. 
Fantasia Group China Co, whose controlling shareholder is Fantasia Holdings, said on Monday it would adjust the trading mechanism of its Shanghai-traded bonds following credit downgrades by China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co (CCXI).
Fantasia had appointed advisers on Friday after it shocked markets by missing a bond payment earlier in the week. It saw its bonds dive from almost 100 cents on the dollar to just 20 cents, as just a couple of weeks earlier it had said its liquidity was fine.
""We believe policymakers have zero tolerance for systemic risk to emerge and are aiming to maintain a stable property market, and policy support could be forthcoming if the deterioration in property activity levels worsen,"" said Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
""That said, we also believe that policymakers do not want to over-stimulate, and their longer term goal is to deleverage the property sector."" 
Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province, has become one of the first cities in China to announce measures to support property developers and their projects, which have been shaken by the Evergrande crisis.

Advisers to offshore bondholders said on Friday they not yet heard from Evergrande, and are also demanding more information about its plan to divest some businesses, worried a potential fire-sale could ultimately leave them with less.
Trading in shares of Evergrande, as well as its Evergrande Property Services Group unit, has been halted since Oct. 4 pending a major deal announcement.

Stellantis will assign Mirafiori a new electrified platform to build Maserati sedans between 2022 and 2024, making Turin, where it already produces the electric 500, the group's hotspot for electrification in Italy. 
Future production of the electric 500 is also confirmed in Turin, Stellantis added in a statement, after presenting the plan in Rome to the industry and labour ministers and unions.
All 1,100 workers and functions in Grugliasco will move to Mirafiori by 2024 with no overall impact on jobs in the area, the group said without giving details about what happens to the Grugliasco site after that date. Assembly operations will move immediately.
Grugliasco, where Stellantis makes some Maserati models, is just four km from Mirafiori. Its workers have often moved between the two sites based on production needs. 
The plan marks a new step in Stellantis' effort to overhaul its production in Italy, which has been under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere in Europe since the group was formed at the beginning of this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA. 
In June, Stellantis decided to base production at Melfi, its largest facility in the country, on a single enhanced line that will merge two existing ones with unchanged capacity. It will build four medium-segment electric vehicles, of different brands, from 2024.

It also said in July it would build one of its three European battery factories in Italy, at the Termoli site, which currently makes internal combustion engines.
Industry Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said in a statement that there was an ongoing ""huge effort"" to support the Termoli gigafactory initiative with public funds.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) said on Monday it had wrapped up a 2.16 billion euro ($2.5 billion) capital increase and used the proceeds to repay 1.5 billion euros in state aid as it banks on a rebound in air travel. 
The German airline paid back the first of two tranches of hybrid capital, dubbed silent participation, it received as part of a 2020 bailout, it said.
The company added it also intends to fully repay the second tranche, worth 1 billion euros, before the end of this year. 
""Today, we are keeping our promise and paying back a large part of the stabilization funds earlier than expected. We are increasingly confident about the future,"" said Chief Executive Carsten Spohr.
He added demand for flights, especially from business travellers, was growing daily, though the market remained challenging. 
The airline also aims to terminate an unused portion of the first participation tranche before the end of 2021. A state loan of 1 billion euros was repaid in February.
Lufthansa said last week its rights issue was 98.36% subscribed by investors, and the remainder was quickly sold in the open market.
The airline last year received a 9 billion euro government bailout to stay afloat through the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the German state's Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) taking 15% of Lufthansa's shares.

That stake was trimmed in the rights issue to 14.09%.
Lufthansa said on Monday the ESF had committed not to sell any shares over the next six months, but would divest them completely in the 24 months after the capital increase, provided the airline repays the two participation tranches, among other contractual requirements.

""While our associates have been reporting for work, we have lost production since the strike commenced ... as a number of suppliers to the plant have been affected,"" Hailey Philander told Reuters.
She said production of around 700 vehicles was lost, but gave no further details.
The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) launched the strike last Tuesday after pay talks with employer bodies reached a deadlock, raising fears the action would spill over and block supplies of parts to make new cars.
BMW's plant is at Rosslyn, around 60 kilometres from the commercial city of Johannesburg.
On Friday, NUMSA said its members were considering a new proposal to end the strike. On Monday, the union was still collating feedback before making a decision.
NUMSA, with around 155,000 members organised in the sector, wants an 8% across-the-board wage hike in the first year, and inflation plus 2% for the second and third years.
Industry body Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (SEIFSA) had initially offered 4.4% for 2021, inflation plus 0.5% in 2022 and inflation plus 1% in the third year.

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca's antibody cocktail against COVID-19, which has proven to work as a preventative shot in the non-infected, was also shown to save lives and prevent severe disease when given as treatment within a week of first symptoms. 
The drug, a combination of two antibodies called AZD7442, reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 or death by 50% in non-hospitalised patients who have had symptoms for seven days or less, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said on Monday.
The risk reduction was even better in patients who started therapy within just five days of initial symptoms, but AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) joins an already crowded field of medicines that were shown to prevent deterioration in patients with mild disease when given soon after diagnosis.
AstraZeneca executive Mene Pangalos said in a media call that the treatment results would mainly underscore the potential future use as a non-vaccine prevention.[FWN2R716N]
""If and when this is approved it will be used in the treatment setting as well. But the real differentiator for this antibody is going to be in the prophylactic setting,"" he said.
Similar therapies made with a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies are being developed by Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) with partner Vir. These therapies are approved for emergency use in the United States for treating mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Regeneron's therapy showed 72% protection against symptomatic infection in the first week, and 93% after that.
GSK-Vir's showed a 79% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation or death due to any cause, while Eli Lilly's therapy showed a 70% reduction in viral load at day seven compared to a placebo.
Merck & Co Inc, in turn, is emphasising the convenience of use of its anti-COVID-19 tablet, which cut the risk of having to got to hospital or of dying by 50% in a trial of early-stage patients who had at least one risk factor.
Merck, collaborating with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, on Monday applied for U.S. emergency clearance for the oral drug.
AstraZeneca, whose COVID-19 vaccine has been widely used across the globe, asked U.S. regulators last week to grant emergency use authorisation for AZD7442 as a preventative shot.
As such, it is designed to protect people who do not have a strong enough immune response to vaccines, primarily those who have received organ transplants or who are in cancer care.
If full market clearance is obtained after any emergency approval the market could widen, for instance, to include crew and passengers of a cruise ship, said Pangalos.
""You can say the same for people who don't want to be vaccinated but want an antibody,"" he added.
AstraZeneca said it is submitting the new treatment data on AZD7442 to global health regulators.
The trial took place across 13 countries and involved more than 900 adult participants, 90% of whom suffered from conditions that made the particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, such as cancer and diabetes. One half receiving AZD7442 and the rest a placebo. 
Full trial results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, AstraZeneca said.

AZD7442 contains laboratory-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection. A vaccine, in contrast, relies on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells.
While Monday's results cover the use of AZD7442 in non-hospitalised patients, a separate trial is also studying its use as a treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients.

The target translates into an upside of around 32% on the stock from its current level, based on the analyst’s belief that the company will remain a market leader in the online sports betting and gaming business.
Jason Bazinet thinks the opportunities offer investors exposure to ""robust, long-term growth"".

(Reuters) -KKR & Co Inc said on Monday it has elevated its co-presidents Scott Nuttall and Joseph Bae to co-chief executive officers, succeeding the storied private equity firm's billionaire co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts.
The transition has been in the works for years and is unlikely to surprise the firm's investors. KKR had named Bae, 49, and Nuttall, 48, as co-presidents in 2017. KKR said on Monday that Kravis, 77, and Roberts, 78, would remain involved in the running of the firm as executive co-chairmen.
KKR's shares have tripled in value and its assets under management and distributable earnings have doubled since Bae and Nuttall officially became Kravis and Roberts' top lieutenants four years ago, KKR said. 
The shares were trading up 2% at $68.80 per share on Monday morning. 
""We view the moves as orderly, and would not expect any breakage in assets under management or earnings,""  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts wrote in a note to investors.
Nuttall and Bae will face a challenge replicating the successful working relationship of the two cousins who started KKR 45 years ago. From having their last names as two of the three initials in KKR to fostering a close-knit culture of old-school Wall Street loyalty, Kravis and Roberts have maintained a tight grip on the firm and helped shape the leveraged buyout industry.
The move leaves Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc CEO Stephen Schwarzman, 74, as the only founder of a major publicly listed private equity firm not to have relinquished the role of chief executive, though his No. 2, president and chief operating officer Jonathan Gray, has been in line for years to succeed him.
In 2018,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc CEO Kewsong Lee took over from co-founders David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello, and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp CEO Michael Arougheti succeeded co-founder Tony Ressler. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc co-founder Marc Rowan became CEO in March, replacing Leon Black who stepped down in the wake of scrutiny of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Nuttall and Bae both joined KKR in 1996. Nuttall had previously spent less than two years at Blackstone, while Bae had a similarly short stint at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)'s principal investments group.
Nuttall helped take KKR public, a process that involved merging the firm with an Amsterdam-listed fund in 2009 and then moving the listing to New York in 2010. He has been a fixture on the firm's quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts and also ran KKR's capital markets, insurance, credit, hedge funds and fundraising initiatives. 
Bae has been the main driver of KKR's expansion into Asia, making the firm one of the largest U.S. private equity investors on the continent. The Korean-American dealmaker also sat on the investment committees of KKR's global private equity business.
By attracting money from some of the world's largest institutional investors such as pension plans and sovereign wealth funds, KKR grew from a single $30 million fund in 1978 to more than $429 billion in assets under management currently. These assets span private equity, real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds. 
KKR first gained widespread recognition through its $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1988, a battle that was immortalized in the bestseller ""Barbarians at the Gate"". Its current investments include beauty products maker Wella AG and media group Axel Springer SE.
Kravis and Roberts have an estimated net worth of $8.6 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, according to Forbes.

In addition to its leadership changes, KKR said on Monday it would take steps to eliminate its dual-class share structure. Carlyle was the first major publicly listed private equity firm to do this in 2019, followed by Apollo this year. 
KKR said that its common shareholders will be able to vote on a one-to-one basis on all major important issues, including the election of board directors. It added that this will be achieved though a complex web of mergers of KKR entities to be completed by 2026.

So, popular Chinese EV stocks NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (LI), which beat their third-quarter vehicle sales estimates, could be worth watching.Despite the semiconductor chip shortage severely affecting the electric vehicle (EV) industry, EV sales of Chinese companies have gotten a boost due to government subsidies and other preferential policies. In addition, the Chinese government would like 20% of new cars sold to be new energy vehicles by 2025.
Moreover, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology indicated there could be sector consolidation. Tu Le, the founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights, said that he expects China’s top electric-car makers to benefit from efforts to consolidate the industry “since it’ll eliminate potential competitors and perhaps allow them to acquire a team or technology to enhance their products.”
As a result, famous Chinese EV makers NIO Inc. (NIO), XPeng Inc. (XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (LI), which delivered higher-than-expected EV sales in the third quarter, could be solid additions to your watch list.

Since December 2020, coal prices have soared from $50/ton to over $200/ton. Some of the major factors for strength in coal prices are the rising price of natural gas, years of underinvestment in CAPEX, and utilities in the US switching away from coal due to environmental regulations.
During the pandemic, coal production dropped even more, while demand has turned out to be more robust than expected. Natural gas production and transportation have also been disturbed by the same supply chain issues that are affecting so many industries across the world. As a result, many countries are having to increase coal consumption to meet the shortfall.

Europe's mining sector surged 3% to post its biggest daily gain in three months as iron ore and coking coal rallied on supply fears, while base metals prices jumped on concerns about rising cost of energy and raw materials. [IRONORE/] [MET/L]
As a global energy crunch lifted crude prices, oil stocks rose more than 1%, as did auto shares, offsetting losses in travel & leisure, utility and retail names. [O/R]
The pan-European STOXX 600 index recouped losses of as much as 0.6% on the day, to end marginally higher. A heavy presence of commodity-related companies saw London's FTSE 100 outperform with a 0.7% rise. 
""Inflation is set to stay higher for longer than we previously envisaged due to surging energy prices and goods shortages. The boost from energy will go into reverse next year due to base effects and lower oil and gas prices,"" said the global economics team at Capital Economics. 
""Goods shortages are worsening and will persist for some time... These pressures should start to ease next year. But there is a risk that the shortages trigger a more persistent pick-up in price pressures.""

An authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could help change clinical management of COVID-19 as the pill can be taken at home.
The treatment, molnupiravir, cut the rate of hospitalization and death by 50% in a trial of mild-to-moderately ill patients who had at least one risk factor for the disease, according to data released earlier this month.
The interim efficacy data on the drug, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, had heavily dented the shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers and set off a scramble among nations, including Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore, to sign a supply deal with Merck.
The drugmaker has a U.S. government contract to supply 1.7 million courses at a price of $700 per course. Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021.
It has also agreed to license the drug to several India-based generic drugmakers, which are expected to supply the treatment to more than 100 low- and middle-income countries.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s infused antiviral remdesivir is generally given only once a patient is hospitalized. 

Monoclonal antibody drugs from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which are typically infused as well, have so far seen only limited use due to the difficulty in administering them. 
Merck's shares opened roughly 1% higher before paring some gains to trade at $81.32.

The executive cited the group’s focus on high-end labels with heritage and a history of craftsmanship as a continued emphasis, but also indicated interest in new brands with strength in fashion technology, as well as Chinese labels that could complement the group’s existing brands. 
""We are open to any good targets, we don’t have restrictions as to whether they are Western or Chinese, young or old – we’re open,"" she said, noting that luxury labels have proven resilient during the COVID-19 crisis, thanks to demand from middle class consumers seeking a lift from high quality products. 
Cheng declined to provide a value range for potential acquisitions targets, but noted the group is backed by its larger owner, the conglomerate Fosun International. 
She noted plans to grow the group through retail expansion, e-commerce and expanding product lines.

Chinese shoppers are the biggest buyers of luxury goods worldwide and China also has its own fashion companies. But Chinese companies, including ones that have purchased established European labels, have so far found it hard to take off in Western markets.

London-based Elliptic said the Series C round was led by Evolution Equity, with SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Wells Fargo Strategic Capital investing for the first time. Other investors include Japan's SBI Group, Elliptic said in a statement, without disclosing its valuation.

“The prime minister hoped to see a net-zero commitment,” his office said Monday following a phone call between Johnson and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The U.K. is also seeking an “ambitious nationally determined contribution from Saudi Arabia,” it said, referring to pledges under the Paris climate agreement.
The UAE this month become the first of the Persian Gulf petrostates to commit to zeroing out emissions within its borders, and said it would invest almost $165 billion in clean energy by 2050. Johnson is now pushing Saudi Arabia to make a similar move ahead of key UN climate talks starting later this month.
The world’s biggest oil exporter has faced criticism that it’s acting too slowly on emissions, with research group Climate Action Tracker rating its policies as “critically insufficient.” The kingdom has pledged to stop burning oil in its local power plants by 2030 and instead use solar, wind and gas for the grid. But it also argues that the world will need oil for decades to come.
Saudi neighbor Qatar, the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, on Monday criticized nations that make net-zero pledges without having a proper plan in place to bring them to fruition. It also said that gas, a cleaner fuel than oil or coal, would remain crucial to the global economy for decades.

Momentum is growing for international climate agreements ahead of the UN COP26 talks beginning Oct. 31 in Glasgow, Scotland. The U.S. and the European Union announced Monday that two dozen more countries have joined a global pact to pare methane output, meaning nations backing the pledge now represent about 30% of global emissions of the polluting gas.
The U.K.’s Johnson and the Saudi crown prince “agreed on the importance of G-20 countries making substantive progress on climate change and reducing emissions ahead of the COP26 Summit,” the prime minister’s office said. They also discussed opportunities for further trade and investment.

(Reuters) - Weeks of stock market volatility have done little to dent the record-setting pace of U.S. initial public offerings, with capital market insiders forecasting a strong finish to the year and a robust pipeline of listings in 2022.
More than 2,000 IPOs raised a combined $421 billion globally by the end of September, a record high, as private companies rushed to attain the soaring valuations of their publicly listed peers. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data. 
Four IPOs were withdrawn or postponed in the United States in the last three weeks, according to Dealogic. Uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling, the financial woes of Chinese property developer Evergrande and spiraling energy prices and inflation fueled wild swings in the stock market, making it more difficult for companies to price their stock market debuts. 
Still, U.S. IPOs proved more resilient than those in Europe, where seven listings were pulled. With U.S. lawmakers agreeing last week to postpone the debt ceiling issue for two months and investors coming to grips with the Chinese property market's jitters, IPO bankers and lawyers said most companies were keeping their listing plans on track.
""We see not only new deals coming to the market, we see existing engagements continuing to move forward,"" said Marc Jaffe, managing partner of law firm Latham & Watkins' New York office. 
In the last three weeks, IFIT Health & Fitness Inc, owner of the NordicTrack fitness brand, Allvue Systems Holdings, an alternative investment technology solutions provider, and Cingulate and AEON Biopharma, two biotechnology firms, pulled their U.S. IPOs, blaming market volatility. 
IPO hopefuls that braved the market volatility were rewarded by investors, albeit less than they previously expected. Shares of U.S. companies that went public in the last four weeks have gone up 25.5% on average, compared with a 42% rise in value for those that went public this time about four months ago, according to Dealogic. 
Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity capital markets at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), said the recent IPO jitters showed that the market was resilient, but that investors were becoming more selective.
""Investors have narrowed the scope of investments to consider given overall muted performance in the secondary market,"" Cooney said.

Among the biggest high-profile IPOs expected by the end of the year are those of electric vehicle market Rivian Automotive and chipmaker GlobalFoundries. More are expected soon, industry insiders said. 
""There are kick-off meetings and bake-offs and preparation is underway for what looks like an equally strong 2022 pipeline,"" Latham & Watkins' Jaffe said.

So, we think it could be wise to bet now on fundamentally sound fertilizer stocks  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR), The  Mosaic Company  (NYSE:MOS), and Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI). Let’s discuss.Supply chain disruptions, transportation issues, labor shortages, and the negative impact of climate change on agricultural output continue to drive food prices higher. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) monthly Food Price Index, global food prices rose nearly 33% in September 2021 compared to the year-ago period.
Furthermore, rising population and dietary shifts are expected to increase food demand, helping the fertilizer industry grow. According to a Global Market Insights report, the fertilizer market is expected to grow at a 2.4% CAGR from 2021 to 2027.
So, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally strong fertilizer stocks Nutrien Ltd. (NTR), The Mosaic Company (MOS), and Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI). They are expected to generate significant returns in the coming months.

""I don't think treatment is where we are going to be competing,"" Mene Pangalos, executive vice president for bio-pharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said during a media briefing. 
""It's good that we know this can work in the treatment setting. If and when this is approved it will be used in the treatment setting as well. But the real differentiator for this antibody is going to be in the prophylactic setting,"" he said.

The experimental monoclonal antibodies therapy, called AZD7442, reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 or death by half in non-hospitalised patients who have had symptoms for seven days or less in a late-stage trial.
Pangalos added that the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker would use its existing supply chains to manufacture the antibodies and would have supplies online by the end of the year and ""ready to go"" by the time of approvals.

Investing.com – Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) stock rose 4.5% on Monday after the company said it will buy Ferrous Processing and Trading Company to gain access to prime scrap and expand its portfolio of high-quality iron-ore pellets and other ferrous raw materials.
Cleveland has assigned FPT an enterprise value of approximately $775 million, on a cash-free, debt-free basis.
FPT is among the largest processors and distributors of prime ferrous scrap in the U.S., representing approximately 15% of the domestic merchant prime scrap market. It processes approximately 3 mtpa of scrap, approximately half of which is prime grade.
Cleveland-Cliffs’ CEO Lourenco Goncalves said that with all the new flat-rolled capacity coming online in the market over the next 4 years, prime scrap will become more and more scarce.
As the largest supplier of flat rolled steel in North America, Cleveland-Cliffs is the main source of the steel that generates prime scrap in manufacturing facilities. The buyer also consumes a very significant amount of scrap.
The acquisition will enhance the company’s ability to buy back prime scrap directly from its clients, cutting the middlemen and improving the margin contribution from scrap for both Cleveland-Cliffs and for the manufacturing and service center clients that will be able to sell scrap directly back to it, according to Goncalves."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened marginally higher on Monday against a backdrop of unease over high energy prices that appear ever more likely to feed through into higher inflation and tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. 
Trading volumes were moderate, however, depressed by the Columbus Day holiday, as well as by the awareness that the third-quarter earnings season is about to start. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 58 points, or 0.2%, at 34,804 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%. 
JPMorgan is due to kick off earnings season on Wednesday, with analysts expecting it to grind out a rise of less than 3% in earnings per share, compared to the third quarter of 2020. But bank stocks have fared better than most, recently, as the rise in bond yields has brightened the outlook for their core lending businesses. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield had its highest close in over three months on Friday at 1.61%. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock inched up 0.3% in early trading, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock gained another 0.9% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 1.5%.
Energy names dominated the list of early gainers once again, after crude oil prices surged to a fresh seven-year high overnight.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 0.7% while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 2.2%. 
But the biggest gainers were Chinese companies' American Depositary Receipts, after signs that Beijing may be relenting in its pressure on tech companies after a barrage of criticism during the summer that was widely interpreted as an attack on the extreme wealth accumulated by the sector's biggest names. Meituan ADRs rose 4.5% after the company received a relatively light fine of $534 million from antitrust regulators for various abuses of its dominant market position. It's now recouped almost all the losses it's suffered since July.
Other Chinese ADRs - notably those already in the authorities' cross-hairs - also fared well on hopes that those companies too will be able to avoid the worst-case scenario.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs, which had fallen more than 50% from their 2020 peak during the summer, rose 3.4%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) rose 1%. 
Among the losers were Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock, falling 2.4% after a weekend in which bad weather scuppered its ambitious plans for cashing in on the Columbus Day weekend. Weather problems in Florida led to a cascade of problems that left aircraft and personnel in the wrong parts of the country, forcing the airline to cancel over 1,000 flights.
 Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) stock lost 0.7% after it lost its CEO to medical leave just as the key holiday season approaches, while Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) stock fell 1.6% after it agreed to spin off its industrial software businesses into a venture with Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN), which rose 8.7%."

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Monday it will assess the risks and benefits of the drug, called Ronapreve, and it could issue an opinion within two months. The agency has already started a rolling review of the treatment.
Ronapreve has received emergency approval to treat COVID-19 in more than 20 countries including the United Kingdom and United States. It belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies that mimic natural antibodies produced by the body to fight off infections.
The EMA said it was assessing clinical data investigating the effectiveness of the drug in preventing hospitalisation in outpatients, and another study looking at effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in adults and children at risk of infection from a household member diagnosed with the disease.

Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s antiviral, remdesivir, is the only COVID-19 treatment that has been approved for use in the European Union.
Marketing authorisation has been submitted for other COVID-19 treatments including Lilly's rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant, Sobi's Kineret, Celltrion's regdanvimab and arthritis drug tocilizumab, sold by Roche as RoActemra.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Private business jets once provided refuge from airport waiting lines for the few that could afford them, but the fading pandemic has driven demand to such heights that even wealthy travelers now face cancellations and delays.
While a headache for some jet set travelers, the crunch is a boon for makers of corporate planes built to carry 19 or less passengers in luxury, with announcements for new orders expected at the world's largest business jet show that starts Tuesday.
Some fractional ownership and charter plane operators are turning away business, face a further crunch as the holiday season looms - and are buying more planes. 
Traffic has surged above 2019 levels in the United States. Combined with staffing shortages, the situation is squeezing industry services from fueling to catering, while fewer spare planes are available to replace jets that break down, executives said. 
To protect service, NetJets Inc recently suspended sales of jet cards, which allow customers to pre-pay for blocks of flight hours. 
The world's largest private jet company said it is investing approximately $2.5 billion for 100 new aircraft to be delivered between now and the end of 2022.
""The vast number of flights is taxing the air travel infrastructure in ways we haven’t seen in years,"" said Ohio-based NetJets.
It saw about 10 times more flights delayed due to air traffic control in June 2021, compared with June 2020 when flights dived during the pandemic.
Flight demand is ""currently exceeding all other highs"" in its 57 years, with an average of around 500 flights a day compared to under 400 a day in 2019, it said in a statement.
""While most owners have experienced business as usual in their recent travels, a few have felt the challenges that coincide with heightened demand across the industry,"" it said.
Fly Exclusive, which provides jets to charter operators in a kind of wholesale business, is seeing a significant increase in requests since their clients are increasingly running short of aircraft.
Investors closely watch the dynamic in the private jet market as operators are key customers for corporate planemakers.
The delays are creating complaints among affluent travelers who are already looking for alternatives.
Amanda Applegate, a partner at aviation law firm Aerlex Law Group said she received 10 calls last month alone from clients who were unhappy with their service.
""In good times I don’t get any calls or at most one or two every six months or so,"" said Applegate, who works on deals to buy and sell planes and is an information hub for her clients.
Applegate said she isn't quite sure what to tell private jet clients who are looking for the best service. ""There's just not enough capacity.""

Ian Moore, chief commercial officer at private jet company VistaJet, said there is less tolerance in the industry for customers who cancel or put off flights at the last minute without penalty because they get stuck at in a meeting.
Now, the planes don't wait. ""There's just not enough supply for that anymore,"" Moore said.

Investing.com – Hasbro stock (NASDAQ:HAS) traded 1.2% lower in Monday’s premarket as its Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner went on a leave with immediate effect for health reasons.
The company said Goldner is taking leave for health reasons, citing his disclosure in August 2020 that he was undergoing continued medical care following treatment for cancer in 2014.
Rich Stoddart, most recently the Lead Independent Director of Hasbro’s board, has been appointed as Interim CEO.
Goldner joined Hasbro in 2000 and became its CEO in May 2008.
The company posted a 54% jump in second-quarter revenue to $1.32 billion, riding on demand for toys and digital-gaming segment.
Wizards of the Coast and gaming segment revenue more than doubled in the second quarter and surpassed 2019 numbers. This was led by Dungeons & Dragons, Duel Masters, as well as the launch of Foosketball. 
The company had in July said it was on track for double-digit revenue growth for the full year. It's one of a host of U.S. companies facing unprecedented challenges with shipping goods from China to market in time for the peak holiday season.

The move, announced late on Sunday, follows Goldner's statement last year that he had been under continued medical treatment following his cancer diagnosis in 2014.
Stoddart, the CEO of marketing firm  InnerWorkings  (NASDAQ:INWK) Inc until last year, takes the position at a time when Hasbro is battling industry-wide supply-chain issues to ensure its toys hit store shelves in time for the pivotal holiday season.
Long-time CEO Goldner's medical leave is a ""big shock"" but will likely not impact Hasbro's ability to execute its strategy of focusing more on boosting its entertainment and licensing business, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note.

The deal that will see $6 billion cash going out from Emerson to AspenTech shareholders got a muted response from the former’s shareholders. Aspen stock traded 4.6% higher at $141.55 in premarket.
The aim of the deal is to provide a fuller suite of services to a wide range of industry verticals at a time when most of big companies, from energy to chemicals, are committing billions of dollars in investment to meet booming deamnd.  
The transaction, comprising cash and stock, values each AspenTech share at $160, a premium of 13% to its Friday close.
AspenTech shareholders will receive approximately $87 per share in cash and 42 cents of stock of the merged entity for each share of AspenTech they own.
Upon completion of the transaction, expected to happen by June, Emerson will own 55% of the new AspenTech on a fully diluted basis and AspenTech shareholders will own 45%.
Emerson President and Chief Executive Officer Lal Karsanbhai said Aspen will be used for both acquisition and organic growth. New AspenTech is expected to have FY22 annual revenue of $1.1 billion.
The new AspenTech will derive 86% of pro forma revenue from software and 14% from services.
Emerson reiterated its annual underlying sales guidance of around 5.5%.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",France's Carrefour and Auchan end talks over $19.4 billion tie-up,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) -Carrefour and Auchan have ended talks over a possible partnership, the second time this year  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) boss Alexandre Bompard's plans to create a Gallic supermarket powerhouse have been frustrated.
The potential deal to create a retailer with combined sales of 110 billion euros per year and a French market share of nearly 30%, had looked too complex in terms of valuation and structure, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
A second source familiar with the talks said Auchan had offered Carrefour 21.50 euros per share, or 16.8 billion euros ($19.4 billion), comprised of 70% in cash and 30% in shares of the combined company. 
That's more than 30% above Carrefour's share price last week. But Carrefour ended the talks after its top shareholder, the Moulin family, opposed the deal - mainly on valuation grounds, the source added. 
A person close to the Moulin family, however, told Reuters the family had opposed the tie-up because it ""lacked industrial rationale"" and could raise competition issues as well as threaten jobs in France.
In January, Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard dropped a 16.2 billion euro bid for Carrefour after the French government opposed the deal, citing food security concerns.
This left Carrefour without the extra firepower to galvanise a turnaround plan Chairman and CEO Bompard was reappointed in May to lead for another three years.
The extra resources offered by Couche-Tard would have boosted Carrefour's e-commerce roll-out, a priority as it looks to retain an edge over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on the groceries front. 
The discussions with Auchan, which started in the spring, reviewed various scenarios ranging from equity tie-ups to asset swaps and technological partnerships, the first source said.
It was unclear if there was potential for talks to be revived. The second source said Auchan, owned by the Mulliez family, did not plan to make a hostile move for Carrefour.
CONSOLIDATION
Analysts have expressed concern that an Auchan-Carrefour merger would increase exposure to the struggling hypermarket store format. Some, however, have said a deal could generate cost savings and buying synergies.
Bompard has repeatedly said the retail sector is bound to consolidate and his mission is to ensure Carrefour emerges as a winner. 
In 2018, Carrefour and French rival Casino were locked in a dispute after Casino said it had rejected a tie-up approach that Carrefour denied making.
Carrefour said in June it had also started considering possible tie-ups and divestments for its foreign subsidiaries, but that it had not made a decision to sell any assets. 
Carrefour shares were 1.4% lower at 15.8 euros as of 1110 GMT.

""We think there is potential for further offers from Auchan or at least strategic assets disposals,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Austin prides itself on ""keeping it weird,"" but the city's success at luring more big companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has some residents wary of getting priced out of their unique culture.
Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, said on Thursday the electric car maker will move its headquarters https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-moving-headquarters-austin-texas-says-ceo-musk-2021-10-07 from Palo Alto, California, to Austin, Texas.
Housing prices in the Austin metro area have skyrocketed in recent years, with large tech firms including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) building new campuses in and around the city.
""I'm really happy for all the jobs this will create, but my family is already unable to buy a house right now, and it will only get worse with Tesla,"" Trish Webb, 47, a resident of South Austin, said on Friday while on her lunch break from her job as a hospital administrative assistant.
Median prices for Austin houses have risen some 40% over the last two years, with the median price for a house around $549,000 in September, according to real estate brokerage  Redfin  (NASDAQ:RDFN). 
Frequent reports of out-of-state buyers, particularly Californians, purchasing houses in cash at double the asking price have frustrated many Austinites. Over the summer, nearly three in every four houses sold in the city went for above the asking price, Redfin data showed. 
Even before Musk's relocation announcement, the electric vehicle maker planned to bring some 10,000 workers to an imposing new factory east of the city center. It is unclear how many corporate workers Tesla will relocate from California, or hire in Texas.
""All these Californians coming here is also changing the culture, and I'm worried it will become too much,"" said Reed Chorry, 26, who moved to Austin from Houston several years ago and works in sales.
The city's unofficial motto - ""Keep Austin Weird"" - has given rise to a quirky, bohemian cultural scene that has turned local music festivals like Austin City Limits and South by Southwest into national attractions.
""It will be hard to keep that up when Austin becomes bigger and bigger,"" said Ryan Baker, 32, who works at a restaurant in East Austin.
Austin Mayor Steve Adler welcomed Tesla's decision and said the company fits right in with Austin's strong innovative, entrepreneurial and environmentally focused culture. His office did not respond to questions about housing affordability.
Austin's rapid growth is also expected to exacerbate the city's congestion problems, with three out of four residents driving to work alone in their car.
While Austin is working to improve its public transit network, Tesla's factory is located in a transit desert. 
The city may evaluate transit options to the plant, but it expects most of Tesla's workers to drive to the plant, Austin Transportation Director Rob Spillar said. Austin hopes an increase in housing, stores and medical clinics will attract workers to live close to the plant, Spillar said.
Roberts Communities, a developer for affordable manufactured housing, is hoping to benefit. The company has bought large plots of land just minutes from the Tesla factory and sells houses at around $80,000.

Tesla factory workers will receive an average annual salary of $47,000, an income considered low by Travis County's health and human services division.
""All those workers will want to live somewhere nice, clean and affordable with their families,"" said Brandon Long, a Roberts Communities sales manager at the local Oak Ranch site.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 07:23AM ET</span>","Britain likely to adopt Sarbanes-Oxley style audit rules in some form, says regulator","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to adopt landmark U.S.-style safeguards on financial reporting in some form even if the government shies away from legislation, the UK's accounting watchdog said on Monday.
The government will say before the end of the year how it will legislate to apply some or all recommendations from three reviews of corporate governance and auditing, after big company collapses at retailer BHS and builder Carillion raised questions about audit quality.
The government has proposed that directors state why they believe their company's internal controls and risk management are strong enough to ensure accurate financial reporting.
It draws on U.S. rules from 2002 known as Sarbanes-Oxley or SOX, where directors can go to prison for breaches, though no such penalty has been proposed in Britain.
Jon Thompson, CEO of the Financial Reporting Council, said this was the ""key political decision"" of the reform package and ministers will consider ""very carefully"" the administrative costs of such rules against their benefits.
""Even if legislation is not passed in this area, it will be relatively easy to raise the bar further with revisions to the corporate governance code, or for us to include reporting on internal controls in minimum standards or audit committees,"" Thompson told an event held by the ICAEW, an accounting industry body.
Audit is dominated by KPMG, EY, Deloitte and PwC or the Big Four, and the UK government has proposed requiring these firms to share an audit with a smaller rival like BDO, but many companies are opposed and prefer a cap on market share.
Thompson said there is no single solution and the FRC has told the government it wants powers to impose a market share cap or shared audit on a company-by-company basis.

It was ""highly likely"" there will be an obligation on the regulator to set out a plan on the number of years it would take to change the audit market in a significant way, Thompson said.
The FRC will also publish a 19-point framework in coming weeks that spells out what constitutes high quality audit and practice.

GSK is due to be split in two in the middle of next year in its biggest shake-up in two decades with the consumer healthcare arm, a joint venture with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) known for brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil painkillers, becoming a separately listed company. 
Headquarters for the new business, including research facilities, will be built in Weybridge, southwest of London, to house 1,400 staff from the end of 2024. 
However, staff will first relocate from GSK's current corporate headquarters in Brentford, west London, to temporary facilities in Weybridge when the split takes place in mid-2022.
Weybridge is already home to a GSK oral health research and development (R&D) site and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has an operation in the area.. 
The rest of GSK's Brentford staff, working for the pharmaceuticals and vaccines business, will move to an as-yet-undetermined site in the same area at the end of 2023 or later, with the pharma giant saying it would be ""maintaining access to the UK’s world-leading science and innovation hubs"". 
GSK said it planned to provide further updates on that location in mid-2022.
GSK House, as the Brentford headquarters are known, was built about 20 years ago after the merger of SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome in 2000 created GSK. A spokesperson said it was too spacious to house either of the two successor companies.
Relocating can be thorny as evidenced by years of delays in building AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s new corporate centre and large R&D campus in the English university city of Cambridge.

In 2013, when the scheme was first unveiled, costs were put at 330 million pounds and the aim was to inaugurate the centre by 2016 but construction took until 2020 and costs ballooned to about 1 billion pounds.
The listing of the GSK's consumer healthcare business will deliver an 8 billion pound ($11 billion) windfall and other financial benefits to bolster drug development at the pharmaceuticals business.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Corporate business travel 'carbon budgets' loom for airlines,"By Jamie Freed and Rajesh Kumar Singh
SYDNEY/BOSTON (Reuters) -As major companies look at drastic ways to cut carbon emissions from corporate travel, airlines are bracing for a major hit to business-class travel, a key revenue driver, industry executives and experts say.
Several companies, such as HSBC, Zurich Insurance, Bain & Company and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), have already announced plans to quickly cut business travel emissions by as much as 70%. 
Some are considering a ""carbon budget"" as they come under growing pressure from environmental advocates and investors to reduce indirect emissions that contribute to climate change.
Flights account for about 90% of business travel emissions. That makes it the lowest-hanging fruit for companies setting reductions targets. 
The airline industry last week committed to reach ""net zero"" emissions by 2050 https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-accelerate-climate-pledge-industry-talks-2021-10-04 at a meeting in Boston, decades beyond the corporate travel emissions cut targets. ""It's going to be hard on airlines and they're going to need to adapt,"" Kit Brennan, co-founder of London-based Thrust Carbon, which is advising S&P and other clients on setting up carbon budgets. 
""I think what we're going to see, funnily enough, is more of an unbundling of business class where you might get all perks of business class without the seat,"" he said, referring to airport lounges and nicer meals. ""Because ultimately it all comes down to the area on the aircraft and it takes up.""
Flying business class emits about three times as much carbon as economy class because the seats take up more room and more of them are empty, according to a World Bank study. 
CHANGE ALREADY UNDER WAY
Pre-pandemic, about 5% of international passengers globally flew in premium classes, accounting for 30% of international revenue, according to airline group IATA.
The pandemic-related drop in travel and a switch to more virtual meetings have led many companies to save money by resetting travel policies.
Sam Israelit, chief sustainability officer at consulting firm Bain, said his company was evaluating carbon budgets for offices or practice areas to help cut travel emissions per employee by 35% over the next five years.
""I think more broadly, it's something that companies really will need to start to do if they're going to be successful in meeting the aggressive targets that everyone's putting out,"" he said.
Companies and corporate travel agencies are also investing heavily in tools to measure flight emissions based on factors such as the type of plane, the routing and the class of service.
""We're not seeing a lot of companies take a very draconian approach like simply cut travel because that impacts their bottom line,"" said Nora Lovell Marchant, vice president of sustainability at  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel. ""But we are seeing an increased ask for transparency so those travellers can make decisions.""
Global ratings agency S&P, which plans to reduce travel emissions by 25% by 2025, found that 42% of its business class use was for internal meetings, its global corporate travel leader, Ann Dery, said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event last month. 
AIRLINES GOING GREEN
U.S. carrier JetBlue plans for about 30% of its jet fuel for flights in and out of New York to be sustainable within two to three years https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/jetblue-buy-sustainable-jet-fuel-over-1-bln-use-new-york-airports-2021-09-29.

718,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 06:17AM ET</span>","Southwest Slips After Cancelling 1,800 Flights Over Bad Weather, Staffing","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Southwest Airlines stock (NYSE:LUV) fell 2% in Monday’s premarket trading after cancelling 1,800 flights over the weekend that hit the travel plans of thousands of passengers and left even crew members without hotel rooms.
Bad weather, issues related to air traffic control and shortage of staff all combined to make it a bad weekend for the airline and its passengers.
According to the airline, it was adequately staffed to handle the weekend traffic but ATC issues and bad weather conditions across Florida could not be foreseen.
Jacksonville Air Route Traffic Control Center, which controls airspace in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida and North and South Carolina faced weather and staffing issues which made traffic management for airlines even more onerous on Friday.
Southwest said operations would be close to normal by Sunday but that wasn’t to be.
The company rejected suggestions that staff shortages could be due to protests at the airline management's Covid vaccine mandate.
The disruptions hint at the ongoing difficulties of returning the air travel sector to anything like pre-pandemic normality. An immediate rise in travel numbers after the reopening of the economy in the spring quickly ran into renewed problems with high transmission rates for Delta-variant Covid-19. On the plus side, international travel routes have started to open up as authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have eased quarantine restrictions.

China introduced new rules in August limiting the amount of time under-18s can spend on video games to three hours a week, a move it said was necessary to combat gaming addiction, but causing young Chinese gamers to express outrage at the rules.
""On some online trading platforms, there are game account rental and sales businesses, users can bypass the supervision by renting and buying accounts and play online games without restrictions. This means that there are still loopholes for teenagers to enter online gaming, which is worthy of attention,"" a commentary in the Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper said on Monday. 
The commentary also said that some game trading platforms have said that strict measures have been taken to prohibit minors from buying, selling and renting accounts. Gaming enterprises must ""actively fulfill social responsibilities,"" ""be responsible for the healthy growth of the next generation"" and ""promote the healthy development of the industry.""

Families and schools are also urged to create a conducive environment ""for the healthy growth of minors,"" according to the commentary, especially parents, as some minors use their identities to register for a gaming account, making the gaming time limit ineffective.
Authorities in China, the world's largest video games market, have worried for years about addiction to gaming and the internet among young people, setting up clinics which combine therapy and military drills for those with so-called ""gaming disorders.""

Investing.com – Meituan stock (HK:3690) closed 8.4% higher in Hong Kong trading Monday after the $534 million fine the Chinese markets watchdog imposed on the company last week removed an overhang for the stock.
The fine was not as harsh as many expected it would be, in the context of what has become a loud and broad attack by the Communist government on some of the country's most valuable young companies.
China’s State Administration for Market Regulation had accused Meituan of abusing its dominant position in the country’s online food delivery market. The antitrust regulator said Meituan locked merchants into exclusive agreements and punished those who refused.
The body ordered the food delivery giant to take corrective action, while closing the probe.
SAMR’s ruling buoyed other Chinese shares as well, many of which have been under pressure because of heightened regulatory action and oversight as the government pursues a campaign of 'shared prosperity', in an attempt to reduce inequality.

DUBAI (Reuters) -  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) has asked banks to arrange a loan expected to be in the $12 billion-14 billion range that it plans to offer to buyers of its gas pipeline network, sources said, as the oil giant advances plans to raise funds from asset sales.
Aramco could raise at least $17 billion from the sale of a significant minority stake in its gas pipelines, sources have previously told Reuters. The stake would be offered with a loan financing package already in place, worth about 80% of the price.
Banks that financed a $12.4 billion acquisition of the company's oil pipelines earlier this year received a request for proposals from Aramco last week, said three sources familiar with the matter.
That deal, which included all of Aramco's existing and future stabilised crude pipelines, was backed by $10.5 billion financing from a large group of banks including Citi, HSBC and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new financing for gas pipelines. It is working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on the gas pipeline deal, sources have said.
Reuters reported in August that companies that have been in talks for Aramco's gas pipeline assets include Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Brookfield, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, European gas infrastructure owner and operator SNAM, as well as China's Silk Road, Chinese state-backed investment fund CNIC Corp, South Korea's sovereign wealth fund Korean Investment Corp (KIC) and NH Investment & Securities.
Potential buyers are expected to submit bids at the end of October, said one of the sources. 

Earlier this year Aramco, similar to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), used a lease-back agreement to sell a 49% stake of newly formed Aramco Oil Pipelines Co to the buyer and rights to 25 years of tariff payments for oil carried on its pipelines.
It plans to use a similar structure for its gas pipelines.

“Despite near-term uncertainty, we expect the equity market will continue to rally as investors gain confidence that the current pace of inflation is transitory,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by David J. Kostin wrote in a note to clients.
Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) led by Mislav Matejka concurred, writing that stagflation fears will start to fade. 
Jitters over surging prices and concerns that the post-pandemic rebound is now past its peak dragged the S&P 500 Index 5% below its September record last week, after almost a year without a correction of this magnitude. Persistent supply bottlenecks, along with a slowdown in China, have raised doubts about whether stock valuations can be stretched any further. 
A Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) survey of market professionals suggested that the majority of them see at least another 5% pullback in equities by the end of the year. There’s “a fairly strong consensus” that some kind of stagflation is more likely than not, according to the survey results published Monday. 
Goldman and JP Morgan resoundingly disagree. 
“We believe this dip will prove a good buying opportunity, as 5% pullbacks usually have in the past,” Goldman strategists said. “We finally got some weakness after 330 days of no greater than 5%+ pullback, but we don’t expect it to last, and advise to buy into the dip,” JPMorgan strategists wrote.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",China's Harbin lends hand to property firms; Morgan Stanley upgrades sector view,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Harbin has become one of the first cities in China to announce measures to support property developers and their projects, which have been shaken by the deepening debt crisis at property giant China Evergrande Group. 
Developers should get back part of their presale funds held in government escrow accounts as quickly as possible to relieve pressure on their cashflows, the government of Harbin, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang province, said on Sunday in a statement on its website. 
Developers with good credit profiles are encouraged to re-embark on presale activities as soon as they are able to, the statement said. 
China's overall property investment and sales have been declining while growth in new home prices slow. In many inland cities, lacklustre demand has led many developers to hit the pause button on sales or offer discounts. 
Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution, said he expected other cities to follow Harbin in announcing support for the sector, especially ""those under great pressure from high inventories, including some tier-three and four cities in central and western regions.""
In a further positive sign for developers,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) lifted its view on China's real estate industry to ""attractive"" from ""in line"", saying regulators may relax their grip on the sector to help stabilise it and support the economy. 
China's property sector - which accounts for about a quarter of the country's gross domestic product - has been hit by tighter borrowing caps that have hurt cashflow as well as developers' ability to finish construction and raise funds for new projects.
The crisis at Evergrande, which is grappling with some $300 billion in debt and has missed two coupon payments, has only added to those strains as investors fret that other developers are also susceptible to defaults.
Morgan Stanley analysts said, however, that systemic risks have become more manageable as regulators and local governments have the experience and the mechanisms in place to deal with developer defaults.
""Debt restructuring will also be done at the holding company level, while the operating companies or property projects will remain in operation during the restructuring with the support of regulars and local governments,"" they said in a client note on Sunday.
Additional measures from Harbin will include subsidies of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,500) for talented residents with skills and qualifications looking to buy homes for the first time.
""If policymakers were to make statements about assuring property projects completion and supporting restructure, it could alleviate concerns from home buyers and the financial system,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Kenneth Ho, head of Asia Credit Strategy at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), also said he thought China's policymakers would have zero tolerance for systemic risk and policy support would be forthcoming if there was more deterioration in property activity levels.

Chinese real estate and bank subindexes gained more than 2.2% each on Monday compared to a flat broader market.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>",Japanese bonds show rare bout of inflation anxiety,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - A sudden spike in inflation expectations priced into Japanese government bonds shows some investors are changing long-held assumptions about the economy being resistant to any global supply-side shocks.
Growing concerns about global inflation, fuelled by rising commodity prices and a supply crunch worldwide, have prompted investors to buy Japanese inflation-linked bonds, driving the 10-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate higher last week.
While investors appear confident in the Bank of Japan's ability to anchor bond yields, the rare jump in inflation expectations to 2018 levels speaks to how the pandemic is changing perceptions about price pressures in a country beset by decades of deflation.
""I feel there are many investors who are a bit too careless about inflation, thinking that won't happen in Japan even if the rest of the world is in inflation,"" said Tadashi Matsukawa, Japan head of fixed income investments in PineBridge Investments.
Matsukawa thinks consumers no longer view price hikes as unpalatable.
""People haven't gone out for drinking for such a long time. They may be more eager to pay for that now. If you think just because there has been deflation for so long, that will continue forever, you could be in for a nasty surprise."" 
The 10-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate, the gap between inflation-linked bonds and conventional bonds, rose last week to 0.36%, meaning markets expect Japan's inflation over the next 10 years to average that much. 
That compares with an inflation expectation of just 0.07% in mid-July and around 0% at the end of last year.
Since late 2020, the bond markets have also been pricing in inflation levels higher than the actual inflation rate. 
(GRAPHIC: Japan inflation - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkmnmnpq/211008B.png) 
Japan's official consumer price inflation has so far shown little sign of price gains, with the annual core CPI turning flat in August after falling for a year.
Average inflation over the past 10 years, when stripping out the impact of two sales tax hikes, is about 0.1%.
With inflation nowhere near the Bank of Japan's 2% target, investors expect the central bank will stick to massive monetary stimulus for the foreseeable future.
COUNTING ON BOJ 
To be sure, many market players say Japan's BEI rate should be taken with a grain of salt because the inflation-linked bond market is small, with limited players and illiquid trading.
The level of expected inflation is also a fraction of what is baked in elsewhere -- around 2.45% in the United States and 1.60% in Germany.
Yet, there are tentative signs that price pressures are building.
Hourly pay for contract workers rose 3.1% on an annual basis in August, the biggest increase since December 2019, amid signs of a labour shortage, data from staffing firm En Japan showed. 
(GRAPHIC: Japan wage - revised - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkragldpm/211008E.png) 
Government data showed wages rose 0.7% in August, though economists say the data can be misleading because an increase in lower-paid jobs can weigh on overall wage growth. 
Factors that once helped keep a lid on prices have also waned. Chinese labour and prices are not as cheap as they used to be.
Japanese companies have also been more reluctant to relocate production overseas amid supply chain uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S.-China tensions.
Inflation worries helped drive the 10-year JGB yield to a four-month high of 0.085% on Monday, though investors see limited room for a further rise, confident in the BOJ's tight grip and policy intent to keep the yield close to 0%.

The risk is a spike in yields, should investors start to doubt the BOJ's commitment.
""Without the BOJ's policy peg, the 10-year JGB yield could easily rise to 1%,"" said Hiroaki Hayashi, managing director at Fukoku Capital Management.

After weeks of debate about the supposedly transitory nature of higher inflation and its potential monetary policy implications, markets are about to find out how rising input costs impacted companies during the third 2021 quarter. 
As the reporting season kicks off in earnest from this week, commodity price rises, labour shortages and supply bottlenecks will be the main story, taking over from the absolute recovery narrative of the previous two quarters. But with world stocks down as much as 6% from last month's record highs, it's anyone's guess whether the margin squeeze is already priced in.
    Asia started Monday on the upside but European and U.S. equity futures suggest some caution, possibly as oil prices extended their multi-week gains, pushing Brent crude to new three-year highs. 
    Still, investors may be coming to terms with a more moderate economic growth pace. Nineteen S&P 500 firms report earnings this week starting with the big banks; Refinitiv IBES forecasts profit growth at 30% this quarter, down from 96% in the previous three-month period. 
Companies may also find it harder in future to engage in tax arbitrage -- a common practice in particular among tech and pharma firms -- after 136 nations agreed on Friday to implement a 15% minimum tax rate on big firms.
    Meanwhile, hawkish central bank noise continues. Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders told households to get ready for ""significantly earlier"" interest rate rises. He spoke shortly after BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said above-target inflation was concerning and had to be managed.
A Polish rate setter too said last week's surprise rate hike was the beginning of normalising monetary policy.

As cars become 'smarter' with more in-car entertainment, information and autonomous driving functions, automakers and tech companies are gathering more data from vehicles, raising privacy and security concerns.
China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not offer details about how the assessment would be done. According to current rules, auto companies cannot export key vehicle data abroad unless they obtain approval from regulators. 
The ministry said regulators will improve monitoring of vehicle data security and encourage telecommunication companies to invest more in cyber security technologies.

The move comes amid China's push to ensure the security of data as the proliferation of smart cars, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric vehicles, fuels concern about national security, in line with its broader aim to tighten policies around privacy.
Beijing has been increasingly concerned over the mountains of data amassed by private firms and whether such information could be attacked or misused, especially by foreign states. It recently implemented a new data security law and is tightening up oversight in other related areas.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -A tech body backed by the Australian units of Facebook, Google and Twitter said on Monday it has set up a special committee to adjudicate complaints over misinformation, a day after the government threatened tougher laws over false and defamatory online posts.
The issue of damaging social media posts has emerged as a second battlefront between Big Tech and Australia, which last year passed a law to make platforms pay licence fees https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-media-idUSKBN2AO099 for content, sparking a temporary Facebook blackout in February.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week labelled social media ""a coward's palace"" https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-law-chief-wants-defamation-rules-fixed-internet-age-letter-2021-10-07, while the government said on Sunday it was looking at measures to make social media companies more responsible, including forcing legal liability onto the platforms https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-mulls-measures-making-social-media-giants-responsible-defamatory-2021-10-10 for the content published on them.
The Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI), which represents the Australian units of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), said its new misinformation oversight subcommittee showed the industry was willing to self-regulate against damaging posts.
The tech giants had already agreed a code of conduct against misinformation, ""and we wanted to further strengthen it with independent oversight from experts, and public accountability,"" DIGI Managing Director Sunita Bose said in a statement.
A three-person ""independent complaints sub-committee"" would seek to resolve complaints about possible breaches of the code conduct via a public website, DIGI said, but would not take complaints about individual posts.
The industry's code of conduct includes items such as taking action against misinformation affecting public health, which would include the novel coronavirus.
DIGI, which also counts Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and TikTok as signatories, said it could issue a public statement if a company was found to have violated the code of conduct or revoke its signatory status with the group.
Australian communications minister Paul Fletcher, who has been among senior lawmakers promising tougher action against platforms hosting misleading and defamatory content, welcomed the measure, while consumer groups argued it did not go far enough.
""I'm pleased that DIGI is announcing an important development to strengthen the way the code will protect Australians from misinformation and disinformation,"" Fletcher said in a statement.
But Reset Australia, an advocate group focused on the influence of technology on democracy, said the oversight panel was ""laughable"" as it involved no penalties and the code of conduct was optional.
""DIGI's code is not much more than a PR stunt given the negative PR surrounding Facebook in recent weeks,"" said Reset Australia Director of tech policy Dhakshayini Sooriyakumaran in a statement, urging regulation for the industry.

Australian Communications Consumer Action Network CEO Andrew Williams said the move was ""a step in the right direction"" but too limited since only people with Google accounts could lodge complaints on the new website.
""It's important that any information that consumers need to know about the DIGI Complaints Portal is easy to find and accessible for everyone,"" he said.

The issues around unpaid entitlements date back to 2010 and were self-reported by CBA to the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) in early 2019 with remediation almost complete, the bank said in a statement.

The FWO alleges that CBA failed to make sure its employees were not paid less than the overall minimum entitlements required and that the bank did not make top-up payments for any shortfall. 
The FWO is seeking penalties of A$666,000 per serious breach and up to A$66,600 for non-serious breaches in the civil case against the bank. 
CBA and its brokerage arm, CommSec, have since improved their systems and processes, the bank said.

736,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2021 10:21PM ET</span>",Home from home: Mercedes-Benz doubles down on China,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz, the German company founded by the inventors of the motor car, is pouring more resources into its cutting-edge research and design capabilities in China as the centre of gravity of the new auto world shifts eastwards.
In a drive to create a ""home away from home"", Mercedes-Benz is doubling down on bases in Beijing and Shanghai to stay ahead of regulations and consumer trends in a car market that outstrips the United States and Germany combined.
Three years after initially announcing plans to strengthen its research and development (R&D) in the country, the luxury car brand owned by Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) will unveil its new Tech Center China in Beijing this month.
Reuters has spoken to four people close to the tech centre and the brand's Chinese design studio who are familiar with the company's new China strategy. All declined to be named because they are not allowed to speak with the media.
With 1,000 engineers, the new tech centre is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014 and the first outside Germany that can test ""everything"", putting it more ""on par"" technically with the far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said. 
Mercedes-Benz has also invested significantly in upgrading its Chinese design studio and has moved the whole team from Beijing to Shanghai, a megalopolis of about 25 million people known as the car design capital of China.
Mercedes-Benz has good reason to elevate its Chinese operations. 
Its car sales in China jumped 12% last year to a record 774,000 despite the pandemic, streets ahead of its next two markets, Germany on 286,000 and the United States with 275,000.
About 80% of the cars it sold in China were also made there, typically with an array of China-only features and models, and Asia overall accounted for almost half its global sales in 2021. 
China's auto market, the biggest in the world since 2009, is expected to carry on growing steadily, with demand forecast to reach 35 million vehicles by about 2030 versus 25 million now.
'SECOND HOME'
But Mercedes-Benz, like all foreign automakers in China, is under growing pressure from local EV startups such as Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), Li Auto and Nio (NYSE:NIO) and their stylish vehicles with high-tech features tailored to Chinese consumers.
That's why the German carmaker's ""second home"" strategy for China is focused on making its design and technology more agile, to respond quickly to the ever-shifting landscape and to firmly entrench the Mercedes-Benz brand, the four sources said.
""The expectations in China are for the in-car experience to be served by a localised digital services ecosystem, and such solutions must be conceived and built by people that live in China and truly understand the mobile internet,"" Bill Russo, head of consultancy Automobility Ltd in Shanghai, said.
Mercedes-Benz customers in China are 36 years old on average - roughly 20 years younger than in Germany - and are more tech-savvy, but they are also notoriously disloyal, hopping from brand to brand as trends shift.
Mercedes has spent 1.1 billion yuan ($170 million) upgrading the centre, with much of the investment ensuring it can do an array of testing locally - rather send new technologies back to the Sindelfingen headquarters in Germany.
""A key reason for the expansion is to gain the proximity to those customers and their needs,"" the person close to the tech centre said. ""Here, we finally have everything we need to test the car fully,"" said the source.
The centre has modern chassis test benches and others including for noise, vibration and harshness, as well as batteries and e-drive powertrains and it has the flexibility to swap in new ones as technology develops, two sources said.
Mercedes has also added functions deemed important for Chinese customers, such as a team dedicated to intelligent, connected electric vehicle (EV) technology. 
""Tech savvy customers here require that you're very local in terms of intelligence, connectivity and autonomous driving,"" one of the sources said.
THINK ROSE GOLD
All four sources said a sharper focus on the customer in China in recent years is already paying off.
A drive to create China-only colours led to research into the preferences of younger luxury goods buyers. While sensitive to being seen as hip and tech-savvy, there has been a revived interest in styles inspired by China's ancient dynasties.
As part of that research, the studio came up with ""rose gold metallic"", a variation on rose gold tones adjusted for cars first used as an exterior colour for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class L sedan in 2018. New EVs such as the EQA and EQB now come in rose gold, and it's also an interior tone in the EQC.
""Global ideas, inspired by China,"" said one source close to the studio, adding that while Mercedes needs to cater to its China customers first, some China-grown ideas will go global.
Moving the studio to Shanghai was partly driven by the need to significantly speed up the design process by making it more digital, as most virtual model-making vendors are based there.
""Besides, Shanghai is a lot easier a place to recruit design talent,"" said the source close to the studio, which is just north of city's prime waterfront district The Bund.
Designers typically sketch a car on paper or a touch-sensitive computer screen and expert modellers then help sculpt the designs into clay models. Mercedes-Benz plans to more or less do away with those physical models. 
Under the new process, the Shanghai studio will review its designs using virtual tools, except for the occasional quarter-size physical models, according to one of the four sources.
If the studio makes it to the final of internal competitions for car designs, it will send designers and modellers to the main studio in Germany to create life-size models for the last round, the source said. 
RULES OF THE ROAD 
Daimler's drive to strengthen its technology development in China also comes at a time when the cost of failing to be in step with Beijing policymakers has never been higher.
Beijing's sweeping regulatory crackdown in recent months has wiped billions of dollars off the value of some of the country's best-known private firms, and has weighed on the auto sector. 
That's partly because tensions between the United States and China have created a tricky environment for foreign companies to import technology developed elsewhere.
And from battery technology to new kinds of mobility including smart connectivity and autonomous driving, Chinese policies and regulations are shifting and evolving rapidly.
""If you respond to change after policies and regulation kick in, it's too late,"" said one of the contacts close to Daimler.
With that in mind, the tech centre works closely with the brand's external affairs team which keeps its finger on the regulatory pulse - and that has proved key when it comes to so-called vehicle-to-everything, or V2X, technology.
V2X controls communications between a car and ""everything"" outside, from 5G cellular signals to low-earth-orbit satellites to smart traffic lights and cameras on the road.

In China, vehicles will soon have to come with full-fledged V2X capabilities to achieve a top safety ranking under a new version of its vehicle safety evaluation system, or New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), which is expected in 2025.
""We knew this regulation was going to be implemented. We started developing those self-drive technologies including V2X to be in compliance with the new law and did so well before new regulation kicks in,"" one of the tech centre sources said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, even as the latest U.S. jobs report disappointed, the global energy crunch continues and central banks prepare to begin asset tapering.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.55% by 10:07 PM ET (2:07 AM GMT) and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.52%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.55%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.35% and the Shenzhen Component was up 0.26%, with trade and inflation data due later in the week.
South Korean markets were closed for a holiday, and the Bank of Korea will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday.
U.S. shares were on a downward trend after the latest U.S. jobs report disappointed investors. Non-farm payrolls were at 194,000, while the unemployment rate was 4.8%, in September. Despite the figures, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin asset tapering soon and investors will be looking to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic’s speech on Tuesday for clues.
The Fed will also release the minutes from its latest meeting a day later, with the core consumer price index (CPI) due on the same day.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England also reinforced signs that it could hike interest rates soon to curb inflation.
Alongside asset tapering from central banks globally, investors also await upcoming third-quarter company profits and also the next moves in China’s property sector.
“We do have this environment where we have expectations for inflation rising and expectations for growth falling but I don’t think we are going to be in an environment where we see stagflation becoming entrenched,” J.P.Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Kerry Craig told Bloomberg.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) economists cut their forecasts for U.S. growth in both 2021 and 2022, citing a slower-than-expected recovery in consumer spending. However, these cuts were mostly offset by upgrades to projections for the following two years.
Meanwhile, declining China-Taiwan relations are also on investors’ radars. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen on Sunday said the island will defend its sovereignty, while Chinese President Xi Jinping declared just a day earlier that unification will be achieved.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will also hold their annual meetings through Oct. 17."

Newly-launched real estate trust products raised 16.2 billion yuan from investors in September, down 44.8% from the previous month, the newspaper said, citing data from investment advisory Usetrust. That follows a 24% decline in August, and a 25% fall in July. 
Evergrande's financial woes deepened in September, as the developer, wrestling with debts of more than $300 billion, missed payments on wealth management products, commercial bills and dollar bonds.

Chinese developers are already struggling amid government's lending curbs and surging cost of bond issuance. A rapidly shrinking market of property trust products could further squeeze funding channels of a sector suffering from slower home sales. 
In contrast, trust products that channel money into capital markets saw a jump in popularity and fundraising, the Shanghai Securities News said.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group offshore bondholders are concerned that it is close to defaulting on debt payments and want more information and transparency from the cash-strapped property developer, their advisers said.
Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's largest defaults https://www.reuters.com/article/china-evergrande-debt-property-bonds/update-1-building-default-fears-pummel-chinese-property-firms-idUSL8N2R433Z as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and whose troubles have already sent shockwaves across global markets, missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.
With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, offshore investors https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-grappling-with-evergrande-fallout-weigh-risk-wider-pain-2021-09-20 have been left wondering if they will face large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods for last month's coupons. [nL8N2QP1H5]
A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them.
Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis.
""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.
""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he said 
Evergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Neil McDonald, a restructuring partner in the Hong Kong office of Kirkland & Ellis, said the bondholders would like more transparency, and hoped Evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under stock listing rules.
The offshore bondholders are also demanding more information about Evergrande's plan to divest some businesses and how the proceeds would be used, the advisers said, adding that the creditors group they represent was growing.
The two advisers said that, including the parties that have expressed an interest to be part of the group, they represent bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds.
Evergrande said last month it would sell a $1.5-billion stake it owns in Shengjing Bank https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-transfer-15-bln-stake-shengjing-bank-state-firm-2021-09-29 Co Ltd. The bank, one of Evergrande's main lenders, demanded cash from the sale go towards settling the developer's debts with Shengjing.
Trading in Evergrande shares has been halted since Monday pending a major deal announcement. Trading in its Evergrande Property Services Group unit was also halted.
China's state-backed Global Times https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-share-trading-halted-hong-kong-2021-10-04 said Hopson Development was to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing other media reports.
""Whilst we don't want to overstate this, we are obviously at this point in time preparing contingency plans to ensure that there are no dissipation of assets,"" McDonald said.
""And if there is such activity, we will be prepared to take steps to protect the rights and interests of U.S. creditors, and we really hope that that's not necessary,"" he added.
The advisers for offshore Evergrande bondholders had reached the developer on Sept. 16, but had not received any assurance from the developer, demanding more transparency. 
SECTOR SLUMP
In another development, Evergrande dollar-bond trustee Citi has hired law firm Mayer Brown as counsel, a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters earlier on Friday. 
Citi and Mayer Brown declined to comment.
The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.
With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday. 
""The potential lack of transparency and clarity are leaving investors more skittish and it will be very difficult for people to want to refinance any debt coming due in that particular sector,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.
An index tracking China's property sector dropped 1.53%, against a 1.31% blue-chip share rise.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading of two bonds issued by smaller developer Fantasia Group China Co, with one dropping more than 50%, after controlling shareholder Fantasia Holdings Group missed the deadline on a $206 million international market debt payment on Monday.
Fantasia Holding said in a stock exchange filing on Friday that it had appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and Sidley Austin as its advisers to assess its capital structure, evaluate liquidity and explore solutions to ease its current liquidity issue.
Most of Evergrande and Fantasia's bonds have already lost around 80% of their value.

Meanwhile, bonds issued by Greenland Holdings, which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers including in Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, and Kaisa Group both took another beating on Friday. [L8N2R433Z].
""Market participants are questioning if this may be a precursor for voluntary defaults by other developers with healthy short-term liquidity positions, but large unsustainable longer-term debt,"" Chang Wei Liang, Credit & FX Strategist at DBS Bank, said in a note.

Yields on Chinese borrowers’ junk-rated dollar bonds are near 17%, the highest in about a decade, and a number of the notes are trading at levels which suggest substantial risk of nonpayment. The sector is the source of 36% of the record 175 billion yuan ($27.1 billion) in local corporate bond defaults so far this year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. 
Meanwhile, Evergrande has coupon payments on three more dollar notes due Tuesday. The company is one of China’s largest developers and the biggest issuer of high-yield bonds in Asia. 
Here’s a maturity calendar for this month for dollar and yuan notes from developers whose debt offers the weakest year-to-date returns in a Bloomberg index of China high-yield dollar bonds. Excluded are defaulted firms and Evergrande. The information is from data compiled by Bloomberg.
Kirkland & Ellis and Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co. are working on contingency plans with offshore holders of Evergrande’s bonds who fear the struggling property company may sell assets that they’re counting on to back up their claims if the business collapses.
Moelis and Kirkland are advising a group that so far includes six members holding $2.5 billion of Evergrande offshore bonds, a Moelis managing director said on a call with bondholders Friday. 
They’ve been trying to engage with Evergrande and its advisers since Sept. 16, sending letters asking for information about the company’s situation and assurances that management won’t sell offshore assets while a solution is being discussed. So far, there hasn’t been any meaningful response, a Kirkland partner said during the call, which reporters were invited to monitor. 
Key Developments:
Modern Land Seeks to Extend Bond Maturity (8:15 a.m. HK)
Modern Land (China) Co. Ltd., a Beijing-based property developer, is seeking consent to extend the maturity of its 12.85% senior notes due 2021 by three months, according to statement to Hong Kong stock exchange.
The purposes of the consent solicitation are to extend the maturity of the 12.85% senior notes due 2021 and improve its liquidity and cash flow management and to avoid any potential payment default.
Evergrande’s Reach Goes Way Past Just Building Homes (6:06 a.m. HK)
Evergrande is the biggest financial worry in China right now, and it’s fast becoming a problem outside of the nation’s borders. In a nutshell, the giant real-estate developer is $300 billion in debt and is widely expected to default on bond payments. The group owns 1,300 projects in more than 280 cities. But its reach goes way beyond building homes. Its billionaire owner Hui Ka Yan has his fingers in pies from electric vehicles and media production to mineral water and soccer.
Fantasia’s Default May Suggest Potential Issue Regarding Payment (6 a.m. HK)
The default on principal payments by Fantasia in the October bond maturity may indicate a potential issue to pay, given the company’s record of buybacks since May 2021, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence. This goes directly against the Chinese government directive on issuer conduct, risking severe consequences, the report said. 
The act could risk destabilizing the high-yield market further as fundamentals may no longer dictate default risks but may be offset by increasing bond buybacks from more reputable firms. 
Evergrande Managers Return Funds after Early Redemption (Oct. 9, 2:17 a.m. HK)
Six managers from Evergrande who redeemed wealth-management investment products before due dates have returned all funds to designated accounts as of Oct. 8, the company says in a statement.

744,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",Why is Invesco entangled in a legal dispute with Indian TV giant Zee,"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's Zee Entertainment is locked in a legal battle with one of its biggest foreign investors, Invesco, after it called for ouster of the TV network's CEO citing concerns around corporate governance.
Zee has said it has tightened its governance processes. But the dispute comes at a fraught time for one of India's biggest news and entertainment TV groups as it recently started merger talks with the local unit of Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp. 
Here is what the Invesco-Zee dispute is all about:
WHAT ARE INVESCO'S DEMANDS?
Invesco's legal filings reviewed by Reuters - which are not public - show it wants changes at Zee in light of corporate governance and financial irregularities that have plagued the company, and have even been flagged by India's market regulator.
Invesco's Developing Markets Fund and its OFI Global China Fund LLC own a near 18% stake in Zee. They have suggested six new independent board members to be appointed and remove Zee's current CEO, Punit Goenka.
Invesco asked Zee on Sept. 11 to call an ""extraordinary general meeting"" of shareholders to consider its demands.
HOW DOES ZEE VIEW INVESCO'S DEMANDS?
Zee on Oct. 1 rejected Invesco's request to revamp the board, saying that the move had legal infirmities.
Invesco then took the battle to India's companies tribunal, where it is trying to force Zee to call the meeting, saying Zee's behaviour is ""oppressive"". Zee has two weeks to respond, as per a tribunal order on Friday.
The Indian TV giant says that it has implemented corrective plans to address concerns raised by the market regulator and that it follows ""highest standards of governance"". 
It remains unclear which way the shareholders will vote if a meeting is called, but Zee's founder Subhash Chandra, father of CEO Goenka, has accused Invesco of plotting a hostile takeover. 
""They want to take over the company against Indian laws,"" Chandra has said. Invesco hasn't commented on the allegation.
IS THE ZEE-SONY DEAL AT RISK?
While Invesco was pushing for a Zee shareholder meeting, the Indian giant announced its merger talks with Sony. The deal terms say Goenka plans to continue to be the CEO of the merged entity, which will be majority owned by Sony. 
Invesco has in Indian tribunal hearings said it's not against the Zee-Sony plan, but its filing does criticize how the two entered into talks. 
The Sony deal would allow Chandra's family to raise their shareholding to up to 20%, from 4% now, Invesco said, adding that it was ""plainly an attempt to distract the general public"" and stall the convening of a shareholder meet.
ZEE PRIME-TIME APPEAL, BOLLYWOOD SUPPORT
In an unusual public diatribe, Chandra made a prime-time TV appearance on Zee's Hindi news channel this week.
""I urge Invesco to behave like a shareholder not like the owner ... You want a fight, then I will fight back,"" Chandra said, teary-eyed as he spoke about Zee's journey in India. 

Zee, which has for years offered dozens of entertainment channels and shows in many local languages in India, is a household name. It is now finding support from Bollywood.
""Zee which was first Indian channel promoted by Indian nationalist ... (is) now hounded by American and Chinese investors. Pray Zee Entertainment remains in original Indian entrepreneur's passionate hands,"" film producer Boney Kapoor said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

745,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 10, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>",European climate group says EU needs tougher truck CO2 targets,"By Nick Carey
(Reuters) - The European Union needs to dramatically toughen up CO2 targets for truckmakers to spur a shift to zero-emission models as current goals do not provide the incentive to do so, European campaign group Transport and Environment (T&E) said on Monday.
In a study entitled ""Easy Ride: why the EU truck CO2 targets are unfit for the 2020s,"" the climate group found that improvements in aerodynamics and fuel efficiency meant that truckmakers are able to meet the EU's 2025 CO2 targets while only having to make only a few zero-emission long-haul trucks.
The study also found that most truckmakers have already made voluntary commitments for electric vehicle sales that go beyond EU requirements.
""Truckmakers are clearly able to decarbonise quicker,"" T&E's acting freight director Lucien Mathieu said in a statement. ""It's time to make them.""
Under current EU rules, truckmakers have a voluntary target for zero-emission vehicles to make up 2% of sales from 2025 onwards. The EU is expected to revise that target. 
Based on truckmaker's voluntary commitments, T&E estimates zero-emission trucks will make up 7% of sales in 2025 and 43% in 2030. 
T&E said this shows the EU can set a realistic ""but more ambitious"" target that at least 30% of sales should be zero-emission trucks by 2028. 

The study also found that Swedish truckmaker Scania, part of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s commercial vehicle arm Traton SE, is a market leader: with CO2 emissions 5.3% lower below the average for the most common type of long-haul truck thanks largely to aerodynamics. 
 Renault  (PA:RENA) and Iveco, the truck and bus business of Italian-American CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), are both laggards, T&E said, with emissions 2.6% and 2.4% above the average respectively.

Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs, also expressed openness to the idea of letting regulators have access to Facebook algorithms that are used to amplify content. But Clegg said he could not answer the question whether its algorithms amplified the voices of people who had attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 
The algorithms ""should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation so that people can match what our systems say they’re supposed to do from what actually happens,"" Clegg told CNN's ""State of the Union."" 
He spoke days after former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testified on Capitol Hill about how the company entices users to keep scrolling, harming teens' well-being.
""We're going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that the teenager is looking at the same content over and over again and it's content which may not be conducive to their well-being, we will nudge them to look at other content,"" Clegg told CNN.
In addition, ""we're introducing something called, 'take a break,' where we will be prompting teens to just simply just take a break from using Instagram,"" Clegg said.
U.S. senators last week grilled Facebook on its plans to better protect young users on its apps, drawing on leaked internal research that showed the social media giant was aware of how its Instagram app damaged the mental health of youth.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, has argued for more regulation against technology companies like Facebook.
""I'm just tired of hearing 'trust us', and it's time to protect those moms and dads that have been struggling with their kids getting addicted to the platform and been exposed to all kinds of bad stuff,"" Klobuchar told CNN on Sunday after Clegg's interview.

She said the United States needs a new privacy policy so that people can ""opt in"" if they favor allowing their online data to be shared. The United States also should update children's privacy laws and its competition policy, and require tech companies to make their algorithms more transparent, Klobuchar said.

Le Figaro, another French daily, had reported on Saturday that Carrefour decided to end discussions with Auchan after judging a potential deal as too complex.
Like Le Figaro, Les Echos cited a latest proposal by Auchan under which it would have potentially acquired Carrefour for 21.50 euros ($24.90) per share in an offer consisting of about 70% in cash and some 30% in Auchan shares.
Auchan's reported proposal is higher than a 20 euro per share bid for Carrefour made by Alimentation Couche-Tard in January. The Canadian retailer dropped its offer worth about 16 billion euros in the face of opposition from the French government.
Carrefour shares closed at 16.03 euros on Friday.

Auchan declined to comment, while Carrefour could not be immediately reached.

GFG, owned by commodities tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, has been scrambling to refinance its cash-starved web of businesses in steel, aluminium and energy after supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital filed for insolvency in March.
The debt restructuring for its Australia assets will allow GFG to make a ""substantial upfront payment"" to Greensill Bank and Credit Suisse, with the balance paid in instalments until the new maturity date of June 2023, a statement from GFG said.
Zurich-based Credit Suisse had previously disclosed some $2.3 billion worth of loans exposed to financial and litigation uncertainties within Greensill-linked supply chain finance funds, with some $1.2 billion of its assets related to GFG.
Following the cash injection into its UK steel business, Liberty Steel, production will start in October with a plan for output to reach 50,000 tonnes per month as soon as possible, the statement said.
Jeffrey S. Stein, the chief restructuring officer, said in the statement that new lenders in Europe had expressed interest in refinancing GFG's steel assets.

In Europe, GFG said it had launched a legal action against private equity firm AIP, which said it had taken control of GFG's smelter in Dunkirk, Europe's largest primary aluminium producer.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd on Sunday announced two deals to buy solar capacity, as the owner of the world's biggest refining complex seeks to become net carbon zero by 2035 and make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacture.
Through its unit Reliance New Energy Solar Ltd (RNESL), Reliance is buying Norwegian-headquartered solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings for $771 million from China National Bluestar (Group) Co Ltd and an up to 40% stake in India's Sterling and Wilson Solar.
Reliance in June said it would invest $10.1 billion in clean energy over three years https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/reliance-invest-101-bln-new-energy-business-over-3-years-2021-06-24.
Owned by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, the company plans to build solar capacity of at least 100 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, accounting for over a fifth of India's target of installing 450 GW by the end of this decade. 
India relies on coal for more than 70% of its generation and only 4% is produced through solar power.
Ambani said in a statement on Sunday, Reliance was ready to set up ""a global scale integrated photovoltaic giga factory"" with initial annual capacity of 4 GW, eventually rising to 10 GW. 
He said buying REC Solar would help Reliance to expand in Australia, Europe, the United States and also elsewhere in Asia and that it was seeking to make India a hub for the manufacture of the lowest cost, highest efficiency solar panels.
All fossil fuel companies are under pressure from investors and campaigners to reduce emissions to limit global warming and oil majors including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and BP (NYSE:BP) Plc have set goals to become net zero-carbon firms by 2050.

The statements on Sunday said RNESL's 40% stake in Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd will be made through investment, secondary purchase and an open offer. Reliance did not disclose the full value of that deal but has agreed to acquire new share and promoter's stake in Sterling and Wilson at 375 rupees each.

Moreover, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology indicated there could be sector consolidation. Tu Le, the founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights, said that he expects China’s top electric-car makers to benefit from efforts to consolidate the industry “since it’ll eliminate potential competitors and perhaps allow them to acquire a team or technology to enhance their products.”

State-run Coal India Ltd is using its 40 million tonne stocks to replenish utilities, which together have 7.2 million tonnes of inventory, equivalent to four days' requirements, the ministry statement said.

In a separate statement, the power ministry said coal supplies to power utilities on Saturday rose to 1.92 million tonnes, while consumption was 1.87 million tonnes.

It said the level of coal stocks held by power companies will rise as Coal India is ramping up the supplies.

GRUENHEIDE, Germany (Reuters) -The first cars to emerge from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s new Berlin factory should roll off the production line as early as next month, CEO Elon Musk said at the site of the plant on Saturday, but added that volume production would take much longer to achieve.
Musk hopes to get the green light in coming weeks to start production at the site. The latest consultation on public concerns towards the site closes on Oct. 14, after which the Environment Ministry will make a decision.
""Starting production is nice, but volume production is the hard part,"" Musk told a cheering audience at a festival at the plant site, many of whom livestreamed the speech on social media. ""It will take longer to reach volume production than it took to build the factory.""
He said volume production would amount to 5,000 or ""hopefully 10,000"" vehicles per day, and battery cells would be made there in volume by the end of next year.
He also defended the factory against critics of its environmental impact, saying that it used ""relatively little"" water and that battery cell production was ""sustainable"".
Some local residents and environmental groups are unhappy https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-gigafactory-electrifies-california-germany-culture-clash-2021-10-07 with Musk's approach, which they say flies in the face of German business culture.
""I would tell him to stop building electrocars but rather fly to Mars,"" said Manu Hoyer, who led a small protest of locals who oppose the project on environmental grounds, saying it will pollute drinking water.
Brandenburg's economy minister has put the chances of the factory gaining approval to operate at 95%.
Tesla has submitted plans to invest 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in a battery plant with 50 GWh capacity next to the site, outstripping Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s planned 40GWh capacity site in Salzgitter.
Musk said Tesla was worried that recruiting sufficient staff would be an issue, calling for people to apply from ""all over Europe"".
He said he hoped the battery plant would reach volume production by the end of next year.
POPSTAR RECEPTION
The company offered 9,000 tickets to the festival, with residents of Brandenburg state given priority. 
""Look, Mummy! A Tesla,"" shouted an excited 9-year old called Emil, one of many children lined up with parents waiting for a 90-minute site tour.
Fans cheered and laughed when Musk took the stage at sunset, welcoming him like a popstar.
""This day is unique,"" said Tesla fan Fred Schroeder. ""The Tesla factory in Germany will be opened to the public for the first time. That is a very special day.""

Another had driven his Tesla from Milton Keynes in Britain, despite not having a ticket. He said it was worth it just to see the site from the outside.

By Hyunjoo Jin and Subrat Patnaik
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Thursday the electric carmaker plans to move its headquarters from Silicon Valley's Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas, where it is building a massive car and battery manufacturing complex.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) joins Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) in moving U.S. headquarters to Texas from California, which has relatively high taxes and living costs. While Silicon Valley also is a hive of development of new ideas and companies, Texas is known for cheaper labor and less stringent regulation.
""I'm excited to announce that we're moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas,"" Musk told the company's annual meeting, held in the Texas car factory.
""This is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,"" he said, saying it plans to increase output from its main California factory and Nevada factory by 50%.
The Fremont, California factory nonetheless is ""jammed"" and it is tough for people to afford houses in California, he said. 
Billionaire Musk himself moved to the Lone Star State from California in December to focus on the electric-car maker’s new plant in the state and his SpaceX rocket company, which has a launch site in the southern tip of Texas.
Musk had a rocky relationship at times with California, threatening to move Tesla headquarters and future programs to Texas during a row over the closure of Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California due to COVID-19, for instance.
At the meeting he showed off a design of what looked like a cowboy-style belt buckle emblazoned with ""Don't Mess With T"" -- the T in the style of the Tesla logo. The phrase is based on a venerable and popular Texas anti-littering campaign - Don't Mess with Texas.
DIRECTOR TERM CUT 
Despite some criticism from activist shareholders and a proxy advisory service, shareholders followed board guidance on several key proposals, including reelection of Kimball Musk, Elon's brother, and James Murdoch as board directors. 
But they voted in favour of a stockholder proposal to reduce director terms from three years to one year and a proposal regarding additional reporting on diversity and inclusion efforts.
""It's unfortunate that the shareholders did not agree to remove Murdoch and Musk's brother. But I think they know the pressure is on them,"" Stephen Diamond, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, said. 
""They've got a lot more work to do on governance. Just changing the term is just an artifact of a larger governance issue,"" William Klepper, a professor at Columbia Business School, said.
Advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended that Tesla investors not re-elect the two directors because of concerns about excessive compensation packages to non-executive board members. 

Shareholders also voted against a stockholder proposal asking for a study into the impact of Tesla's use of arbitration on workplace harassment and discrimination.
The proposal, opposed by the board, was thrown into the spotlight after a Black former contract worker on Monday won a $137 million jury award against Tesla over workplace racism.

Wall Street's three main indexes were mixed for much of the session before losing ground toward the end. All three indexes posted weekly gains.
Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) tumbled after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) cut its price target on the media company, while  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) fell after Wells Fargo downgraded that cable operator to ""underweight"" from ""overweight"".
Both companies were among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.
Real estate and utilities were the poorest performers among 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, down 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively. 
The S&P 500 energy sector index jumped 3.1%, with oil up more than 4% on the week as a global energy crunch has boosted prices to their highest since 2014. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) rallied more than 2% and were among the companies giving the S&P 500 the greatest lift.
The Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report showed the U.S. economy in September created the fewest jobs in nine months as hiring dropped at schools and some businesses were short of workers. The unemployment rate fell to 4.8% from 5.2% in August and average hourly earnings rose 0.6%, which was more than expected.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Friday asked a U.S. federal judge to put on hold orders that could require it to change some of its App Store practices and said that it is also appealing the ruling in an antitrust case brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, according to court filings.
U.S. district Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in September largely ruled in Apple's favor after a weeks-long trial. But she did require one key concession: Apple starting Dec. 9 could no longer prohibit app developers from including buttons or links in their apps that direct users to means of paying beside Apple's in-app payment system, which charges a commission to developers.
In her full 180-page ruling, Gonzalez Rogers expressed concern that developers were being prevented from communicating with iPhone users about alternative prices. 
Apple said in Friday's filing that complying with the order could cause it and consumers harm. It said it expects to win an appeal challenging the order and that it wants the legal process, which could last about a year, to play out first. 
Epic separately is appealing the judge's finding that Apple has not violated antitrust law through its payment rules. 
""The requested stay will allow Apple to protect consumers and safeguard its platform while the company works through the complex and rapidly evolving legal, technological, economic issues,"" Friday's filing said.
Apple in recent months agreed to loosen other rules about communications between developers and users as part of settlements with developers suing the company and Japan's antitrust regulator. 
The company said it has already begun discussing solutions that both satisfy Gonzalez Rogers' request for consumers to be more informed and its desires to keep them protected from scams and continue collecting commissions. 

Apple is seeking a hearing with Gonzalez Rogers in early November on its stay request. Epic's opening arguments for its appeal are due Dec. 12.
Apple has said it would keep ""Fortnite"" off the App Store until all appeals are exhausted.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc apologized to users for a two hour disruption to its services on Friday and blamed another faulty configuration change for its second global outage this week.
The company confirmed its social media platform, Instagram, Messenger and Workplace were impacted by the latest outage.
""Sincere apologies to anyone who wasn't able to access our products in the last couple of hours,"" the company said. ""We fixed the issue, and everything should be back to normal now.""
During the latest outage, some users were unable to load their Instagram feeds, while others were not able to send messages on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger.
People swiftly took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to share memes and jokes about the second service disruption this week. ""Looks like Facebook went to a 3-day work week. Monday and Friday shutdowns?"" a Twitter user said https://twitter.com/MyNameIsRaph/status/1446564891721076739?s=20.
Instagram thanked users https://twitter.com/InstagramComms/status/1446582114468597761 for their patience and ""for all the memes this week"".
On Monday, the social media giant blamed a ""faulty configuration change"" for a nearly six-hour outage that prevented the company's 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.
The outage on Monday was the largest that web monitoring group Downdetector had ever seen and blocked access to the apps for billions of users, leading to a surge in usage of rival social media and messaging apps.

Moscow officials said Monday's outage showed Russia was right to develop its own social media networks, while EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager highlighted the repercussions of relying on just a few big players, underscoring the need for more rivals.
Both the outages piled pressure on Facebook this week after a former employee turned whistleblower accused the company on Sunday of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.

BEAUMONT, Texas (Reuters) -The labor union representing workers locked out of an  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) refinery on Friday accused the oil company of trying to ""bust our union"" by supporting efforts to officially remove the union with a decertification vote. 
Any vote would be tainted by ""serious unfair labor practices,"" the USW said in a statement that accused Exxon of ""misleading people with confusing statements regarding our union, our negotiations and the company's spiteful lockout.""
A majority of the plant's union members ""are still with us,"" Bryan Gross, a USW international representative, said of a vote's prospects. 
Exxon locked out 650 union workers from its Beaumont, Texas, plant on May 1 after the prior contract expired and there was no vote on the company's proposed offer. The refinery, which makes gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil, has continued to operate using managers and replacement staff. 
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) this week said it had received a petition backed by signatures from at least 30% of workers represented by United Steelworkers union local 13-243, the minimum required to call for a decertification vote to remove the union.
If the Beaumont employees approve a decertification, it would remove the USW as their bargaining agent. NLRB has not determined whether or when a vote to remove the USW will be held, it said in a notice on Friday. 
Exxon has said its contract proposal contains provisions needed to ensure flexibility to compete in low-margin environments. The company stepped up its efforts to win a vote, accusing the union of sowing misinformation and engaging in voter suppression on the decertification effort.

The USW has said the proposal would wipe out important worker seniority protections and, by creating separate contracts for the plant's refinery and lubricant oil plant employees, dilute their negotiating power. 
USW and Exxon negotiators met on Friday, Gross said. ""The company clarified some things,"" he said. ""We gave them a few things to consider.""

(Reuters) - When Wall Street veterans gathered this week for one of their first in-person conferences since the pandemic began, the focus, on emerging issues from ""meme stocks,"" to cryptocurrencies and free trading apps, signaled a new era for the world of finance. 
More than 460 finance executives, regulators and politicians met in Washington, with another 800 tuning in virtually, for the Security Traders Association (STA) annual conference, an event better known for rehashing dry decades-old issues from trading fees and market data to advances in algorithmic trading.
But this year's gathering, which wrapped up on Friday, follows an extraordinary few months in which millions of young retail traders convening in online forums and trading through low-cost mobile apps have frequently piled into ""meme stocks"" - most notably video retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) in January.
The volatility of that episode was a common theme and for many participants the issues struck close to home: speaking in fireside chats and panels, several said their kids had been drawn into the market after retail brokers like  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Fidelity followed Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets' and dropped commissions. 
Robinhood said at the end of last quarter it had 21.3 million active users, with an average age of 31, and that half of those were first-time investors. The company is also trying to recruit new users on college campuses, offering $15 to start investing and the chance to win $20,000 towards tuition.
""I'm thrilled that my kids are even talking about trying to invest and save and look towards the future,"" Republican lawmaker Bill Huizenga, who has five kids, aged 15 to 24.
""I would think we should be encouraging that,"" he added. 
Eric Pollackov, global head of ETF capital markets at Invesco, marveled that his son, a college sophomore, used a mobile app to buy an exchange-traded fund created by his firm that tracks U.S. long-term, investment-grade corporate bonds.
""What I love to watch in this industry ... is the adoption rate by all types of investors,"" he said.
But while many participants cheered the emergence of a young new investing class, others sounded a note of caution. After what happened in the GameStop case, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a consultation on game-like behavioral prompts some brokers use to drive transactions, amid worries young investors are being manipulated into risky trades.
Allison Lee, a Democratic SEC commissioner, said her five children, all in their 20s and 30s, also use trading apps.
Talking to them about market risks tends to ""bore them to death,"" she said, but she wants to ensure brokers give full disclosure around potential conflicts of interest and how they make their revenue, so everyone understands how they work.
Cryptocurrencies are also drawing in young investors, including the children of ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo, known among crypto-evangelists as #CryptoDad for his support of the new industry. 
He recalled how a discussion during a family ski trip with twenty-somethings who had never shown interest in the markets before opened his eyes to ""a true generation gap.""
""They intuitively get digital money, they intuitively get tokenization, and they intuitively get bitcoin and crypto,"" he said.
The head of the SEC has warned of widespread fraud in cryptocurrencies. 

STA head Jim Toes said protections were needed for this new generation of investors, noting that his 23-year-old was also engaging in the market for the first time. 
""It also kind of renews this sense of responsibility that we all have of being guardians of the marketplace,"" he said, ""and making sure we leave something better for the next generation.""

""In the past, escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions has sparked risk off among investors,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. Moreover, the U.S. Senate temporarily raised the $28.4 trillion debt limit to avoid a potential default. This gives the administration a timeframe of eight weeks to address the issue. This, combined with seasonal factors like index rebalancing and portfolio adjustments, are leading to heightened market volatility.
The market volatility is evident from the recovery of the major indexes yesterday, with Dow gaining almost 340 points while S&P 500 rose 0.8%.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",Tesla speeds the EV industry's South by Southwest drive,"By Tina Bellon and Hyunjoo Jin
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) -Tesla Inc's decision to move its headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, California, accelerates the shift of electric vehicle industry jobs to Southern and Western U.S. states that offer lower taxes, lighter regulation and less unionization than the coastal Blue states where most electric vehicles are sold. 
Electric vehicle startups and established automakers have lined up $24 billion in investments in new factories in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky.
CEO Elon Musk's announcement https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-moving-headquarters-austin-texas-says-ceo-musk-2021-10-07 during the No. 1 EV maker's annual meeting on Thursday puts an exclamation point on the shift in the U.S. auto industry's center of gravity - and also highlights the tensions it could create.
The competition among states for electric vehicle jobs is intense, and has a political dimension. Democratic-leaning Blue States such as California are home to many electric vehicle buyers and EV company investors, who have strong views on climate policy. 
Many of the states getting EV jobs are politically conservative Red states, whose Republican governors are both supportive of the fossil fuel industry and eager to welcome electric vehicle manufacturers and their jobs with subsidies and regulatory streamlining.
""The Lone Star State is the land of opportunity and innovation. Welcome,"" Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted on Thursday after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced its move.
Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, now faces the challenge of taking advantage of the Texas business climate without alienating workers recruited from the San Francisco Bay Area's vibrant technology industry. It also has to consider the big base of Tesla vehicle customers in more politically liberal states such as California and New York.
""Tesla does not want to invite criticisms or attacks from public advocacy groups accusing them of looking for a large incentive package or abandoning California at a time when the state is in peril,"" said John Boyd, principal of Boyd Company, a site selection firm. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday praised Musk for having invested in California, including its SpaceX facility, and creating jobs. 
But Newsom said the state also offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax subsidies to Tesla. ""Our regulatory environment helped create a company and grow that company.""
UNIONIZING 
Detroit automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have an analogous problem. Ford said last week it and South Korean battery partner SK Innovation would invest $11 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/ford-motor-electric-idCAKBN2GN299 to develop a sprawling electric vehicle and battery assembly complex in Tennessee larger than the automaker's historic Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan. 
That complex and related new operations in Kentucky could create 11,000 jobs. 
The United Auto Workers union quickly called on Ford to assure those would be union jobs. But in Tennessee and Kentucky, union membership is optional, and workers at other auto manufacturers in those states have so far rejected UAW organizing efforts.
Musk had a public falling-out with California when regulators forced Tesla to suspend production during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. At one point, Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future programs out of the state. 
Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, said he moved to Texas last year, and he has taken to his new home, wearing Western-style bandannas and shirts. California has income tax rates up to 13.3%, while Texas has no tax on personal income. 
California, however, also accounted for about 15% of Tesla's global deliveries in 2020.
On Thursday, Musk said the headquarters move is not a matter of Tesla leaving California entirely, and said production from Tesla's Fremont assembly plant and Reno, Nevada, battery factory will rise by 50%. Employees at Tesla's Palo Alto area offices expect engineers to stay in Silicon Valley, though some finance staffers could move, one source said.
One awkward issue for Texas officials and Tesla to sort out is that Texas law currently forbids Tesla from selling vehicles directly to customers in the state.
Austin is the fastest-growing U.S. metropolitan region, its population growing 30% between 2010 and 2020 to some 2.3 million.
Like other large Texas cities, Austin and its surrounding Travis County, where the Tesla factory is located, are governed by Democrats, setting it apart from the majority of Texas' conservative, less densely populated counties.
The Austin metro area is a technology hub, home to PC maker Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, and operations of large Silicon Valley companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google. Business software maker  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) in December announced it was moving its headquarters to Austin. 
South Korean conglomerate Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) is also close to initializing the construction of a $17 billion semiconductor factory just north of Austin.
Austin's Democratic mayor, Steve Adler, welcomed the decision, saying Tesla will create ""the clean manufacturing, middle-skill jobs Austin needs.""

Known for its quirky culture, Austin is also home to large music festivals such as Austin City Limits and South by Southwest, drawing large crowds each year.
But the drastic growth and the influx of many well-paid Californians has faced resistance by some local residents, with reports of out-of-state buyers purchasing houses for cash at double the asking price, frustrating many Austinites.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Friday disclosed it circulated Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's application seeking approval to launch and operate 147 satellites to provide broadband internet access for a vote.
Boeing first filed with the FCC in 2017 seeking approval to deploy a V-band Constellation using low earth orbit and highly inclined non-geostationary orbit satellites ""to provide high speed broadband communications.""
Boeing sought to operate V-band Constellation ""to provide broadband Internet and communications services to residential consumers, governmental, and professional users across the United States, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands."" 
In 2019, Elon Musk's SpaceX urged the FCC to reject Boeing's plan saying it presented a ""clear danger of harmful interference"" to other systems or ""at a minimum impose appropriate conditions to ensure that Boeing’s operations do not harm those of other"" operators.
Boeing declined to comment on the FCC application circulated for a vote by Acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday. 
In April, the FCC voted to approve a SpaceX plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned as part of its push to offer space-based broadband internet.
SpaceX had asked the FCC for approval to fly 2,824 satellites at a lower orbit as part of the plan to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.
The FCC also said SpaceX agreed to accept that their lower-altitude satellites may encounter interference from satellites deployed under Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kuiper Systems satellite project.
In July, Amazon said it would invest more than $10 billion to build a network of 3,236 low-earth orbit satellites. 

SpaceX, which plans to eventually deploy 12,000 satellites in total, has said previously the Starlink constellation will cost it roughly $10 billion.
While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.

773,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>",Wall St Week Ahead: Energy price spike adds market risk as earnings arrive,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock market investors are gauging whether more volatility is ahead because of surging global energy prices, which could drive up inflation, erode profit margins and pressure consumer spending.
Stocks rebounded this week after Monday's losses left the S&P 500 down 5.2% from its record high hit in September. A truce in the U.S. Congress to avoid a debt default provided some relief, but investors remain worried about inflation, higher U.S. Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve's plan to unwind its easy money policies. 
Energy costs are a major factor for inflation, and will be a key topic as companies report third-quarter results in coming weeks. Oil prices have surged more than 25% since late August, with Brent topping $80 a barrel and hitting three-year highs. Natural gas prices in Europe have rocketed, causing alarm among political leaders.
Oil prices have a ""roughly neutral"" affect on overall corporate earnings, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists, with every 10% increase in Brent prices boosting S&P 500 earnings per share by 0.3%.
Energy shares have soared as crude prices climbed, yet higher prices could weigh on companies ranging from transportation to consumer discretionary firms.
""We are going to find out if this piece of the inflation puzzle is the straw that breaks the camel’s back and actually starts cutting into margins,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""There are incremental costs to everything when energy prices go up."" 
Despite September's pullback, the S&P 500 remains up about 17% so far in 2021. Even as investors swooped in to buy the market's latest dip, some Wall Street strategists are pointing to risks that could come with jumping into equities.
Analysts at Capital Economics said in a note that rising energy prices could put more upward pressure on bond yields. A jump in yields roiled stocks in recent weeks, particularly tech shares.
If oil prices keep rising toward $100 a barrel, that ""could continue to weigh on sentiment,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""If we break that barrier, I think it will influence how people are forecasting economic growth and inflation and interest rates, which has broad implications for sectors and industries and markets,” Arone said. 
As oil gained since late August, the S&P 500 energy sector has increased 25% against a 1% drop for the overall index. Energy was the lone sector to post positive performance in September. 
Oil vs U.S. stock market in 2021 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvweweglvw/Pasted%20image%201633718533077.png 
The energy sector comprises less than 3% of the weight of the S&P 500, however, and rising oil prices can raise fuel and other costs for companies such as transportation firms, while also threatening demand by leading consumers to pay more, such as for gas at the pump.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategists in a note this week outlined a basket of stocks negatively impacted by oil at $100 a barrel, including package delivery company FedEx (NYSE:FDX), discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and auto parts retailer O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) Automotive.
In a note last week, U.S. economists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the 101-cent increase in gas prices from a year earlier would be expected to lead to a reduction in income that can be spent on non-energy items of about $120 billion.
However, the relative amount of consumer spending on gasoline and other energy expenditures has trended lower over the past 40 years, according to data from Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
The percent of personal consumption expenditures devoted to gas and other energy spending has fallen from over 6% in the early 1980s to 2.35% most recently, Janasiewicz said.

And JPMorgan strategists said markets would be able to digest oil at $130 a barrel, as the economy and consumer ""were functioning just fine"" over 2010-15, when oil averaged above $100. 
""We do not believe that the current price of energy will have a significant negative impact on the economy,"" the strategists wrote.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Bayer is evaluating its legal options after Mexican health regulators for the first time rejected a GMO corn permit it was seeking, the German pharmaceutical and crop science giant said in a statement to Reuters on Friday, blasting the decision as ""unscientific.""
Reuters reported earlier in the day that regulator Cofepris rejected the corn permit for future import as the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hardens its opposition to genetically modified crops. 
""We are disappointed with the unscientific reasons that Cofepris used to deny the authorization,"" the statement said, identifying the rejected corn variety as using its proprietary HT3 x SmartStax Pro technology.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stressed that the permit denial does not affect its current business, noting that last year the company stopped work on its HT3 hybrid corn varieties due to regulatory delays in the European Union in favor of a new HT4 line which the company expects to launch later this decade.
Bayer nonetheless criticized what it described as continuous regulatory delays with Cofepris as well as the possibility of additional permit denials that could have a ""devastating impact"" on Mexican supply chains.
The company said genetically modified crops including corn have undergone more safety tests than ""any other crop in the history of agriculture"" and have been judged safe for humans, animals and the environment.
The Cofepris press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Lopez Obrador issued a controversial decree at the end of last year that outlined a three-year plan to ban the weed killer glyphosate and GMO corn for human consumption.
Industry associations have sharply criticized the plan and have sought unsuccessfully to persuade judges to strike it down, arguing that it risks a trade dispute with the United States. If the ban is interpreted to include animal feed or other industrial uses, they say it will ultimately hit consumers with higher food prices.

The planned prohibition, however, is popular with environmentalists and health-food advocates who argue that spraying glyphosate on the GMO crops designed to tolerate them is indeed harmful.
Glyphosate was pioneered by the Roundup brand of weed killers from agrochemical company  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which was bought by Bayer as part of a $63 billion acquisition in 2018.

However, energy moving higher means more inflation is likely, while the jobs report indicates the economy may be slowing.It’s been a rough year thus far for the precious metals sector, and while gold (GLD) has only given up one-third of last year’s gains, down 7% vs. a 24% gain in 2020, the miners have been slaughtered, to say the least.

MILAN (Reuters) - Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) on Friday endorsed a request by its top shareholder Leonardo Del Vecchio to ditch a rule reserving up to three board seats to managers of the Italian merchant bank.
Welcoming the decision ""with deep satisfaction,"" Del Vecchio in turn withdrew a second proposal to amend the company's bylaws, which had been criticised by Mediobanca's board.
Mediobanca also complained that Del Vecchio had failed to discuss with the company proposals he wanted to put to a shareholder vote at the Oct. 28 general meeting, disregarding what is considered standard practice for listed companies.
Del Vecchio last month proposed modifying Mediobanca's governance rules to make the board more diverse and independent from management, in his first formal move to promote changes at the group since becoming its single largest investor.
The 86-year-old founder of spectacles giant Luxottica bought 19% of Mediobanca after gaining clearance from European regulators on the condition that he would not interfere with the running of the bank.
Del Vecchio in the past has been critical of the strategy of Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel, although he has praised Nagel's latest business plan.
The two are also embroiled in a governance tussle at Generali (MI:GASI), Italy's biggest insurer, in which both Del Vecchio and Mediobanca are investors.
Mediobanca said that while the company had benefited from having top managers among its directors, this was a statutory requirement it had been planning to axe next year in light of discussions with institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms.
Mediobanca was critical of Del Vecchio's second proposal, which it said risked penalising institutional investors that own half of Mediobanca. 
Del Vecchio's holding company, Delfin, said late on Friday it would withdraw the proposal to avoid confusing investors, given that Mediobanca's board had decided to present an alternative proposal if the one by Del Vecchio was rejected.
At present, a majority of Mediobanca's directors come from the list that gets the most votes from shareholders, with two seats reserved for the second most-voted list. 
Del Vecchio had proposed increasing to three or four the number of seats reserved for the minority lists, which would each appoint a director based on the number of votes, provided they cross a 5% threshold.
Under the alternative proposal by Mediobanca's board, a fifth of directors would come from minority lists, with at least one seat reserved for representatives of institutional investors. The 5% threshold would be lowered to 2%.

""Delfin has finally been able to set in motion a process to improve Mediobanca's governance ... to increase management's accountability,"" Delfin said.
""In light of this fundamental result, while Delfin believes its proposal is preferable ... it is in the interest of the bank and its shareholders ... that only the board's proposal get put to shareholders.""

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global equity markets wavered on Friday on a weak U.S. labor market report, and Treasury yields rose as investors still expect the Federal Reserve to begin tapering its massive bond purchases as early as next month. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed above 1.6% for the first time since June, the dollar eased and stocks on Wall Street slid as technology and other high-growth shares sold off while energy and financials gained.
The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in nine months in September amid a drop in hiring at schools and worker shortages. Some attributed that at least partly to jobs lost after vaccine requirements were imposed to combat the surge of the Delta variant.
The unemployment rate dropped to an 18-month low of 4.8%. 
""The headline weakness hides an otherwise much stronger job market than we're currently seeing,"" said Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services Inc in Troy, Michigan. ""It's related to mandates for vaccinations for the people who may have lost their jobs because of that.""
MSCI's all-country world index slid 0.05%, but rose 0.7% for the week.
In Europe the broad STOXX Europe 600 index closed down 0.28% stocks yet marked its best week in two months as fears of soaring inflation were tempered.
Gains in oil and bank stocks in Europe were outweighed by a 1.4% decline in tech stocks as rising bond yields dimmed the high-growth sector's appeal, a story seen on Wall Street too. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03%, the S&P 500 slid 0.19% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.51%, pulled lower after  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) cut its price target on Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which tumbled 4.7%.
All three indexes gained for the week.
The September jobs report was the last one before Fed policymakers meet Nov. 2-3, when the market expects tapering to begin or a timeline to be announced.
The Fed has made it clear that it does not need a blockbuster jobs report to taper in November, said Kathy Lien, a managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. 
""While you're seeing a little bit of a pullback in the dollar, I think the Fed remains on track,"" she said.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.076% to 94.105.
The euro was up 0.19% at $1.1572, while the Japanese yen traded up 0.56% at $112.2200. 
The sideways market is due to an information vacuum before the third-quarter earnings season starts next week, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC.
""The last few weeks there's some uncertainty with Delta, so the market is really looking forward to estimates,"" Hayes said.
Global stock indexes turned positive for the week after Thursday's rally despite widespread selling initially as soaring energy prices and the prospect of sooner-than-expected interest rate hikes to combat inflation rattled investors.

The U.S. Senate's approval of legislation to raise the federal government's debt limit and avoid a historic default buoyed risk sentiment, though it only put off a decision on a longer-term remedy until early December.
In Asia, the main share benchmark was supported by advances in Chinese blue chips, which rose 1.31% as trading resumed after the week-long National Day holiday. Sentiment improved from a private-sector survey that showed China's services sector returned to growth in September.
Chinese shares have been battered the past three months by regulatory clamp-downs, turmoil in the property sector related to China Evergrande's vast debt, and recent power shortages. But some investors are starting to see a buying opportunity. 
Oil prices rose, gaining more than 4% on the week, as a global energy crunch lifted prices to their highest since 2014 as big global power users struggle to meet demand.

Brent crude rose 0.54% to settle at $82.39 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 1.34% at $79.35 a barrel.
U.S. gold futures settled down 0.1% at $1,757.40 an ounce.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",Former UBI top executives acquitted in governance trial,"MILAN (Reuters) -An Italian court on Friday acquitted the former top executives of UBI Banca in a trial over alleged governance irregularities at the regional bank, which is now part of the Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) group.
Former UBI CEO Victor Massiah and Intesa Sanpaolo's Honorary Chairman Giovanni Bazoli were both acquitted together with another 27 people on trial due to accusations they obstructed regulators, two attorneys who were in the room told Reuters.
""I deeply appreciate the professional qualities and independence shown by the Bergamo court,"" Bazoli said in a statement. ""It's not acceptable though that ... people's lives were scarred by this judicial trouble for seven years.""
At a hearing in May, prosecutors had sought a five-year prison sentence for Massiah, while requesting six years and eight months in jail for Bazoli.
Only one former UBI executive was convicted. The public judgment was read in a courtroom in the northern city of Bergamo.
Intesa Sanpaolo, which last year took over UBI to become Italy's largest bank, was also acquitted. Under Italian law, companies are liable for crimes committed by their employees.

Prosecutors had alleged two groups of investors tied by shareholder agreements had unduly influenced the outcome of the 2013 general meeting by improperly collecting proxy votes.
The defendants and UBI itself have always rejected the accusations and said they had acted correctly.

Those figures are up from the 399,552,444 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Thursday out of 482,326,275 doses delivered. 
The agency said 216,573,911 people had received at least one dose, while 186,917,921 people were fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Friday. 

The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine.
Roughly 7.3 million people received a booster dose of either  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna's vaccine since Aug. 13, when the U.S. authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended the week higher despite closing lower on Friday as investors digested data showing the economy created fewer jobs than expected last month.
For the day, the S&P 500 fell 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03%, or 8 points, the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.51%.
The U.S. economy created 194,000 jobs in September, well short of forecasts for 500,000, and below the upwardly revised 155,000 jobs for August.
“The market will look back on this report as just a blip,"" Eric Green, Chief Investment Officer of Equity at Penn Capital told Investing.com in an interview Friday. ""There is a lot of noise in September that makes that report less reliable than normal [...] I'm sure we're going to see revisions."" 
A deeper look into the monthly jobs report, meanwhile, showed enough bright spots including higher wages and lower unemployment that should pave the way for the Federal Reserve to start tapering its bond purchases next month.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.8% from 5.9%, compared with the forecast for a decline to 5.1%.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.6% last month, compared to August's 0.4% increase, as firms increased wages to attract new workers amid dearth of labor supply.
“I think we're still there,” Green said, referring to the Fed’s plan to taper bond purchases. “These numbers were not bad enough for the Fed to change course.”
U.S. Treasury yields climbed following the report, with the 10-year Treasury yield scaling 1.6%, as investors look ahead to the Fed’s path to tightened monetary policy.
Tech struggled to find its footing against rising yields and inflation, both of which sour the outlook on sectors like growth with longer duration cash flows that become less attractive.
Cyclicals stocks, which move in tandem with the economy, fared better as energy and financial pushed higher.
Energy was up more than 2% as oil prices topped $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014 as concerns about tight supply persist despite recent efforts by the U.S. and Russia to quell fears of an energy crunch.
Hess (NYSE:HES), APA (NASDAQ:APA), and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) jumped more than 5%.
Rising bank stocks, meanwhile, underpinned financials as investors look to the start of the quarterly earnings season for the return of loan growth at a time when Treasury yields continue to advance.
Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) were among the biggest gainers in the sector.
Higher interest rates boost the return on interest that banks earn from their loan products.
Wall Street is set to end the week in positive following a wild few days of trading as investors fretted over the prospect of the U.S. default on its debt.
While the volatility is expected to continue into next week, the market is nearing a strong period for risk assets.
“There tends to be volatility the first couple weeks of October, then things start to calm down,” Green said. “The better performing sectors will be the more risky sectors, which in today's market are the cyclicals stocks that have done well in the last year but have massively underperformed over the last six years.”"

Castillo, a member of a Marxist-Leninist party, swept into office last summer on promises to increase mining industry taxes. He has also hinted at nationalizing Peru's natural gas sector, a key mining industry supplier.
Adkerson said he and Castillo held a ""listening session"" as part of last month's United Nations General Assembly. While the two did not discuss specific policies, Adkerson said he advised Castillo to fight corruption and also craft a tax regime that allows mining companies to remain in the country. 
""We're very concerned about the political situation that's emerged in Peru. What we are doing is to see if we can find a way to work forward cooperatively,"" Adkerson told an FT mining conference. ""I was encouraged by this initial conversation."" 
Separately, Adkerson said Freeport would pause investment decisions in Chile while that country debates raising copper royalty rates.
Adkerson also said Chinese copper demand remains strong despite recent debt concerns. ""I still have a lot of confidence in China's macroeconomic situation for the long term,"" he said.
In the United States, one of Freeport's major growth regions, Adkerson said he does not expect President Joe Biden's administration to prioritize mine development over environmental and social concerns.

Some in the mining industry have encouraged Biden to approve more mines, regardless of community objections, but Reuters reported earlier this year that Biden will rely on ally countries for EV metal supplies. 
""You're not going to have a (U.S.) government that steps in and puts a priority for metals above these other objectives. It's all got to be worked out together,"" Adkerson said.

The securities regulator is probing the firm's trading activity, including whether it concealed the size of its bets on public companies, according to the report.
Authorities are also scrutinizing whether Archegos bought multiple stakes in the same companies across several banks to avoid triggering public disclosure rules, the report added.
Archegos could not be immediately reached for comment. A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.
The collapse of the investment firm in March triggered losses of more than $10 billion at some global banks, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG,  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) being the hardest hit. 
The Archegos meltdown led to calls for more stringent regulation of family offices, which are investment funds set up by wealthy families. In May, SEC Chair Gary Gensler told Congress the commission is considering new trading rules to address problems highlighted by the Archegos blowup.

The San Francisco-based company did not share terms for the offering, but two sources close to the matter said in May it could seek a valuation of up to $5 billion. 
The IPO follows a flurry of financial technology companies that have listed their shares in New York this year, such as buy-now-pay-later firm Affirm Holdings Inc, online brokerage  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc.
NerdWallet confidentially submitted https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-personal-finance-startup-nerdwallet-files-us-ipo-sources-2021-05-14 paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the IPO in May, Reuters had reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The company was founded in 2009 by former hedge fund executive Tim Chen and Jake Gibson, a former trader at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) It provides financial guidance to users on credit cards, loans, mortgages and other financial products.
Chen was inspired to start NerdWallet after he failed to find a suitable answer on the internet to his sister's question about which credit card was the most suitable for an expatriate living in Australia, the filing showed. 
In the six months ended June 30, the company reached 21 million unique users per month and generated $181.6 million in revenue compared with $137.3 million a year earlier, according to the filing.
In 2020, NerdWallet entered the international market with the acquisition of UK-based online financial guidance provider Know Your Money. It also bought New York City-based Fundera, a marketplace for small businesses looking for loans, the same year. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and KeyBanc Capital Markets are among the underwriters for NerdWallet's offering. The company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""NRDS"".

Given the uncertain market conditions, we believe the recent price dips in dividend aristocrats Walgreens Boots (WBA), West Pharmaceutical (WST), and W.W. Grainger (GWW) offer solid entry opportunities.After a rocky start to October, the major benchmark indices finished Thursday with a three-session winning streak, triggered by optimism surrounding Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s recent announcement that lawmakers have reached a deal to increase the debt ceiling in the near term to avoid a government default. However, given the uncertainties surrounding the infrastructure bill, potential monetary policy changes, and supply chain constraints, October is expected to be a volatile month.
Since dividend-paying stocks can reduce overall portfolio risk by securing a steady income stream, especially when markets are volatile, they can be ideal bets now. Investors’ confidence in dividend aristocrats is evident from the First Trust S&P International Dividend Aristocrats ETF’s (FID) 22.8% return over the past year.
So, fundamentally sound dividend aristocrats Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. (NYSE:WST), and W.W. Grainger, Inc.

Like many other drug prospects to treat this debilitating disease, gantenerumab is designed to neutralise beta-amyloid plaques seen as a driver behind brain cell death.
The Swiss pharmaceutical giant said the U.S. breakthrough designation was based on data showing that gantenerumab had significantly reduced brain amyloid plaque in ongoing trials.
Levi Garraway, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Roche, said the designation ""reinforces our confidence in gantenerumab, which would be the first subcutaneous medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease with the potential for at-home administration.""
Analysts had said there could be an expedited filing for U.S. regulatory approval of gantenerumab, which could be a blockbuster if shown to work.

Pursuit of an Alzheimer's remedy, which would inevitably reap drugmakers billions of dollars, has been marked by more than 100 failures, although researchers still hope to tame a condition that affects nearly 6 million Americans, more than 40 million people worldwide, and which is growing more prevalent.
Roche will complete a Phase III trial of the medicine in the second half of next year. In July, Chief Executive Severin Schwan said it was urgent to find a way to treat this unmet medical need and bring treatment to patients as soon as possible.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended a volatile session lower on Friday as investors digested data showing slowing jobs growth in the United States, but they still marked their best week in two months as fears of soaring inflation were tempered. 
A U.S. Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 jobs last month, compared with an expectation of 500,000. Although the headline number was a huge miss, analysts said excluding the seasonally adjusted factors, the number was not too disappointing.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index, which had fallen as much as 0.5%, only briefly reversed the earlier losses after the data.
""Payrolls data came in weaker than expected, but the overall trend of an improving labor market remains intact,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. 
While strong numbers could cement the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve's withdrawal of its support for the economy, many analysts expect that even a second straight weak employment report may not be enough to hold back the central bank from announcing a slowdown of its bond purchases later this year.
""It doesn't look like today's figure comes anywhere close to the kind of scary figure that might provoke (the Fed) into swerving course at the last minute,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trader IG.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group offshore bondholders are concerned that it is close to defaulting on debt payments and want more information and transparency from the cash-strapped property developer, their advisers said.
Evergrande, which could trigger one of China's largest defaults https://www.reuters.com/article/china-evergrande-debt-property-bonds/update-1-building-default-fears-pummel-chinese-property-firms-idUSL8N2R433Z as it wrestles with debts of more than $300 billion and whose troubles have already sent shockwaves across global markets, missed payments on dollar bonds, worth a combined $131 million, that were due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.
With Evergrande staying silent on dollar debt payments and prioritising onshore creditors, offshore investors https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-grappling-with-evergrande-fallout-weigh-risk-wider-pain-2021-09-20 have been left wondering if they will face large losses at the end of 30-day grace periods for last month's coupons. [nL8N2QP1H5]
A group of bondholders have enlisted investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co and law firm Kirkland & Ellis to advise them.
Offshore bondholders want to engage ""constructively"" with the company, but are concerned about lack of information from what was once China's top-selling property developer, said Bert Grisel, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Moelis.
""We all feel that an imminent default on the offshore bonds is or will occur in a short period of time,"" Grisel said on a call with bondholders on Friday.
""Unfortunately, so far, we have had a couple of calls with the advisers,"" but there had not been any ""meaningful dialogue with the company or provision of information"", he said 
Evergrande, which faces nearly $150 million in offshore payment obligations next week, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Neil McDonald, a restructuring partner in the Hong Kong office of Kirkland & Ellis, said the bondholders would like more transparency, and hoped Evergrande would meet disclosure obligations under stock listing rules.
The offshore bondholders are also demanding more information about Evergrande's plan to divest some businesses and how the proceeds would be used, the advisers said, adding that the creditors group they represent was growing.
The two advisers said that, including the parties that have expressed an interest to be part of the group, they represent bondholders who currently hold $5 billion worth of Evergrande nominal offshore bonds.
Evergrande said last month it would sell a $1.5-billion stake it owns in Shengjing Bank https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-transfer-15-bln-stake-shengjing-bank-state-firm-2021-09-29 Co Ltd. The bank, one of Evergrande's main lenders, demanded cash from the sale go towards settling the developer's debts with Shengjing.
Trading in Evergrande shares has been halted since Monday pending a major deal announcement. Trading in its Evergrande Property Services Group unit was also halted.
China's state-backed Global Times https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrande-share-trading-halted-hong-kong-2021-10-04 said Hopson Development was to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing other media reports.
""Whilst we don't want to overstate this, we are obviously at this point in time preparing contingency plans to ensure that there are no dissipation of assets,"" McDonald said.
""And if there is such activity, we will be prepared to take steps to protect the rights and interests of U.S. creditors, and we really hope that that's not necessary,"" he added.
The advisers for offshore Evergrande bondholders had reached the developer on Sept. 16, but had not received any assurance from the developer, demanding more transparency. 
SECTOR SLUMP
In another development, Evergrande dollar-bond trustee Citi has hired law firm Mayer Brown as counsel, a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters earlier on Friday. 
Citi and Mayer Brown declined to comment.
The possible collapse of one of China's biggest borrowers has triggered worries about contagion risks in the world's second-largest economy, with other debt-laden property firms hit by rating downgrades on looming defaults.
With few clues as to how local regulators propose to contain the contagion from Evergrande, the price of bonds and shares in Chinese property developers slumped again on Friday. 
""The potential lack of transparency and clarity are leaving investors more skittish and it will be very difficult for people to want to refinance any debt coming due in that particular sector,"" said Cliff Corso, chief investment officer of Advisors Asset Management.
An index tracking China's property sector dropped 1.53%, against a 1.31% blue-chip share rise.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading of two bonds issued by smaller developer Fantasia Group China Co, with one dropping more than 50%, after controlling shareholder Fantasia Holdings Group missed the deadline on a $206 million international market debt payment on Monday.
Fantasia Holding said in a stock exchange filing on Friday that it had appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) and Sidley Austin as its advisers to assess its capital structure, evaluate liquidity and explore solutions to ease its current liquidity issue.
Most of Evergrande and Fantasia's bonds have already lost around 80% of their value.

Meanwhile, bonds issued by Greenland Holdings, which has built some of the world's tallest residential towers including in Sydney, London, New York and Los Angeles, and Kaisa Group both took another beating on Friday. [L8N2R433Z].
""Market participants are questioning if this may be a precursor for voluntary defaults by other developers with healthy short-term liquidity positions, but large unsustainable longer-term debt,"" Chang Wei Liang, Credit & FX Strategist at DBS Bank, said in a note.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 11:57AM ET</span>",Analysis-Europe's record IPO year has a sting in its tail,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Oliver Hirt
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's record year for initial public offerings (IPOs) is threatening to come to a juddering halt as inflation fears and concerns over a property crisis in China have soured investors' appetite for new stock listings.
Deal cancellations and postponements have started to hit the screens with France's Icade Sante and Switzerland's Chronext pulling deals in the past week.
Czech company Eurowag pushed through a reduced-size London IPO on Friday, but the trucking services group's stock fell 10% from its 150 pence offer price.
Many companies that listed earlier in the year are trading below their IPO price, with the FTSE Renaissance IPO Index for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region down 9.19% so far this year.
""Fear of inflation and rising interest rates, as well as uncertainty around China, have made many investors more cautious,"" said Christoph Lang, head of core equities in Europe for J. Safra Sarasin. ""The Goldilocks environment we had for the last twelve months is over.""
The United States has also been hit by the shift in investors' mood, with Peleton rival iFIT dropping its IPO plans, while shares in fitness centre operator Life Time's opened 8% below their offer price on its debut.,
This contrasts with the first nine months of 2021, when listings surged to their the highest level since the dotcom bubble of 2000, based on Refinitiv data, even if the pace slowed in the third quarter.
The IPO market closely reflects investors' appetite for risk and they tend to become more reluctant to commit large chunks of cash to a single company if the broader economic environment is showing signs of strain.
Uncertainty over the fate of heavily indebted Chinese property company Evergrande and rising bond yields on the back of strong inflation numbers have hit stock markets globally. The MSCI's World Index is down over 4% over the past month.
""We've had something of a buyers' strike, which is not a phrase I've had to use for a while,"" said one senior banker who manages IPOs in Europe, preferring to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to speak about his clients.
""The market has turned quite viciously and investors are reluctant to put money to work in IPOs unless they are a complete slam dunk.""
He said that apart from the deal cancellations, a number of IPOs that were being prepared behind the scenes are being postponed.
A few high-profile IPOs are still heading for market, led by Volvo Cars in Sweden, a company that is hoping to tap into the huge appetite for electric vehicle makers and deliver what would be the biggest stock market listing in Europe in 2021.
Bankers also said the Nordic market feels slightly insulated from the travails elsewhere.
Swedish spam blocking app Truecaller completed an IPO that valued it at SEK 19.43 billion ($2.21 billion) and traded up from its list price on Friday.
Norwegian robotics company Autostore is planning an Oslo listing this month that could value it at up to NOK 103.4 billion ($12.04 billion).
Others braving the market turbulence include French cloud computing company OVHCloud, which is due to price its IPO next week, and Russian software group Softline, which is planning a London IPO in the coming weeks.

The company said it shipped over 45 million SARS tests in the September quarter, up 135%. Covid-19 revenue is expected to be approximately $406 million, compared to $375.7 million for the third quarter of 2020.
Demand for its rapid diagnostic tests during the pandemic is likely to have driven its third-quarter revenue well past estimates, according to a note by the company.
Releasing its preliminary numbers for the third quarter, Quidel said total revenue will be $507.5 million at midpoint, an increase of around 6.5% from July to September 2020’s $476.1 million.
President and CEO Douglas Bryant said as the Delta-variant spread, demand came in from both professional and retail channels.
A 12-month contract worth an expected $284 million for supply of up to 51.2 million QuickVue at-home over-the-counter rapid antigen tests from the federal government came the company’s way at the end of the quarter. The size of the government order has not yet been confirmed, Bryant said in a note.
He said the company is also on-track to reach the target run-rate capacity of approximately 70 million rapid antigen tests per month by the end of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Friday urged the Federal Trade Commision to ensure technology companies like Facebook (O:FB), Alphabet's YouTube (O:GOOGL) and TikTok comply with policy changes aimed protecting young people online. 
The letter from Senator Ed Markey and Representatives Kathy Castor and Lori Trahan cited recent commitments by the companies amid growing concern by lawmakers about young people online. The FTC, said the letter seen by Reuters, has an ""obligation to ensure that powerful technology platforms comply with their public statements and policies on children’s and teen’s privacy.""
The FTC and Facebook declined to comment. TikTok and YouTube did not immediately comment.
Facebook came under harsh criticism from senators this week at a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing that heard testimony from former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, who said she believes ""Facebook's products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.""
The lawmakers cited young people's increasing online use - saying it was now on average almost five hours each day. ""We therefore encourage you to use every tool at your disposal to vigilantly scrutinize companies’ data practices and ensure that they abide by their public commitments,"" they wrote.
Some changes have been prompted by a new UK law that took effect last month called the Age Appropriate Design Code. The lawmakers noted photo-sharing app Instagram publicly announced it is ""defaulting young people into private accounts, making it harder for potentially suspicious accounts to find young people.""
Last month, Instagram said it was pausing plans to develop a new app it is creating for kids.

The subcommittee chaired by Senator Richard Blumenthal is planning another hearing for as early as the week of Oct. 18 that is expected to include other major tech companies like TikTok, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and YouTube.
A committee spokesman said the hearing had not been finalized but the panel has secured commitments from several social media companies to appear in the coming weeks.

But instead of relying on traditional valuation measures, investors should consider stocks trading well below their upside potential such as  MKS Instruments , Inc. (NASDAQ:MKSI), Medifast Inc. (NYSE:MED), and  Amarin  Corp. PLC ADR (NASDAQ:AMRN).While many investors focus on value measurements, such as price-to-earnings or price-to-sales, to find underpriced stocks, an even better method is to look at their upside potential based on analyst price targets. Wall Street analysts are responsible for coverage on a select group of stocks based on industry and market size.
These analysts meet with management and other stakeholders to determine a company's current and future value based on its financials and growth potential. They use this information to generate earnings estimates and target prices that help them form their overall ratings. So, a price target is what analysts think the stock is worth per share.
If you take the average of analyst price targets, you can estimate what price a stock could reach. So, if a stock is trading below its average target price, there is a solid chance it will increase its price. But If a stock is trading more than 50% below its average price target, the company has a very high upside, which is why I recommend investors check out stocks such as MKS Instruments, Inc.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) by asking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product gives it greater clout, in a sign that they could open an investigation.
In a questionnaire sent to rivals and seen by Reuters, the European Commission is focusing on the period 2016 to 2021. Microsoft introduced Teams in early 2017 to compete with Slack and others in the fast-growing workplace collaboration market.
Slack, bought by business software maker Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in July, took its grievance over Microsoft's Teams software to the Commission last year.
Microsoft, which has been handed 2.2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in EU fines for cases involving so-called tying and other practices in previous decade, declined to comment.
Slack alleged that tying or bundling Teams with Office was illegal and urged the EU competition agency to separate the two. 
It said Microsoft pre-installs the workplace chat, it was difficult to un-install and that the U.S. company refused to provide information which would allow rival products to work with Teams and Office.
This has prompted the Commission to ask if bundled products give companies access to data that may increase their market power in both markets and at the same time make it harder for rivals, in particular those with only product, to compete.
It has also asked about barriers to entry or expansion in the workplace apps market, switching costs for customers and the importance of user data protection.
Rivals were asked for a list of customers who have switched to Microsoft Teams or its bundled Office, the percentage of revenue they had lost as a result, as well as the impact of the integrated products on their investments in innovation and the quality and price of their products.
The questionnaire asked if the COVID-19 had boosted demand for workplace apps and how this will evolve post-pandemic.

Other companies which provide workplace apps include  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Tata Sons will resume control of Air India after bidding $2.4 billion, including equity and debt, the government said on Friday, marking the end of years of struggle to privatise the financially troubled airline.
A successful sale of the loss-making national flag carrier will be a major victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it had cost tax payers an average of nearly $3 million a day for the past decade. It would also bode well for planned stake sales in a slew of state-run firms to bolster government coffers and make India a fully market-driven economy.
Talace Pvt Ltd, a unit of Tata Sons - the holding company for the autos-to-steel Tata conglomerate which owns luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover - will acquire 100% of Air India, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, said.
The deal, which is expected to be finalised by the end of the year, puts Air India back in the hands of the group which founded it as Tata Airlines in 1932 before it was nationalised in 1953.
The bid amount includes Tata taking on $2 billion of Air India's $8.2 billion total debt, resulting in an equity value for the government of only about $400 million.
Tata currently operates two airlines - Vistara, India's only other full-service carrier, in a venture with Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) as well as budget airline AirAsia India, a venture with Malaysia's AirAsia Group.
Adding Air India will give Tata a combined share of about 27% of the country's domestic aviation market, second only to IndiGo.
Family scion and emeritus chairman of Tata Sons, Ratan Tata said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that while it will take ""considerable effort"" to rebuild Air India's reputation, it would provide Tata with a strong opportunity in the aviation industry.
""Welcome back, Air India!,"" he said in a tweet.
The acquisition will give Tata an additional 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international slots at Indian airports annually, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas, the most lucrative of which are at London's Heathrow.
""Air India provides a unique and attractive international footprint,"" Tata Sons said in a statement, adding that more than two-thirds of its revenue comes from international markets like North America, Europe and the Middle East.
Tata will gain 8,000 full-time employees, which it must retain for at least one year under the terms of the deal, and some 120 planes, mostly older narrowbody Airbus aircraft but also some newer widebody Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes.
It will also become the sole owner of Air India's low-cost arm, Air India Express, likely giving the group a competitive advantage, said Suman Chowdhury, chief analytical officer at Mumbai-based Acuité Ratings & Research.
""However, the ability to optimise costs, and streamline operations will be a formidable challenge and the key to profitability,"" he said.

It has taken the Modi administration more than four years to find a buyer for Air India. The latest push began in January 2020, just weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic brought the global airline industry to its knees.
Over the past decade, the government has spent about $15 billion of taxpayer money on Air India, famous for its Maharaja mascot, Pandey said, adding that the deal will plug the outflow of bailout funds.

Investing.com – Oshkosh stock (NYSE:OSK) fell 1.6% in Friday’s trading as the company said its revenue in the fourth quarter ended September 30 is likely to be around $2.05 billion as per preliminary estimates, lower than the forecast of $2.10 billion it had handed out in July.
The company blamed rising raw material and freight costs for its revised guidance and said they continue to be challenging and would likely carry over into 2022.
Adjusted profit per share is likely to be 90 cents to 95 cents. The company will reveal the final numbers on October 28.
The company had reported $1.78 billion in consolidated sales in the fourth quarter of the last financial year. In July this year, it said its fourth-quarter sales would grow by 18%. This would have translated into sales of $2.10 billion for the fourth quarter.
It said the significant supply chain and logistics disruptions were more than what it anticipated, and the unavailability of parts has hampered its ability to produce and ship units, contributing to labor inefficiencies.
President and Chief Executive Officer John C. Pfeifer said the company had taken price increases in its non-defense segments over the past six to nine months to absorb higher raw material and freight costs.
“However, due to our backlogs, we do not believe this price catch-up will occur until the end of the second quarter of calendar 2022. If cost escalation persists, we will take additional pricing actions,” he said in a note.
Cost pressures on one side, Pfeifer said the company expects robust customer demand to continue for its access equipment, fire and emergency and commercial segments.
Oshkosh is now moving to a January to December financial year to “better align the timing of its business planning and reporting activities with those of its customers.”

DAKAR (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo should renegotiate its $6 billion infrastructure-for-minerals deal with Chinese investors, according to the draft of a report commissioned by a global anti-corruption body of governments, companies and activists.
The draft, seen by Reuters, describes the deal that was first signed in 2008 as ""unconscionable"" and urges Congo's government to cancel an amendment signed secretly in 2017 that sped up payments to Chinese mining investors and slowed reimbursements of investment in infrastructure.
The final report is expected to be released this month by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which tracks revenue flows in the oil and mining sectors and counts more than 50 countries, including Congo, as members.
The report has no legal force but, if the draft's main conclusions remain, it could bolster Congo's push to secure more favourable terms from mining contracts with Chinese investors.
President Felix Tshisekedi's government is reviewing the 2008 contract and the reserve levels at China Molybdenum's Tenke Fungurume mine after saying Congo was not getting a fair deal.
Prime Minister Sama Lukonde Kyenge told a mining conference on Thursday: ""There has to be some adjustment.""
The moves represent rare pushback by Congo, the world's leading producer of the battery metal cobalt and Africa's top copper miner, against the Chinese investors who control most of its mining industry.
Under the 2008 deal struck with the government of former President Joseph Kabila, Chinese state-owned firms Sinohydro Corp and China Railway Group Limited agreed to build roads and hospitals financed by profits from Congo's Sicomines cobalt and copper joint venture. 
Critics say few of those projects have been realised.
Congo's government spokesman said he had not read the draft and could not comment. EITI's office in Congo referred Reuters to the terms of reference of the mission and declined to comment further. A Sicomines representative did not respond to requests for comment. 
China Railway had no immediate comment. Sinohydro did not respond to a request for comment.
Fred Zhang, a senior Sicomines official, defended the deal in comments to Reuters last week, saying it had driven development for Congo's people and Sicomines would disburse more funds as production rose.
'DENUNCIATION'
The draft, written by two Congolese consultants, recommends ""the denunciation by the Congolese state of the unconscionable character of the joint-venture convention of April 22, 2008 and the return to the negotiations table by Sicomines shareholders"". 
It says the Chinese companies' 68% stake in Sicomines is too high since the Congolese contributed all the mining assets and 32% of the initial capital.
It condemns the previously undisclosed 2017 amendment. 
Under the 2008 contract, all of Sicomines' profits would initially go to reimbursing investments in Congo's most urgent infrastructure projects. It was on that basis that parliament agreed to exempt Sicomines from all taxes, the draft says. 
Under the 2017 amendment, seen by Reuters, only 65% of Sicomines' profits must initially go toward reimbursing the investments while 35% goes to shareholders.
The change could further slow the pace of the infrastructure projects, the draft says. To date, less than $1 billion of the expected $3 billion has been invested, about $1 billion less than projected at this stage, it says.

""This amendment constitutes a violation of the security of the interests of the Republic,"" the draft says.
The draft report calls for re-evaluating Sicomines' reserves, saying a 2010 feasibility study 2010 was flawed, and cancelling another contract with the same Chinese investors to build a hydroelectric dam.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened slightly higher on Friday after an employment report that - while weak - wasn't weak enough to alter expectations that the Federal Reserve will start to tighten monetary policy next month.
The U.S. added only 194,000 jobs in the month through mid-September, the Labor Department said, well short of expectations of 500,000. However, the disappointment was softened a touch by an upward revision of over 130,000 to August's payrolls gain. Government employment was a drag on the overall number, falling 123,000, while leisure and hospitality jobs rose only 74,000, far less than indicated by ADP's private-hiring survey earlier in the week. Gains were broadly distributed across the whole of the private sector, however, with manufacturing employment rising by over 20,000.
Average hourly earnings also continued to rise at a smart clip of 4.6% on the year, while the monthly gain of 0.6% was above expectations for a 0.4% increase. That doesn't suggest any near-term weakening of inflationary pressures. Even so, the U.S. labor market is struggling to put the pandemic behind it: Labor force participation among those of prime working age fell by the most in over a year, with female participation dropping particularly sharply.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively flat at 34,750 points, just 5 points below Thursday's close. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.2%.
Stocks remained under pressure from rising long-term interest rates, which hit valuations through the discount rate that is plugged into analysts' valuation models. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury bond returned to its three-month high of 1.60% on the back of the release, while the more interest rate-sensitive two-year note rose to 0.32%, its highest since early 2020. 
Developments in the bond market supported financial stocks, as usual, as higher interest rates promised wider credit spreads in banks' core lending businesses. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 0.6%, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock rose 0.7% and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 1.2%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was a rare underperformer, dipping 1.3% after CEO Elon Musk said the company has decided to move its headquarters to Texas from California. 
Oil and gas stocks also gained broadly as U.S. crude oil prices hit their highest in seven years, while surging liquefied natural gas prices continued to support domestic gas prices at the Henry Hub. While futures were flat in early trading on Friday, they are on course for an eighth straight weekly gain, and have risen nearly 50% in that time.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.3% while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 1.7% and Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 3.9%."

A global microchip shortage is pushing automakers to slow down production, with Stellantis halting operations at several facilities across Europe and the United States. The carmaker forecast it would make 1.4 million fewer vehicles this year.
""The semiconductor hurricane is causing production stoppages that are weighing more than the lockdown in 2020,"" FIM-CISL head Ferdinando Uliano said. ""The forecasts are that such situation will carry on for the whole first half of 2022"".
FIM-CISL said Stellantis had produced 319,000 cars in Italy in the first nine month of this year, 11% more than in the same period of 2020, when operations where frozen for several weeks following the COVID-19 outbreak. 
But Uliano said 2021 full year production would hardly match the 461,000 units produced last year.
""It's practically impossible, the chip situation is getting more serious and we'll have further heavy closures,"" he said, adding a similar situation was expected with van production at the Sevel plant in central Italy.
Stellantis, formed earlier this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, will operate the Melfi plant, its largest Italian facility, for an equivalent of only six days in October.
On the other hand, Turin's Mirafiori, where the electric 500 small car is produced, is among the few plants which have not suffered major stoppages.
""Production of the BEV 500 must go on to meet targets on carbon emission reduction,"" Uliano said.
The world's fourth largest carmaker has also decided to close one German plant until the end of the year.
""The main risk is that Stellantis decides to delay planned investments and new model launches, as the chip crisis pushes sales down,"" Uliano said.

The carmaker will present Maserati's Grecale SUV next month, followed by Alfa Romeo Tonale SUV, with sale due from June 2022.
Italian unions will meet Stellantis on Monday at Italy's Industry Ministry to discuss production and jobs in the country.

Investing.com – Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) stock (KS:005930) closed 0.1% lower in Seoul Friday even as the consumer electronics giant said its third-quarter operating profit will rise 28% and sales 9% year-on-year.
The South Korean company expects third-quarter consolidated operating profit to be approximately 15.8 trillion Korean won (around $13.2 billion) and consolidated sales to be around 73 trillion Korean won.
Samsung is the world’s largest maker of DRAM and NAND chips and counts Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) among its clients.
NAND memory chips serve the data storage market and are used in digital cameras, USB flash drives and smartphones while DRAM chips are temporary storage devices used in smartphones, laptops, servers and other computing devices.
Chipmakers world over have had a historic run last one as people and corporates reacted to the pandemic and first moved to a mostly work-from-home and then to a blended work-from-office and work-from-home habit. This boosted the demand for gadgets like mobiles, laptops and printers like never before. That demand is still robust as most of the devices are now a ‘must-have,' particularly devices like printers and scanners.  
Chipmakers have announced billions of dollars in investment for production, and there are now fears that in a few quarters from now, there may be a glut of chips in the market.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks must show from 2025 how their trading operations could be shut down in a crisis without spreading contagion across markets, the Bank of England proposed on Friday.
Since the global financial crisis in 2008-09, banks must have plans vetted by regulators showing how collapsing operations could be shut down or transferred without destabilising markets or the need for taxpayer bail-outs.
The proposals set out on Friday go further with more granular demands regarding trading books loaded with stocks, bonds and derivatives worth billions of pounds.
Following a public consultation, the BoE will publish final policy changes in the first half of 2022 which banks will have to implement by January 2025.
The BoE said its Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority carried out exercises between 2014 and 2021 which demonstrated that firms lack the full capabilities required to carry out an orderly wind-down of their trading activities.
""The PRA considers this lack of capabilities to be a market failure, posing risks to the PRA’s safety and soundness objective, and has therefore decided to clarify its expectations in this area,"" the BoE said.
""For the largest firms, the destruction of trading book asset value in a disorderly wind-down risks impacting UK financial stability, due to the scale and interconnectivity of their trading activities.""
Applying the proposed new rules would mean a one-off cost of 12 million pounds ($16.35 million) as banks may have to restructure operations to make the plans workable. Annual maintenance costs would be 2.5 million pounds, the BoE said.
Regulators are under pressure from industry and some lawmakers to ease rules on banks to maintain the City of London as a global financial centre after being cut off from the European Union by Brexit.
The BoE said its proposals were in line with a requirement to have regard to competitiveness as they reinforce market resilience.

""This would help to ensure that the UK remains an attractive domicile for internationally active financial institutions, and that London retains its position as a leading international financial centre,"" the BoE said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Aena kicked off the bidding on Friday for a 28-hectare plot near Madrid-Barajas where the airport operator plans to build a mega-hub for air and ground freight to capitalise on a boom in logistics.
The move is the first step in a plan announced earlier this year to build the hub, called Airport City, near Aena's largest airport which it also hopes will become an international flight hub connecting Asia to Europe and Latin America.
Potential investors face a qualifying phase in which they must commit to providing 125% or more of the initial capital expenditure, which Aena estimated at 107 million euros ($124 million), in exchange for a majority stake in a joint venture.
Bidders have until Nov. 7 to present their documentation, with the plot of land known as Area 1 expected to be auctioned in the first quarter of 2022, and state-owned Aena set to retain a minority stake in the newly-formed company.
Aena said in a statement it will lease Area 1, which will combine 153,000 square metres of developed area and 4 hectares of land reserved for green spaces, to its majority partner for a period of 75 years.
Airport City will offer investors 2.1 million square metres of buildable space overall, dedicated to cross-docking, storage and logistics warehouses and providers of associated aviation services, as well as offices, hotels and parks.
The company on Thursday also signed a 30-year lease with Worldwide Flight Services (WFS) to use two logistics plots in Madrid-Barajas airport's Air Cargo Poligon - an area separate to the yet-to-be-built Airport City.

WFS will pay 2 million euros per year to use around 12,200 square metres for air-freight activities including merchandise storage and handling, Aena said in a statement, some 360% above the expected value.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Consumer goods companies walk a tightrope as inflation surges,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Big global brands Pepsi and Levi Strauss told investors this week they offset inflation with price increases, but rising costs of everything from aluminum to cotton signal tighter times ahead for consumer goods companies.
Freight costs and raw material prices have surged this year across industries due to global supply chain disruptions, squeezing profit margins at companies looking to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
To cushion the blow, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI), among the first batch of consumer product companies to report quarterly earnings, have raised prices for jeans, snacks and sodas, helping results exceed expectations.
While those companies were able to pass along costs to consumers, higher prices will be a headwind until at least the end of the year with some industries likely facing pressure until the middle of 2022, analysts have said.
With government data showing inflation has started to dent consumer spending, companies must also balance the need to protect their margins with the risk that boosting prices will hit demand for their products.
Analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) characterized the breadth of inflation PepsiCo faced as ""stunning"".
""We expect margin pressure to be the predominant theme through the rest of this earnings season,"" they said. J.P.Morgan's Andrea Teixeira said PepsiCo ""is feeling and will continue to feel the impact of inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges.""
But Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's chief executive officer, is confident even as the company faces higher packaging material costs and truck driver wages.
""Across the world, consumer seems to be looking at pricing a little bit differently than before,"" Laguarta said in an analyst call, highlighting the strength of the company's brands and innovations.
That sentiment was echoed by Slim Jims maker Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc. Levi's said previous price increases, which helped boost the jeans maker's gross margins, would allow it to offset expected higher cotton prices next year.
However, some companies are feeling the pinch more than others.
Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) said on Wednesday the benefits from price increases and a cost savings program are expected to be more than offset by higher prices for commodities including aluminum, diesel and wood.

PepsiCo keeping up with demand during the pandemic while also grabbing market share has given the company strong pricing power, where as Constellation, which struggled to keep up supplies has comparatively less capacity to raise prices, said Markus Hansen, Portfolio Manager at Vontobel Quality Growth, which holds stakes in both PepsiCo and Constellation. 
""PepsiCo wasn't shooting down the idea of price increases in the mid single-digit range - 4% or 5%. That's a pretty powerful thing,"" Hansen said, adding that for Constellation he was looking at a low single-digit range.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",Corteva faces slow start as it takes aim at Bayer's Brazil soy reign,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - U.S. pesticide and seed maker  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc will take up to three times longer to break into Brazil's genetically modified soy seed market than it did in the United States, where Corteva's sales grew rapidly in recent years, the company said. 
Corteva is launching new genetically modified (GMO) soy seeds in top soybean grower Brazil, where rival  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) has enjoyed a virtual monopoly since planting of GMOs began in the early 2000s. Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) has a vast network of sales staff and longstanding relationships with farmers, seed developers and manufacturers in Brazil, relationships Corteva is just now establishing.
Brazil's adoption of genetically modified crops helped it become the world's biggest seller of soy used for livestock feed. But weeds and pests have become resistant to the chemicals those crops can withstand. 
So Bayer and Corteva are each striving to convert Brazilian growers to their next-generation GMO seed varieties that can tolerate newer herbicides. At stake are billions of dollars in annual sales of seeds and herbicides to the important Brazilian market.
Moreover, the seeds that Brazil's farmers choose, by playing a role in the size of their harvests, will influence world supply and prices for commodities that many countries rely on to feed their people and livestock. Soybeans are already scarce and prices are at a seven-year high.  
Bayer and Corteva do not produce seeds themselves in Brazil. Rather, local genetic improvement companies tailor new varieties for the local market to address local soil and climate conditions -- a process that can take years. Then, seedmakers mass produce seeds to sell to farmers for planting.
""The adoption of the Enlist system in Brazil will take a little longer than in the United States,"" Corteva said in an e-mail to Reuters, because seed quantity in Brazil is limited. 
The company had ample Enlist E3 seeds, the GMO technology that quickly took off in the United States, available for U.S. farmers in 2019 when Enlist received U.S. regulatory approvals. 
Corteva, spun off in 2019 after a merger of Dow Chemical and Dupont, captured 35% of U.S. soy-planted area with Enlist in three years. 
In Brazil, Corteva estimated it will take five to 10 years to reach that level. 
Corteva is also launching a more expensive soybean seed in Brazil called Conkesta E3, but Enlist is its primary focus in the campaign to win market share from Bayer. 
BAYER EDGE
Bayer's long dominance in Brazil's seed market gives it an edge as it introduces a new product in Brazil at the same time as Enlist and Conkesta are entering the market. Bayer acquired seedmaker  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2016 and inherited Monsanto's seed and chemical empire.
Monsanto launched the Intacta RR2 Pro soybean seed technology in Brazil seven years ago. In the 2020/2021 cycle, 80% of Brazilian soy was grown with Intacta.
This year Bayer is launching its Intacta2 Xtend seed line in Brazil that resists the herbicide dicamba - a chemical Bayer is betting on globally as crops grow resistant to its earlier herbicide glyphosate. 
Bayer said in an e-mail more than 30 seed varieties had been developed using its Intacta2 Xtend technology for the Brazilian market. That gives it an advantage over Corteva's Enlist, which has not yet been adapted to the Brazilian market by local genetic seed companies. 
Even so, at least one factor may work in Corteva's favor. Dicamba is the target of U.S. lawsuits and a U.S. government review because of its tendency to drift away from where it is sprayed and damage crops on neighboring farms.
Bayer agreed to pay up to $400 million to resolve lawsuits by U.S. landowners who said their crops were damaged by neighbors spraying dicamba.

Problems with dicamba encouraged U.S. farmers to turn to Corteva's Enlist products, and Brazilian farmers have followed the U.S. experience with dicamba closely. 
""I will not buy the herbicide (dicamba),"" said Eduardo Godoi, a farmer in Brazil's top soy growing state of Mato Grosso who will try Intacta2 Xtend for the first time.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Friday, with investors displaying caution ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly employment report.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 30 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%.
The major indices closed higher Thursday after the U.S. Senate agreed to raise the debt limit on the federal government by $480 billion until December, thwarting a possible default and the associated financial crisis and likely recession. 
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose over 300 points, or 1%, the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.1%. All three indices are on course to finish the week higher.
The main focus Friday will be the official job report for September, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with investors using the strength of the labor market as a barometer for the state of the economic recovery, and thus a guide on whether the Federal Reserve feels comfortable in starting the tapering of its bond-buying program this year, as expected.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise 500,000 in September, a jump from after the August disappointment of only 235,000 positions, which was the worst total since January. Average hourly earnings are likely to have risen 0.4% month-on-month, compared with the previous month’s 0.6% rise, while the unemployment rate is set to fall to 5.1% from 5.2%.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will be in the spotlight Friday after Elon Musk, the electric vehicle manufacturer’s chief executive, confirmed that it will move its company headquarters to Texas from California.
The third quarter earnings season kicks off in earnest next week,  with some of the world's biggest banks up first.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) posted a combined $33 billion in profits in the second quarter as the economy rebounded, but that momentum likely slowed in the third quarter.
Crude prices rose Friday, heading for a seventh weekly gain, as the U.S. Energy Department said it has no plans currently to release oil from the country’s strategic reserves.
The potential for the U.S. adding supply to the market had been floated Thursday as a method of curbing oil prices. These have climbed to multi-year highs on the back of signs of improved fuel demand as economic activity rebounds, OPEC producers only gradually increasing output as well as fears that a cold winter will further strain gas supplies.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $78.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $82.55. Earlier in the week, WTI touched a near seven-year high while Brent hit a three-year high.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are looking at the upcoming holiday season and the reopening of vital trans-Atlantic route to recover the momentum lost in the last quarter following a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
After a strong summer travel season, air-carriers had to temper their outlook last month for the quarter through September as the fast spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus slowed down new bookings and drove up cancellations.
A month on, dipping COVID-19 cases have raised industry hopes that passengers would be more confident to fly again.
Financial services firm Raymond James conducted an analysis of the Transportation Security Administration's 7-day average passenger screening data, which showed that while the travel demand still lags the peak in late July, it has improved from the lows in mid-September.
""Cancellations have abated, bookings are recovering,"" Chief Executive of  Hawaiian Holdings  (NASDAQ:HA) Inc Peter Ingram told Reuters in an interview. ""As we get to Thanksgiving and Christmas, we've got the opportunity for a strong, solid recovery.""
Bookings have also recovered at Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which expects domestic travel demand to surpass 2019 levels next year.
United Airlines on Thursday said it would fly its biggest domestic schedule since the start of the pandemic, offering more than 3,500 daily domestic flights in December - representing 91% of its domestic capacity compared to 2019.
""There's a lot of pent-up demand,"" said Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an consortium of 290 airlines, expects air-carriers in North America to return to profit next year before their counterparts in other geographies.
BUSINESS TRAVEL
The outlook for the industry's cash cow - business travel - remains uncertain.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, estimates business travel accounted for as much as 50% of airline industry passenger revenues before the pandemic.
Carriers were banking on office reopenings for a revival in business trips this fall. But the Delta variant forced many large employers to push back their office openings into next year.
Airlines say a revival is inevitable. However, there is no consensus on the timeline.
United's Kirby expects business travel to rebound to the pre-pandemic levels in 2023, but JetBlue's Chief Executive Robin Hayes reckons it could take ""a few years."" 
The New York-based budget carrier has reallocated flights from some business markets into leisure markets, Hayes said.
""We continue to believe that...the holiday will be strong,"" Hayes told Reuters in an interview. ""That's certainly what we see in our forward bookings at the moment.""
TRANS-ATLANTIC ROUTE REOPENING
Airlines, meanwhile, are buoyed by the Biden administration's plan to reopen the United States in November to air travelers from Europe. The trans-Atlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the big three carriers.
All the U.S. carriers, which serve the market, has seen a surge in the bookings since the White House made the announcement.
Kirby said United's bookings for trans-Atlantic flights last week were above the same period in 2019. Sales have also jumped up at Delta Air and JetBlue.
The reopening is not just an opportunity, but is also considered a big test for the industry. 

A successful reopening of the world's most important long-haul market is expected to set a trend for other markets to follow. However, a reimposition of the restrictions if COVID-19 cases start rising again could also slow the fragile recovery.
""Restrictions can't start reappearing where they have disappeared,"" said Hayes. ""It acts as a big dampener to demand.""

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 0.7% lower in Friday’s premarket as the market absorbed CEO Elon Musk’s decision to move the company’s headquarters to Texas from California.
The company plans to maintain a significant presence in California and even increase output at its Fremont factory there.
Tesla even held its 2021 annual meeting of stockholders at its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas’s capital, on Thursday. The management advanced two main reasons for the move. One was the limited scope for expansion at the Fremont factory, the other being the high cost of living in California and the long distances that employees were forced to travel. 
The company had numerous run-ins with state regulators last year as it tried to keep the Fremont factory open in defiance of state decrees on social distancing. Musk, who has personally already relocated to Texas, called the state's health orders 'fascist' on an earnings call at the time. 
The electric vehicle maker thus joins a growing a list of companies which have moved out of California. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), HPE and Toyota are among them.  
According to StreetInsider, Wedbush’s Dan Ives believes the move is Tesla's first step towards making Austin its domestic and global hub.
Texas has been a key beneficiary of the move out of California. 
“The Lone Star State is the land of opportunity and innovation,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted, welcoming Musk and his company.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged largely lower Friday in tight trading ranges, with weak German trade data weighing ahead of the release of key U.S. jobs data.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.3% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.2%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 bucked the trend, climbing 0.2%.
The volume of German exports fell in August for the first time in 15 months, dropping by 1.2% compared with the 0.5% increase expected, as Europe's largest economy, and main growth driver, felt the effect of the global supply chain problems. That rounds off a disappointing week of August data from Europe's largest economy, with manufacturing orders and industrial production also recording sharp declines.
The disappointing release overshadowed the positive handover from Asia as Chinese mainland markets reopened from a week-long holiday and the country’s services sector made a return to growth in September, after an August hit by Covid-19 lockdowns.
Wall Street also closed sharply higher Thursday on the back of the U.S. Senate approving legislation to temporarily raise the federal government's debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default.
In corporate news, Stellantis (DE:8TI) stock fell 0.1% after the auto giant announced it is considering spinning off the two biggest plants of its Opel unit, a move seen by unions as a preliminary to their permanent closure. The Eisenach plant has already been shut until the end of the year due to chip shortages.
Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock slumped 13% after the travel group announced plans for a more than 1 billion euros capital raise in order to help pay off more than substantial state-backed loans taken during the pandemic.
However, most attention will be on the release of the monthly official U.S. employment report later Friday, as this is expected to show a rebound in the labor market, allowing the Federal Reserve to slow its massive bond-buying program. 
The economy is expected to have added 500,000 jobs in September, a sharp jump from the 235,000 jobs added in August. 
Crude prices pushed higher once more Friday, heading for a seventh weekly gain, as doubts emerged over whether the U.S. Energy Department was considering releasing oil from the country’s strategic reserves.
The potential for the U.S. adding supply to the market had been floated Thursday as a method of curbing oil prices. These have climbed to multi-year highs on the back of signs of improved fuel demand as economic activity rebounds, OPEC producers only gradually increasing output as well as fears that a cold winter will further strain gas supplies.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $79.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $83.11. Earlier in the week, WTI touched its highest in nearly seven years while Brent Oil Futures hit a three-year high.
Additionally, gold futures edged 0.1% lower to $1,756.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1547.

Asda, which trails market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury's in annual sales, had launched the ""Express Delivery"" service with a four-store trial in June.
Rapid delivery is the latest frontier in the battle for grocery shoppers' cash.
A raft of new firms, including Weezy, Getir, Dija and Gorillas, are offering deliveries within 15 minutes of ordering, prompting traditional supermarket groups to rethink their business models.
Tesco said on Wednesday it had expanded its ""Whoosh"" service to 60 shops.
Asda's service allows customers to order up to 70 grocery products from a range of over 30,000 for delivery within one hour if they live within a three-mile radius of a store.
Delivery slots cost 8.50 pounds ($11.6) with no minimum spend requirement.
""We are rolling out our Express Delivery service to almost 100 stores after a trial showed there was a clear gap in the market for a speedy delivery service offering our full online product range for delivery within one hour,"" said Simon Gregg, Asda’s vice president of online grocery.

Asda, owned by the Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital, also recently extended its rapid delivery partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats to over 300 stores.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open largely unchanged Friday, with investors cautious ahead of the release of key U.S. jobs data which could provide fresh clues into the timing of Federal Reserve tapering.
At 2:15 AM ET (0615 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France fell 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. traded largely unchanged.
The monthly official U.S. employment report is scheduled for release later Friday, and is expected to show a rebound in the labor market, allowing the Federal Reserve to slow its massive bond-buying program. Wednesday’s strong ADP private payrolls release already hinted at robust job gains, although the correlation between the two reports has weakened during the pandemic.
The economy is expected to have added 500,000 jobs in September, a sharp jump from the 235,000 jobs added in August. 
European markets had received a positive handover from Asia after Chinese mainland markets reopened from a week-long holiday and the country’s services sector made a return to growth in September. The Caixin services purchasing managers index came in at 53.4 in September, compared with the previous month’s 46.7.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Rising chip prices fuel Samsung's best quarterly profit in 3 years,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Friday flagged a 28% jump in its third-quarter operating profit to the highest in three years, driven by rising memory chip prices and display sales for new flagship smartphone launches. 
The preliminary result was up 26% from the second quarter, although just below forecasts, while the market reaction was further muted as analysts pencilled in a flat or slightly lower result this quarter on an expected fall in memory chip prices.
The world's largest memory chip and smartphone maker estimated its July-September profit at 15.8 trillion won ($13.3 billion), below a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 16.1 trillion won. It is the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018. 
""The mobile business' operating margin might have been lower than the market expected,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. ""We will have to see marketing costs and what the mix of products Samsung (KS:005930) sold was like.""
Rising memory chip prices and shipments, plus a jump in profitability at Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business, likely raised the chip division's operating profit by about 79% from a year earlier, analysts said. 
Semiconductors accounted for about half of Samsung's operating profit in the first half of the year. 
Samsung shares pared early gains to be up 0.4% in afternoon trade. It is due to announce detailed earnings later this month.
The stock has fallen about 12% so far this year versus a 3% rise in the wider market, hurt by losses in September when U.S. peer Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) said https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-chipmaker-micron-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-estimates-2021-09-28 its memory chip shipments would slip in the near term. 
Analysts said prices for memory chips are expected to tumble this quarter as demand for personal computers drops amid an expected easing in global lockdowns that have helped power sales, while smartphone shipments may also decline. 
A bright spot next year is expected to be Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business, which on Thursday announced plans to start producing cutting-edge, 3-nanometre chip designs in the first half of 2022, as it races against industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd to preempt advanced technology and win clients.
For Samsung's mobile business, estimated sales of 2 million https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-electronics-likely-report-best-quarterly-profit-3-years-2021-10-05 new foldable smartphones within a month showed demand for its foldable handsets captured more of the mass market than last year, analysts said.
However, this was likely offset by marketing costs and higher component costs due to the global chip shortage. 
Samsung's display unit likely saw solid results as key customer Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramped up orders before its late-September launch of the iPhone 13 series, analysts said. 

Overall revenue likely rose about 9% from the same period a year earlier to a record 73 trillion won, Samsung said in a filing.

(Reuters) - Valuations of Asian equities hit a 16-month low at the end of September, as concerns over an economic slowdown in China and growing expectations of monetary policy tightening by major central banks dragged down equity markets. 
The MSCI Asia-Pacific index fell 2.3% last month and its forward 12-month P/E ratio was 14.6 at the end of September, the lowest since May 2020, according to Refinitiv data.

Graphic: Valuation of Asia-Pacific equities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mypmnozelvr/Valuation%20of%20Asia-Pacific%20equities.jpg  
So far this year, the MSCI Asia-Pacific index has lost 3.2%, compared with the MSCI World's 10.3% gain. ""Asian equities have been under acute pressure this year due to growth deceleration in China, regulatory overhang on technology stocks and the credit issue with Evergrande,"" said Suresh Tantia, a senior investment strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). ""On top of this, as growth momentum has been weak, earnings revisions are normalising."" 
Analysts downgraded the forward 12-month P/E ratio for Asian companies by 0.3% last month, the first cut since June 2020, as manufacturing contracted. 
Graphic: MSCI Asia-Pacific index's estimates change - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbkyrdqvq/MSCI%20Asia-Pacific%20index's%20estimates%20change.jpg 
Malaysian and Australian companies saw the biggest earnings downgrade of more than 2.5% each. China saw a 0.3% cut in forward earnings.
With liabilities of $305 billion, China Evergrande Group has sparked concerns that its cash crunch could spread through China's financial system and reverberate globally. China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 49.6 in September versus 50.1 in August. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.
However, Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex Japan equities at Janus Henderson Investors, said Asian equities look relatively attractive compared to developed equities after the third-quarter weakness. 
""Outside of China, we are seeing stronger performance from markets that are late to recover from COVID-19 and it is reasonable to make a case for that to continue in India and parts of South East Asia.""

In a statement issued late on Thursday, Chubb said it will acquire Cigna's A&H (accident and health) and life business in South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia, in addition to Cigna's 51% stake in a joint venture in Turkey.
""The addition of Cigna's business, which is overwhelmingly A&H (accident and health), will rebalance our global portfolio towards this important region,"" Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg said.
Chubb said the acquisition will boost Asia's share of its global portfolio to $7 billion from about $4 billion in net premiums written, representing about 20% of the company's total business, excluding China.
The transaction comes at a time of a shakeup in the insurance sector in key markets.

Cigna said Chubb will acquire Cigna's business in South Korea and continue to operate it under the LINA Korea brand.
Cigna will focus on its global health services portfolio, as well as local market services in the Middle East, Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and its joint ventures in Australia, China and India.

The deal is not subject to a financing condition and Cigna expects to realize about $5.4 billion of net after-tax proceeds.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 11:33PM ET</span>",US electronics firm struck deal to transport and hire Uyghur workers,"(Corrects typo in third from last paragraph)
By Cate Cadell
QINZHOU, China (Reuters) -U.S. remote-control maker Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC) Inc told Reuters it struck a deal with authorities in Xinjiang to transport hundreds of Uyghur workers to its plant in the southern Chinese city of Qinzhou, the first confirmed instance of an American company participating in a transfer program described by some rights groups as forced labor.
The Nasdaq-listed firm, which has sold its equipment and software to  Sony  (NYSE:SONY), Samsung (KS:005930), LG, Microsoft and other tech and broadcast companies, has employed at least 400 Uyghur workers from the far-western region of Xinjiang as part of an ongoing worker-transfer agreement, according to the company and local officials in Qinzhou and Xinjiang, government notices and local state media.
In at least one instance, Xinjiang authorities paid for a charter flight that delivered the Uyghur workers under police escort from Xinjiang's Hotan city - where the workers are from - to the UEI plant, according to officials in Qinzhou and Hotan interviewed by Reuters. The transfer is also described in a notice posted on an official Qinzhou police social media account in February 2020 at the time of the transfer.
Responding to Reuters' questions about the transfer, a UEI spokeswoman said the company currently employs 365 Uyghur workers at the Qinzhou plant. It said it treated them the same as other workers in China and said it did not regard any of its employees as forced labor. 
Sony Group Corp, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, LG Corp and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) each say in social responsibility reports they prohibit the use of forced labor in their supply chains and are taking steps to prevent it. 
Sony declined to comment on specific suppliers. In a statement to Reuters, it said if any supplier is confirmed to have committed a major violation of its code of conduct, which prohibits the use of forced labor, then ""Sony will take appropriate countermeasures including request for implementing corrective actions and termination of business with such supplier.""
A Microsoft spokesperson said the company takes action against any supplier that violates its code of conduct, up to termination of its business relationship, but that UEI was no longer an active supplier. ""We have not used hardware from the supplier since 2016 and have had no association with the factory in question,"" the spokesperson said.
A Samsung spokesman said the company prohibits its suppliers from using all forms of forced labor and requires that all employment be freely chosen. He declined to comment on UEI. 
LG did not reply to requests for comment. 
The UEI spokeswoman said the company covers the cost of the transfer of workers to its Qinzhou plant from a local airport or train station in Guangxi, the region in which Qinzhou is located. She said the company does not know how the workers are trained in Xinjiang or who pays for their transport to Guangxi.
Reuters was unable to interview plant workers and therefore was not able to determine whether they are being compelled to work at UEI. The conditions they face, however, bear hallmarks of standard definitions of forced labor, such as working in isolation, under police guard and with restricted freedom of movement.
UEI's Uyghur workers are under surveillance by police during their transportation and life at the factory, where they eat and sleep in segregated quarters, according to details in Qinzhou government notices and local state media.
Programs like this have transferred thousands of Uyghur laborers to factories in Xinjiang and elsewhere. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, citing leaked Chinese government documents and testimony from detainees who say they were forced into such jobs, say the programs are coercive and part of China's overall plan to control the majority-Uyghur population in the region. 
In response to Reuters' questions, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not address employment at UEI, but denied forced labor exists anywhere in the country.
""This so-called 'forced labor' is a completely fabricated lie,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Xinjiang migrant workers in other parts of China, like all workers, enjoy the right to employment in accordance with the law. The right to sign a labor contract, the right to labor remuneration, the right to rest and vacation, the right to labor safety and health protection, the right to obtain insurance and welfare rights and other legal rights.""
Xinjiang authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Department of State, which has criticized China and several other governments for condoning forced labor, said the United States has found ""credible reports of state-sponsored forced labor practices employed by the (Chinese) government in Xinjiang, as well as situations of forced labor involving members of these groups outside Xinjiang.""
A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on UEI, but said wittingly benefiting from forced labor in the United States was a crime under the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
That law ""criminalizes the act of knowingly benefiting, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture, where the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that the venture engaged in forced labor,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. The law imposes criminal liability on individuals or entities present in the United States, the statement added, even when the forced labor occurs in another country.
The State Department referred Reuters to the Justice Department for further comment on UEI; Justice did not respond.
The import of goods into the United States made wholly or in part by forced labor is also a crime under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930. UEI told Reuters ""a very small quantity"" of products made at its Qinzhou factory are exported to the United States. It did not specify who purchases the goods.
The law is enforced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which can seize imports and start a criminal investigation of the importer. Customs said it does not comment on whether specific entities are under investigation. 
Legal experts told Reuters there have been very few forced labor prosecutions in the United States over abuses overseas, given the difficulty of proving an offense. ""As the law currently stands, there's very little that the U.S. government can do to hold American companies accountable when they build, manage and profit from supply chains that engage in forced labor and other human rights abuses outside the United States,"" said David McKean, deputy director of the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable, a coalition of rights groups. 
Legislation before the U.S. Congress, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, was designed to toughen up restrictions by creating the legal presumption that any products made in Xinjiang are the result of forced labor, putting the burden on importers to prove they are not. The latest version of the legislation was passed by the Senate this year but has yet to pass the House of Representatives.
The UEI spokeswoman told Reuters the company does not conduct independent due diligence on where and how its workers are trained in Xinjiang. She said the arrangement is vetted by a third-party agent working with the Xinjiang government, who brokered the deal. She declined to identify that agent. Reuters could not determine if the agent is independent or works for the Xinjiang government. 
'VOCATIONAL' INTERNMENT CAMPS
China has detained over 1 million Uyghurs in a system of camps since 2017 as part of what it calls an anti-extremism campaign, according to estimates by researchers and United Nations experts. China describes internment camps in the region as vocational education and training centers and denies accusations of rights abuses. 
Organized transfers of Uyghur laborers to other parts of China date back to the early 2000s, according to state media and government notices from the time. The program has expanded since about 2016, Xinjiang officials said in late July, around the time the mass internment program began.
Xinjiang officials told reporters at a Beijing media conference in late July that transfers of workers outside of Xinjiang are common and voluntary. ""There are many labor-intensive industries that fit the skills of people in Xinjiang,"" said Xu Guixiang, a spokesman for the provincial government. ""They go where the market needs them."" 
Suppliers for some U.S. companies have been accused of using forced laborers transported from Xinjiang. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank, last year released a report identifying 83 brands linked to Uyghur labor transfer programs, citing Chinese-language documents, satellite-imagery analysis and media reports. None of the U.S. companies were directly involved in the transfers, however.
Aside from remote-control technology, UEI also makes home security products under the Ecolink brand. It has more than 3,800 employees in 30 countries and a market value of about $670 million. Its headquarters are in Scottsdale, Arizona, but the company has no plants in the United States.
The company's two largest investors are funds run by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Eagle Asset Management, an affiliate of Carillon Tower Advisers.
BlackRock declined to comment. A spokesman for Eagle Asset Management said: ""Since becoming aware of purported labor issues involving one of our investments, we immediately approached the company's senior leadership and they have provided assurances that labor is paid, treated humanely and employed at-will. Should we learn otherwise, we will take appropriate action.""
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Six groups of workers were transported from Xinjiang to the UEI factory between May 2019 and February 2020, according to Qinzhou government notices, confirmed to Reuters by government officials in Xinjiang and Guangxi. 
In early 2020, as the new coronavirus began to spread in China and lockdowns crippled manufacturing, about 1,300 Uyghurs were transported from Xinjiang’s southern Hotan region. They were sent to factories around the country to alleviate labor shortages and help get them running again, according to officials cited by Chinese state media outlet Economic Daily in February 2020. 
The police-escorted charter flights were funded by the Xinjiang government, according to Qinzhou government notices and an official in Hotan who spoke to Reuters in May.
UEI’s Qinzhou factory took more than 100 workers in the February 2020 transfer, according to notices on the Qinzhou government website, state media and Qinzhou officials. That was one of several transfers made under an agreement struck some nine months earlier between UEI and Xinjiang authorities. Reuters could not determine exactly where the workers came from. 
UEI’s operation underscores the role played by agents in supplying companies with Uyghur workers.
The UEI spokeswoman confirmed the company entered into an agreement with Xinjiang authorities in 2019 after being approached by the third-party agent. UEI said the same agent hires and pays the workers and that UEI does not sign individual contracts with the workers. 
The spokeswoman declined to disclose what the Uyghur workers are paid, beyond saying that they receive the same as others at the facility, which is ""higher than Qinzhou local minimum wage.""
The Economic Daily reported that workers sent in UEI's February 2020 transfer are expected to make around 3,000 yuan ($465) a month. That compares with the average manufacturing wage in the province of Guangxi of 3,719 yuan, according to China’s national bureau of statistics.
UEI's Uyghur employees are part of a much bigger system. Two separate labor agents hired by Hotan and Kashgar authorities in Xinjiang told Reuters they had each been set targets of placing as many as 20,000 Uyghurs annually with companies outside the region.
They, and one other agent, showed Reuters copies of three contracts for transfers already completed this year. These included a January contract to transport 1,000 workers to an auto parts factory in Xiaogan, Hubei province, who had to undergo ""political screening"" prior to transfer. 
The three agents told Reuters that separate dormitories, police escorts and payments overseen by third-party agents are routine elements in such transfers.
""Uyghur workers are the most convenient workers for companies,"" one of the agents told Reuters. ""Everything is managed by the government.""
The Uyghurs of UEI are kept under tight watch all along this labor-supply chain.
Photographs published online by the Economic Daily and an official social media account of Qinzhou police, dated Feb. 28, 2020, show the workers lining up before dawn outside the airport in the city of Hotan before taking the flight.
""Get to work quickly and get rich through hard work using both hands,"" one manager employed by Xinjiang authorities told the gathered workers, according to an account published online by the Qinzhou Daily. Accompanying photos show the workers dressed in blue and red uniforms.
More than a dozen uniformed police officers escorted the same workers through the Nanning Wuxu airport and onto buses, according to posts on a social media account of a Qinzhou police unit and a post by the Qinzhou government. The buses were then escorted by police vehicles to the UEI factory in Qinzhou, some 75 miles (120 km) away.
SEPARATE DORMS, POLICE ‘EDUCATION’
The mostly young Uyghur laborers at UEI’s plant sleep in separate dormitories and eat in a segregated canteen under the watch of managers assigned by Xinjiang authorities. Non-Uyghur laborers are not subject to such monitoring. The managers stay with the Uyghur workers throughout their employment, according to state media, local police notices and government officials who spoke to Reuters. 
UEI said the canteens were established to provide local Uyghur food, and says it allows Xinjiang workers to share dormitories ""as they wish.""
The Uyghurs must participate in what are described as ""education activities"" run by Qinzhou police and judicial authorities within the UEI facility, as part of the agreement between the U.S. firm and local authorities, according to notices on the government website of the Qinzhou district where UEI's factory is located.
Reuters could not determine what those activities involve. Beijing has said that legal education is a key aspect of the training programs in Xinjiang's camps. The education activities in UEI’s factory only apply to the Uyghur workers, according to two Qinzhou government notices.
The UEI spokeswoman said UEI is ""not aware of specific legal education activities"" that Uyghurs take part in at its plant. 
'TERRORISTS, XINJIANG PEOPLE AND MENTAL PATIENTS'
Two Reuters journalists visited the Qinzhou factory in April during a local public holiday when the plant was not running. Women in Uyghur ethnic dress were visible inside the compound. 
Half a dozen police arrived, followed by a delegation of officials from the Qinzhou Foreign Affairs Office. The officials confirmed that Uyghur laborers worked in the factory, which is run by UEI's wholly owned China subsidiary Gemstar Technology. The officials said Gemstar had taken the lead in setting up the May 2019 agreement to transfer workers. The officials told Reuters not to take photos of Uyghurs in the factory. 
The district of Qinzhou where UEI is located has surveillance measures targeting Uyghurs that predate the transfers. A June 2018 procurement document seen by Reuters shows police there purchased a 4.3 million yuan ($670,000) system that establishes blacklists of ""high-risk"" people. These include ""terrorists, Xinjiang people and mental patients.""

The document also lists a specific need for ""automatic alarms"" - a computer system that sends alerts via an internal messaging system to police when Uyghurs from Xinjiang are detected in the area.
According to a March 2020 post on the official Qinzhou police website, UEI agreed to provide daily reports on the workers to police.

844,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 11:27PM ET</span>",China Shares Rise on Reopen From Holiday With Consumer Strength,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese shares advanced after mainland markets reopened from a week-long holiday, with consumer staples and tech shares showing resilience in the face of regulatory and economic uncertainty. 
The benchmark CSI 300 Index climbed as much as 1.5%, with top performers including Huadong Medicine Co. and China Fortune Land Development Co. Despite a tumultuous period globally while onshore markets were closed, local traders started Friday on the front foot, taking a cue from a buoyant session overnight in China stocks listed on Wall Street.  
“There’s a risk-on sentiment in the market -- the U.S. rebounded strongly, Hong Kong is back to where it started during Mid-Autumn festival,” Bocom International chief strategist Hao Hong said on Bloomberg TV. “There should be a markup on the technical basis for the mainland market today.”
The CSI’s sub-indexes of consumer staple and discretionary stocks were up 4.1% and 3.2%, respectively. Still, trading volumes on the CSI in the morning were lower than the average over the past 30 days.
How enduring Friday’s gains will be remains uncertain for investors amid problems ranging from an energy shortage to debts of property developers and an ongoing regulatory crackdown on private enterprise. 
The China Evergrande Group debt crisis still casts a shadow over the wider market. A dollar-bond default this week by Fantasia Holdings Group Co. is a reminder of the risks.
The People’s Bank of China also drained the most short-term liquidity from the banking system in a year on a net basis as it reduces liquidity support following the holiday. Government bond futures declined.
On Thursday, PBOC Governor Yi Gang reiterated that authorities would continue taking steps to curb monopolistic behavior among internet platform companies. 
For now, bargain hunters and long-term buyers back chasing China’s tech giants, encouraged by a relative lull in the flow of negative news in the sector. NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. and Ping An Healthcare and Technology Co. were both up more than 5% higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong.
“It’s all about short term stories with knee jerk reactions to every headline,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer at the Global CIO Office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday he had instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard airplanes, many involving the requirement to wear face coverings.
""I've instructed the Justice Department to make sure that we deal with the violence on aircraft,"" Biden said at a speech in Illinois. ""We're going to deal with that.""
To date this year, there have been 4,626 reports of unruly passenger incidents https://www.faa.gov/data_research/passengers_cargo/unruly_passengers/?ipid=post_link_1, including 3,366 that were mask-related. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated enforcement actions in 177 cases, issuing more than $1 million in proposed fines.
The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
Many incidents onboard airplanes have been captured by passengers and posted on social media, drawing significant attention. 
Last month, two senior U.S. Senate Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/DOJ%20Unruly%20Passenger%20Letters%20(Sept.%2020%202021)%20Final%20Signed.pdf to investigate and prosecute unruly air passengers due to the surge in such behavior during the coronavirus pandemic.
In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines such as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, and aviation unions also asked Garland https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-airlines-unions-urge-us-prosecute-egregious-onboard-conduct-2021-06-21 to prosecute the growing number of disruptive and violent air passengers.
The letter from Airlines for America said the ""incidents pose a safety and security threat to our passengers and employees.""
Last month, Delta called on other U.S. airlines to share lists of passengers who have been banned during the COVID-19 pandemic for disruptive behavior to help deter the rising number of incidents. The carrier said during the COVID-19 pandemic it has put more than 1,600 people on its ""no fly"" list.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson imposed in January a zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on flights around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack.
That policy will extend until at least as long as federal mask rules on airplanes are in place, which were extended in August into mid-January 2022.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher on Thursday in a broad-based rally led by Big Tech, as a truce in the debt-ceiling standoff in the U.S. Congress relieved concerns of a possible government debt default this month.
Mega-cap stocks jumped with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) up 0.9% and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) rising 1.2%, the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) both rose more than 1%.
The U.S. Senate took a step toward passing a $480 billion increase in Treasury Department borrowing authority, which would put off another partisan showdown until December.
Uncertainty over the debt-ceiling negotiations was one concern investors cited in September as the S&P 500 logged its biggest monthly percentage drop since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.
""Today's (market) is driven by a slight move in Washington towards rationality about being able to pay their bills, write some checks,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
Meanwhile, data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped last week by the most in three months, suggesting the labor market recovery was regaining momentum as the latest wave of COVID-19 infections began to subside.
The closely watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Friday.
“Today’s numbers reinforce the expectation that employment will take a significant step up in the coming months, and I think that’s positive for the economy,” said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger.
""The market climbed its wall of worry today as fears of a debt-ceiling impasse receded and hopes for an acceleration in employment gains were reinforced.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.98% to end at 34,754.94 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.83% to 4,399.76. 
The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.05% to 14,654.02.
The S&P 500 materials index jumped 1.35% and the consumer discretionary index rallied 1.50%, both leading among 11 sectors.
U.S.-traded Chinese stocks  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) each surged about 8% as concerns around U.S.-Sino trade relations and Evergrande's debt crisis appeared to ease.
Investors will watch third-quarter earnings reports that start to arrive in earnest next week. Analysts on average estimate S&P 500 companies' earnings per share rose 29% in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv.
 Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI) shares jumped 8.5% after the jeans maker beat third-quarter revenue and profit estimates.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.1 billion shares, compared with the 11 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 80 new lows.

South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.83%.
Investors kept an eye on Chinese markets, which re-opened after a holiday as the focus shifted back to the country’s embattled property sector. People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said that regulators will continue to curb monopolistic behavior among internet platforms, as well as strengthen consumer and data protection.

The latest U.S. job report, including non-farm payrolls, will be released later in the day and could firm expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon begin asset tapering.
Global shares are set to wrap up the week with its best week since early September as the Senate’s decision averts an immediate U.S. default, but the debate about the debt ceiling is not over yet. Inflation, fueled by rising commodity prices, the Fed’s imminent asset tapering, and the Chinese property sector slowdown remain as risks for the economic recovery from COVID-19.
“As soon as you start thinking about asset tapering it’s really hard to not then think about what that means for the Fed funds rate and when that might start to increase,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist and international economist Kim Mundy told Bloomberg.
“We do see scope that markets can start to price in a more aggressive Fed funds rate hike cycle.”
In other central bank news, the Reserve Bank of India will hand down its policy decision later in the day."

(Reuters) - California will bar companies from requiring non-disclosure agreements in settlements with employees over workplace harassment claims under a bill signed into law on Thursday in a win for tech workers who championed the proposal.
The Silenced No More Act had been co-sponsored by Ifeoma Ozoma, who quit Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc last year after voicing concerns about gender and racial discrimination, and also drew backing from organizations including TechEquity Collaborative that advocate for workers in tech and other industries.
Supporters say the law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will enable workers to speak out about experiences of harassment and discrimination without fear that companies could tear up severance packages. They say allowing more people to publicly address workplace treatment could help curb systemic racism and other problems ailing many companies.
The new law says settlement agreements cannot prevent or restrict workers from disclosing facts related to harassment and discrimination claims they have filed against the company. It also bars settlements from including non-disparagement clauses that stop people from talking about unlawful acts in the workplace. 
As part of efforts to respond to #metoo stories, California lawmakers three years ago banned companies from imposing non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, in cases of sexual harassment, sexual assault or sex discrimination out of concern that secret deals were allowing companies to maintain problematic cultures. 
The new law covers confidentiality in a broader range of cases, including racial discrimination and harassment based on disability.

Ozoma last year said that as a Black woman, she was pushed aside by managers at Pinterest for some tasks and underpaid. Supporters said the new law will help hold companies accountable to promises they have made to offer a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
Pinterest signed on as a supporter of the legislation.

(Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd is operating less than one-third of its usual domestic capacity due to tough COVID restrictions in Auckland and doubts whether a travel bubble with Australia will reopen, the airline's chief executive said on Thursday.
""We're running almost 100% outside of Auckland,"" Air New Zealand CEO Greg Foran told Reuters in an interview. ""It's a reasonable network but Auckland is literally two-thirds of the domestic network so it's a pretty significant impact to our business, not having Auckland operating at this stage.""
The airline has said it is burning through around NZ$25 million ($17.30 million) to NZ$35 million of cash a month due to the lockdown in the country's largest city, which the government says will be scaled back in phases as vaccination rates rise.
The Pacific nation was among just a handful of countries to bring COVID-19 cases down to zero last year and largely stayed virus-free until an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant in mid-August frustrated efforts to stamp out transmission.
The closure of a quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia is costing the airline another NZ$20 million to NZ$25 million a month in cash burn.
Foran said it was possible the New Zealand government would treat Australia like any other country in the future when it came to testing and quarantine rules, as is being done now.
""It will be up to the New Zealand government to decide if they going to relax (mandatory quarantine) for people who were vaccinated,"" he said. ""Maybe they can do isolation at home or maybe hopefully in time they don't have to do any. But the way it was operating in April, May and June, I'm not convinced it ever returns.""

The company has suspended its earnings guidance for the financial year ending June 30 amid the challenging market conditions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management LP said on Thursday that it owns a stake in US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Corp and plans to push for changes at the food service company.
Sachem Head said it is being advised by food industry veteran Bernardo Hees, who was until 2019 the CEO of the Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) Co.
In a regulatory filing, the New York-based investment firm said it owns 5.1% of the company's common shares and a 4.1% stake in cash settled swaps, making for an economic exposure of 9.2%.
The firm, run by Scott Ferguson, plans to hold discussions with the company's board and management but declined to say exactly what kind of changes it would like to see at the company, whose brands include Cross Valley Farms fresh produce and Devonshire bakery products.
The stock price closed at $37.28.
Its main competitors are  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY). and Performance Food Group (NYSE:PFGC). 
Hees is currently working for Sachem Head as an advisor and has agreed to serve as a potential nominee to the board. But Sachem Head has not yet said whether it plans to nominate directors to the company's 10-member board.
Pietro Satriano, US Foods' current CEO and chairman, joined the company in 2011 and was appointed chairman in 2017. 

Ferguson recently challenged International Flavors & Fragrances (NYSE:IFF), where he nominated four directors to the board and pushed the company to improve its financial performance. After the two sides reached a settlement, IFF's long-serving CEO, Andreas Fibig, last month announced plans to retire but said he would stay on until a replacement is found. 
Sachem Head owns stakes in fewer than 30 companies, with IFF and animal health company Elanco, where Ferguson was invited onto the board late in 2020, making up the bulk the portfolio.

(Reuters) - Two senior U.S. lawmakers on Thursday accused the White House of pressuring U.S. airlines to require their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19 by a Dec. 8 deadline for federal contractors or face firing.
Representative Sam Graves, top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Garrett Graves, senior Republican on the aviation subcommittee, wrote President Joe Biden on Thursday, saying it ""is unacceptable that your administration is using the threat of contractual measures as a coercion to single out American workers in a vital national industry.""
The lawmakers, who are not related, cited a Reuters story reporting that White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients had called the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Sept. 30, urging them to follow United Airlines' lead in mandating employee vaccines.
Zients on Wednesday praised airlinesfor mandating vaccines. ""Vaccination requirements work. New data reinforces that fact each day,"" he said.
Three of the airlines and the White House declined comment. Southwest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have since announced they will meet the Dec. 8 deadline for federal contractors. Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Sunday that the airline has not madea decision.
President Joe Biden on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-tout-vaccine-mandates-large-companies-chicago-trip-2021-10-07 was in Illinois to tout vaccines and praised United's vaccine mandate after meeting with United CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
The letter noted Congress since March 2020 awarded U.S. airlines a total of $54 billion in taxpayer funding for payroll costs, which only ended last week.
""We strongly urge you to rethink this ill-conceived mandate which will result in the termination of employees whose jobs were saved over the last 18 months at enormous taxpayer expense,"" they wrote.
""This unilateral mandate and arbitrary deadline will serve only to disrupt airline operations and increase the likelihood of canceled flights.""

Biden signed an executive order last month requiring federal contractors to mandate employee vaccines, with the White House later setting the Dec. 8 deadline.
A growing number of federal contractors are opting to comply, with  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) announcing Thursday it would mandate employee vaccines.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a date of Oct. 26 for its panel of outside advisers to meet and discuss the application, making it possible for children in this age group - numbering around 28 million - to begin receiving the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine shortly afterward.
""With new cases in children in the U.S. continuing to be at a high level, this submission is an important step in our ongoing effort against #COVID19,"" Pfizer wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The vaccine already has won U.S. emergency use authorization in teens ages 12 to 15 and is fully approved by regulators for people ages 16 and up.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of three in use in the United States, along with the two-dose  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) version, neither of which has won full regulatory approval for any age group. 
A rapid authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in young kids could help mitigate a potential surge of cases in the coming weeks and months, with schools open nationwide and colder weather driving activities indoors. If given regulatory authorization, the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would become the first COVID-19 shot made available to children 5 to 11 in the United States.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been shown to induce a strong immune response in 5 to 11 year olds in a 2,268-participant clinical trial, the companies said on Sept. 20.
The two drugmakers are also testing the vaccine in children ages 2 to 5 years old and children ages 6 months to 2 years, with data expected in the fourth quarter.
The vaccine could be ready for roll out as early as November pending approval from federal regulatory health agencies, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said on CNN.
Once the authorization is granted, Zients said: ""We are ready. We have the supply. We're working with states to set up convenient locations for parents and kids to get vaccinated including pediatricians' offices and community sites.""
The United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
Children currently make up about 27% of all U.S. coronavirus cases and an increasing percentage of hospitalizations, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That reflects the high contagiousness of the coronavirus Delta variant among unvaccinated people.

While children are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, they can spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations more at risk of severe illness.
A Pfizer spokesperson said the application to the FDA has been completed.

""We are not talking about a spin off yet. The problem here is the size of the business,"" said Eduardo Bartolomeo, Vale's Chief Executive Officer as part of the Financial Times' Mining Summit. 
Vale had a longstanding plan to sell the unit, that was still being considered as recently as April of this year. The plan had first been developed in 2014, postponed to 2015, and then the idea was temporarily abandoned. 
Bartolomeo said part of the problem was the value of the business, saying it brings in $3.5 billion in revenue a year, which would put a sale value at ""more or less $25 billion."" 
To get to a spin-off, Vale said in a statement after the event, ""the business still needs to be adjusted, transformed, and go through an internal transformation."" 
Vale, one of the world's largest iron ore miners, is still dealing with the consequences of a dam burst in 2019, which killed 270 in the town of Brumadinho.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -U.S. automaker Ford will temporarily suspend production from Oct. 11-12 at its Hermosillo plant in Mexico because of a shortage of material, the plant's labor union said on Thursday. 
Workers will be paid 75% of salaries on those days, the union added in a statement. 
Ford produces its Bronco Sport SUV at the Hermosillo plant in Sonora. It did not specify which materials were in short supply. 
Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other automakers have been struggling with a chips shortage as manufacturers shifted production toward parts needed for laptop computers, cell phones and video games during the pandemic.

Rivals General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have suspended operations several times this year. On Wednesday, the Mexican unit of Nissan (OTC:NSANY) said it would temporarily stop production during October at two plants.
Earlier this month, Ford said it would suspend production at its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant and at parts of its Kansas City plant.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 05:35PM ET</span>",Automakers funding new tech aimed at making greener lithium for EVs,"By Ernest Scheyder
CALIPATRIA, Calif. (Reuters) - Automakers, investors and even oilfield giant Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) are beginning to embrace environmentally friendly technologies to produce lithium that could help meet 25% or more of global demand for the electric vehicle battery metal by the end of the decade.
Stellantis, Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and others have invested millions of dollars or signed supply agreements with so-called direct lithium extraction (DLE) start-ups in recent months in an attempt to propel the technology to commercial production, expected within the next year or two.
DLE technologies use less land and groundwater than hard rock mining and brine evaporation ponds - the traditional ways to process the white metal. Industry analysts see it as a new way to help ensure lithium supply for the EV industry - if the technology can work on a large scale.
""More green lithium is the promise of this new technology,"" said Kasper Sage of BMW i Ventures, BMW's venture capital fund, which this week invested https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/bmw-invests-lithium-technology-startup-lilac-solutions-2021-10-06 in DLE tech start-up firm Lilac Solutions Inc.
DLE technologies are comparable to common household water softeners, which remove metals from drinking water.
The process can take as little as a few hours to filter the metal inside an average-sized warehouse. By contrast, traditional evaporation ponds can be hundreds of acres in size, permanently drain nearby aquifers and take several years to produce lithium. 
However, most DLE technologies are more expensive to operate than evaporation ponds, which use sunlight, and some require large volumes of freshwater and electricity. 
 Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) Corp and other traditional lithium producers say they have studied DLE technologies but feel they will not go mainstream until later this decade, given worries about high energy and water use.
""Access to clean water is one of the key hindrances to DLE,"" said John Peichel of Suez PA's water technology division, which sells equipment to the lithium industry. 
Schlumberger, known for its hydraulic fracturing work, is building a DLE project in Nevada and says its ""ultimate goal"" is to produce lithium without any freshwater. It is a goal the U.S. Department of Energy is supporting with a $4 million contest for the best geothermal lithium technological developments.
WALL STREET
The potential hurdles have not hindered Wall Street's interest in so-called green lithium. 
Standard Lithium Ltd.'s shares have risen six-fold since they started trading in New York in July, even though the company's DLE technology is still being piloted in Arkansas.
Australia's Vulcan Energy Resources Ltd shares are up 40% since August on its plans to supply automakers https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/renault-locks-lithium-supply-vulcan-energy-five-year-deal-2021-08-02 Stellantis and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY) from its German DLE project.
Chris Berry, an independent industry analyst with House Mountain Partners, says that based on existing announcements, DLE could produce a quarter of global lithium supply by the end of the decade, though he noted not all technologies should be treated as equal. Other industry consultants put that figure even higher.
Global demand for lithium last year was about 320,000 tonnes, and is expected to hit 1 million tonnes by 2025 and 3 million tonnes by the end of the decade. 
""Investors need to weigh the benefits of DLE technology against a host of challenges in tailoring the technology to each lithium deposit,"" Berry said.
One area drawing attention from DLE developers is California's Salton Sea, roughly 160 miles (258 km) southeast of Los Angeles. Superhot brines teeming with lithium swirl under the area, which sits atop the San Andreas Fault.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and EnergySource LLC are studying ways to add DLE technology to existing power plants there so they can process lithium while producing electricity. 
Nearby, privately held Controlled Thermal Resources Ltd is developing a geothermal lithium brine project to supply General Motors (NYSE:GM) https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-shakes-up-lithium-industry-with-california-geothermal-project-2021-07-02, which said CTR could supply ""a sizeable amount of our lithium needs"" by 2024.
That project, as well as a similar one in Argentina https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/australias-lake-resources-teams-up-with-clean-tech-firm-lilac-develop-argentina-2021-09-21, are backed by technology from Lilac Solutions and seen by some analysts as one of DLE's first commercial tests.

The DLE attention comes as prices for lithium are near all-time highs, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, fueling the race for new technologies.
""Lithium supply is the main bottleneck to electrification and DLE can help boost that supply,"" said Teague Egan, chief executive of Energy Exploration Technologies Inc, a privately held company working with Argentina lithium producer Orocobre (OTC:OROCF) Ltd.

As demand is expected to skyrocket in the winter, the prices of the energy will likely move higher. Energy infrastructure stocks Western Midstream (WES), Flowserve (FLS), Holly Energy (HEP), and Star Group (SGU) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.Despite the market being significantly volatile in September, owing to various economic factors, controlled supply and high demand for oil and gas led to a price increase for these commodities. In its meeting this week, OPEC, and its allies, have decided to stick to their previous plan of gradually increasing oil production and declined the need to ramp up production. As a result, U.S. crude traded above $79 a barrel this week, the highest since 2014. Today, U.S. natural gas futures closed at $5.68, representing a gain of 125% from the level seen a year ago.
The demand for oil and natural gas is expected to increase as winter approaches, increasing prices. This should significantly benefit energy infrastructure companies, among others. Investor interest in the energy sector is evident from the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLE (NYSE:XLE)) 15% gains over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 2.5% loss.

Stagflation fears are overdone, and investors are overly focused on weaker economic growth and higher inflation though the long-term market trend is higher, said Bill Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management.
""The journey ultimately is to a global expansion that continues intact, which recently has had this stagflation tinge to it,"" he said.

""There's still a number of black clouds hanging over the market, but the skies have cleared up a little bit in the last two days,"" James said.
Euro zone bond yields fell as energy prices declined, recovering from a sharp sell-off in debt markets a day earlier that had been driven by inflationary concerns.

(Reuters) - Sports betting will likely occur through exchanges and retail brokerages like  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) in the future, the head of North American markets at Nasdaq Inc said on Thursday. 
Nasdaq in June took a stake in Sporttrade, a start-up that plans to launch a sports betting app in New Jersey by year-end, and last month the exchange operator said it was providing the company with market surveillance technology.
Bringing an exchange model to sports betting will add competition and transparency to the industry, now legal in 25 states, with large states like California, Florida and New York looking at it, and by some estimates could be worth $37 billion by 2025, Nasdaq's Tal Cohen said at a Securities Traders Association conference. 
""In terms of competition, we'll have liquidity providers, market makers, compete for business, which means better prices and better odds, and lowers friction, and also means there's more data for you to look at when you're placing a wager,"" he said.
Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River Trading and Tower Research, proprietary trading firms that make markets in various asset classes by providing two-sided quotes for others to trade against, have also invested in Sporttrade.
Cohen also said it would make sense for brokerages like Robinhood to enter event and prediction markets.
""That same customer segment that's looking to buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), maybe buy bitcoin, is also interested in Sunday football and so I think that's going to be a natural evolution,"" he said.

Sports betting will grow with or without Nasdaq, and the exchange operator is well-positioned to provide advanced technology and potentially make the market safer and more transparent, Cohen said.
""What we're going to have to think about as a country is just based on investor protection and making sure we're not raising a culture of bettors,"" he said.

869,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",ECB's brain trust spars over inflation outlook,"By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's two leading economic thinkers sparred on Thursday over how likely it was for the recent, sharp rise in euro zone inflation to become permanent.
Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel, who lead the economic debate on the ECB's board, both repeated the ECB's official line that the spike in price growth would ease next year as the effects of a post-pandemic bounce fade.
But they differed sharply on the risks surrounding that prediction, with Schnabel warning of ""more persistent inflationary pressures"" and Lane of forces that could drag down price growth.
""It would be premature to assert that current price dynamics will fully subside next year,"" Schnabel told a joint conference organised by the ECB and the Cleveland Federal Reserve.
""There are several sources of uncertainty that might entail more persistent inflationary pressures.""
Among them, she listed potential changes in inflation expectations and in people's behaviour when it comes to setting wages and prices.
Speaking later at the same event, Lane refuted that the future was so uncertain. 
""We should not be flying into a narrative of 'who knows?' 'uncertainty is so pervasive that we have no idea' - that's not the case,"" the ECB's chief economist said.
""There's very solid reasons to believe that a lot of this is to do with the reopening of the economy. There's very solid reasons to believe there's a significant transitory component.""
He added that the recent rise in energy costs and the rollback of pandemic-related fiscal support measures were headwinds for the economy.
Schnabel conceded that so far there was ""no indication"" in market prices and in economists' forecasts that higher inflation would become entrenched.
But Lane went further, saying that the ECB wouldn't be spurred into tightening policy by a one-off increase in wages resulting from higher inflation this year.
The ECB is widely expected to wind down its emergency bond purchases in March and the debate is now shifting to how much debt it will continue buying after that date under its regular programme.
UPSIDE RISKS
Accounts of the ECB's latest policy meeting showed on Thursday that policymakers had already started worrying about upside risks when they met on Sept. 9-10.
""Risks to the inflation outlook... were widely regarded as being tilted to the upside,"" the accounts stated, with policymakers arguing that the ECB must keep an eye on a possible inflation ""regime shift"".
ECB chief Christine Lagarde played down inflation fears at a news conference after the meeting but has since struck a more balanced tone while many of her colleagues have flagged their concerns in private and public conversations.
New ECB forecasts unveiled at the meeting put inflation at 2.2% this year, 1.7% next year and 1.5% in 2023. 
But policymakers at the gathering also wondered whether their projection models were working properly given the big inflation overshoots this year.
""This raised doubts about how well the models relied on in the projections were able to capture what was currently happening in the economy, the structural changes implied by the pandemic and the impact of the ECB’s new monetary policy strategy,"" the ECB said.
Inflation in the euro zone hit 3.4% in September, according to Eurostat flash estimate.
EMERGENCY SUPPORT
The rate setters also debated a bigger cut in the monthly pace of their Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and some policy hawks even argued that markets had already prepared for the end of PEPP without a significant impact on financing conditions.

""The argument was made that markets were already expecting an end to net asset purchases under the PEPP by March 2022,"" the accounts showed. ""The point was made that, even without the PEPP, the overall monetary policy stance remained highly accommodative.""
In the end, the ECB opted for a more cautious move, simply deciding to cut their emergency bond buys ""moderately"" for fear of upsetting the markets.

Uncertainty over the debt limit standoff had weighed on stocks. Investors are also looking to Friday’s job report for September, at once a barometer on the state of the recovery and a tool the Federal Reserve will use to determine the timing of its tapering program.

1. Jobs, jobs, more jobs
Job creation is expected to have gotten a boost in September after the August disappointment of only 235,000 positions. According to estimates, the Labor Department is likely to give a figure of 500,000 for the jobs the economy added in September. The August total was the worst since January.
2. Hourly pay
Wages are expected to have maintained their north-drift but at a slower pace in September. Average hourly earnings are likely to have risen 0.4% month-on-month compared to August’s 0.6% rise, according to estimates of analysts tracked by Investing.com.
3. Unemployment rate
The unemployment rate is likely to have dropped to 5.1% in September from 5.2% in August. All of the jobs data comes out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

LONDON (Reuters) - Investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has estimated that troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande and many of its major rivals have billions of dollars worth of off-balance sheet debt that, once added on, ramp up their leverage ratios.
JPMorgan's China and Hong Kong property analysts said the tactic is likely to have been used to help firms look like they were conforming with new borrowing cap rules introduced last year, but Evergrande's case looks the most extreme.
""Instead of true deleveraging, we think Evergrande has shifted some of the interest-bearing debt to off-balance sheet debt,"" JPMorgan's analysts said. ""Commercial papers, wealth management products and perpetual capital securities, etc, which are not officially counted as debt.""
They estimated Evergrande's ""net gearing,"" as debt as a ratio of a firm's equity is known, was at least 177% at the end of the first half of the year, instead of the 100% its accounts reported.

""It is possible that the real gearing could be even higher, as data on some off-balance sheet debt is not publicly available,"" JPMorgan added, saying the ""disguised"" debt as it called it added up to 55% of Evergrande's overall debt.
Other major firms whose gearing levels were likely to be higher than formally reported included R&F Properties at 139% versus the 123%, Sunac China Holdings at 138% versus 87% reported and Country Garden at 76% versus 50% reported.

While the dizzying rallies caught the attention of retail traders, most meme stocks are risky as their fundamental strength does not back up these massive gains. We believe fundamentally weak meme stocks Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), SmileDirectClub (NASDAQ:SDC), Rocket Lab (RKLB), and Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) could see a significant pullback in the near term. So, investors should avoid these stocks for now.Meme stocks emerged as a pandemic-induced diversion, fueled by the hype surrounding them on social media forums. They gained immense popularity following the GameStop (GME) short squeeze triggered by retail traders earlier this year, and the craze continues with social media platforms influencing retail investors’ investment decisions. However, while the massive price gains of meme stocks look tempting, the performance for most of them may not be sustainable given their weak fundamentals.
Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged two individuals for a fraudulent trading scheme involving meme stocks to take advantage of a surge in retail trading driven by social media. This has raised investor anxiety surrounding meme stocks.
So, it could be wise to avoid meme stocks with weak growth prospects and bleak financials. To that end, we believe Beyond Meat, Inc. (BYND), SmileDirectClub, Inc. (SDC), Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB), and Ocugen, Inc. (OCGN) are best avoided now.

The good news is that this correction has removed short-term overbought conditions on the market that were present in early September. The bad news is that we still haven’t seen any real semblance of fear in the market, and valuations still remain at some of their highest levels in history. This is evidenced by the S&P-500 trading at a price-to-sales ratio just shy of 3.20, a figure that is 22% above the Dotcom Bubble peak figure of ~2.60. However, with the market now in a short-term correction, it’s a great time to start building shopping lists in case the weakness persists and we do see some fear enter the market.

Adobe (ADBE) and Nvidia (NVDA) have little in common as they hail from different industry groups, but they do share two key traits: they both have a track record of steady earnings growth with compound annual earnings growth rates above 35% since 2014, and they both continue to find strong support at their 40-week moving averages on any pullbacks. In ADBE’s case, the stock has a 40% compound annual EPS growth rate since FY2014 and just came off a strong quarter with 22% sales growth. In NVDA’s case, the stock has an incredible ~38% compound annual EPS growth rate for a mega-cap company and just had its second strongest quarter in the past two years from a sales growth standpoint, posting 68% revenue growth while lapping 50% growth in the year-ago period.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions activity for the third quarter hit its highest since 2016 as historically low interest rates and strong equity markets helped companies to revive transactions that were put on hold due to the pandemic.
Dealmaking rose 27.7% to $76.6 billion in the third quarter of the year, but was significantly down from the record $120.3 billion recorded in the first three months of the year, according the Refinitiv data. 
Bankers said while factors underpinning M&A exists and pipelines are strong, equity market volatility could slow the deal momentum.
""Higher deal flow in the third quarter was driven by a combination of factors including strong equity markets, historically low borrowing costs and market confidence in a gradual COVID-19 recovery,"" said Jake Lawrence, Group Head and CEO, Global Banking and Markets, Scotiabank.
However, he said short term inflationary and supply chain concerns are unlikely to have a material impact on deal flow given investor focus on long-term strategic considerations.
Transportation and infrastructure-focused deals led activity in the third quarter, with $33.6 billion in M&A activity, including Brookfield Asset Management's A$9.57 billion ($6.95 billion) bid for Australia's AusNet Services, and Brookfield's $3.4 billion planned takeover of Dexko Global Inc.
Higher inflation in Canada and the United States has stoked worries about central banks dialling back pandemic-era liquidity support and prospects of higher interest rates. That has increased stock market volatility.
""I guess the big threat that's overhanging the M&A landscape is the threat of rising interest rates,"" said Sarfraz Visram, head of Canadian and international mergers & acquisitions at Bank of Montreal.
""M&A is a lot easier to do when everybody is enjoying a strong equity market but I would say that valuation multiples were getting pretty high ... it was hard to justify doing deals at peak multiples,"" he added.
Of the deals announced in the first nine months of 2021, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s BofA Securities Inc, Bank of Montreal's BMO Capital Markets and  Toronto Dominion Bank  (NYSE:TD)'s TD Securities Inc took the top three spots in the advisory rankings.

Despite the strong stock markets, equity offerings fell for the second consecutive quarter, almost halving in the third quarter to C$6.8 billion ($5.42 billion) from the previous quarter, while IPOs dropped by nearly a tenth in the third quarter to C$332 million from the previous three months.

Investing.com – Lamb Weston shares (NYSE:LW) fell more than 4% Thursday as the company cut its guidance for the year and said annual gross profit margins would remain below pre-pandemic’s 25% level.
The company now expects annual sales growth to be in low-single digits as compared to low-to-mid single digits it had guided in July. The muted outlook came in as the company’s first-quarter sales and earnings came in below estimates.
The supplier of french-fries and appetizers has one too many challenges to contend with in the coming quarters, according to President and CEO Tom Werner.
One of them is the extreme summer heat that negatively affected potato crops in the Pacific Northwest. Then there are industrywide operational challenges, including highly inflationary input and transportation costs, labor availability, and upstream and downstream supply chain disruptions.
All this, according to Werner, will result in higher costs as the year progresses, and significantly pressure its earnings.
However, Werner said shipments in each of the company’s core restaurant and foodservice sales channels is improving.
He said the company is taking price hikes to offset commodity inflation, restructuring freight policies, modifying production and crewing schedules to reduce labor volatility and adopting new practices to attract and retain staff. It is also rationalizing its product portfolio, Werner said.
First-quarter net sales rose 13% to $984 million as demand from restaurants for frozen potato products rose. Lower shipments of private label products and weaker demand for at-home consumption were dampeners. Price hikes helped.
Net profit fell by two-thirds to $29.8 million as cost of sales rose and so did selling, general and administrative expenses.  "

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican concrete giant Cemex said on Thursday that supply chain snags and project delays will squeeze its full-year operating profit, even as it plans double-digit U.S. price hikes to offset higher costs.
Together with inflation and foreign exchange effects, the snags and delays could hit earnings this year by around $100 million, its chief executive said in a presentation for investors and analysts.
""What has changed is inflation. We thought we were going to have inflation, but not as much as we've seen, particularly fuels, electricity, maritime transportation in particular,"" Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez said. 
""We are increasing prices on a much more frequent basis."" 
Cemex will report third-quarter results at the end of the month with more detailed information on the impact to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Gonzalez said, adding that the company was also aiming to delay costs and some investments. 
""There is a scarcity of certain goods,"" he said. ""We've needed to buy at spot prices... that's more expensive than we're prepared to spend."" 
Jaime Muguiro, president of Cemex's U.S. operations, said the company would hike U.S. prices by double-digits throughout the coming year, in part to offset higher energy and shipping costs. 
He praised a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill under consideration by U.S. lawmakers, saying the $550 billion increase in funding for projects such as bridges, highways and transportation would have a positive impact on demand. 
Cemex also projected spending $410 million in capital expenditures in the United States, one of its key markets, over the next three-to-four years, Muguiro said.
In Mexico, Cemex's third-biggest market, the company is analyzing the potential implications of a proposed electricity reform https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-president-says-electricity-reform-has-been-sent-congress-2021-10-01 and how it could impact Cemex's climate goals. 
The bill would boost state control of the electricity market and set limits on private sector involvement, including companies that produce renewable energy. 

Ricardo Naya, the head of Cemex's Mexico unit, said Cemex currently sources just 30% of its energy from the state-run Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE). 
Naya also noted that cement exports to the United States are on track to hit a record this year, outdoing the past high from 2006.

Investing.com – Helen of Troy stock (NASDAQ:HELE) rose more than 6% on Thursday as the company put packaging-related issues with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency behind it to lift its annual guidance after accounting for higher inflation.
By the end of next month, the company expects to return to usual levels of shipping activity for the vast majority of filtration and humidifier products affected by EPA’s objection to claims made by the company on the packaging of those items sold in the U.S.
After booking $13.1 million as EPA compliance costs for inventory on hand in the first quarter as well as storage and legal expenses, the company took a charge of another $3 million in the second quarter to account for the incident.
The settlement of those issues and the ramp-up in sales gave the company the confidence to raise its guidance for the year. Consolidated net sales for the year are seen at $2.04 billion at midpoint. Core net sales are seen at $2.01 billion at center of the range.
The company said it is managing cost pressure through better product mix, price increases, forward buying of inventory to delay cost effects, utilizing previously negotiated shipping contracts at rates below current market prices, and implementing other cost reduction initiatives.
Second-quarter consolidated net sales declined over 10% to $475.2 million, led by lower sales of health and home products due to EPA-related issues. Sales of housewares rose while those of beauty products were mostly flat.
Profit fell 41% to $51.31 million. Both sales and earnings came in well ahead of estimates.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Flying Buttress once glided across the oceans carrying vital commodities like grain to all corners of the world. 
Now it bears a different treasure: Paw Patrol Movie Towers, Batmobile Transformers and Baby Alive Lulu Achoo dolls. 
The dry bulk cargo ship has been drafted into the service of retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which is chartering its own vessels in an effort to beat the global supply chain disruptions that threaten to torpedo the retail industry's make-or-break holiday season. 
""Chartering vessels is just one example of investments we've made to move products as quickly as possible,"" said Joe Metzger, U.S. executive vice president of supply-chain operations at Walmart, which has hired a number of vessels this year. 
The aim is to bypass log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space at a time when COVID-19, as well as U.S.-China trade ructions, equipment shortages and extreme weather, have exposed the fragility of the globe-spanning supply lines we use for everything from food and fashion to drinks and diapers.
More than 60 container ships carrying clothing, furniture and electronics worth billions of dollars are stuck outside Los Angeles and Long Beach terminals, waiting to unload, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California. 
Pre-pandemic, it was unusual for more than one ship to be  in the  waiting lane at the No. 1 U.S. port complex, which handles more than half of all American imports.   
Other big retail players, such as  Target  (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), have said they are chartering ships to deal with the pandemic-driven slowdown of sea networks that handle 90% of the world's trade.
Or, as Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit describes the escalating concern: ""Containergeddon.""
U.S. retailers' traditional lifeline from Asia is freezing up due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia plus a power-supply crunch in China. The supply snarls coincide with booming demand as consumers spend more on goods than going out, and the festive shopping frenzy nears.
Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, said at least 20-25% of the goods stuck on ships were unlikely  to make it onto shelves in time for the Nov. 26 Black Friday kickoff for the holiday shopping season, a period when retailers make more than a third of their profits.
ROUTE FOR GREAT PROFIT
The biggest chains are taking matters into their own hands.
In a typical year, Walmart would have moved those toys from China to Los Angeles in hundreds of 40-foot (12-metre) cargo boxes stacked like colorful Lego bricks on gigantic container vessels that serve multiple customers. 
But 2021 is far from typical. Incoming cargo at the Port of Los Angeles is up 30% from last year's record levels. Trucks and trains can't remove it fast enough, leading to logjams, said the port's Executive Director Gene Seroka, reflecting the surge in consumer demand.
""It's like taking 10 lanes of freeway traffic and squeezing them into five,"" Seroka said. 
Chartered ships that offer valuable cargo space and can sidestep the container terminals play a critical role in this second pandemic holiday season, particularly for time-sensitive goods like Christmas sweaters that won't sell if they arrive too late.
The Flying Buttress, for example, entered Los Angeles waters on Aug. 21. It got stuck in a queue outside the port before it bypassed clogged terminals and unloaded its goods at a separately operated bulk cargo dock nearby on Aug. 31, according to Refinitiv data and shipping records. 
During that voyage, Walmart circumvented the shortage of 40-foot containers typically used for global shipping by switching to bigger 53-foot containers that are almost exclusively used to move goods by truck and train within the United States.
Other companies are also playing the shipping game including Home Depot which said it was ""creatively working to obtain additional capacity"".
The home improvement retailer dodged the Los Angeles gridlock by sending its Great Profit charter ship nearly 125 miles south to the Port of San Diego. 
On Sept. 15, the ship's onboard cranes hoisted 7-foot Halloween ""Spellcasting witches"", Christmas lights and other holiday decor onto docks there, said Ocean Audit CEO Ferreira, who helps shipping customers claw back overpayments. 
""This is the home stretch. They're doing whatever it takes"" to win in an overheated market, he said of retailers. 
WHY PORT SIZE MATTERS
Yet there is a limit to such workarounds.
Great Profit moored at a terminal that handles everything from sugar to windmill blades but can only accommodate a maximum of 500 containers from one to two ships per month between now and the end of the year, said Greg Borossay, the port's maritime business development principal. 
That's because San Diego, like many other U.S. seaports, doesn't have the towering gantry cranes needed to pluck boxes from massive ships. Rail service is equipped for autos and other specialty cargo. And, roads in surrounding commercial and residential areas aren't set up for the fleets of trucks needed to whisk thousands of containers to other parts of the country. 
""We'd have a very unhappy community if we had 3,000 (boxes) coming off a ship,"" Borossay added. 
Not all retailers will hire ships to support sales, and other factors could be significant in picking out potential winners and losers. 
Clothing and accessory retailers have seen their inventories decline even as sales have accelerated, stoking worries about sell-outs, said Jason Miller, associate professor of logistics at Michigan State University's business college.  
General merchandise retailers like Walmart and Target, on the other hand have done a better job of keeping inventory on pace with sales, he added.
PAYING $20,000 PER CONTAINER
The global supply crunch is providing lucrative opportunities for bulk cargo ship operators, though; they are cashing in on a record spike in container shipping rates that has sent freight costs above $20,000 per box on the biggest liner vessels.
Global container shipping players like AP Moller Maersk and Hapag Lloyd, are flush with cash from the soaring rates. Major lines are ""putting in every ship we can find"", Hapag Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said.
Several shipping sources said other firms were snapping up second-hand container vessels of all sizes.
Hong Kong-based Taylor Maritime, which according to shipping databases manages the Flying Buttress, did not respond to a request for comment.
Dry bulk transporters have a short window of time to prepare decks to safely secure and carry cargo boxes. They typically transport commodities in below-deck cargo holds. 
Genco Shipping (NYSE:GNK) & Trading is seeking approval from its ship safety certifier to prepare some of its own dry bulk vessels to carry containers. 

Genco isn't going all-in on container shipping, said CEO John Wobensmith, who called the project ""opportunistic"".
Separately, agribusiness giant Cargill said it is looking into using some of the dry bulk ships it charters to instead hold containers, if only as a temporary solution, to ""alleviate bottlenecks"".

This comes in the light of U.S. President Joe Biden's mandate last month ordering all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with a few exceptions, and private employers with 100 or more workers to require employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.. 
IBM, which is a federal contractor, has tens of thousands of U.S. employees. 

IBM had previously said it would allow only fully vaccinated U.S. employees to return to offices. However, the new policy applies to all U.S. employees, even those working from home. Some can, however, claim exemption from the rule on medical and religious grounds.

(Reuters) - European stocks marked their best showing since July on Thursday, as easing oil and gas prices offered relief to investors worried about runaway inflation, while positive earnings updates added to the upbeat sentiment. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.6% to reverse weekly losses, with buying seen across all sectors. The energy sector gained the least, up 0.2%.
Stock market volatility has spiked in recent weeks on concerns about soaring energy prices spurring inflation and interest rates, debt problems at property developer China Evergrande and risks from tighter monetary policies. 
However, oil prices dropped for a second session after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks, and European gas futures fell back from record highs as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would boost gas supplies to Europe amid an energy crunch. [O/R]
But strategists at UBS warned Russia's supplies may not have a lasting impact in taming prices. 
""Russian gas exports to Europe are already running at elevated levels, and we think it's difficult for Russia to accelerate its shipments further in time for the European winter season,"" UBS said. 
The auto and parts sector jumped 3.2% for its best day in three months. 
The automakers-heavy German DAX index logged its best session since May, up 1.9%, shrugging off data that showed the country's industrial output in August dropped the most since April last year.
Also brightening the mood were a reprieve on the U.S. debt ceiling front, after U.S. Senate leaders agreed to extend the borrowing limit into December, and fewer than anticipated jobless claims in the country were recorded.
Sika rose 3% after the Swiss construction chemicals maker said it could overcome rising raw material costs and supply chain restrictions to increase its sales and profit margins this year.
A similar tone from French construction materials company St Gobain and a stock buyback announcement lifted its shares 4.2%.
With third-quarter earnings set to kick off, analysts expect a slowdown in profit growth as a post-pandemic rebound normalises. Profits for STOXX 600 companies are seen rising 45.6%, compared with a 152.6% surge in the second-quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
French luxury goods maker Hermes jumped 3.7% after HSBC upgraded the stock to ""hold"", while peers LVMH, Richemont and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) all rose about 2%. 
French car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) climbed 5.9% after a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) upgrade.

But the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage poses a significant challenge for the industry’s progress in the near term. Thus, we think Nikola (NKLA), Poterra (PTRA), Hyzon Motors (HYZN), and Workhorse Group (WKHS), which were the worst performing EV stocks in the third quarter due to their poor fundamentals, should be avoided.The transition of the automobile industry from internal-combustion-powered cars to electric vehicles (EV) will have major ripple effects for multiple industries. Several states in the United States have already declared a ban on the sale of new internal combustion cars beginning in 2035 to decrease carbon emissions. In addition, several other nations have announced similar plans to allow only EV sales in the next decade.
However, a global semiconductor shortage has emerged as a major impediment to the growth of the EV industry. According to the CEO of semiconductor company Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology, the semiconductor chip shortage may continue until 2022 and maybe beyond. This could dampen the revenue and earnings growth potential of several EV companies.
Given this backdrop, we think it would be wise to avoid fundamentally weak EV stocks Nikola Corporation (NKLA), Proterra Inc. (PTRA), Hyzon Motors Inc. (HYZN), and Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS), which were the worst performers in the third quarter.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday called for regulators to change rules that make it difficult for the NYSE to compete for stock orders, as the market share of exchanges has dwindled versus off-exchange trading platforms during the retail trading boom.
""On exchange, we are artificially constrained from competing for pretty much half of the market,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's NYSE.
""It's like we're in a bullfight, and sure, you can beat the price on an exchange if you've drugged the bull and starved him for two weeks,"" she said at an annual conference held by the Securities Traders Association.
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has said his agency is revisiting regulations he says may create an unequal playing field https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-global-exchange-fintech-2021-06-09 for exchanges versus broker dealer-run trading platforms.
One rule the SEC is reviewing is referred to as the ""sub-penny rule."" It prevents exchanges from displaying bid and offer quotes in increments smaller than a penny, whereas off-exchange trading platforms can offer fractional, sub-penny price discounts to exchange prices, which is attractive to retail brokers that are required to get their clients the best prices.
The rule was enacted in 2005 over concerns that if smaller pricing increments were allowed, sophisticated traders might use them to jump ahead of retail orders.

In 2021, the vast majority of retail orders have been executed through wholesale brokers.
Retail trading, which has surged in recent years during the work-from-home environment and as online brokers dropped trading commissions, accounts for slightly more than 20% of market volume, versus just over 10% in 2018, according to wholesaler Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT).

BERLIN (Reuters) -Stellantis, owner of Opel, is considering splitting off the German carmaker's largest plant and a second plant, which is shutting down temporarily next week due to chip shortages, a company spokesperson said on Thursday.
The two plants, located in Russelsheim and Eisenach in central Germany, would no longer be part of Opel Automobile GmbH but would remain linked to Stellantis, a company spokesperson said, adding that talks were underway with unions about the potential plan.
""The advantages associated with this more efficient and flexible organisation should contribute to securing jobs in the long-term,"" the spokesperson told Reuters.
The news, reported first by German newspaper Handelsblatt, comes after unions expressed concern that the Eisenach plant could be shut down permanently after the company said it would be closed for three months due to the global chip shortage.
Workers at the plant on Thursday accused Stellantis, of exploiting Germany's furlough scheme to move production out of the country.
Union officials fear that Opel, which is bound by an agreement struck last year not to make any workers in Germany redundant until 2025, is placing workers at the Eisenach plant on furlough as a temporary fix that could evolve into a longer-term shutdown.
Until the shutdown is lifted, the Grandland X model being produced in Eisenach will be made at the company's Sochaux plant in France - but Eisenach workers fear it will be moved there permanently.
""We won't let this be done to us,"" local workers' council head Uwe Loesche wrote in a statement published on union IG Metall's website on Thursday.
Two unions in France last week issued a similar critique of Stellantis' use of the furlough scheme, alleging that the company was using the chip shortage as an excuse to furlough a disproportionate number of people.
""The global automotive industry is in an exceptional situation due to the ongoing pandemic and a global shortage of semiconductors,"" Stellantis said in an emailed statement to Reuters when asked about the union's concerns.
""Production in Eisenach is scheduled to start again at the beginning of 2022, provided the supply chain situation allows.""
Stellantis' Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, alongside other heads of automakers and industry experts, predict the chip crisis will carry on well into 2022.

Analysts have said that the company, which is the world's fourth largest carmaker, has an overcapacity problem that could lead to plant shutdowns, though CEO Tavares has promised that his endeavours to turn around Opel's profits would not involve factory closures.
Stellantis, formed through a merger of France's PSA and Fiat Chrysler, has stalled production at plants across France, the United States and Italy in recent months due to the chip crunch, forecasting it would make 1.4 million fewer vehicles this year.

(Reuters) -Conagra Brands Inc said on Thursday it would increase prices again on its frozen meals and snacks to help cushion the blow of higher inflation, after the diversified food maker raised its annual sales forecast and topped quarterly results.
Packaged food companies are grappling with inflation as the U.S. economy rebounds, while spending heavily on freight and logistics to ease the strain on their supply chains due to the pandemic.

""We didn't just acquire new consumers, we kept them,"" he said in the post-earnings call.
The company raised its full-year outlook for organic net sales, citing a stronger-than-expected consumer demand and additional pricing actions, accounting for elevated inflation levels. It raised its full-year gross inflation estimates to around 11% from about 9% forecast earlier. 
The company expects full-year sales growth of about 1% compared with its previous forecast of about flat growth. 

Net sales fell 1% to $2.65 billion in the first quarter, edging past analysts' expectations of $2.54 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Thursday said it would allow others to use its intellectual property in hopes of speeding up the transition to low-carbon technology and energy sources. 
The bank is making several key patents related to how it efficiently cools and ventilates its massive data centers available to anyone using low carbon technologies as part of a joint pledge initiated by  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Co. 
Launched in April this year, companies have shared more than 450 patents as part of the pledge, shining a light on the technology these companies are using to mitigate their carbon footprints.
Majid Al Futtaim and enterprise software company Micro Focus also shared patents on Thursday, including Micro Focus's patents related to wind turbine management technology.
As part of their technology infrastructure, JPMorgan and other major companies use huge data centers, which consume vast amounts of energy for cooling and ventilation to prevent systems from overheating. 
While some companies, including JPMorgan, have moved some applications to a public cloud, financial services companies have remained largely reliant on private data centers because they are considered the most secure option. 
JPMorgan does not disclose information about its data centers. But it was reported in 2012 that the bank spent $500 million to build just one center. The bank's annual technology budget regularly runs around $12 billion. 

The bank's head of intellectual property Daryl Wooldridge said the company was making the patents available to back up the bank's commitment to the international Paris climate accord.

Carmakers around the world are struggling with a lack of semiconductor chips amid a post-pandemic rise in demand, and the disruption is hampering the Czech economy and others in central Europe reliant on the auto industry.
""Not even Skoda Auto is able to avoid this global crisis,"" Skoda Auto spokesman Tomas Kotera said.
The expected production curbs are the biggest so far in central Europe, and economists said they would lead to a cut in Czech growth forecasts.
Skoda, the backbone of the country's car sector that employs 180,000 workers and makes up quarter of industrial output, has already stocked up tens of thousands of cars finished but awaiting chips. Dealerships are reporting months-long waits for new cars.
Kotera said the firm wanted to focus on getting the backlog of almost finished cars to customers as soon as possible.
Due to Skoda's outage, overall car production should be similar this year to the 1.15 million cars made in the ""covid"" year 2020, the Czech Automotive Industry Association said.
Previously, the association expected 1.3 million cars to be produced this year. 
Skoda, which employs 35,000 and said it remained committed to maintaining jobs, predicted a gradual calming of the situation for chips in the second half of 2022.
The uncertainty in the car industry is becoming a major drag around central Europe, forcing economies to rely more on a rebound in services or household spending to drive growth. 
Data on Thursday showed Czech industrial output fell in August year-on-year for the first time since February amid a sharp drop in car production due to extended holidays.
Hungary, where carmakers likes Mercedes and Suzuki have had to limit some production, also saw output growth shrink more than expected because of the car sector. Output in Germany, the region's key trade partner, slumped in August.

The Czech Republic is home to three car manufacturers. Besides Skoda, which also halted production at the end of September, Toyota has faced outages, including last month.
""Automotive is not getting out of the trenches just yet, and that means bad news for the whole industrial sector, and that actually means bad news for GDP (gross domestic product),"" Raiffeisen analyst Vit Hradil said, adding he would look to revise his forecast for roughly 3% economic growth this year.

Investing.com – Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stock rose 2% Thursday as it waded into the increasingly competitive smart TV market with the launch of its own device in the U.K.
The smart TV, Sky Glass, will host Comcast’s own operating system. The company will begin to offer the screen to U.K. customers of Sky, Comcast’s European pay-TV unit, later this month and in other European markets next year. 
Sky Glass integrates Comcast’s technology platform and Sky’s content. The company said other pay-TV operators will also be able to use Sky Glass.
Comcast has taken several steps over the last few quarters to drive its 2018 acquisition of Sky as well as get deeper into the streaming business.
In July, the company decided to give NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock, to Sky’s 20 million subscribers across Europe at no extra cost.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's vaccine advisory committee on Thursday endorsed COVID-19 booster shots for those 70 years and older as well as medical staff interacting with patients, even as the nation's health system is already giving boosters to those over 60.
The expert panel, known as STIKO, said a repeat shot of mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) should be given six months at the earliest after the initial standard course. 
""Vaccine protection is decreasing over time in particular with regard to preventing asymptomatic infections and mild disease forms. With older age the immune response after vaccination takes an overall weaker form and breakthrough infections can more frequently lead to severe disease,"" STIKO said.
Anyone who received Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine should get an mRNA booster four weeks after the initial dose because the rate of breakthrough infections for J&J's vaccine had been the highest among the approved shots, it added.
Decision makers in public health have not waited for the experts' word. 
On Sept. 6, health ministers of the country's regional states and the federal minister Jens Spahn agreed to widen the groups eligible for a third shot to people over 60 who had consulted their physician. 
They also included nursing home staff and anyone likely to work closely with infected people.

One month prior to that, the group decided to offer booster shots to people with weakened immune systems, people in nursery care and those over 80 years and people who received a full course of vector shots by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and J&J. 
The European Union's drugs regulator said on Monday people with weakened immune systems should get a third dose of a vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, but left it to member states to decide if the wider population should have a booster.

By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) -Nestle is launching plant-based substitutes for egg and shrimp that closely mirror the taste, nutrition and performance of the originals, the food group said on Wednesday, extending its range in the fast growing vegan market.
The egg substitute, branded Garden Gourmet vEGGie in Europe, contains soy protein and omega-3 fatty acids. It can be scrambled or used in a frittata or as an ingredient in cakes and cookies, Nestle said.
The vegan shrimp, called Vrimp, follows the launch of its tuna substitute last year.
Chief Executive Mark Schneider said the Swiss company's vegan products such as plant-based burgers and sausages were seeing double-digit sales growth.
""It's also not limited to one particular age group or one particular demographic group,"" he told reporters in London. ""This is really getting mainstream and broad based.""
Last year, Nestle's sales from plant-based meat-substitute products were just 200 million Swiss francs ($216 million), a tiny fraction of its total sales of 84 billion francs. Adding other vegan products, such as dairy substitutes, took the total to 800 million Swiss francs.
Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said Nestle had developed the new products in less than a year, using for example its plant science expertise to engineer pea protein that did not have the taste of the legume.
""We want to be as close as possible to the animal-based version, because then it's much easier for people to switch to these type of products,"" he said in an interview.
The two products will initially have a limited launch in some European markets, including Switzerland.
Nestle launched its first plant-based burgers in 2019, about three years later than U.S. industry pioneers Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Impossible Foods. 
""We're the first ones to say that we did not invent the plant based hamburger, we also didn't invent plant based chicken,"" Schneider said.
""But I'm also obviously proud to say ours right now will beat everyone around the world when it comes to taste, mouth appeal and especially nutrition.""
Palzer said Nestle's global reach and range of brands also gave it an advantage over high-profile rivals.
""We have a broad portfolio of food and beverage brands, which these companies don't have,"" he said.
Nestle has already launched vegan products across its other categories, including a vegan KitKat. 

""There's a super big opportunity for us to make line extensions is all these loved brands,"" Palzer said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alberto Joseph Safra and his family are close to an agreement over the will of his father, Brazilian billionaire banker Joseph Safra, that could avoid litigation over an almost $15 billion fortune, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
Alberto challenged the will in a New York court in August, asking for medical records to prove his father, who was Brazil's richest man when he died in December 2020 aged 82, was in poor health when he last changed his will in 2019.
He argued in court that he had been disinherited, a characterization disputed by his mother Vicky Safra, administrator of Joseph Safra's state, according to a document filed with the court.
Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo first reported the ongoing negotiations between Alberto and his family.
Alberto and his siblings declined to comment on this and other financial matters.
Alberto resigned from Banco Safra's board of directors in November 2019, after a dispute with his younger brother David.
Alberto said at the time he would launch his own bank, ASA Bank. But Alberto reviewed his plans and has instead opened an asset manager, ASA Investments.
Before challenging his father's will in court, Alberto had disagreed with dividend policy at the family's holding company.
According to minutes of a shareholders meeting held in May by J.Safra Holding SA, a family holding that controls commercial buildings and other non-financial ventures, Alberto disagreed with the distribution of dividends at the minimum levels.

The holding company paid 80,000 reais ($14,560.00) over a profit of 85 million reais. Alberto voted against it.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Thursday, amid relief at a temporary deal to put off a U.S. government default and the partial retreat of sky-high energy prices that have posed an increasing threat to the world economy.
By 9:43 AM ET (1343 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 404 points, or 1.2%, at 34,821 points. The S&P 500 was up by 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up by 1.2%.
Stocks were building on gains already made on Wednesday on the back of developments in Washington, DC, and Moscow. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed to put off a final reckoning on the debt ceiling until early December, while Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the first indication that it's willing to increase gas supplies to Europe to bring prices down. 
There was also a fresh sign of the labor market making steady progress as the Delta-variant wave of Covid-19 recedes. Initial jobless claims last week fell to 326,000, breaking a sequence of three straight weekly gains. With no sign of the labor market weakening in near-real-time, the official labor market report on Friday is now positioned to remove one of the last obstacles to the Federal Reserve reducing its bond purchases from November.
American Depositary Receipts of Chinese companies were among the biggest gainers, after officials said that Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had agreed to hold a virtual meeting before the end of the year. The move represents the latest tentative sign of an improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations, after the dropping of charges against Huawei chief financial office Meng Wanzhou in September. Relations still remain tense, as evidenced by the regular violations of Taiwan's airspace by Chinese military airplanes in recent days.

The move could help protect more than 28 million people in the U.S. According to The  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), the agency has promised to process the request quickly and tentatively scheduled an October 26 meeting to consider it. A ruling is expected between Halloween and Thanksgiving, the NYT said.
Pfizer has proposed giving children one-third of the adult dosage. The company will be looking for a quick approval from the regulator as it rolls out its booster doses for the vulnerable while also facing some challenges.
The company last month secured FDA’s approval to provide booster dose to those 65 and older and to adults at-risk. While the company gets on with that exercise, countries and experts are still debating over the need for a booster after two doses and where it all ends even as many countries are still hugely under-vaccinated.
Also, not just Pfizer but all Covid-vaccine makers, face a potential competition from Merck (NYSE:MRK) which last week said that an experimental drug it is developing could halve risks of hospitalization and death due to the infection.
If approved Merck's antiviral pill could be the world’s first oral medicine for Covid, the company said in a note. Merck plans to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. as soon as possible."

DUESSELDORF (Reuters) -German utility Uniper is planning to cut one in 10 jobs over the next few years, the group's works council head said, as it shifts services towards renewables and hydrogen and away from fossil fuel-based power plants, except its own.
Harald Seegatz, who sits on Uniper's supervisory board, said the measures, which include power plant shutdowns, could affect at least 1,200 jobs, or about 10% of the total workforce.
Uniper, in a separate statement, said the restructuring would involve ""wide-ranging organizational changes and a significant reduction in headcount including divestment of individual business activities,"" without giving details.
The company said affected staff had been informed and it would provide further information on the plans in the first quarter of 2022.
Sources had told Reuters earlier that Uniper, which is majority owned by Finland's Fortum, was preparing major job cuts.
The news was greeted with dismay by the IG BCE (NYSE:BCE) union.
""That Uniper SE (OTC:UNPRF) prepares major cuts as an employer without working through possible future scenarios with labour representatives and the union beforehand is a slap in the face not only for co-determination but also for the affected employees,"" IG BCE union representative Nadine Bloemers said in a statement.

Uniper, which was spun off from E.ON in 2016, has been under pressure to decarbonise in response to Germany's plan to abandon coal as an energy source by 2038 at the latest. Fortum has also outlined a path to drastically reduce CO2 emissions.
The Finnish group, which owns 76% of Uniper, last month said it could free up additional cash to boost its war chest to expand in solar and wind energy assets, a field becoming increasingly crowded with utilities as well as oil majors.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Sika can overcome rising raw material costs globally and uncertainty in China linked to debt concerns at developer China Evergrande to reach its 2021 goals, Chief Executive Thomas Hasler said on Thursday.
The Swiss construction chemicals maker expects to increase its sales when measured in local currencies by 13%–17% this year following last year's pandemic driven downturn in building projects.
The company also expects to achieve an operating profit margin of 15% for the first time this year, confirming the guidance it gave in July.
Hasler, who took charge at Sika in May, said he remained optimistic about China despite uncertainties surrounding China Evergrande.
""There is a lot of speculation, but our Chinese organisation is much more relaxed. The exposure is rather small,"" Hasler told Reuters at the company's investor day in Zurich.
Sika, whose products are used to strengthen and waterproof building materials, is more involved in high-end projects like bridges, ports and tunnels than the mass market like accommodations, where mainly Chinese companies operated, he said.
""Our value is if you build a nuclear power plant or a bridge, then they rely on high tech, then they want reliability,"" said the 56-year-old executive.
""This type of construction is going to be reinforced and accelerate going forward,"" Hasler added. ""Our growth strategy in China is well balanced; our aim is to grow in China like in other regions.""
Sika now gets around 10% of its annual sales in China, a share that ""may increase a little bit"", Hasler added, although it was not the company's goal to double this level.
Sika confirmed its 2021 targets ""despite a challenging raw material price development and supply chain restrictions."" 

Sika expects a four percentage point increase in its bill for raw materials this year as suppliers of polymers, for example, had problems restarting full-scale production.
The company would respond with price rises in the fourth quarter and early next year, Chief Financial Officer Adrian Widmer told the event.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Twenty years ago, just days before the 9/11 attacks on the United States crippled the aerospace industry, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co moved its headquarters from its historic Seattle manufacturing hub to a stylish downtown Chicago skyscraper.
The move was central to Boeing's plan to forge a new identity as a diversified global juggernaut, distancing top executives from the daily operations inside far-flung business units, and getting closer to Wall Street and major customers.
Two decades on, in the midst of a fresh crisis shaking the industry, Boeing's corporate hub is in a state of limbo. 
A new crop of top executives based mainly on the coasts are managing industrial and safety certification problems at its major divisions and the lingering fallout from the 737 MAX and coronavirus crises. At the same time, tax incentives heaped on Boeing by Chicago and Illinois run out at year-end.
Once the symbol of a new Boeing, the vision of a corporate epicenter rising above its constituent parts has fallen at odds with the imperative of recapturing engineering dominance and repairing relationships with customers and federal regulators.
Chief Executive Dave Calhoun, for example, spent the beginning of the year at Boeing's factory in South Carolina dealing with production-related defects that have hobbled the program, people familiar with the matter said.
Other top executives, like newly minted CFO Brian West, are also based primarily on the U.S. East Coast and a hush has descended on the exclusive but functional top floor, although the pandemic has also been a major factor, the people said.
""It's a ghost town,"" one of the people added.
The headquarters - a 36-floor, $200 million riverfront skyscraper - sits at the crossroads of a cost-cutting campaign that has seen Boeing shed real estate, including its commercial airplane headquarters in Seattle. 
Several people close to the company say cost cuts and a more hands-on corporate culture have raised questions about Boeing's long-term future in the city, and in turn the broad direction Boeing intends to take as it tries to regain its stride.
Boeing, however, insists significant operations still take place there and rebuffs any suggestion that the giant may leave its Midwest base. ""Chicago is strategically important to Boeing's U.S. and global operations,"" a spokesperson said. 
""As with other companies, we have adapted to hybrid ways of working in the midst of the global pandemic to engage with our people, and our customers and other stakeholders.""
Boeing and employees have invested nearly $50 million in support of Chicagoland communities in recent years, Boeing said.
Despite the new focus, others caution exiting the city would risk a local firestorm and remains far from Boeing's immediate priorities amid a slew of industrial and regulatory problems.
    NEUTRAL LOCATION
    Boeing left its Seattle home after 85 years following its 1997 merger with St. Louis-based rival McDonnell Douglas - a decision that angered rank-and-file mechanics and engineers. 
Boeing was seeking a post-merger headquarters in a neutral location separate from those existing divisional power centers. 
But some critics viewed Boeing's Chicago move as a symbol of a company that prized near-term profits and shareholder returns over long-term engineering dominance - a charge repeated after crashes of 737 MAX jets that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.
""It began as a way of signaling that they would make future investments without regard to any legacy loyalties,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. ""To some, it has merely become a way of indicating that they will not make any future investments at all.""
    INCENTIVES EXPIRING 
    Chicago, Cook County and Illinois awarded Boeing more than $60 million in tax and other incentives over 20 years to relocate. Those credits have expired or will expire at year-end, though Boeing will receive 2021 funds next year, the spokesperson said. 
The incentives, which were temporarily swept up in a trade spat with Europe's Airbus over mutual claims of unfair support, required Boeing to keep 500 full-time employees at the office. 
Boeing reported 513 full-time employees in Chicago for 2020, a city spokesperson said. 
Boeing also employs thousands of people in Chicago and the Metro East region in southern Illinois near St. Louis, a state spokesperson said.
But analysis last year by the Better Government Association, which scrutinizes Illinois state decisions, found that Boeing fell short of the 500-employee mark in at least four years.
""Numbers reported by the company to the state and city differ, have never been audited, and in some years fell short of the public target,"" it said. 

The indirect impact from Boeing employees in the Chicago area had been pegged at $4.3 billion over 20 years, Pam McDonough, a former director of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, said in a LinkedIn article last year.
""These large projects are complicated and strategic but do result in tremendous benefits both financial and civic.""

Investing.com – Shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) traded nearly 3% higher in Thursday’s premarket as the pot producer rode high demand for cannabis during lockdowns to drive its first-quarter revenue higher by 43%.
June-August revenue rose to $168 million from $117.5 million a year earlier. Net cannabis revenue jumped 38% as more people took to it to serve recreational and medicinal purposes. 
Legal acceptance of cannabis in more states in the $80 billion U.S. cannabis market as well as Canada also helped the company. Tilray also sent its first shipments of medical cannabis products to Germany in the quarter.
However, Tilray's net loss widened to $34.6 million in the first quarter from $21.74 million, as total operating expenses shot up 175%. The company gave no explanation for why this had happened.
The company said it is on track for at least $80 million in cost savings from its deal to merge with Aphria (NASDAQ:APHA). It said it is focused on maximizing near-term profitability in higher-margin international medical markets and in Canada.
The company posted its tenth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Tilray claims to have a 16% share of the Canadian market and is aiming to raise that to 30% by the end of May 2024.

919,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",Britain's NatWest pleads guilty to money laundering failings,"By Kirstin Ridley and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -NatWest pleaded guilty on Thursday to failing to prevent the laundering of nearly 400 million pounds ($544 million) and faces a heavy fine after becoming the first bank in Britain to admit to a criminal offence of this sort.
The bank, which is 55% taxpayer owned after a 45 billion pound plus state bailout during the financial crisis, indicated in a London court guilty pleas to three criminal charges of not adequately monitoring customer accounts between 2012 and 2016.
""The facts of the case are complex, the likely sentence is a very large fine,"" Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which prosecuted the case against NatWest, told Westminster Magistrates' Court.
NatWest could face a potential penalty of around 340 million pounds under sentencing guidelines, Montgomery told the court, although a judge will set the level of any fine later this year.
Sara George, a white collar crime lawyer at Sidley, said the case sent a clear message to the banking industry to step up anti-money laundering systems and controls.
NatWest, which is Britain's biggest business bank, said in a statement it will take a provision in its third quarter results next month in anticipation of a fine.
The FCA alleged NatWest failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash.
But it said it would not take action against any current or former employees, while NatWest said it was not anticipating any other authority investigating this conduct.
""We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers,"" NatWest CEO Alison Rose said in a statement. 
NatWest said it had invested 700 million pounds over five years in money laundering prevention systems.
'COMPLY OR FACE COURT'
A sentencing hearing will take place at a higher Crown Court, possibly around Dec. 7, the court was told.
The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, is the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law and represents a blow to Rose's drive to rehabilitate the bank's image, including rebranding it from the scandal-tainted Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) banner last year.
Prosecuting a bank for criminal conduct is rare in Britain and, unlike in any civil action, can threaten a bank's ability to operate if it is convicted.
However, the FCA confirmed it is not aiming to strip NatWest of any banking licences, limiting the potential fallout. 

""Today's events should have compliance departments reviewing their own procedures to ensure adherence to the regulations,"" Neil Williams, deputy head of complex crime at Reeds Solicitor, said. ""The message from the FCA is clear: comply or face court.""

The world's largest cannabis producer by sales said its revenue rose to $168 million in the quarter ended Aug. 31 from $117.49 million a year earlier. Net cannabis revenue jumped 38%.
Cannabis products saw a massive rise in popularity this year as more people turned to it for relaxation during the months-long isolation caused by COVID-19, lifting sales of pot producers.

Investing.com – Levi Strauss stock (NYSE:LEVI) jumped nearly 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the company raised its annual guidance for the second time and disclosed a $200-million share repurchase program.
Third-quarter numbers were not just ahead of the previous year period’s but also 2019’s.
Levi President and Chief Executive Chip Bergh said its acquisition of Beyond Yoga is helping establish it in the fast growing, high-margin premium activewear market as the company tries to capture “global casualization trends”. The pandemic has driven this shift towards casual, sports and leisurewear as people try to balance both work and personal life in attire they think allows them to straddle all purposes.
Approximately 10% of company-operated stores were closed globally during the quarter, primarily in Asia, where traffic remained at very low levels as Delta-variant Covid-19 spread and governments imposed limits on the movement of people. 
But as stores opened, more consumers logged out online and stepped out to shop. This reflected in contribution of digital sales slipping to 20% of revenue from 23% in second quarter. Only 4% of Levi's company-operated stores worldwide were still shut at the end of the quarter. 
Overall, global wholesale revenue rose and so did digital sales. Revenue from the Americas, comprising more than half of the total, rose 52%. Europe revenue was up 27% and Asia 34%.  
The company now expects full-year adjusted diluted profit per share at $1.44 at center of the guidance range, compared to $1.31 back in July.
Net revenue in the third quarter was up 41% at $1.5 billion and profit rose more than seven-fold to $193.3 million. Both came in ahead of estimates.

During pandemic lockdowns, instead of offering refunds to those legally unable to fly, IAG-owned British Airways offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair providing the option to rebook.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) started action against the airlines in June, saying passengers who were legally unable to take flights booked in good faith should have their money back.
But it said on Thursday the law did not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund in such unusual circumstances.
Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said the CMA ""strongly believed"" the passengers should be offered a full refund. 
""However, after considering the relevant law and gathering evidence in our investigation, we have concluded that the length of time that would be required to take this case through the courts, and the uncertain outcome, can no longer justify the further expense of public money,"" he said.
He added the CMA hoped the law would be clarified.
Ryanair said it welcomed the decision. ""We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons,"" a spokesperson said. 
""Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee, and many availed of this option."" 

British Airways said in a statement it had acted lawfully at all times during the crisis, issuing nearly 4 million refunds and offering highly flexible booking policies.

924,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Tesla's gigafactory electrifies California-Germany culture clash,"By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - With final approval for its German factory potentially just weeks away, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk will make an appearance in the tiny town of Gruenheide this Saturday to host a county fair.
Despite pandemic-related curbs limiting gatherings in Germany to under 5,000 people, Tesla applied for - and got - a permit to have 9,000 at the Oct. 9 'Giga-Fest', after local authorities agreed the event would be COVID safe.
Coming on the heels of officials allowing the company to break ground on its new site before final approval had even been granted, environmental groups say this is just the latest example of Tesla being given too much leeway to act disruptively in Germany - a pattern they worry will continue. 
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The pre-approvals Musk has received from local authorities to build without final permission are legal, but rarely used by German firms because of the associated risk: if final approval is not granted, Tesla must pay to tear everything down.
While some bemoan Musk's approach as throwing German caution to the wind, others - who say German regulations governing planning, jobs and environmental concerns are unnecessarily restrictive - welcome the influence he could have on the country's business culture.
""I am fully convinced Tesla can have a positive effect on Germany,"" Brandenburg's economy minister Joerg Steinbach, a prominent advocate of the factory, told Reuters. 
""The fundamental idea of taking a close look at current legislation and checking whether it could perhaps be modernised - without risking a loss to legal clout - is in my opinion absolutely worth considering.""
The country's powerful unions are already gearing up to fight for German-style contracts for Tesla workers, environmental groups are poised to oppose any further expansion plans, and locals wary of Musk's 'American' ways are watching the firm's every move.
""Tesla has to stick to environmental protection laws, building laws, and of course labour and unionisation laws,"" Birgit Dietze, head of the Brandenburg region for union IG Metall and a former member of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s supervisory board, said.
Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.
Once running, the factory will produce 500,000 electric cars a year and generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity – more than any other plant in the country.
Conversations between the union and applicants indicate Tesla, whose CEO is known for his rocky relationship with organised labour, is offering pay 20% below the collectively bargained wages offered at other German automakers, IG Metall said.
It is also shaking up conventional German contracts by offering packages with stock options and bonuses rather than predetermined holiday pay.
Driving a harder bargain with its workforce could create a competitive advantage for Tesla, whose choice to set up its first European gigafactory in the homeland of Volkswagen, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW has raised the stakes in the global battle for EV dominance.
Musk has already experienced German union power. When Tesla bought German car parts supplier Grohmann Automation in 2017, it set wages 30% below average, refusing to match collectively bargained pay. 
After the firm offered one-off bonuses and stock options instead, unions dropped a threat to strike. Unions say stock options have also been mooted at the Brandenburg factory. 
GERMAN CARMAKERS CAN'T DO IT - BUT TESLA CAN
Of the 12,000 positions to be created at the factory, 800-1,200 have been filled so far, according to IG Metall and Steinbach.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment or questions on how recruitment was progressing. But data from LinkedIn suggest applications are low, with fewer than 10 applicants for most of the factory positions advertised in the past month.
Gruenheide is a 45-minute drive from the Polish border, and Tesla is widely expected to recruit workers from there.
""20% under German wages is still very good pay for Polish workers,"" Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, an expert on the German auto industry, said.
""German automakers couldn't do it; they'd get into big trouble with the unions. But Tesla can do it.""
Musk had planned on starting production in July in order to deliver the Model Y car to European customers from Berlin - but local opposition and the late addition of a battery plant requiring blueprints to be resubmitted to authorities held up the process.
The delay forced Tesla to deliver the Model Y from Shanghai, prolonging waiting times and increasing costs.
In a document published online in late September containing all 813 objections to the factory filed with local authorities and Tesla's responses, the company repeatedly reminded its critics that it was creating jobs and bringing Germany closer to its electric mobility goals.
""I understand the concerns. But some of it is selfish. It’s always the same - people want things like wind farms and electric vehicles... just not in their backyard,"" said 60-year-old Grunheide local Ralf-Thomas Petersohn, a member of Germany's official Tesla fan club. 

A public hearing scheduled for Sept. 23 for citizens to discuss objections to the factory was moved online due to concerns that it could become a ""super-spreader event"", authorities said, a decision which some viewed as hypocritical considering the likely approval of Tesla's request for a 9,000-person party. 
""This isn't about Tesla. It's about whether you take citizen participation seriously,"" Michael Ganschow of environmental organisation Gruene Liga said. ""We can't just say, 'You're making electric cars, so you can do whatever you want'.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, continuing the previous session’s late gains with sentiment boosted by reduced fears of a potential debt default.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 235 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 35 points, or 0.8%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 150 points, or 1%.
The major indices closed higher Wednesday, overturning earlier sharp losses after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell put forward a compromise of a short-term suspension of the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a national default.
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 100 points, or 0.3%, after reversing an earlier loss of more than 400 points. The S&P 500 advanced 0.4%, after falling as much as 1.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%, overturning an earlier 1.2% loss. 
Earlier this week Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a default would cause “irreparable” harm, citing a likely financial crisis and recession.
Stock markets have been very volatile of late, driven by uncertainty surrounding the country’s economic recovery. The sharp rise in energy prices has led to concerns that add to inflationary pressures, stifling growth while prompting the Federal Reserve to move up the tightening of its accommodative policies.
That said, U.S. companies added more jobs than forecast in September, according to data from the ADP Research Institute, released Wednesday, with private payrolls rising by 568,000 in August, the most since June.
The ADP numbers are a prelude to a bigger reading of nonfarm employment that comes out Friday. Ahead of that comes the weekly initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which are seen falling to 348,000 for the week ending October 2 from 362,000 for the week before.
In corporate news, clothes retailer Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) will be in focus after reporting strong quarterly numbers after the closing bell, benefiting from back-to-school demand. Cannabis company Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) also reported a solid rise in quarterly revenue.
ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG), the maker of brands such as Duncan Hines, Bird’s Eye, and Hunt’s, is scheduled to report earnings Thursday, as the market heads into the main third quarter earnings season next week.
Also helping the tone in Europe Thursday has been the move lower in energy prices, after the United States said it was considering selling oil from its strategic reserves and Russia said it was ready to stabilize the natural gas market.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $76.27 a barrel, the Brent contract fell 1% to $80.30 and Gasoline RBOB Futures dropped 0.8% to $2.2929 a gallon.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,762.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1563.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",GM aims to double revenues by 2030 as it drives to pass Tesla,"By Joseph White and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday that the automaker plans to double revenue by 2030, expanding profits from combustion vehicles even as it rolls out new electric vehicles and new digitally powered services to catch up with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
GM said if it succeeds, annual revenue by 2030 would be about $280 billion, and the automaker would be the leader in U.S. electric vehicle sales. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said GM expects pre-tax profit margins of 12 to 14%, which could beat current levels. That would imply annual pre-tax profits of as much as $39 billion.
Jacobson said GM can fund $9 billion to $10 billion in annual capital spending for electric vehicles and other initiatives while returning money to shareholders.
""This won't all happen at once,"" Jacobson said.
GM projects its combustion vehicle business can grow even as annual electric vehicle revenues rise to $90 billion by 2030 from $10 billion projected in 2023, Jacobson told investors after markets closed. The company also plans to add $80 billion from new businesses such as the Cruise autonomous vehicle ride service by 2030.
Barra has been campaigning to convince investors that General Motors (NYSE:GM) can top Tesla in technology development and profitability as the auto industry navigates the most profound technology revolution since the mass-produced Ford Model T. She and other GM executives began a two-day series of presentations to investors at the automaker's Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. 
They said GM can transform itself ""from automaker to platform innovator"" - a reference to Silicon Valley digital platform companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) that have far higher stock valuations than GM and other incumbent auto manufacturers.
Barra took the helm at GM in 2014 and at one point almost doubled the share price from a narrow band around its 2010 initial public offering price of $33. The shares rose after hours on Wednesday after closing at $53.93. 
Still, GM's market capitalization of about $78 billion remains far behind Tesla's $773 billion market cap, reflecting investor skepticism that GM can match Tesla's battery and software prowess.
Barra and GM President Mark Reuss outlined a plan for a transition to an all-electric fleet by 2035 that starts gradually, then accelerates after 2030, by which time more than half of GM's factories in China and North America will be ""capable of EV production."" 
AGILE FACTORIES
GM has said it aspires to produce nothing but electric vehicles by 2035. Reuss said that will depend on the ""agility"" of GM's factories, which will build both combustion and electric vehicles.
""We want to take the entire workforce along with us,” Barra said. She and Reuss insisted that GM's current workforce and factories are assets, not liabilities. Electric vehicle startups are building new factories at great expense, she noted, while GM already has plants and people it can repurpose.
In 2022, GM plans to launch an electric version of its best-selling North American model, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Barra will unveil it at the CES technology show on Jan. 5, GM said. Suppliers have said that vehicle will be launched in late 2022.
“No one will be able to touch us in the electric truck space,” Reuss said.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which is on track to beat GM to market with the battery-electric Ford F-150 Lightning early next year, recently said it will double capacity for the Lightning at its Dearborn, Michigan, factory. Ford plans even more electric F-150 production at a complex planned for Tennessee. Startup Rivian began production of its electric pickup last month. https://www.reuters.com/article/rivian-production/amazon-backed-startup-rivian-starts-production-of-electric-pickup-truck-idUSKBN2GA235
Tesla has delayed the launch of its futuristic Cybertruck.
GM executives have been careful not to make a hard commitment to abandon internal combustion vehicles by 2035, saying that will depend on market demand and government policy.
ELECTRIC DREAMS
Still, GM's embrace of electrification has won over investors increasingly concerned about climate change. On Monday, hedge fund Engine No. 1 said GM had carved a leadership position on battery technology and had a lot of growth ahead.
GM also aims to expand profits from internal combustion vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Silverado large SUVs such as the Cadillac Escalade.
Barra has expressed confidence GM can build profitable, higher-margin software-driven services and capture new customers with electric vehicles, such as a $30,000 electric Chevrolet crossover wagon. 
GM is majority owner of autonomous vehicle services company Cruise, and projects that company should deliver $50 billion in annual revenues by 2030. Last week, Cruise received licenses in California to begin accepting passengers, though it cannot yet charge for rides.
GM is also investing in the BrightDrop e-commerce delivery unit and insurance offered through its Onstar telematics brand. In all, GM said it is managing 20 startups to develop new lines of business.

Tesla's impact was evident. GM said that by 2023 it will offer a new version of its Ultra Cruise hands-free driving system using sensors to enable hands-free driving in ""95% of all driving scenarios."" 
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has made similar claims for future versions of the electric automaker's Autopilot technology.

Investing.com – Amazon stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) traded 1.1% higher in Thursday’s premarket as it attempted to allay fears over the data hack at Twitch Interactive, a company it acquired in 2014 for about $970 million.
Twitch is an American video live streaming service focusing on video game livestreaming and broadcasts of e-sports competitions.
In a post on its website Wednesday, Twitch said no login credentials or credit card details were compromised. The platform said it doesn’t store full credit card numbers in any case.
Information from the data breach was leaked on the online chat forum 4chan. The user who allegedly posted Twitch data said they did it to hurt its business. The person claimed to have access to the Twitch source code, internal security tools and creator payouts.
Twitch boasts an average of more than 2.5 million viewers at any given moment. More than 7 million unique creators stream live video on the platform and over 30 million users visit the site daily, it says.
According to an August 4 Accenture (NYSE:ACN) report, global cyber intrusion activity more than doubled in first half of 2021.
However, it's unusual for big companies, with more generous cybersecurity budgets and more cyber risk awareness to be badly compromised. Companies with annual revenue between $1 billion and $9.9 billion accounted for more than half (54%) of ransomware and extortion victims, followed by companies with annual revenue between $10 billion and $20 billion (20%).

931,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 05:53AM ET</span>","Taiwan's TSMC, after U.S. request, says it won't leak sensitive info","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC will not leak any sensitive company information as part of a White House request for details on the ongoing semiconductor crisis that has forced cuts to U.S. auto production, the company's general counsel said.
The White House made the request to automakers, chip companies and others last month.
Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said a voluntary request for information within 45 days on the chips crisis would boost supply chain transparency and that if companies did not answer the voluntary request ""then we have other tools in our tool box that require them to give us data"".
The issue has caused concern in Taiwan that companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, would have to hand over sensitive data.
""Don't worry. We definitely will not leak our company's sensitive information, especially that related to customers,"" TSMC's general counsel Sylvia Fang said on Wednesday, in comments provided by the company on Thursday.
""Customer trust is one of the key elements to our company's success,"" she added.
""If this is to resolve supply chain issues, we will see how best we can do to help them. We have done so many things. For the part of auto chips, we've tried to increase output and prioritize auto chips to a certain degree.""
TSMC, and Taiwan's government, have repeatedly said they are doing all they can to resolve the chip shortage.
Fang said they were still in the process of assessing the content of the questionnaire the United States has sent out for companies to fill in. 

  The U.S. government ""found out that many companies have questions so they are preparing an FAQ, which will be released soon. We are waiting for that too and see if the FAQ can help answer questions"".
Taiwan's government has said they respect U.S. commercial law and rules but will help Taiwanese companies if they receive any ""unreasonable requests"".

933,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>",French watchdog chief calls for ban on 'payment for order flow' in EU stock market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - ""Payment for order flow,"" a practice critics say has fuelled bouts of frenzied retail share trading on Wall Street, should be banned in the European Union, France's stock market regulator said on Thursday.
In the United States, stockbrokers have touted for business among retail customers by offering zero commission services, with payment coming from sending the orders to a specific wholesale market maker for executing.
Robert Ophele, chairman of France's AMF securities watchdog, said the situation was even more complicated in the EU due to the lack of a single markets regulator.
""I am strongly inclined to favour the clarity of a ban for payment for order flow,"" Ophele told an event held by European markets industry body AFME.
The EU is reviewing its securities market rules known as MiFID II with a view to making a series of tweaks in a bid to deepen its capital market now that Britain has left the bloc.
France, president of the EU in the first half of 2022, will be responsible for marshalling reforms through the bloc.
The EU's executive European Commission has said it wants to create a ""consolidated tape"" or record of transaction prices for shares traded across the bloc to make it easier for investors to spot the best deals.
But there is debate over whether transaction prices should be published near to real-time or, as exchanges want, with a 15-minute delay nL8N2R04BU.
Ophele said the closer to real-time the better for investors.
""If you just say let's have a delay, I am not sure it will make life simpler for the users of this consolidated tape,"" Ophele said.
Pan-European funds industry body EFAMA said a real-time tape was essential to enhancing retail investor confidence in EU capital markets, and for asset managers to improve their trading strategies.

Ophele said he hoped that EU changes to improve the quality of stock market data could come in by January 2023.
Banks argue that once data quality has improved calls from bourses to curb off-exchange trading - or over-the-counter dealing often done via banks - will be seen as unjustified.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Eneos Holdings Inc, Japan's biggest refiner, plans to buy Japan Renewable Energy for about 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion) from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.
The deal would mark the first major purchase of a renewables company by a top Japanese oil company, the Nikkei said, as Eneos looks to shift away from fossil fuels.
Founded in 2012, Japan Renewable Energy develops and builds renewable energy assets and has 419 megawatts of solar, onshore wind and biomass capacity in operation, with a further 410 MW under construction.
An Eneos spokesperson said the company was considering various options to expand its renewable energy business but that nothing had been decided. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment. 
Like overseas counterparts including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Japan's oil companies are shifting into new areas, especially after Tokyo stepped up commitments on cutting atmosphere heating emissions along with other countries.
Japan Renewable's website has few financial details but, with its comparatively small capacity, any acquisition is unlikely to make much of an immediate contribution to Eneos' typical annual sales of around 10 trillion yen ($90 billion). 
However, it signifies Eneos intent to start switching out of fossil fuels as the energy transition accelerates. Japan is set to nearly double official targets for renewable supplies in the energy mix of the world's third-largest economy.

Eneos controls half the market for gasoline and other fuels in Japan, but has for many years seen its customer base shrink due to a declining population and shifting tastes.

Jumbo Fortune Enterprises, a joint venture whose owners include Evergrande's main onshore unit, issued the bond at an initial amount of $260 million, according to the report.
Some bond holders did not receive the payment that matured on Oct. 3 as of Thursday in Hong Kong, the news agency said.
A nonpayment of the bond's principal may constitute a default as the note has no grace period, although five business days would be allowed if the failure to pay were due to administrative or technical error, the Bloomberg report said. 

Evergrande did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply higher Thursday, continuing the week’s volatile trading with sentiment boosted by falling energy costs and signs of compromise in Washington over averting a U.S. default.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1%.
European markets have benefited Thursday from the abrupt reversal on Wall Street late Wednesday, after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a short-term suspension of the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a national default until a more permanent solution can be found before the end of the year.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said such a default would cause “irreparable” harm, in the form of a financial crisis and a recession.
Also helping the tone in Europe Thursday has been the move lower in energy prices, with both crude and gas prices falling off recent multi-year highs after the intervention of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
By 3:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.9% lower at $76.00 a barrel, the Brent contract was 1.2% lower at $80.16.
Investors should buy dips in European equities,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said, in a note published Wednesday, arguing that stocks still offer more value than bonds even if price-to-earnings ratios are high and earnings per share growth is set to moderate.
In corporate news, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSb) stock rose 0.3%, the energy giant expecting a significant boost to cashflow in the third quarter on the back of the elevated natural gas and electricity prices (even after a significant production outage in the Gulf of Mexico).
Sika (SIX:SIKA) stock rose 2%, as the Swiss construction chemicals group expressed confidence that it could overcome rising raw material costs and supply chain restrictions to increase its sales and profit margins this year. Paper and packaging group Mondi (LON:MNDI) also rose 1.9% after saying it is passing on most of the recent rises in input prices to its customers. 
There was some disappointing economic news Thursday, as German industrial production slumped 4.0% on the month in August, a hefty drop from the 1.0% gain seen in July. This follows Wednesday’s sharp 7.7% fall in factory orders, and points to the difficulties Europe’s largest economy has been having with supply chain constraints.
Elsewhere, speeches from European Central Bank members Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel are likely to draw attention following talk that the central bank is studying a new bond-buying program to prevent any market turmoil when emergency purchases get phased out next year.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,766.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1564.

Those requirements will be introduced earlier for some sites in high risk areas, such as Mt Arthur coal mine in New South Wales state, BHP said in a statement.
Australia has struggled since mid-year to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19.
It is now pushing to increase vaccination rates so that cities can begin lowering their lockdowns.
“The science is clear that widespread vaccination saves lives,"" BHP Minerals Australia President Edgar Basto said in a statement.
""We recognise the path forward is through widespread vaccination in Australia and we are looking at a range of practical ways to support that while protecting communities and workforces,"" he said.
The Mining and Energy Union said that it did not support BHP’s decision to mandate vaccines and that it was working through the legal implications of the decision. 
""We have strongly advocated to government and industry that COVID-19 vaccinations should be voluntary for mineworkers,"" it said in a statement.
Western Australia, where BHP runs its iron ore operations, and which has remained mostly coronavirus free, said earlier this week that it would require all employees that work with natural resources to have a first COVID-19 shot from December.

That was to help protect vulnerable Indigenous communities as the country begins opening up, it said.
Australia's coronavirus numbers are relatively low, with some 120,000 cases and 1,381 deaths. The country's double dose vaccination rate has climbed to around 47%.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 02:27AM ET</span>",Shareholders push for Australia's banks to stop fossil fuel funding,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -A group of shareholders filed climate change resolutions with three of Australia's Big Four banks on Thursday, asking them to abide by their self-declared support for net-zero emissions by 2050 and stop financing fossil fuels.
The resolutions ask for a firm commitment from  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) not to fund any fossil fuel projects, in line with calls by the International Energy Agency (IEA) https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/radical-change-needed-reach-net-zero-emissions-iea-2021-05-18. 
The resolutions, filed by a group of about 100 shareholders, come ahead of the United Nations' COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, set to begin on Oct. 31, and as Australia regulators step up their scrutiny of climate-related risks and disclosures.
They are unlikely, however, to be officially tabled for a vote at the banks' annual general meetings in December, partly because of restrictions under Australian corporate law.
But backing for these types of resolutions is often acknowledged at meetings and support for similar proposals has risen in recent times. 
Last year, shareholder support for similar resolutions tabled at the annual meetings of ANZ and NAB doubled to 28% and 26% respectively.
In one of the three matching resolutions, the shareholders say: ""Despite committing to the climate goals of the Paris Agreement ... ANZ is aligning its investment practices and policies with the failure of these goals, resulting in our company falling behind rapidly evolving investor and regulator expectations, and the practices of other financial institutions.""
Earlier this year, a group of investors managing $4.2 trillion, called on some of the world's biggest banks to toughen their climate and biodiversity policies or risk rebellions at their next annual meetings.
In a statement, ANZ said its thermal coal mining exposure had reduced significantly, while lending to renewables had increased. Exposures to oil and gas exploration and development has remained relatively flat. 
The bank will update its Climate Change statement https://www.anz.com/content/dam/anzcom/shareholder/ANZ-Climate-Change-Statement-November-2020.pdf with new climate targets in the coming month, a spokesman said. 
Westpac said it only finances emissions-intensive sectors in line with principles aligned with its climate change action plan https://www.westpac.com.au/content/dam/public/wbc/documents/pdf/aw/sustainability/WBC-climate-change-position-statement-2023.pdf, adding that the bank would not ""establish relationships with new thermal coal mining customers"". 
At end-March, mining accounted for about 0.75% of the bank's total loans and lending to oil and gas extraction represented 0.22%, the bank said.
NAB confirmed the resolutions had been tabled without commenting further.

A May report by the International Energy Agency said there should be no more new fossil fuel projects after this year for the world to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050.
Australia, the world's biggest coal exporter and one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita, has not signed up for that target, and this week approved its third coal mine extension in the past month.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Europe's biggest gas firms say the continent's top supplier Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) is fulfilling its long-term contracts yet the Russian energy giant remains at the centre of a dispute about whether it could do more to ease the price pain in a red-hot spot market.
The rocketing gas price, with the European benchmark up almost 600% this year, fuelled by low inventories and surging demand in Asia and elsewhere as economies recover from the COVID-19 crisis, has put Gazprom in Europe's crosshairs.
The Russian gas export pipeline monopoly, which supplies 35% of European needs, insists it is meeting contracted commitments - which top European clients have confirmed to Reuters.
But European politicians, under pressure from consumers who face a huge jump in winter heating bills, say Russia could supply more and is using the gas price spike as leverage in a dispute over the Gazprom-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
""Eni is receiving from Gazprom all the quantity of gas which are nominated within the long-term contracts,"" the Italian firm said in emailed comments, echoing statements sent to Reuters by half a dozen other leading European energy companies.
But European Union politicians still blame Gazprom for stoking the gas price problem, saying it has not responded to surging demand by offering extra volumes to spot market buyers, while they say Europe's other big supplier Norway has done so.
""We are very grateful that Norway is stepping up its production, but this does not seem to be the case in Russia,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday.
EU parliamentarians want Gazprom investigated over possible violations of competition rules. They say it has not sent more gas in a bid to force swift approval for Nord Stream 2, the newly built pipeline that will send Russian gas to Germany but which needs a greenlight before pumping starts.
The project is opposed by the United States and some European nations, saying it will make the EU even more dependant on Russian fuel. Germany has stuck with the plan but a final nod may still be months away.
SPOT MARKET SHIFT
Gazprom, which has no commercial obligation to supply Europe's spot market, has said it was meeting contracted obligations and previously warned Europe that relying on the spot market rather than long-term deals would bring volatility. It declined to make further comment to Reuters for this article.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia was boosting supplies and acting as a reliable partner, but he said the EU erred when it shifted towards a spot market under steps taken years ago.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""As far as I know, Gazprom is in constant contact with its customers in Europe, all permissible additional supply requests are being met by Gazprom.""
Yet, it remains unclear how much more Gazprom can do to boost supplies, with its own inventories running low, output already near historic highs and Russia's winter needs looming.
It is also not clear whether European firms, with long-term contracts, have sought more fuel. When asked by Reuters, European energy firms Wingas and Engie said they had not asked for extra gas, while Eni, Uniper, OMV and RWE did not elaborate apart from saying Gazprom had met contracted commitments.
Two sources at Gazprom said they had not seen any requests for more fuel from spot buyers.
Gazprom figures show its exports outside the former Soviet Union rose 15.3% year on year in the first nine months to 145.8 billion cubic metres (bcm). That includes to Europe and Asia, where an economic surge has sucked in gas for power generation and other uses, much of it in liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes.
Nord Stream 2 will add annual capacity of 55 bcm.
There is, however, little obvious sign of Gazprom racing to pump more to Europe's spot buyers via existing routes: it has only booked about a third of transit capacity offered for October via the Yamal-Europe pipeline and no extra transit capacity via Ukraine. 
""If Gazprom wants to book additional volume, there is plenty available,"" said Xun Peng, a gas analyst with Refinitiv. ""The ones buying gas from the spot market are facing challenges as the current gas price is at a record high.""
CONSTRAINTS
Some spot market figures indicate lower Russian supplies. Gazprom's spot sales in Europe for same-year delivery were 0.5 bcm in July-September this year compared to 3.1 bcm a year ago, when European economies were still on their backs, said Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch ratings agency.
""It is not fully clear whether Gazprom's modest exports level is a result of production constraints at home or an attempt to ensure a stronger demand once Nord Stream 2 is up and running,"" he said.
European gas prices eased in August when Gazprom said it aimed to ship 5.6 bcm via Nord Stream 2 this year, but rose when that looked in doubt as approvals lagged. Whether or not those flows could now be sent via other routes is still uncertain.
""On the second quarter call, management stated that opening of the Nord Stream 2 this fall wouldn't actually make much of a difference in export volumes, which implies redirection of existing gas flows,"" said Ronald Smith, senior analyst at BCS Global Markets.
Any extra supply could help cool European prices, he said: ""When under stress, such as now, a modest addition to supply could have an outsized impact on gas prices.""
But Gazprom might not have much room for manoeuvre. Smith said Gazprom's production was already running near its peak of just over 1.5 bcm per day. The company does not provide monthly data.

Meanwhile, Gazprom's storage in north-western Europe holds almost 70% less gas than a year ago, Refinitiv data shows.
This may mean Europe faces tighter times ahead. ""We see a risk that, given Gazprom's exceptionally low inventory levels in north-western Europe, the company would not be able to meet its contractual obligations during the winter,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.

948,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2021 02:02AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; U.S. Debt Talks and Easing Energy Prices Help,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday, continuing the week’s volatile trading with sentiment boosted by falling energy costs and signs of compromise in Washington over averting a U.S. default.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 1.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 1.2%.
European markets are likely to benefit Thursday from the abrupt reversal on Wall Street late Wednesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average overturning a loss of over 400 points to close 100 points higher, as concerns about the lack of a debt ceiling deal eased.
This followed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offering a short-term suspension of the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a national default -- which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has recently said would result in a financial crisis and recession -- until a more permanent solution can be found before the end of the year.
Earlier in the day, a stronger than expected report on private payrolls indicated that the economy still has enough momentum to allow the Federal Reserve to start reducing its bond purchases in November, as expected
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes has since fallen back to 1.54%, down from Wednesday's three month high of 1.57%.
Also helping the tone in Europe Thursday has been the move lower in energy prices, with crude falling off multi-year highs after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stocks raised concerns over demand in the world’s largest consumer.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $77.06 a barrel, having hit a seven-year high on Wednesday, while the Brent contract was flat at $81.09, after posting a three-year high in the previous session.
Gas prices also fell from all-time highs, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country was ready to supply more natural gas to head off a growing energy crisis.
That said, there was some disappointing economic news Thursday, as German industrial production slumped 4.0% on the month in August, a hefty drop from the 1.0% gain seen in July. This follows Wednesday’s sharp 7.7% fall in factory orders, and points to the difficulties Europe’s largest economy has been having with supply chain constraints.
Elsewhere, speeches from European Central Bank members Philip Lane and Frank Elderson are likely to be studied following talk that the central bank is studying a new bond-buying program to prevent any market turmoil when emergency purchases get phased out next year.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,758.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1550.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Northvolt plans to invest $750 million expanding its laboratory facility in Sweden, a top executive said, to meet soaring demand for lithium-ion batteries as carmakers go electric.
As it aims to take on major Asian players such as CATL and LG Chem, Northvolt said it would set up the ""first R&D campus covering the entire battery ecosystem"".
Northvolt, which plans to start production this year at its gigafactory in Sweden's Skelleftea, plans to build a new office in Vasteras, increase headcount there to at least 1,000 from 400, and create a centre for customers to experiment with battery technologies and electrification.
China is currently home to some 80% of lithium-ion cell production, but with demand soaring, capacity in Europe is set to expand quickly and Northvolt is targeting a 25% market share in Europe by 2030.
""The development in Vasteras is the funnel right now that will enable us to do that land grab,"" Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson told Reuters, adding that this would require it to hire around 5,000 engineers within five years.
""I have some slide presentation on the very early concepts ... we hadn't chosen Vasteras then but we had a first budget of 80 million dollars,"" Carlsson said in an interview.
European carmakers are looking to use batteries from Northvolt for their electric vehicles to rival those from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is building its own factory in Germany.

Backed by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Scania, the European Commission and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) founder Daniel Ek, Northvolt has raised funding of more than $6.5 billion, with nearly $20 billion in orders from the biggest automakers.
A source said in June that its latest fundraising had valued Northvolt at $11.75 billion. Electric vehicle and related sectors have been a big draw for investors, who have driven up the valuations of pioneers such as Tesla and Lucid Motors.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - DuckDuckGo and three other search engine rivals to Google on Thursday urged EU lawmakers to take action against the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit via new tech rules, saying they have yet to see positive results from an antitrust ruling against Google.
The European Commission in 2018 levied a record 4.24- billion-euro ($5 billion) fine on Google for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine and ordered it to ensure a level playing field for rivals.
Google subsequently made changes and four months ago said it would let rivals compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe.
U.S. search engine DuckDuckGo, Germany's Ecosia and French peers Qwant and Lilo said lawmakers should use tech rules drafted by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to ensure competition.
""Despite recent changes, we do not believe it will move market share significantly due to its persisting limitations,"" they said in a joint letter to European Parliament lawmakers.
They said a preference menu that let users choose their search default when setting up an Android device is not available on Chrome desktop or on other operating systems, and that it is only shown once to users. 
""The DMA should enshrine in law a requirement for a search engine preference menu that would effectively ban Google from acquiring default search access points of the operating systems and the browsers of gatekeepers,"" they said. 

The DMA may come into force in 2023 once it gets the green light from EU lawmakers and EU countries.

The gap between putting in a semiconductor order and taking delivery, known as the lead time in the industry, rose another five days in September to an average of 21.7 weeks, according to research by Susquehanna Financial Group. That wait has increased for nine months in a row and is by far the longest since the firm began tracking the data in 2017.
Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland wrote that microcontroller lead times rose sharply again, an ominous sign for automakers that have been hard hit by the crunch. Key suppliers such as  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc., Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies AG, ON Semiconductor Corp., Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) Inc. all posted their highest lead times on record.
“Recent distributor checks suggest no stabilization in 2021, with perhaps China power outages creating new bottlenecks in the supply chain,” Rolland wrote.
Semiconductor shortages have hammered automakers just as the integration of new technology and the transition to electric vehicles become key competitive battlegrounds. AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, estimated last month that the global automotive industry will lose about $210 billion in sales for 2021 alone.

Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd will open the first 7-Eleven round-the-clock convenience store in a neighbourhood in India's financial capital of Mumbai on Oct. 9.
The deal marks the latest by the Reliance Group, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, to rapidly expand its retail and e-commerce businesses to better compete with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Flipkart in India's nearly trillion-dollar retail market.
The oil-to-telecoms conglomerate's $3.4 billion deal for the retail assets of Future Group has been stalled following Amazon's legal challenge. 
Irving, Texas-based 7-Eleven Inc, known for its iconic products including the Slurpee, operates and franchises more than 77,000 stores in 18 countries and regions. 
Future Retail said on Tuesday it had mutually terminated an agreement with 7-Eleven as the companies were not able to meet targets of opening stores and paying franchisee fees.
In 2019, Future Retail - India's second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, including the popular Big Bazaar supermarkets and local chains Food Hall and Nilgiris - had said it plans to set up 7-Eleven stores from scratch and convert some of its existing operations into the U.S. brand.

Investing.com –  Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd . (HK:0127) shares jumped as much as 31% on Thursday after the former major shareholder in China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) proposed to go private for a HK$1.91 billion ($245.30 million) price tag.
China Estates' Hong Kong shares soared 30.69% to HK$3.79 by 12:37 AM ET (4:37 AM GMT).
The privatization offer comes from Solar Bright Ltd., which is backed by the family of Chinese Estates' biggest shareholder Joseph Lau. Chinese Estates’ proposal will offer minority shareholders HK$4 apiece, a 38% premium to the developer's last traded price.
Chinese Estates was the second-largest shareholder in China Evergrande with a 6.48% stake, before selling it down since August 2021 to the 4.39% it holds as of Thursday. Lau, Chinese Estates' former chairman, is a member of a ‘poker club’ of Hong Kong tycoons that included China Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan. China Evergrande, meanwhile, continues to deal with its debt woes.
Chinese Estate shares have been suspended from trading since Sep. 29 and were down 42% in 2021 before the suspension. A privatization would reduce the costs and management resources needed for listing, and could provide more flexibility to implement long-term business strategies."

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Members of the union representing locked-out workers at  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s Beaumont, Texas, refinery have submitted a petition to force a vote on removing the union, the union and company said on Wednesday.
Exxon and the local United Steelworkers union said they were notified by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board, which will oversee the vote, that a petition calling for removal had been filed. It was unclear when the vote would occur.
The union represents 650 workers who have been locked out of their jobs since May 1, following failure to reach a new contract after the previous one expired in February. 
At least 30% of the members must sign the petition for the decertification vote to take place. Decertification is the formal name for the removal process. 
""You've got people that have been locked out for six months, it's getting pretty tough,"" Bryan Gross, USW international representative, said about the petition. 
""The company respects employee choice and believes in the value of a direct relationship between the company and employees, without a third party union,"" Exxon said in a message to Beaumont employees, as confirmed by an Exxon spokesperson.
The USW in April filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging Exxon had violated federal law by providing an employee with decertification materials, employee email addresses and use of a company computer and email system to campaign for decertification. 

The petition comes a week after Exxon made its first concession at the bargaining table when it offered greater seniority and job security protection for the lube oil plant workers.
Exxon said it began the lockout to avoid the disruption of a possible strike. The USW said the company's contract proposal would wipe out seniority and create separate contracts for the workers at the refinery and the adjoining lubricant oil plant.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note edged up, and U.S. shares were up, as progress was made on a possible deal to boost the debt ceiling into December 2021. Although a deal would alleviate the immediate risk of default, tensions between the Democrats and Republicans are far from resolved.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 09:23PM ET</span>",A Chilean tree holds hope for new vaccines - if supplies last,"By Aislinn Laing and Allison Martell
CASABLANCA, Chile (Reuters) -Down a dusty farm track in Chilean wine country, behind a wooden gate wrapped in chains, forestry experts are nursing a plantation of saplings whose bark holds the promise of potent vaccines.
Quillay trees, technically known as Quillaja saponaria, are rare evergreens native to Chile that have long been used by the indigenous Mapuche people to make soap and medicine. In recent years, they have also been used to make a highly successful vaccine against shingles and the world’s first malaria vaccine, as well as foaming agents for products in the food, beverage and mining industries.
Now two saponin molecules, made from the bark of branches pruned from older trees in Chile’s forests, are being used for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by drugmaker  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. The chemicals are used to make adjuvant, a substance that boosts the immune system.
Over the next two years, Maryland-based Novavax plans to produce billions of doses of the vaccine, mostly for low- and middle-income countries, which would make it one of the largest COVID-19 vaccine suppliers in the world.
With no reliable data on how many healthy quillay trees are left in Chile, experts and industry officials are divided on how quickly the supply of older trees will be depleted by rising demand. But nearly everyone agrees that industries relying on quillay extracts will at some point need to switch to plantation-grown trees or a lab-grown alternative.
A Reuters analysis of export data from trade data provider ImportGenius shows that the supply of older trees is under increasing pressure. Exports of quillay products more than tripled to more than 3,600 tonnes per year in the decade before the pandemic.
Ricardo San Martin, who developed the pruning and extraction process that created the modern quillay industry, said producers must immediately work toward making quillay products from younger, plantation-grown trees.
“My estimate four years ago was that we were heading towards the sustainability limit,” he said.
San Martin said he has toiled through the COVID-19 pandemic in the basement of his oceanfront cabin in Sea Ranch, California, to refine a process that could help produce saponins from leaves and twigs in order to maximize the yield.
“I am working as though this needs to be done yesterday,” said San Martin, who is also sponsoring a project in which drones would count quillay trees in remote and hard-to-access forests, to determine how many are left.
Quillay producers and their customers say the harvest can continue for now without decimating the supply of older trees.
“We continue to monitor the situation in Chile, in close collaboration with our supplier, but at this time we are confident in our supply,” Novavax said in a statement to Reuters. The company also said it was confident that uses such as “life-saving vaccines will be prioritized.”
The desert-plant extract company Desert King International Ltd, which runs the Casablanca plantation, is Novavax’s sole supplier of quillay extracts and Chile’s largest quillay exporter by far.
The company’s manager in Chile, Andres Gonzalez, told Reuters it is set to produce enough quillay extract from older trees to make up to 4.4 billion vaccine doses in 2022. With new supplies from privately owned native forests, they have enough raw material to meet demand for the rest of this year and part of next, he said.
Gonzalez said the company, where San Martin is a consultant, has built a new production plant and has the capacity to supply other interested pharmaceutical firms - all without harming the forests.
He acknowledged, however, that “at some point these native forests will come to an end.”
“We want to start having very productive plantations, and we are working on that,"" he said.
A relatively small volume of quillay extract is required to make vaccines - just under one milligram per dose - but the supply is stretched by the demand from other industries. Quillay products are used, for instance, as a natural additive in animal feed, a biopesticide and an agent to reduce pollution in mining.
Individual quillay trees grow outside of Chile, but Chile is the only country where mature quillay is harvested from forests in large quantities.
AN ELUSIVE INGREDIENT
Novavax’s adjuvant, known as Matrix-M, contains two key saponin molecules. One of those, called QS-21, is more difficult to access because it is found mainly in trees that are at least 10 years old. 
Among major pharmaceutical companies, only GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) PLC and Novavax have bet heavily on QS-21, a relatively new pharmaceutical ingredient.
GSK’s highly successful vaccine against shingles, Shingrix, and several other promising experimental vaccines contain QS-21 supplied by Desert King. In a statement, GSK said it has “no specific challenges relating to sustainable supply” of QS-21.
The quillay-based adjuvant used in Shingrix is also part of the world’s first malaria vaccine, Mosquirix. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it should be widely given to African children, marking what could be a major advance against malaria.
No other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are relying on quillay bark extracts. Some drugmakers are developing synthetic alternatives, but these could be years from regulatory approval. Switching out the ingredients in any existing vaccine would require new clinical studies to prove the product is safe and effective.
The Massachusetts-based pharmaceutical company Agenus (NASDAQ:AGEN) stopped selling bark-derived QS-21 several years ago to focus full-time on trying to grow it from quillay plant cells in a laboratory.
“The shortage of QS-21 has been an issue for a while,” said Jason Paragas, Agenus vice president of strategic initiatives and growth exploration. “We saw it before COVID, and we made the hard decision that we had to change.”
Paragas said it is too soon to say when an alternative could be ready.
Entrepreneur Gaston Salinas said his Davis, California-based startup Botanical Solution Inc can already produce QS-21 from quillay tissue starting with seeds in the lab, and aims to eventually produce the chemical on a large scale to supply pharmaceutical companies.
“You cannot afford to over-exploit the native Chilean forest because of a desire to develop modern vaccines. You need to find other ways to develop your products, even if it’s something so important, ” he said.
AN EYE TOWARD THE FUTURE
Inside the gate of the carefully guarded Desert King plantation, gardeners carefully tend to the young trees using fertilizers and bountiful supplies of water. They were cloned from full-grown cousins whose dusty gray bark was especially rich in saponins.
If all goes well, the plantation could be producing for one customer in two to three years, according to Desert King’s business development manager Damian Hiley. He declined to name the company.
Desert King has its eye on future vaccines, some already in the works.
In early 2020, for instance, GSK licensed an experimental tuberculosis vaccine that contains GSK’s QS-21-based adjuvant to the Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. It showed promising results in a mid-stage trial.
And in April, researchers at Oxford University announced that a new malaria vaccine containing Novavax’s Matrix-M adjuvant appeared to be highly effective in a trial involving 450 children in Burkina Faso.

Gustavo Cruz, a researcher at the University of Chile who worked with San Martin to industrialize production of quillay, said he generally trusts quillay producers to manage supply and demand. He is more worried about other threats - specifically drought and fire.
“The trees do eventually regrow,” he said, “but there comes a time when they don't anymore.”

961,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 09:22PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate appears near temporary truce in debt-ceiling standoff,"By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate appeared near to a temporary deal to avert a federal debt default in the next two weeks, after Democrats said on Wednesday they might accept a Republican proposal to defuse the partisan standoff that threatens the broader economy.
Democrats called off an early afternoon vote after the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, floated a plan that would buy more time to resolve the issue. McConnell proposed that his party would allow an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December.
Without congressional action to raise the $28.4 trillion debt limit, the Treasury Department has forecast that it will run out of ways to meet all its obligations by Oct. 18.
Several Democrats said they would accept that offer. ""We intend to take this temporary victory,"" Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin said on CNN.
But without a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, it was not clear whether that was the party's official stance, and the White House did not commit to the idea.
The White House has yet to receive a formal offer, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. 
Still, Democrats would have to address the issue again in December, just as federal funding is due to expire. That could complicate their efforts to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of Biden's domestic agenda. 
Republicans said Democrats could use the intervening weeks to pass a longer debt-ceiling extension through a complex process called reconciliation, which Democrats have dismissed as too cumbersome and risky. McConnell said Republicans would make concessions to help speed the process up.
There are less than two weeks to go before the Treasury Department expects to run out of ways to meet the government's expenses. The Bipartisan Policy Center said on Wednesday that unemployment insurance payments, salaries for millions of federal employees and medical insurance payments could be delayed without a debt-ceiling hike.
Republicans had been expected to block the bill that was up for a vote on Wednesday, which suspended the debt limit until December 2022, after the midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress for the next two years.
Analysts say a default could upend the global financial system and cause millions of lost jobs.
Even a close call would likely be damaging. A 2011 debt ceiling dispute that Congress resolved two days before the borrowing limit was due to be reached caused stocks to tumble and prompted a first-ever credit downgrade for U.S. debt.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service said on Tuesday it expects Washington will ultimately raise the debt limit, however, and U.S. stock indexes rose on Wednesday as investors grew more optimistic that Congress could reach a deal. (N)
A more telling indication of investor relief was evident in the U.S. Treasury market, which would be directly affected by a U.S. default. Rates on 1-month T-bills - the securities most likely to be impaired by a failure of the government to pay interest or principal on the debt immediately after the deadline - dropped sharply in an indication that investors were again willing to buy them. [US/]
Democrats had considered other options to resolve the standoff.

Biden said on Tuesday that Democrats might weaken a long-standing rule, known as the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation in the 100-seat Senate.
But that notion seemed to fade on Wednesday, as a key centrist Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin, said he would not support it.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 09:16PM ET</span>",WHO backs malaria vaccine rollout for Africa's children in major breakthrough,"By Maggie Fick and Aaron Ross
NAIROBI (Reuters) -The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday the only approved vaccine against malaria should be widely given to African children, potentially marking a major advance against a disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people annually. 
The WHO recommendation is for RTS,S - or Mosquirix - a vaccine developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).
Since 2019, 2.3 million doses of Mosquirix have been administered to infants in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in a large-scale pilot programme coordinated by the WHO. The majority of those whom the disease kills are under age five.
That programme followed a decade of clinical trials in seven African countries.
""This is a vaccine developed in Africa by African scientists and we're very proud,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 
""Using this vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year,"" he added, referring to anti-malaria measures like bed nets and spraying to kill mosquitoes that transmit the disease. 
One of the ingredients in the Mosquirix vaccine is sourced from a rare evergreen native to Chile called a Quillay tree. Reuters reported on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chilean-tree-holds-hope-new-vaccines-if-supplies-last-2021-10-06 that the long-term supply of these trees is in question. 
Malaria is far more deadly than COVID-19 in Africa. It killed 386,000 Africans in 2019, according to a WHO estimate, compared with 212,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the past 18 months. 
The WHO says 94% of malaria cases and deaths occur in Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people. The preventable disease is caused by parasites transmitted to people by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms include fever, vomiting and fatigue. 
The vaccine's effectiveness at preventing severe cases of malaria in children is only around 30%, but it is the only approved vaccine. The European Union's drugs regulator approved it in 2015, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.
""This is how we fight malaria, layering imperfect tools on top of each other,"" said Ashley Birkett, who leads global malaria vaccine work at Path, a non-profit global health organization that has funded development of the vaccine with GSK and the three-country pilot.
Another vaccine against malaria called R21/Matrix-M that was developed by scientists at Britain's University of Oxford showed up to 77% efficacy in a year-long study involving 450 children in Burkina Faso, researchers said in April. It is still in the trial stages.
GSK welcomed the WHO recommendation. 
""This long-awaited landmark decision can reinvigorate the fight against malaria in the region at a time when progress on malaria control has stalled,"" Thomas Breuer, GSK's chief global health officer, said in a statement. 
GSK shares held steady in New York following the announcement, which came after the close of trading in its London-listed shares. 
FUNDING CHALLENGE
The recommendation was jointly announced in Geneva by the WHO's top advisory bodies for malaria and immunization, the Malaria Policy Advisory Group and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.
Experts said the challenge now would be mobilising financing for production and distribution of the vaccine to some of the world's poorest countries. 
GSK has to date committed to produce 15 million doses of Mosquirix annually up to 2028 at a cost of production plus no more than 5% margin. 
A global market study led by the WHO this year projected demand for a malaria vaccine would be 50 to 110 million doses per year by 2030 if it is deployed in areas with moderate to high transmission of the disease.
The GAVI vaccine alliance, a global public-private partnership, will consider in December whether and how to finance the vaccination programme. 
""As we've seen from the COVID vaccine, where there is political will, there is funding available to ensure that vaccines are scaled to the level they are needed,"" said Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. 
A source familiar with planning for the vaccine’s development said the price per dose was not yet set, but would be confirmed after GAVI's funding decision and once there is a clear sense of demand. 
The WHO's decision had personal meaning for Dr. Rose Jalong'o, a vaccinology specialist at the Kenyan health ministry.

""I suffered from malaria as a child, and during my internship, and during my clinical years I attended to children in hospital because of severe malaria who needed blood transfusion and unfortunately some of them died,"" she said.
""It's a disease I have grown up with and, seeing all this in my lifetime, it's an exciting time.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday as investors grew more optimistic that congressional Democrats and Republicans could reach a deal to avert a government debt default.
Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said his party would support an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December. This would head off a historic default that would exact a heavy economic toll.
""McConnell made some dovish comments about temporarily extending the debt ceiling,"" said Jay Hatfield, founder and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. ""That's going to be interpreted in the short-run as positive.""
McConnell's offer could provide an off-ramp to a months-long standoff between President Joe Biden's Democrats and McConnell's Republicans, who had been expected on Wednesday to block a third attempt by Senate Democrats to raise the $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.

(Reuters) - IAC's digital media arm Dotdash on Wednesday agreed to buy Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Corp in a deal valued at about $2.7 billion, bringing titles such as People, Allrecipes and Investopedia under one umbrella.
The combined company is to be called Dotdash Meredith and will be led by Dotdash top boss Neil Vogel, the companies said.
The deal will combine Meredith's more than 40 brands including Better Homes & Gardens, Southern Living and InStyle magazines with Dotdash's digital labels such as The Spruce, Byrdie and Brides.
In June, Meredith had accepted a revised proposal from broadcast firm Gray Television (NYSE:GTN) Inc to buy Meredith's television stations business for about $2.83 billion.
Dotdash will buy the remaining portion of Meredith, primarily its magazines unit National Media Group, in an all-cash transaction of $42.18 per share.
On its own, Dotdash currently reaches about 100 million online consumers monthly and its collection of 14 media brands in health, finance and lifestyle are among the fastest growing media brands online. It is one of the rapidly expanding businesses in parent IAC's portfolio.
Television mogul Barry Diller-owned IAC, which is known to build businesses and later list them on the stock market, has successfully spun off online video platform  Vimeo  (NASDAQ:VMEO) and Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH), owner of online dating services including Tinder and Hinge.
Shares of IAC were up 6.7% at $140.55, while those of Meredith rose 5% to $57.7 in extended trading.

The deal comes four years after Meredith, backed by conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, acquired Time Inc https://reut.rs/3atR00Z, the publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines.
The publisher has since sold some titles like Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated that primarily attracted male readership as it turned its focus on its core women's magazines.

Lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee did not focus on the Big Tech markets, which have received huge amounts of public attention, but asked about a range of industries. In response to each, Kanter pledged vigorous enforcement of antitrust law.
Kanter showed enthusiasm when asked about the labor market, where non-compete agreements and other issues have come under criticism for making it harder for workers to leave their jobs for a higher salary or better conditions.
He said that once confirmed he was ""eager"" to work on the issue. 
If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, Kanter will take the reins of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division amid calls for tougher enforcement overall, with special criticism aimed at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
The department has sued Google and is investigating Apple for violations of antitrust law.

Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Google, which the Justice Department sued last year alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals.
The Biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise, Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan to be a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission.

The FTC commissioners, who often split along party lines, voted 5-0 to use a dormant penalty authority against any school that, for example, overstated how likely it was that graduates would get jobs and how much they could hope to earn.
The notices were sent to schools https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/penalty-offenses-concerning-education/higher_ed_notice_recipient_list.pdf that included ""the largest for-profit colleges and vocational schools"" in the United States, the agency said in a statement, while adding that a school receiving a letter was not an indication of wrongdoing. 
Complaints about for-profit schools rose some 70% between 2018 and 2020, the agency said. 
The notices echo an effort by the Obama administration to pursue for-profit schools whose former students have high loan default rates. At least one chain of schools, Corinthian Colleges, collapsed when its students were denied access to federal student loans.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 06:46PM ET</span>",How AT&T helped build far-right One America News,"By John Shiffman
SAN DIEGO (Reuters) -One America News, the far-right network whose fortunes and viewership rose amid the triumph and tumult of the Trump administration, has flourished with support from a surprising source: AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the world's largest communications company.
A Reuters review of court records shows the role AT&T played in creating and funding OAN, a network that continues to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and the COVID-19 pandemic.
OAN founder and chief executive Robert Herring Sr has testified that the inspiration to launch OAN in 2013 came from AT&T executives.
“They told us they wanted a conservative network,” Herring said during a 2019 deposition seen by Reuters. “They only had one, which was Fox News, and they had seven others on the other [leftwing] side. When they said that, I jumped to it and built one.”
Since then, AT&T has been a crucial source of funds flowing into OAN, providing tens of millions of dollars in revenue, court records show. Ninety percent of OAN’s revenue came from a contract with AT&T-owned television platforms, including satellite broadcaster DirecTV, according to 2020 sworn testimony by an OAN accountant.
Herring has testified he was offered $250 million for OAN in 2019. Without the DirecTV deal, the accountant said under oath, the network’s value “would be zero.”
Dallas-based AT&T, a mobile-phone and Internet provider, also owns entertainment giant Warner Media, which includes CNN and HBO. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 and in August spun off the satellite service, retaining a 70% share in the new, independently managed company. AT&T’s total U.S. television subscriber base, including satellite and streaming services, fell from 26 million in 2015 to 15.4 million as of August.
AT&T spokesman Jim Greer declined to comment on the testimony about OAN’s revenue streams, citing confidentiality agreements. He said that DirecTV broadcasts “many news channels that offer viewpoints across the political spectrum.”
“We have always sought to provide a wide variety of content and programming that would be of interest to customers, and do not dictate or control programming on channels we carry,” Greer said. “Any suggestion otherwise is wrong.”
After this story was published, AT&T issued a statement saying it has “never had a financial interest in OAN's success and does not 'fund' OAN.”
Although the contracts are confidential, in court filings Herring cited monthly fees included in one five-year deal with AT&T. According to an AT&T filing citing Herring’s numbers, those fees would total about $57 million. Greer said that figure is inaccurate, but declined to say how much AT&T has paid to air OAN, citing a non-disclosure agreement.
Herring and his adult sons own and operate OAN, a subsidiary of their closely held San Diego-based Herring Networks. Their AT&T deal includes Herring’s other network, a little-watched lifestyle channel, AWE. The Herrings declined interview requests.
Herring, who just turned 80, is a self-made businessman who amassed a fortune in the circuit board industry, then turned to television and boxing promotion. OAN’s influence rose in late 2015, when it began covering Trump rallies live, at a time when some of the media still saw the New York celebrity businessman as a longshot presidential contender. The network continues to shower Trump with attention and often provides a friendly platform for his Republican allies.
As president, Trump frequently urged supporters to watch OAN. In his final two years in office, Trump touted the network, known as @OANN online, to his 88 million Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers at least 120 times.
“Hope everybody is watching @OANN right now,” Trump tweeted on December 1, citing a dubious report about a truck carrying more than 100,000 fake ballots. “Other media afraid to show.”
The state and federal court documents reviewed by Reuters detail a lucrative relationship for OAN with AT&T, even as the two occasionally tangled in court.
The records include a reported offer by AT&T to acquire a 5% equity stake in OAN and AWE, though the two sides ultimately signed a different deal. The court filings also cite a promise by OAN to “cast a positive light” on AT&T during newscasts.
The confidential OAN financial records are drawn in part from testimony, including by Herring and the accountant, generated during a labor lawsuit brought against OAN by a former employee and unrelated to AT&T. When that case went to trial last year, the network’s lawyer told the jury that AT&T was keeping OAN afloat.
“If Herring Networks, for instance, was to lose or not be renewed on DirecTV, the company would go out of business tomorrow,” OAN lawyer Patrick Nellies told the court, a transcript shows.
Researchers who tracked the rise of conservative media pillars Rush Limbaugh and Fox News see similarities between those pioneers to One America News and other new rightwing networks, particularly during their formative years.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said the births of Fox News and OAN share common threads: money and opportunity. She noted that the late Republican operative Roger Ailes had the foresight in the 1990s to recommend that Fox create a conservative news network.
“If somebody recognizes there’s a market for something and there’s a lot of money attached to that market, you get a news outlet,” Jamieson said. “So this is AT&T playing the Roger Ailes role.”
Greer, the AT&T spokesman, called that comparison “a ridiculous claim,” noting that other distributors also carry OAN.
A BOOST FROM THE INSURRECTION
America’s post-election turmoil, punctuated by the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, continues to roil the country. Dozens of election administrators in battleground states Trump lost have received a barrage of death threats, Reuters has reported. A Reuters poll in May showed that a quarter of Americans – and 53% of Republicans – wrongly believe Trump won the 2020 election.
OAN caters to this audience. Trump’s loss was OAN’s gain, social media data show.
The network’s online audience soared in November, after conservative mainstay and OAN competitor Fox News affirmed Joe Biden’s victory. Trump and his camp blasted Fox. A record 767,000 people installed the OAN app that month, nine times as many as in October, according to data firm Sensor Tower. In January, Trump supporters, including at least one carrying an OAN flag, stormed the U.S. Capitol. That month, app installs spiked again to 517,000.
The OAN website averages 8 million visits a month from desktop and mobile users, having peaked at 15 million from November through January, data firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB) found in an analysis for Reuters. Two in three people on desktop computers return to the website after an initial visit, about the same loyalty rate as Fox News and Newsmax, another rival conservative news channel.
One America’s television ratings are harder to measure, partly because it is available in only about a quarter of the estimated 121 million TV households in the United States. Ratings services Nielsen and Comscore, which both show that Fox News continues to be the leading cable network, do not release OAN figures. In an internal email, an OAN news director told staff that the week of the Capitol assault produced the network’s “best ever” ratings, but gave no statistics.
OAN says it is the fourth-rated news network, behind Fox, CNN and MSNBC, and ahead of CNBC, the BBC and Newsmax, but has not provided figures to back this up. (Each of these networks, including One America News, pays Reuters fees to publish the news service’s stories, videos and/or pictures.)
Even so, the number of viewers OAN reaches may be less important than the kind of observers it attracts and galvanizes, said John Watson, an American University journalism professor specializing in ethics and media law.
“If you have 12 Americans being fed a diet of untruth, that’s 12 too many – and here, it’s literally millions,” Watson said of the OAN audience. “When you have that sort of poisonous influence on mass media, it’s a problem; because elections in the United States tend to be so close, a few percentage points here or there can really make a difference.”
At least one self-described regular OAN viewer recently sent a threatening note to an election official. In August, Sheila Garcia of Riverside County, California, sent Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold a scathing message. Biden beat Trump in Colorado, and Garcia accused Griswold, the state’s top election official, of treason – warning her that punishments for that crime are hanging and legal injection. “Within several months you will have to decide between the two,” Garcia wrote.
In an interview, Griswold said she considered threats like Garcia's message a credible threat on her life. That threat and dozens of others caused her to seek extra security measures, she said.
Garcia, 55, told Reuters she’s convinced Biden stole the election and said she gets most of her news from OAN. She compared U.S. mainstream media to state propaganda outlets in China and Cuba. Her message to Griswold, she said, was legal. “If you're afraid of a little old lady in a trailer park in California, I feel sorry for you,” she said in an interview.
Neil W. McCabe, OAN’s former Washington bureau chief and now national political correspondent for The Tennessee Star, rejects the idea that the network is a toxic influence. He said OAN serves an important public role and has earned loyalty from viewers who share a similar world view.
“When you give a voice to the voiceless, you’re going to bond with them,” McCabe told Reuters. “Who else is doing these stories?”
In several instances, records show, the network broadcast statements and theories that were proven false.
YouTube suspended OAN from making money off its YouTube channel last year for, among other things, repeatedly violating its COVID-19 policy, which prohibits content claiming there’s a guaranteed cure. OAN touts hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug promoted by Trump, without scientific evidence, as a cure for COVID.
During last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, OAN aired an unconfirmed report that an elderly demonstrator in Buffalo, New York, who was knocked down and seriously injured by police was trying to jam the cops’ radios. Trump, citing the OAN story, tweeted that the man “could be an ANTIFA provocateur.”
The false accusation went viral. In the two days after the OAN broadcast, one-third of all online references cited the network, an analysis compiled by Zignal Labs for Reuters found.
On January 6, after Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol, an OAN news director cautioned staff via email, “Please DO NOT say ‘Trump Supporters Storm Capitol …’ Simply call them demonstrators or protestors … DO NOT CALL IT A RIOT!!!”
A day later, Herring suggested the riot might be a false-flag operation by the leftwing Antifa movement. “We want to report all the things Antifa did yesterday. I don’t think it was Trump people but lets investigate,” he emailed OAN producers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation says there is no evidence of Antifa involvement in the riot. All but a handful of the some 600 suspects charged so far have been rightwing Trump backers.
The next day, Herring tweeted: “If anyone thinks we will throw the best President America has had, in my 79 years, under the bus, you are wrong. We will continue to give him honest coverage.”
His network went on to support Trump in an unusual way: OAN allowed two reporters to raise $605,000 to help fund a “private” audit of the presidential vote in Arizona, despite Republican officials’ assurances that Biden won the state. According to an OAN executive, they did so with the network’s blessing but in a private capacity.
One of the OAN reporters, Christina Bobb, also worked part-time for the Trump recount legal team, according to a recent deposition by Trump’s then-lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. An OAN executive confirmed the arrangement. Bobb, a lawyer and former Trump administration official, did not reply to a request for comment.
Five former OAN producers said in interviews that they found the practice of reporters raising funds for events they cover unethical, but said OAN’s move did not surprise them.
“If there was any story involving Trump, we had to only focus on either the positive information or basically create positive information,” said Marissa Gonzales, an OAN producer from 2019 until she resigned in 2020. “It was never, never the full truth.”
Since March, OAN has sold hours of infomercial time to MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a leading purveyor of false claims the election was stolen. Lindell has used that time on OAN to repeatedly broadcast his election conspiracy “docu-movies.” A primary Lindell target is Dominion Voting Systems Inc, whose machines count votes in 28 states and use paper ballots and records for auditing.
In August, Dominion sued OAN for defamation. “OAN saw a business opportunity” and fueled bogus conspiracies about alleged vote tampering, Dominion contended. “OAN helped create and cultivate an alternate reality where up is down, pigs have wings,” the lawsuit said.
The network’s lawyers have said in letters to Dominion that the election coverage is protected free speech and that the Lindell programs include a disclaimer that they are “opinions only and are not intended to be taken or interpreted by the viewer as established facts.”
Other Trump supporters, including Lindell and lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell, offered a similar free speech defense in related lawsuits brought by Dominion. In August, a federal judge said the Lindell, Giuliani and Powell cases should proceed toward trial, noting that the Constitution does not necessarily offer “blanket immunity for statements that are political in nature.”
Generally, the network runs few commercials compared to its competitors, and former bureau chief McCabe said the paucity of advertising is a kind of superpower. The network’s reliance on fees from cable, satellite and streaming providers, instead of commercials, inoculates it from advertiser boycotts faced by counterparts such as Fox News and rightwing online news site Breitbart, in McCabe’s view.
“Because they basically live off the cable and satellite fees, nobody can organize a protest against One America News,” McCabe said.
AT&T & OAN: ORIGIN STORY
From the early 1970s to the late 1990s, Robert Herring Sr, with sons Charles and Robert Jr, created highly successful and profitable circuit board companies. They sold one such business in 1988 for about $52 million and another two in 2000 for $122 million.
In 2004, they created a television network called WealthTV, a channel dedicated to affluent lifestyles – yachts, mega-mansions and private jets.
It proved to be a tough sell. Most cable and satellite providers declined to carry it, even when the Herrings offered WealthTV at a discount, or even for free, just to get it on air. “We went to every place you could think of, begging to get on,” Herring said last year on his network.
In 2007 and 2008, Herring petitioned the Federal Communications Commission and courts for help, alleging that the large cable providers favored networks they owned or co-owned, discriminating against independent broadcasters like him. The providers countered that they had the right to broadcast channels they believed provided the best content.
The FCC concluded that the providers had exercised appropriate business discretion and a federal court affirmed that decision. The Herring litigation irritated some providers, lawyers for two carriers told Reuters, making it even harder to get WealthTV on cable or satellite.
Still, the Herrings say they developed a good relationship with AT&T, which began carrying WealthTV in 2006 through U-verse, an Internet set-top box service that can access live TV and video on demand. By 2012, WealthTV had evolved, carrying news updates and live boxing. The Herrings were keen to leverage their existing production facilities in San Diego to launch a second network, either a boxing channel or news outlet.
In a pivotal moment for the company, the Herrings say in court filings, depositions and sworn statements, unidentified AT&T executives told them there was an audience for another conservative news network. Herring seized the opportunity.
In his 2019 deposition in the labor suit unrelated to AT&T, the elder Herring said he created OAN for two reasons.
“To make money, number one,” Robert Herring said. “But number two, is that AT&T told us … they wanted a conservative network.”
The lawyer questioning Herring, Rodney Diggs, followed up.
“So,” the lawyer said, “AT&T kind of dictated the kind of network that they wanted. Because there was an opportunity, you jumped at it?”
“Yes, sir,” Herring replied.
EQUITY, CELEBRATION, SURPRISE
A few months after launching OAN in July 2013, AT&T proposed acquiring a 5% stake in Herring Networks.
In a sworn statement, OAN president Charles Herring said he accepted the oral offer in October 2013. Emails show that the two sides executed a non-disclosure agreement that December and that AT&T due-diligence executives visited the Herrings in San Diego in January 2014.
But the equity proposal did not materialize into a signed contract. Instead, in April 2014 the two sides signed a more conventional deal: AT&T agreed to pay the Herrings 18 cents per subscriber on U-verse each month for five years. AT&T had 5.7 million U-verse subscribers.
Suddenly, after years of rejection, the Herrings were players.
The joy lasted less than a month. In May 2014, AT&T announced that it planned to acquire the satellite service DirecTV, which had 20 million TV subscribers at the time.
This alarmed the Herrings because their deal with AT&T was limited to U-verse. If AT&T moved all its U-verse customers to DirecTV, the Herrings feared they might receive nothing, court filings show. OAN would lose millions of potential viewers.
To prevent that, Charles Herring hustled to Los Angeles to see a key AT&T executive.
LOBBYING FOR AT&T
That executive, according to Charles Herring’s sworn account in a lawsuit the Herrings would later file against AT&T, was Aaron Slator, then AT&T’s president of content and advertising.
Slator told him AT&T needed help to allay FCC and other officials’ concern that the DirecTV deal – a consolidation of providers – might make it harder for independent networks to get on the air, Charles Herring said.
So, he said in the affidavit, Slator proposed a new deal: If the Herrings lobbied on AT&T’s behalf, AT&T would air OAN and WealthTV on both U-verse and DirecTV. The Herrings would be paid one-third less per subscriber, but because DirecTV had so many more subscribers, the deal could be worth $100 million over five years.
The Herrings got to work.
Charles Herring hired a Washington lobbyist and met with FCC officials, FCC records show. He says he signed a filing of support “ghostwritten by AT&T” and sent it to the FCC. He says he attended a $50,000-per-person Republican fundraiser as part of the campaign.
The Herrings even offered to air positive news about AT&T on OAN, the network said in its lawsuit against AT&T, which said it could not comment on the litigation.
“Herring’s support of AT&T ran deep,” the Herrings’ lawyers wrote. “Herring invited AT&T to utilize OAN’s news programs to cast a positive light on the acquisition and advocated for other issues affecting AT&T’s business.”
In court records, AT&T denied it made such a deal to carry OAN on DirecTV if the Herrings lobbied for the merger. “Support for the merger was never a condition of or part of any content agreement,” an AT&T spokesperson recently told Reuters. Slator, no longer with AT&T, could not be reached for comment.
Another former senior AT&T executive told Reuters the company never made quid-pro-quo offers linking network deals to political support. “You just don’t mix the two,” he said.
In any event, the former executive said, such lobbying by a conservative news channel would be implausible or ineffective because it would have come during the presidency of Barack Obama, a Democrat. “The Herrings were not going to have influence with Obama’s people,” said the former AT&T official.
The FCC approved the AT&T-DirecTV deal in July 2015.
The Herrings say AT&T still refused to put OAN and WealthTV on DirecTV, leaving them only on the shrinking U-verse platform. In March 2016, the Herrings sued AT&T, alleging it had broken an oral promise.
AT&T denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement at the time that said, “This lawsuit is simply a ploy by Herring to negotiate a slanted deal.”
The Herrings won a key pretrial ruling from a federal judge, however, and in March 2017, the case was settled on undisclosed terms. A month later, OAN and WealthTV (since renamed AWE) began appearing on DirecTV.
KEEPING HIS NETWORK
On February 5, 2020, the U.S. Senate, sitting as a jury during Trump’s first impeachment trial in Washington, acquitted him of abusing his power for asking Ukraine’s president to launch an investigation into then-candidate Biden.
On the same afternoon, in a San Diego courtroom, Robert Herring sat before a different jury, the one that heard evidence from the OAN accountant in the employment case.
The jury had already found that OAN had wrongly fired the former producer for filing a racial complaint. Now, the jury was considering punitive damages. To help determine an appropriate penalty, the law allowed the jury to hear testimony about OAN's financial condition.
In addition to testifying that AT&T provided 90% of Herring Networks’ income, the accountant said the company’s book value – the net value of its assets – was a modest $16.6 million.
When Herring took the witness stand, he said OAN’s market value was far higher. He confirmed a 2020 Wall Street Journal report that pro-Trump private equity investors sought to buy OAN for $250 million. Herring told the court he had given the group a few exclusive months to come up with the money but that it had only raised $35 million.
“No way I would sell for $35 million,” Herring testified.

For nearly four decades, Herring had worked closely with his sons to build several successful businesses, including OAN. The network, he said, carried sentimental value.
“I am not sure I want to sell for anything,” he said.

Thus, fundamentally sound stocks Smith & Nephew (SNN), DaVita (NYSE:DVA), and Orthofix Medical (NASDAQ:OFIX) could witness a rebound in the near term.The three major stock market indexes witnessed a broad rally during Tuesday’s regular session. Investor optimism surrounding the better-than-expected manufacturing reading and strong business sentiment as COVID-19 cases continue to decline might have triggered the rebound after a downtrend in September. Although the market could continue to be volatile in October amid worries surrounding the Fed’s potential tapering of its bond-buying program in the near term, analysts expect the concluding quarter of the year to be favorable for stocks.
 CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall believes that while October had previously witnessed higher volatility as compared to the averages of the other 11 months, this year, the fourth quarter is likely to record a “higher-than-average return.” Moreover, the upcoming earnings season could be a positive catalyst for the stock market, with expected earnings growth and surprises boosting investor sentiment.
Amid this environment, fundamentally strong stocks Smith & Nephew plc (SNN),  DaVita Inc . (DVA), and Orthofix Medical Inc. (OFIX), which have dipped over the past month, are well-positioned to regain their momentum soon. So, these stocks could be solid bets now.

Those figures are up from the 397,718,055 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Tuesday out of 479,356,915 doses delivered.
The agency said 216,012,495 people had received at least one dose while 186,385,751 people are fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine.
Roughly 6.4 million people received a booster dose of either  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna's vaccine since Aug. 13, when the U.S. authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Chemo patients' response to vaccine improves with booster
A new study helps quantify the improved protection against COVID-19 achieved with a third booster dose of the vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. ""Chemotherapy can weaken the ability of cancer patients to fight off infections and to respond appropriately to vaccines,"" said Deepta Bhattacharya of the University of Arizona College of Medicine, coauthor of the study reported in Nature Medicine. Her team studied 53 patients receiving chemotherapy for solid-tumor cancers who received two shots of the vaccine. Almost all of the subjects had an immune response after vaccination. But ""the magnitude of these responses was worse than in people without cancer in almost every metric that we measured,"" Bhattacharya said. ""In all likelihood, this leaves cancer patients more susceptible to infection and COVID-19 than healthy vaccinated people."" The researchers were able to bring back 20 of the study participants for a third vaccine dose, to see if immune responses would improve. ""The levels of antibodies improved in about 80% of the cancer patients,"" Bhattacharya said. ""Our data on cancer patients supports the CDC's broad guidelines that people who are immunocompromised should receive a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine.""
Post-COVID depression responds well to treatment
Lingering depression in COVID-19 survivors may be highly treatable, a small Italian study suggests. Doctors treated 58 patients who had developed post-COVID depression with a widely used class of antidepressant drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include sertraline, sold by Pfizer under the brand name Zoloft, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s Paxil (paroxetine), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co's Prozac (fluoxetine) and Celexa (citalopram) from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit. Usually, about 66% of patients see improvement with SSRIs, but among those with post-COVID-19 depression, 91% responded to treatment within four weeks, researchers reported this week at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology meeting in Lisbon. They speculate that depression after COVID-19 is related to inflammation caused by the coronavirus, and note that SSRIs have some anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Dr. Livia De Picker of the University of Antwerp in Belgium, who was not involved in the study, said in a statement that the findings are particularly important for survivors with the syndrome of persistent symptoms known as Long COVID, which often includes depression. A separate study presented at the meeting found that while SSRIs eased depression in COVID-19 survivors, the drugs had less of an effect on their anxiety levels. 
Viral loads similar in vaccinated, unvaccinated patients

Vaccinated individuals should continue to wear masks in public because they can still carry - and possibly shed - as much virus as unvaccinated people and not realize it, data from a new study confirms. Researchers studied viral levels at diagnosis in 869 patients, including 632 who were asymptomatic. Most of the infections were caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. They found no statistically significant differences in average viral loads between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, or between those with or without symptoms, or among different age groups, genders, or vaccine types, according to a report posted on medRxiv on Tuesday ahead of peer review. ""Our study does not provide information on infectiousness,"" said Richard Michelmore of the University of California, Davis, noting that virus transmission is influenced by several factors, not just vaccination status and viral load. ""It is not OK to assume that because you are vaccinated that you cannot become infected and cannot infect someone else, even if asymptomatic,"" he said. COVID-19 vaccines do decrease the odds of infection and reduce infection severity. However, people vaccinated against COVID-19 should still wear masks in public because they might infect others if they themselves become infected, researchers advised.

LONDON (Reuters) - Fund giant Fidelity is putting money back into Chinese stocks and thinks the recent ""indiscriminate"" selling caused by the debt crisis at property giant Evergrande is presenting opportunities in the country's beaten up bond markets. 
Concerns about Evergrande's fate alongside regulatory clampdowns on e-commerce, gaming and paid-for education this year has wiped more than a trillion dollars off China's markets.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Soaring energy prices retreated and stocks on Wall Street rebounded on Wednesday after the top U.S. Senate Republican backed an extension of the U.S. debt ceiling and Russia calmed volatile natural gas markets in Europe. 
The unrelated moves eased growing angst among investors about a possible historic default on U.S. government debt and surging Dutch wholesale gas prices, the European benchmark, that had jumped eightfold this year to record highs.
U.S. natural gas futures plunged more than 10%, a day after they soared to a 12-year high. 
Yields on one-month Treasury bills tumbled after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would support an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December. Republicans had been expected on Wednesday to block a third attempt by Senate Democrats to raise the $28.4 trillion federal debt ceiling.
""There was a lot of nervousness that time was running out on debt ceiling talks,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. 
But the primary catalyst for the day's volatile market moves were the Russian decisions on natural gas, Moya said. 
""The global energy crisis was becoming a focal point for inflation concerns,"" Moya said.
Earlier, a strong private payrolls report helped boost expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would soon taper its massive bond purchases. 
U.S. private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs in September as COVID-19 infections subsided, or 140,000 more than economists polled by Reuters had forecast, according to the employment report from ADP that pointed to a recovering jobs market.
Unless Friday's non-farms payroll report is a disaster, a taper announcement by the Fed in November can be expected with its quantitative easing program over by mid-2022, said David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX in New York.
""QE buying, right now at full bore, at worst is limited or has no effect,"" Petrosinelli said, adding that inflationary pricing pressures in the economy are daunting. 
""They're (the Fed) going to have to raise interest rates in 2022,"" Petrosinelli added.
MSCI's all-country world index pared losses of more than 1% to close almost flat, down 0.1%, while the broad Euro STOXX 600 index in Europe closed down 1.03%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.41% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.47%.
In Europe, euro zone yields rose as a government bond sell-off extended on inflation concerns and potential monetary policy tightening. A gauge of German inflation expectations hit its highest since May 2013.
Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark of the euro zone, rose as much as 4 basis points and hit its highest since the end of June at -0.147%. 
Yields on the U.S. Treasury 10-year benchmark fell from more than three-month peaks. But the outlook for rates remained tilted to the upside.
The 10-year note's yield fell 0.7 basis points to 1.5241%.
The dollar rose toward a one-year high touched last week as inflation concerns fueled by surging energy prices and the outlook for rising rates knocked investors' appetite for riskier assets. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.228% to 94.219.

The New Zealand dollar earlier extended losses after barely budging on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifting its official cash rate for the first time in seven years. 
Oil prices dropped nearly 2% after hitting multi-year highs, a step back from recent torrid gains after U.S. crude inventories rose unexpectedly.

Investing.com - Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) (NYSE:LEVI) reported Wednesday third-quarter results that topped Wall Street expectations, and raised its guidance for the full year amid ongoing momentum.
Shares rose more than 2% in after market hours.
The company reported adjusted EPS of 48 cents on revenue of $1.50 billion, topping estimates of 37 cents and $1.48 billion, respectively.
Revenue, which jumped 41%% from the prior-year period, underpinned by improving momentum in its direct-to-consumer business.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 04:35PM ET</span>",Dow aims to add $3 billion to core earnings by 2030 with new net-zero unit,"By Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) -Dow Inc unveiled on Wednesday plans to boost its core earnings by $3 billion a year over the next decade, with investments that include building a new net-zero carbon emissions ethylene and derivatives facility in Alberta, Canada.
The chemicals maker, once part of DowDupont, joins a growing list of companies that have announced plans to cut emissions and reduce carbon footprint following pressure from investors.
Calling the new project a ""no-regrets"" move, Dow's Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said he expects the facility to deliver about $1 billion of additional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) per year by 2030.
Near-term investments to expand manufacturing capacity of chemicals and materials used in packaging, specialty plastics, coatings and other businesses are expected to generate about $2 billion of EBITDA, the company said. 
The new project would more than triple Dow's ethylene and polyethylene capacity at its Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta site, while retrofitting the site's existing assets to produce net-zero carbon emissions. Dow expects to allocate about $1 billion of capital spending annually to decarbonize its global assets site-by-site.
The project will help Dow produce about 3.2 million metric tons of certified low- to zero-carbon emissions polyethylene and ethylene derivatives. 
Dow said it chose Fort Saskatchewan because the region offers competitive energy and feedstock prices, and has access to third-party carbon storage facilities that will help the project reach net-zero emissions.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the project could become the largest investment in the province in more than a decade. Alberta is Canada's main energy-producing province but its economy has been battered in recent years by volatile global oil prices.
""If this project receives regulatory approval and a positive final investment decision, it will lead to a multibillion-dollar investment in our economy and huge job opportunities in both the construction and operating phases,"" Kenney said in a statement. 
Dow also signed eight new renewable power purchase agreements to reduce Scope 2 emissions, or emissions from the power a company uses for its operations, by more than 600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

Last year Dow said that by 2030, it would reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons versus its 2020 baseline, amounting to a 15% reduction, and set a target to be carbon neutral by 2050.
Net zero plans require companies to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and offset any remaining emissions using projects that capture the gas.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rebounded strongly to end higher Wednesday, after Republican lawmakers softened their stance on a debt ceiling extension, paving the way to a possible deal that would avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt.     
The S&P 500 rose 0.41%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.30% or 102 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.47%.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support extending the debt limit extension into December to give the Democrats more time to raise the ceiling. The Treasury Department has indicated the debt ceiling would need to be raised by Oct. 18 for the U.S. to avoid running out of money.
""This will moot Democrats’ excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified Democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation,"" said McConnell in a statement.
As the clock ticked down on the Oct. 18 deadline, investors didn't appear eager to bet on a U.S. default as 5-year credit default swaps default risk pricing on the U.S. debt ceiling has only ""edged up a smidge in the past 2-3 weeks and 4-week bill yields are little changed again this morning,"" Scotia Economics said.
Technology led the move, with megacap tech in the ascendency.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the green.
The upside in the broader market was stifled, however, by fall in energy, paced by a decline in oil prices after disappointing U.S. weekly petroleum data and reports the U.S. is considering releasing emergency oil supplies.
Crude inventories increased by 2.346 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 418,000 barrels.
Elsewhere in the energy complex, natural gas reversed its gains after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to supply more natural gas to ease the ongoing energy crunch.
The backdrop of rising energy prices has stoked investor fears that elevated inflation will persist just as the strength of the recovery remains doubt, potentially leading to stagflation.
These fears are playing out in the bond market, where the catalyst driving Treasury yields has switched from rising real yields to a ""lift in breakevens – indicative of rising stagflation worries due to the rent lift in energy prices,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note.
Breakeven inflation expectations on five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) rose to 2.61%, the highest since late July, while the 10-year TIPS hit 2.45%, the highest since June.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 04:05PM ET</span>",Tesla would face tough road in any bid to slash $137 million racial bias verdict in U.S,"(Refiles to correct date to Oct 6 in dateline)
By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will likely seek to slash a $137 million jury award for a Black worker who accused the automaker of racial discrimination, but could have difficulty reducing the verdict amid claims that the company tolerated widespread harassment, legal experts said.
A federal jury in San Francisco on Monday ordered https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-ordered-pay-over-130-mln-black-former-worker-over-racism-wsj-2021-10-05 Tesla to pay $130 million in punitive damages to Owen Diaz, a contract worker who was employed as an elevator operator at the company's factory in Fremont, California, according to a court filing. 
The jury found that Tesla failed to take steps to prevent race-based harassment of factory workers, including the use of racial slurs and racist graffiti in bathrooms. Tesla also was ordered to pay Diaz $6.9 million in compensatory damages.
Punitive damages are designed to punish and to deter future unlawful conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has said https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/538/408 punitive damages should generally not exceed 10 times the amount of compensatory damages, and that even a ratio greater than 4:1 might be excessive. As a result, large awards handed down by impassioned juries are commonly reduced by trial judges or appeals courts at the behest of defendants.
If Tesla challenges Monday's verdict, the company will likely point to the fact that the amount of punitive damages is nearly 19 times the compensatory damages, legal experts not involved in the case said. Tesla could also claim the verdict was not supported by evidence, and attempt to settle with Diaz to stave off further litigation over the size of the jury award, the experts said. 
The Supreme Court guidelines can go out the window if misconduct has a widespread impact on workers and is found to be highly offensive or reprehensible, according to Catherine Sharkey, a professor at New York University School of Law. 
Since the jury found that Tesla had created a hostile work environment based on race, it follows that allegations that the company tolerated racist speech and graffiti affected other workers and could justify the massive award, she said.
""The idea is that making an employer pay for that widespread harm could lead them to put in place measures to avoid future harm,"" she said. 
In a memo to employees on Monday, Tesla Vice President Valerie Workman said the company believed the facts of the case did not warrant the large award, and that Tesla took immediate action each of the three times that Diaz complained about racist conduct. 
Tesla did not responded to requests for comment on a potential appeal. 
Lawrence Organ, a lawyer for Diaz, said the case was unusual because of evidence of widespread use of the ""N word"" at the Fremont plant and Tesla's failure to address it. 
""We would argue that ... the jury got it right, particularly in light of Tesla's financial condition as one of the wealthiest corporations in the world,"" Organ said.
Several legal experts said the award for Diaz was among the largest in a U.S. discrimination case involving a single plaintiff. 
A federal jury in 2014 awarded $186 million to a former AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) Stores Inc manager in a pregnancy bias case, which at the time was widely reported in the media to be the largest verdict of its kind. AutoZone moved for a new trial but settled with the plaintiff on undisclosed terms before the motion was decided.
The nine-figure award for Diaz is ""pretty unheard of,"" and sends a message to employers that tolerating discrimination can be costly, said David Lopez, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey who was general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama administration.
Tesla has been accused of tolerating race-based harassment at the Fremont plant in several lawsuits aside from Diaz's, including a pending class action in California state court. The company has denied the claims and says it has adopted policies to better address complaints about racially-charged incidents.
Lopez said the jurors in Tesla's case likely took into account the pervasiveness of the conduct alleged by Diaz and the company's value and high profile, which could also come into play if the company seeks to lower the jury award. 

Tesla's market value has reached https://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-stocks-int/tesla-market-value-crosses-800-billion-for-the-first-time-idUSKBN29D20B nearly $800 billion, making it the world's most valuable automaker.
""The jury was asking itself, 'what would sting Tesla and make sure they don't treat this as just another cost of doing business?'"" Lopez said.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 03:34PM ET</span>","Analysis-If Facebook is the problem, is a social media regulator the fix?","By Elizabeth Culliford
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen told Congress on Tuesday that one option for making social media less harmful would be to create a dedicated regulatory agency to oversee companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which could have former tech workers on staff.
""Right now, the only people in the world who are trained to ... understand what's happening inside of Facebook, are people who grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) or another social media company,"" she said during a hearing https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-whistleblower-say-former-employer-an-urgent-threat-us-2021-10-05 before a Senate Commerce Committee panel.
How social media companies should be regulated has been a topic of intense debate among lawmakers, regulators and experts. Facebook, the world's largest social network, has been blasted by over a lack of transparency into how its platforms work, its handling of user data and the impact of its sites on users. 
Haugen, a former product manager at the company who leaked internal documents to the Wall Street Journal, said the profit motive was strong enough that Facebook, which owns Instagram, would not change without pressure. ""Until incentives change at Facebook, we should not expect Facebook to change. We need action from Congress,"" she said.
Haugen also said that if she were made CEO of Facebook, she would immediately establish a policy that would allow it to share internal research with Congress and other oversight bodies, calling for transparency and public scrutiny of Facebook's systems and decisions.
Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford Law School professor who resigned last year from an effort aiming to get Facebook to share more data with researchers, has argued for legislation to compel social media companies to share their data with external researchers. 
""The platforms thrive in secrecy and if you subject them to outside review, it will change their behavior,"" he said. 
Persily said that as action is needed within the next year, he favored the Federal Trade Commission managing the process. ""You go to war with the army you have, not the army you may want,"" he said, though he said a new cabinet department could later be created. 
Former Facebook executive Brian Boland, who was in charge of the company's partnership data before resigning this year, said improving transparency was ""step one in any kind of regulatory regime."" 
Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he envisaged a new, separate agency with the bandwidth and specialism to establish and enforce standards for Big Tech, including on privacy. 
On Tuesday, Facebook spokeswoman Lina Pietsch said the company had itself long asked for government oversight. ""We have been calling for updated regulations ourselves for two and a half years,"" she said. 
Facebook has previously called for regulation https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/facebooks-nick-clegg-a-bipartisan-approach-to-break-the-deadlock-on-internet-regulation.html of the internet, including a digital regulator. 
Some commentators raised caveats around the idea: Kyle Taylor, program director for a group of critics called the Real Facebook Oversight Board, said a regulator was essential but cautioned against creating a ""revolving door"" of ex-employees from social media companies joining the body. 
Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St. John's University Law School who studies social media governance, tweeted that such an agency should not be in charge of misinformation as an issue.
REGULATION AND REFORM
During Tuesday's hearing, Haugen also encouraged lawmakers to reform Section 230. She urged the law be changed to hold companies accountable for their algorithms, which often decide what social media users see when they sign in.
""They (companies) have 100% control over their algorithms and Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth and virality and reactiveness over public safety. They shouldn't get a free pass on that because they're paying for their profits right now with our safety,"" she said.
Facebook has said it is in favor of a reform of Section 230 to give the companies immunity from liability only if they follow best practices. 
At the hearing, lawmakers did not push back at Haugen's suggestions for various reforms but, in many cases, pointed to legislation aimed along similar lines. 
A bipartisan group of senators, including Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, introduced a bill in June that would require big internet platforms to allow users to view content that has not been decided by an algorithm.
Haugen also encouraged raising age limits for users of Facebook's platforms from 13 to 16 or 18, given addiction issues on the sites and children's issues with self-regulation. 

Under current law, children 12 and under have more protection online than teenagers. There is a bill before Congress to raise the age to 15, among other changes.
Facebook announced in late September, shortly after a report based largely on documents from Haugen that Instagram was harmful to teenagers, that it was pausing its work https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-puts-instagram-kids-hold-amid-criticism-planned-app-2021-09-27 on a version of Instagram aimed at younger users.

Also, the U.S. staffing revenue is expected to rise 16% this year to a record total of $157.4 billion. As job openings hit record highs with healthcare and social assistance sectors requiring most workers, staffing companies should benefit.
Given the rising demand for workers in a reopening economy, it could be wise to bet on prominent staffing stocks such as TrueBlue, Inc. (TBI) and Resources Connection, Inc. (RGP). These stocks are expected to keep rallying due to their strong fundamentals and stable financials.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slashed its losses Wednesday, after Republicans said they would support extending the debt ceiling until December, easing fears about U.S. default and paving the way for bullish bets on stocks to resume.
The S&P 500 rose 0.10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1% or 30 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.2%.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support extending the debt limit extension into December to give the Democrats more time to raise the ceiling. The Treasury Department has indicated the debt ceiling would need to be raised by Oct. 18 for the U.S. to avoid running out of money.
""This will moot Democrats’ excuses about the time crunch they created and give the unified Democratic government more than enough time to pass standalone debt limit legislation through reconciliation,"" said McConnell in a statement.
As the clock ticked down on the Oct. 18 deadline, investors didn't appear eager to bet on a U.S. default as 5-year credit default swaps default risk pricing on the U.S. debt ceiling has only ""edged up a smidge in the past 2-3 weeks and 4-week bill yields are little changed again this morning,"" Scotia Economics said.
Technology led the move, with megacap tech in the ascendency.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were in the green.
The upside in the broader market was stifled, however, by fall in energy, paced by a decline in oil prices after disappointing U.S. weekly petroleum data and reports the U.S. is considering releasing emergency oil supplies.
Crude inventories increased by 2.346 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 418,000 barrels.
Elsewhere in the energy complex, natural gas reversed its gains after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to supply more natural gas to ease the ongoing energy crunch.
The backdrop of rising energy prices has stoked investor fears that elevated inflation will persist just as the strength of the recovery remains doubt, potentially leading to stagflation.
These fears are playing out in the bond market, where the catalyst driving Treasury yields has switched from rising real yields to a ""lift in breakevens – indicative of rising stagflation worries due to the rent lift in energy prices,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been accused of violating Colorado state law by failing to pay warehouse workers for time spent undergoing COVID-19 screenings before clocking in at work. 
Jennifer Vincenzetti, who worked at two Amazon warehouses in Colorado Springs, filed a proposed class action in Colorado federal court on Tuesday claiming the company made workers wait in long lines to answer questions and have their temperatures checked.
Seattle-based Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The proposed class includes more than 10,000 people at five Colorado warehouses.
""Amazon appears fine making efforts to keep its workers safe, so long as the workers are the ones footing the bill,"" David Seligman of nonprofit Towards Justice, which brought the suit, said in a statement.
The complaint says that beginning in March 2020 Amazon required employees at Colorado warehouses to arrive early, wait in lines outside the facilities, and then answer questions and check their temperature once they were inside. The process generally took 20 to 60 minutes, according to the lawsuit.
That time is compensable under Colorado law, which says workers must be paid when they are required to be on their employer's premises or on duty, according to the suit. 

Amazon has argued in a similar lawsuit in California federal court that because the screenings primarily benefit workers, they do not amount to compensable time under federal wage law. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has raised the same defense in a proposed class action in Arizona federal court claiming the retail giant's failure to pay employees for time spent in COVID screenings violated state law.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>",Biden chides 'dangerous' Republicans in CEO meeting as debt limit chaos looms,"By Steve Holland and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden piled the pressure on congressional Republicans to vote for a debt ceiling increase in a meeting with bank and business leaders at the White House on Wednesday, saying their opposition would take America ""right to the brink."" 
During the meeting with leaders of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, Nasdaq Inc and Deloitte, Biden said raising the debt ceiling is about ""paying for what we owe.""
""Our markets are rattled, Americans' savings are on the line...our Republican friends need to stop playing Russian roulette with the economy,"" Biden said.
Biden said Republicans were planning to block a third attempt by Senate Democrats to raise the debt ceiling on Wednesday.
""It's not right and it's dangerous,"" he said.
As Biden's meeting was underway, top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said his party would support an extension of the debt ceiling into December.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated that a U.S. debt default could occur around Oct. 18 if Congress fails to give the government additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion, which was reimposed after a two-year suspension expired in late July. 
At the White House meeting, Yellen said the issue was urgent. ""This would be a catastrophic outcome,"" she said, adding the United States would likely face a financial crisis and could slip into a recession. 
Republicans want Democrats to raise the debt ceiling using reconciliation, a process that would not require Republican votes; Democrats have refused, saying Republicans should join them in the vote because the debt includes about $8 trillion in spending approved during Republican Donald Trump's presidency.
CORPORATE AMERICA VERSUS REPUBLICANS
A rift over the debt limit has been growing between corporate America and congressional Republicans traditionally aligned on economic issues.
A U.S. debt default would severely hurt the country's credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil and poses a major risk https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-watch-market-stress-us-debt-ceiling-deadline-nears-2021-10-05 to company stock prices.
Chief executives of large American banks at the White House expressed alarm at the potential fallout.
JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the impact could lead to a global catastrophe, urging lawmakers to show ""American competence, not American incompetence.""
""We should never even get this close...we don't need to have this kind of brinkmanship every couple of years,"" Dimon said.
Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also urged immediate action. When Biden asked her about the fallout if the United States were to default even for a day, Friedman said ""we would expect the markets would react very very negatively.""
Others such as Citigroup's Chief Executive Jane Fraser warned consumers can be burdened with higher borrowing costs very quickly. ""We just can't wait till the last minute to resolve this. We are simply playing with fire right now.""
A coalition of groups representing investment firms and banks warned congressional leaders in a letter last week that a default would severely hurt financial markets.
""The United States of America defaulting on its obligations is not an option; we are counting on Congress to take the necessary steps to address the debt limit,"" wrote Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest corporate lobbying group.

The Chamber spent $82 million on corporate lobbying in 2020, according to OpenSecrets, a research group that tracks political donations. Three-quarters of its campaign contributions went to Republicans in 2020, the group found. 
""I didn't even know the Chamber was around anymore,"" U.S. House of Representatives Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Wednesday, when asked about the business group's position. He said the lobbying group will have no influence if Republicans take the majority in congressional elections next year.

""Macy's could see an increase in its stock price by 100% if it followed the playbook of Saks,"" Jana Partners portfolio manager Scott Ostfeld said at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit. He did not explicitly say whether the firm owns a stake in the company.
He said Macy's online business could be worth about $14 billion. Macy's as a whole has a market valuation of about $6.9 billion. 
Saks Fifth Avenue announced plans this year to split off its e-commerce unit, allowing Saks.com to continue its strong growth.
Ostfeld said Macy's could create a digital goldmine and delight investors who may now be betting that the retailer's stock price will fall, not rise, by selling it short.
The stock is currently trading at $22.28 and has fallen 42% in the last five years.

The Swedish health agency said it would pause using the shot for people born in 1991 and later as data pointed to an increase of myocarditis and pericarditis among youths and young adults that had been vaccinated. Those conditions involve an inflammation of the heart or its lining.
""The connection is especially clear when it comes to Moderna's vaccine Spikevax, especially after the second dose,"" the health agency said, adding the risk of being affected was very small.
Shares of Moderna fell 4.9%, or $16.08, to $316.11 in afternoon trading.
A Moderna spokesperson said in an email the company was aware of the decisions by regulators in Denmark and Sweden to pause the use of its vaccine in younger individuals because of the rare risk of myocarditis and or pericarditis.
""These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard treatment and rest. The risk of myocarditis is substantially increased for those who contract COVID-19, and vaccination is the best way to protect against this.""
According to one U.S. study that has yet to undergo peer review young males under 20 are up to six times more likely to develop myocarditis after contracting COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.
Denmark said that, while it used the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as its main option for people aged 12-17 years, it had decided to pause giving the Moderna vaccine to people below 18 according to a ""precautionary principle"". 
""In the preliminary data ... there is a suspicion of an increased risk of heart inflammation, when vaccinated with Moderna,"" the Danish Health Authority said in a statement.
It referred to data from a yet unpublished Nordic study, which would now be sent to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for further assessment. Final data was expected within a month, it added.
Sweden and Denmark said they now recommended the Comirnaty vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, instead.
The Danish Health Authority said it had made the decision even as ""heart inflammation is an extremely rare side effect that often has a mild course and goes away on its own"".
The EMA's safety committee concluded in July that inflammatory heart conditions can occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Comirnaty or Spikevax, more often in younger men after the second dose.
The benefits of shots based on so-called mRNA technology used by both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risks, regulators in the United States, EU and the World Health Organization have said.
Data suggests reported cases of rare heart inflammation are relatively higher after Moderna's vaccine compared with the Pfizer/BioNTech shots, Canadian health officials said last week.
Although both vaccines are based on mRNA technology, the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) shot contains 30 micrograms of vaccine per dose compared with 100 micrograms in the Moderna vaccine.
Data from one of two U.S. vaccine safety monitoring databases has also suggested that Moderna's vaccine may carry a higher risk of myocarditis among young people.
The vaccine is not approved for people under age 18 in the United States.
Norway already recommends the Cominarty vaccine to minors and said on Wednesday that it was reiterating this.
""Men under the age of 30 should also consider choosing Cominarty when they get vaccinated,"" Geir Bukholm, head of infection control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said in a statement.

A Finnish health official said Finland expected to publish a decision on Thursday.
The EMA approved the use of Comirnaty in May, while Spikevax was given the nod for children over 12 in July.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>","Analysis-Buying the dip? Not so fast, some Wall St banks say","By Lewis Krauskopf and Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Scooping up stocks after pullbacks has been a winning bet for investors over the past decade but some Wall Street strategists are pointing to a multitude of risks that could come with jumping into equities after their latest tumble. 
The S&P 500 has notched 25 total pullbacks of at least 5% since the start of 2012, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). Over that time, the index has gained more than 240%, bolstering the case for investors willing to step in during episodes of weakness.
Bargain hunting has already been in evidence. The S&P 500 bounced back about 1% since Monday, when a sharp sell-off saw the index end more than 5% below its closing record high, in its biggest drawdown so far in 2021. The buyers included retail investors, who have purchased an average of $1.2 billion in stocks per day so far this week, up from their average, according to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research.
And JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Marko Kolanovic on Wednesday wrote that the COVID-19 pandemic was at an ""effective end"" and urged investors to buy the dip in economically sensitive cyclical shares that would benefit from broad economic improvement.
Others, however, worry that buying the latest dip may come with more near-term risks than before as investors face a bevy of headwinds, from the looming unwind of the Federal Reserve’s $120 billion a month government bond-buying program to a protracted battle among lawmakers to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
Analysts at BofA Global Research on Tuesday cautioned that “the coast appears far from clear” as the Fed prepares to wind down the easy money policies that had helped the market double from last year’s lows as early as August. BofA's target on the S&P 500 is 4,250, some 2% below Tuesday’s close. 
The risks of a more hawkish Fed also concerned analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), who on Monday said the S&P 500 could fall as much as 20% if the economy and earnings ""cool off"" as the Fed tightens. 
Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi US Wealth Management, said a nasty fight among U.S. lawmakers to raise the country’s debt ceiling or throw the nation into default is currently the key near-term risk equities face. 
""The buy-the-dip strategy still works but there (are) very specific things that are lingering that need to be cleared first,"" Snyder said.
Additional risks run the gamut from a recent surge in energy prices to worries over the meltdown of heavily indebted Chinese property developer China Evergrande Group. The S&P 500 is up 15.5% so far this year.
Buying the dip has ""certainly worked for people over the last 10 years,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. However, ""at some point things stop working, especially when people do them time after time.""
STOCKS IN SEASON?
One scenario outlined by Morgan Stanley’s strategists sees the S&P 500 falling by about 10% as the Fed tightens monetary policy due to rising inflationary pressures. In a second scenario, the economy and earnings slow as the Fed tightens, leading to a 20% swoon. 
""Bottom line: faster tapering with a greater deceleration in growth implies a greater than 10% correction,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.
Despite those worries, however, historical evidence shows that a market powered by strong momentum tends to keep rising. The S&P 500 has notched a positive fourth quarter nearly 80% of the time in years during which it has climbed more than 12.5% in the first nine months, according to LPL's Detrick, delivering a median fourth-quarter gain of 5.2%.
Seasonal trends also could provide reasons to buy sooner rather than later. While September lived up to its historical reputation of being the weakest month with a 4.8% decline, October is traditionally stronger, with the seventh-highest average gains for the S&P 500 since 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. 

November ranks second in monthly performance, with the index rising 1.7% on average, and December third, with equities rising 1.5%, according to the almanac.
JPMorgan's Kolanovic, meanwhile, wrote investors should use the recent pullback as an opportunity to buy emerging and developed market equities with the exception of high-growth and technology shares.

Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, formed earlier this year though the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, has pooled its Alfa Romeo, Lancia and former PSA's DS brands to cooperate on the premium market.
""Alfa Romeo will launch a new model every year until 2026,"" Imparato told an Italian dealer's event, in comments later confirmed by a Stellantis spokesman.
Starting form 2027, all Alfa Romeo new vehicles would be electric, he said.
The Alfa Romeo Tonale, whose production was initially expected to start by the end of 2021, will be presented in March next year, with sales in Italy to begin in June, Imparato said.
Lancia's head Luca Napolitano told the same event he had presented Stellantis CEO Carlo Tavares with a 10-year plan for the brand, which is selling only one model, the small Ypsilon, and only in Italy. 
The strategy aims to expand the brand to other European markets, including France, Germany and Nordic countries, with a focus on large cities, to complete the group's premium offer from Alfa Romeo and DS, he said.

""Our target is to bring Lancia (...) to those markets where electric cars are sold, as we'll produce electric cars only from 2026,"" he told dealers in comments later confirmed by a Stellantis spokesman.
""I want to be in the high end of the market, not abandoning Ypsilon, but pushing Lancia beyond it,"" Napolitano said, adding the brand will launch three new models by 2028.

CROZIER, La. (Reuters) -Bruce Westley stood outside his wrecked mobile home, pointing to a small lime green tent, two patio chairs and a 30-quart aluminum pot atop a single propane burner. 
""For more than a month, that's been our bedroom, our living room and our kitchen,"" said the 65-year-old disabled Navy veteran. He and his wife Christina are among thousands of southeast Louisianians struggling more than a month after Hurricane Ida swept through the heart of Cajun country. 
Reuters traveled the bayous of hard-hit Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson and Plaquemines parishes in recent days, speaking with more than 40 residents. All said they felt abandoned by state and federal officials. A few said they had not received any type of support from any level of government. 
""We can't keep living like this,"" Westley said. ""We just need any damn thing to get off the ground, man.""
In most areas it looked as if Ida rolled through only a day or two ago. Old timers who say they've seen it all swear they have never witnessed a more destructive storm. 
A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spokesman said the agency was working as quickly as possible. Louisiana's Governor John Bel Edwards on Monday announced a temporary sheltering program supported by FEMA that he said would start bringing trailers into the hardest-hit areas to alleviate housing shortages. 
The human misery and the piles of debris testify to the massive strain on public and private resources in a hurricane-prone area. The scenes also raise questions about how the United States will cope as climate change creates a new, more destructive normal. 
Reuters saw no heavy equipment, trucks or workers helping people clear the rubble and recover their belongings. The only government presence was in the form of law enforcement officers and staff at FEMA mobile centers processing disaster claims. Residents said it has basically been that way since Ida made landfall on Aug. 29 and killed 26 people, though roadways in the area were largely cleared of debris. 
Hundreds of people, many of them elderly and children, were in tents. Others were in homes that clearly have severe structural damage and where mold, which can impact respiratory health and cause severe allergic reactions, was spreading.
Grocery stores, most restaurants and other businesses remain closed. Power is still out for thousands of people and many have no water or sewage services.
Despite the difficulties, communities are trying to band together. Outside the Howard Third Zion Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Baptist Church just two blocks down from where Westley and his wife are camping, volunteers say they have been handing out meals to 1,000 families daily. Ida destroyed the church's south-facing wall.
""You want to know what's been going on to help these people? Pretty much nothing,"" said Talisa Clark, a community activist for the historically Black area who has been helping coordinate the food distribution. ""There are no state or federal boots on the ground to help. It's looking like a Third World country's efforts down here.""
Clark was forced out of her badly damaged home near Houma and has been staying with relatives.
Parish officials for Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson and Plaquemines did not respond to a request for comment.
DIFFICULT CHOICES 
John Mills, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spokesman at a support site in Golden Meadow, Louisiana, said he understood the frustrations of those who survived Ida. 
""Families and communities will have to face difficult choices about how to rebuild - and whether to rebuild here at all,"" he said.
FEMA is distributing money so people can rent housing for at least two months. In addition, as of Monday FEMA said it was paying hotel costs for nearly 8,000 families. In total, it estimates it has spent at least $30 million in hotel costs. 
""That plan probably works under most circumstances. But the breadth of Ida's damage is so huge, that there's no housing stock, there's no hotel rooms available,"" said Tanner Magee, a state representative whose district includes Terrebonne parish.
State and parish governments have contracted out the task of picking up debris, but have struggled with even deciding on where they will put it, Magee said. He said far more workers and trucks were needed in hard-hit areas.
Magee and his family, who live in Houma, are staying in his Ida-damaged home. 
""If you see this destruction around you constantly and it's not going anywhere, it beats down on people,"" Magee said. ""I'm really worried about the mental health of people.""
Magee and others say they need temporary FEMA trailers. FEMA says that takes several weeks, and is complicated by federal and state regulations that make it difficult to bring in temporary shelters during hurricane season.
FEMA, along with the Small Business Administration, has paid out over $1.1 billion for Ida damage so far, mostly through grants to homeowners, along with FEMA's national flood insurance program. Uninsured damage estimates are upward of $19 billion, according to the property data and analytics company CoreLogic, with 90% of those losses along Louisiana's coast, and the rest in Alabama and Mississippi. There could be another $21 billion in damage to insured properties.
STAY RIGHT HERE
In Galliano, Maria Molina handwashed shirts and shorts for her 7-year-old daughter Julia and grown son Leonardo; she then hung them out to dry. 
""I'm out of work, I'm out of money and we're out of food. We don't have anywhere to go, even though this trailer seems unsafe,"" she said of her blue mobile home, which was now akilter with a damaged roof and foundation.
Molina was awaiting word on whether she'll qualify for any FEMA aid. 
Down the road in the town of Golden Meadow, Rosie Verdin, 73, stood on the tilted porch of her home behind the tribal headquarters of her United Houma Nation. 

Verdin said Ida's destruction was the worst she'd seen. Some three-fourths of her tribe's 19,000 members saw their homes destroyed or left uninhabitable. 
""But there is nothing that will drive us off this land,"" she said. ""With or without help, we'll rebuild and stay right here.""

Viceroy Research, in a report published on Oct. 6, said Adler Group's ""balance sheet has been artificially inflated to a significant degree, its shares are not investible"", causing the group's shares to tumble.
""This is evidently false,"" said Adler in a statement.
""The real estate value set forth in Adler's balance sheet has been determined by independent market leading real estate property appraisers and confirmed independently by financing banks,"" it added.
Adler, which is listed on Germany's smallcap index SDAX, said it was currently preparing a detailed response to the allegations and would comment on them shortly.
Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, said it was taking the report seriously and was reviewing the allegations made in it. 
""If this results in suspicions of criminal activity, we will report it to the relevant public prosecutor's office,"" a spokesperson said.
Shares in Adler closed 26% lower.
Rumours about a short-seller attack targeting Adler first surfaced in June and came after Viceroy Research issued a critical report on German financial services firm Grenke last year.
Aggregate Holdings - Adler's top shareholder with a 26.6% stake - said it was absolutely convinced of the value of its investment in Adler.
""The current share price does not reflect the value in any way,"" Aggregate Holdings' Chief Financial Officer Benjamin Lee told Reuters.
Earlier this week, Adler's Chief Executive Maximilian Rienecker had told Reuters that the firm plans to sell a major part of its residential portfolio in a bid to reduce debt, adding it could even divest its subsidiary Westgrund.

Nissan will halt operations at its plant 2 in the central state of Aguascalientes for 11 days in October, and its CIVAC plant in Morelos state will be halted for 8 days, the carmaker said in emailed comments to Reuters.

The stoppages come as automotive production in Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two largest economies, plunged in September, dragged down by an industry-wide semiconductor chip shortage and railroad blockades in Mexico.
""We continue to make adjustments to our production process to minimize the impact this has had on the automotive industry locally and globally,"" said Nissan, adding it was working to recover production and make good on delivery of vehicles to distributors and customers.

(Reuters) - Several U.S. companies are looking to prioritize employee well-being by offering perks such as home delivery of meals and subsidized furniture to meet the rigors of working from home, a survey showed on Wednesday.
One of five employers have such plans for next year, according to early results from a national survey of 1,502 respondents that was conducted by employee benefits consultant Mercer between June and September.
With a majority of people working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are looking for at-home alternatives for offerings such as subsidized healthy food choices in cafeterias or onsite gyms, the survey of employer-sponsored health plans found.
Large companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and PwC have said they would allow some U.S. employees to work from home and live anywhere, and some others have delayed reopening offices.
The well-being measures such as virtual cooking, exercise, yoga classes and apps for relaxation can cost between $1 and $3 a month per employee, said Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer and Elissa Rosenbaum, principal in Mercer's health business. 
One of four employers were emphasizing virtual care strategies for workers living away from urban areas, the survey showed. Last year, at the height of the pandemic when people stayed indoors, the use of telehealth services from companies such as Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc jumped.

Seventy six percent of survey respondents with 500 or more employees said addressing issues related to employees' mental and emotional health will be a top priority over the next 3-5 years, compared with just 44% that considered it a priority in Mercer's 2019 survey. 
Roughly one-third of the respondents provide employees with a virtual behavioral healthcare option, often through specialized programs from companies such as video-based therapy services provider Ginger, and 21% said they were considering the option.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google cut fuel use and traffic delays by 10% to 20% at four locations in Israel by using artificial intelligence to optimize signal lights and it next plans to test the software in Rio de Janeiro, the company said on Wednesday. 
The early-phase research project is among new software initiatives inside Google to combat climate change. Some employees https://medium.com/@googworkersac/ruth-porat-497bbb841b52 as well as advocacy groups have called on the company, the world's third-most valuable, to more urgently use its influence to combat the crisis. 
While Google has not addressed critics' calls to stop selling technology to oil companies or funding lawmakers who deny global warming, it has prioritized sustainability features.
Google plans in the coming weeks to allow its Nest thermostat users to buy renewable energy credits for $10 a month to offset emissions from heating and cooling. Credits will come from projects in Texas including Bethel Wind Farm and Roseland Solar. A majority of the funds will go toward credit purchases and utility-bill payment costs, Google said, without elaborating on the remainder.
For no charge across the United States, Nest users soon can automatically shift heating and cooling to times when energy is cleaner.
New informational panels alongside search results show emissions or other environmental ratings of flights globally and cars and home appliances in the United States. To stem misinformation, English, Spanish and French queries mentioning ""climate change"" starting this month will feature explanations from the United Nations.
Based on early results in Israel's Haifa and Beer-Sheva, Rio de Janeiro's municipal traffic authority expressed high hopes for the AI to better time traffic signal changes. It told Reuters the system should be introduced within months with locations announced soon.

Aleksandar Stevanovic, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Pittsburgh, said simulations show AI could smooth traffic flow. But he questioned whether a tech company without traffic engineering expertise ultimately could bring such software to reality.
""Every year there is someone new claiming we can do wonders,"" he said.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 12:56PM ET</span>","Italy says mRNA COVID jab effectiveness stable after 7 months, but not for all","MILAN (Reuters) - Seven months after the second dose, there is no reduction in the efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the general population in Italy, while a slight decline is seen for some specific groups, the National Health Institute (ISS) said on Wednesday.
The report led by ISS and the health ministry examined data up to Aug. 29 from more than 29 million people who had received two doses of an mRNA vaccine such as those produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA).
It said that in the general population, effectiveness against infection after seven months remained at 89%, while against hospitalisation and death, this time six months after the second dose, it remained at 96% and 99% respectively.
The findings on protection from infection differ from a study carried out by Pfizer and published on Oct. 4 in the Lancet medical journal.
That showed the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing infection dropped to 47% from 88% six months after the second dose.
The ISS study did not make reference to the study in the Lancet, which focused on electronic health records of 3.4 million members of a U.S. healthcare provider, but did not include data on adherence to mask guidelines and occupation, which could have affected testing frequency and exposure.
In Italy, people are obliged to wear masks indoors and they had been required outdoors before the summer, and stringent behavioural rules have been in place, which may have influenced the results. 
The ISS report said that immunocompromised people saw their protection against infection drop from 28 days after the second dose, with the reduction varying widely according to which diseases cause the weakened immune system.
In people with co-morbidities but who are not necessarily immunodepressed, the study reported a reduction in protection from infection which declined from 75% 28 days after the second dose to 52% after about seven months.
Efficacy among people over the age of 80 and nursing home residents also decreased slightly but remained above 80%, the ISS said.
Comparing the period in which the Alpha variant was prevalent with that in which the Delta variant was, efficacy against infection fell from 84.8% to 67.1%, while protection against hospitalisation declined much less, from 91.7% to 88.7%.
The Institute's reports are among the material the Italian government takes into account for its health decisions. Rome must consider in the coming weeks whether to extend a third vaccine dose to the whole population. 

To date, the third dose, which started on Sept. 20, has only been given to immunocompromised patients, over-80s, nursing home residents and operators, and health workers over 60 or with comorbidities or other factors leading to increased exposure to possible infection. 
The European Union's drugs regulator EMA said on Oct. 4 that people with weakened immune systems should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, but left it to member states to decide if the wider population should have a booster.

Investing.com – Shares of airline companies were trading weaker Wednesday even as oil prices retreated a little from multi-year highs.
Delta Air (NYSE:DAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) traded 1% to 2% lower. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) slipped around 5% each, a downgrade by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was also weighing on the stocks.
U.S. crude climbed to $79.78, its highest since November 2014, before retreating to $77.55 with a 1.8% loss as latest data from the Energy Department showed a rise in crude stocks. Inventories in the country rose by 2.3 million barrels last week, a surprise given estimates called for a dip of 418,000 barrels in crude stocks.
Production in the country rose to 11.3 million barrels per day, recovering from Hurricane Ida-related disruptions more than a month ago to rebound near pandemic-level highs but still far from 2019’s 13-mbpd record.
Shale companies in the country continue to exercise restraint on drilling to focus on investor returns, a reason why the U.S. has been unable to counter OPEC+'s efforts to restrict exports. At its Monday meeting, OPEC+ reiterated its intent to up production only gradually, ignoring calls by the U.S. and other big consumers to hasten output enhancement.
Goldman Sachs made it worse for American Airlines and JetBlue today, downgrading the stocks to sell and neutral, respectively. The brokerage blamed American Airlines’ higher operating leverage to weigh on its profitability. Goldman believes capacity growth to be elevated and pricing to lag recovery in traffic in 2022.
Analyst Catherine O’Brien sees American Airlines at $18, 12% lower from the stock’s current level.
She blamed cost headwinds for her views on JetBlue while putting a target of $17 on the stock, around 10% higher from its current market price but 15% lower from her own $20 target set earlier."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple will be hit with an EU antitrust charge over its NFC chip technology, people familiar with the matter said, a move that puts it at risk of a possible hefty fine and could force it to open its mobile payment system to rivals. 
The iPhone maker has been in European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crosshairs since June last year when she launched an investigation into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay.
Preliminary concerns were Apple's NFC chip which enables tap-and-go payments on iPhones, its terms and conditions on how mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites, and the company's refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system.
The European Commission has since narrowed its focus to just the NFC chip, which can only be accessed by Apple Pay, one of the sources said. 
The EU competition enforcer is now preparing a charge sheet known as a statement of objections, which could be sent to Apple next year, one of the sources said. Such documents typically set out practices considered anti-competitive by the regulator.
The Commission, which has three other cases against Apple, declined to comment. It can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover for violating EU rules, which based on Apple's 2020 revenue could come to $27.4 billion.
Apple, which has cited privacy and safety issues for its policy on Apple Pay, was not immediately available for comment.
Apple's shares were down 1% at $139.6 in early trade
NFC-enabled payments have grown in popularity due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple Pay's wide reach and superior consumer experience on a mobile website or in-store give it a competitive edge over rivals, according to some analysts.
Apple Pay is also on the radar of other regulators and authorities. South Korea approved a bill last month that bans major app store operators, including Apple, from forcing software developers to use their payment systems.

Germany in 2019 passed a law requiring Apple to open its mobile payments system to rivals for a reasonable fee.
In the same year the Dutch competition watchdog kicked off an investigation into the App Store and the requirement that app developers use its payment systems for in-app purchases and pay a 30% fee in the first year.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -German airline Lufthansa received strong investor backing for a 2.14 billion euro ($2.47 billion) rights issue, providing some encouragement for travel companies looking to weather the after effects of the COVID-19 crisis. 
The company said on Wednesday that its rights issue was 98.36% subscribed by investors, and the remainder was quickly sold in the open market soon after.
The cash will be used to repay a chunk of the 9 billion euro ($10.4 billion) government bailout it received last year to stay afloat throughout the COVID pandemic, which resulted in the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) taking a 15% stake in the group.
This was cut slightly in the rights issue to 14.09%, the German state finance agency said on Wednesday.
Sentiment towards the airlines and travel sectors was boosted in September by the lifting of restrictions on travel between the United States and Europe in particular.
""There was a relaxation in trans-Atlantic travel the day the rights issue was announced - we anticipated an eventual lifting of restrictions but did not expect it to happen on the day,” said Stephane Gruffat, co-head of equity capital markets for the EMEA region at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
He said this was the right time for the sector to be raising capital with passenger volumes and the number of flights increasing and with airlines have reduced their cost bases and cash flow stabilising.
Lufthansa is one of several airlines and travel companies that have raised cash or are planning to raise funds to get through the toughest period for the sector in two decades. 
EasyJet recently completed a 1.2 billion pound ($1.63 billion) rights issue, while tourism group TUI announced on Wednesday it would raise planned 1.1 billion euros and Air France is believed to be considering its options.
A solid deal for Lufthansa will provide some encouragement for the others.

Paltalk is grappling with falling sales and DatChat is a pre-revenue company that just went public. So, what’s driving the volatility in these stocks and should you add either of them to your portfolio?.In the last 18 months, communication platform companies have experienced a significant surge in demand for their suite of products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic led to global lockdowns and organizations had to shift towards a remote-first working business model which meant enterprises had to quickly adopt and subscribe to collaboration and communication tools or services.
Even though lockdown restrictions are relaxed in various countries, several companies continue to operate remotely as much as possible to improve employee retention rates and lower operating costs.
This trend is likely to continue going forward making communication companies, such as Paltalk (PALT) and DatChat (DATS) enticing long-term bets right now. So let’s see which between the two stocks should be part of your portfolio today.

Investing.com – Stocks of Covid vaccine-makers continued to be weighed down Wednesday by the promise shown by Merck's (NYSE:MRK) antiviral oral medicine against the dreaded infection.
Merck’s Friday announcement that trials of a drug it is developing against Covid showed that it could halve the risks of hospitalization and deaths was a blow for the shares of  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
If approved, molnupiravir, the antiviral drug, could be the world’s first oral medicine for Covid, the company said in a note. Merck plans to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. as soon as possible.
Novavax, Moderna and BioNTech traded 3.3% to 4.3% lower in today’s session. Johnson & Johnson fell 0.6%. Pfizer, which has jointly developed a vaccine with BioNTech, lost 0.8%.
Since the close of trading on Thursday, a day before the Merck announcement, Novavax has lost around 30% of its value, Moderna 18% and BioNTech 13%.
Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, the two companies who are not very dependent on revenue from sales of the Covid shots, have fallen 2.7% and 2%, respectively. The Merck news came in just as Pfizer was rolling out its booster dose for those above 65 and other adults at-risk in the U.S.
Of the above, Novavax is the only company that is yet to launch its vaccine. There have been some adverse developments at Moderna which have added to the pressure on the stock.
According to reports, Swedish public health agency has paused use of Moderna’s Covid vaccine for people born 1991 and later because of indications of heightened risk of side effects. Reports also said Denmark has stopped offering Moderna shots to people under 18."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd said it has reached a deal with Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) to restructure an order for 362 narrowbody planes worth tens of billions of dollars, including switching 13 A320neos to the larger A321neo model.
Deliveries of the 362 A321neos are now planned through 2035, the cash-strapped airline said on Wednesday, without providing details of the previous timetable.
Industry sources told Reuters last month that Airbus had agreed to reschedule deliveries https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airasia-has-reached-deal-restructure-airbus-jet-order-sources-2021-09-17 and improve terms for its largest Asian customer to salvage the valuable contract.
AirAsia received its first A321neo in November 2019 and currently has four in service after halting deliveries during the pandemic. Airbus sold six A321neos that had been built for AirAsia last year, industry sources have said.
Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said in a statement that the deal was an example of how the planemaker had worked with customers to adapt to the impact of the pandemic.
Other airlines with large plane orders, most of which are in Asia, are also in the midst of restructuring their orders or are expected to press for relief.
""It is hard to cancel unless an airline goes the bankruptcy or court-aided restructuring route,"" said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst. ""The AirAsia order still makes sense given the delivery flexibility and assuming they have resolved the price escalation issue.""
Planemakers typically put price escalation clauses into contracts that lead to price rises when airlines delay delivery but also have the discretion to waive or not fully enforce the price rises.
AirAsia's auditors have, for more than a year, raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airasia-group-strategy-idUSKBN2490GN due to COVID-19's impact on the travel industry.
AirAsia Group President Bo Lingam said the airline had thoroughly reviewed its network and fleet strategy as it prepares for travel to resume.
""Our business model is robust, and there is a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said. ""We are confident that our airlines will be able to rebound and recover strongly as soon as travel restrictions are lifted.""

AirAsia said this week had received approval from Malaysia's only financial guarantee issuer for a loan of up to 500 million ringgit ($120 million) with an 80% government guarantee.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>","Starboard's Smith unveils Colfax stake, talks Huntsman, Elanco","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Activist investment firm Starboard Value on Wednesday said it owns a stake in  Colfax  (NYSE:CFX) Corp and said the industrial equipment maker is undervalued.
""The company is at an inflection point,"" Starboard Value's founder Jeffrey Smith said at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit on Wednesday.
News that Starboard, one of the industry's most prominent activist investors, had taken a position pushed Colfax's stock price up 3.55% in pre-market trading. 
Earlier this year Colfax announced plans to separate its industrial and medical devices businesses into two publicly traded companies following a strategic review of its operations.
By improving operational performance through improved execution at MedTech, which will ultimately lead to a higher valuation multiple, Smith said he believed Colfax can create significant value for shareholders. Colfax, which is currently trading at $47.34, could see its share price trading closer to $76 a share in 2023 with a chance to trade near $94 in 2025, Smith said.Smith also said Starboard plans to push for changes at chemicals producer  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp., in which it owns a 8.4% stake and which is valued at roughly $6.8 billion.
Huntsman has improved its portfolio mix and has strong businesses, Smith said, however saying there is room to improve revenue. ""The company is not getting credit for what it has done,"" Smith said, adding ""We believe this company is a good company.""
But Smith also said there is room for Huntsman to improve its valuation multiple by accelerating revenue growth and increasing profitability, which should lead to greater value creation for all shareholders. He said average annual revenue growth could top 5.5% instead of hovering below 1%. Adjusted EBITDA margins could top 18% compared to 13% where they are now, Smith said, underscoring that the company offers differentiated products and has barriers to entry which make it a ""compelling investment.""
Huntsman was founded by Jon Huntsman and is now run by his son, Peter. It listed its shares in 2005.
Smith also discussed the firm's investment in animal health company Elanco, noting that it has opportunities that are similar to its rival Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). ""We believe there is an opportunity to narrow the margin gap with Zoetis through operational improvements,"" Smith said. 
But he also said ""execution has disappointed and credibility has eroded."" Financial results have remained largely stagnant despite alleged productivity improvements, Smith said.
Starboard is known for pushing for operational fixes and has at times pushed a company to put itself up for sale.
The 13D Monitor conference is one of the first conferences to have in-person participants, requiring attendees to prove they are vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
Previously Starboard pushed for changes at  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc where the company agreed with the hedge fund to add three Starboard-backed directors earlier this year. 
It is known in the industry for having won big victories at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in 2014 and at GCP Applied Technologies (NYSE:GCP) last year and traditionally wins more board seats than any other activist investor, according to bankers and analysts. This year it lost a proxy battle at Box Inc, its first in nearly a decade.

Bank of America in May disclosed plans to raise its minimum wages for its U.S. employees, joining a clutch of firms that have pledged to pay employees more after a year of pandemic risks and government subsidies fueled conversations on whether companies pay their workers enough.
The $25 figure is higher than at competitors, and the second-largest U.S. bank has also asked its vendors to set a minimum wage of $15 an hour.
In the last four years, Bank of America raised the minimum hourly wage to $20 from $15. 
Companies have sometimes been prodded to boost wages by employee complaints that spill into the public sphere. But there are also political pressures and a competitive reality in which one big company outlines a higher pay scale and others follow suit.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday, but the main indices recovered from overnight lows after strong data from the labor market gave some reassurance that the economy still has momentum on the eve of a new policy tightening cycle from the Federal Reserve.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 184 points, or 0.5%, at 34,131 points, while the S&P 500 was also down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3%. 
Futures for the main indices had all been down more than 1% before private payrolls processor ADP reported that a sharp pickup in hiring in the month through mid-September. ADP said 568,000 jobs were added by the private sector, up from 340,000 the previous month and well ahead of a consensus forecast of 428,000. Nearly 40% of the jobs added, some 226,000 in all, came in the leisure and hospitality sectors, suggesting that the sectors most exposed to the pandemic haven't stalled as a result of the Delta-variant wave of Covid-19 that swept the U.S. in the summer. 
If corroborated by the government's official labor market report on Friday, the ADP's data should remove any remaining doubt that the Federal Reserve will start to reduce its bond purchases at it November meeting. They've been running at $120 billion a month since the start of the pandemic and have been a cardinal factor behind the explosion of stock prices in that time. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock continued to underperform, falling 1.9% in the wake of an embarrassing mass outage and even more embarrassing testimony from whistleblower Frances Haugen in Congress on Tuesday. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Tuesday that the allegation that Facebook prioritized profit over the safety of its users ""just isn't true.""
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also continued to lose ground, falling 4.3% after Sweden said it would suspend the distribution of its Covid-19 vaccine to adults amid reports of links to heart muscle inflammation, or myocarditis.

""ICMM members' collective commitment to net zero scope one (direct) and two (indirect) greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is a pivotal moment in our history,"" CEO Rohitesh Dhawan said in an open letter signed by the 28 chiefs of the world's largest miners. 
The announcement comes before next month's U.N. climate gathering that aims to achieve more ambitious climate action from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.
Many miners including  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and BHP, under pressure from environmental activists and shareholders, have already committed to net zero by 2050 in direct and indirect emissions.
The collective commitment, however, ""represents a joint ambition from companies that make up one third of the global mining and metals industry,"" the ICMM said.
Its 28 members, whose operations span 650 sites over 50 countries, will report annually on their progress to decarbonise annually.
Mining has a ""decarbonisation challenge"" because the sector has to reduce emissions while producing metals, such as nickel and copper, that are vital to a lower-carbon economy, said Konrad von Szczepanski, Managing Director and Partner at Boston Consulting Group.
Direct and indirect emissions will be lowered by accelerating the use of renewable energy and reducing or eliminating the use of diesel trucks, Dhawan told Reuters. 
Targets for scope three emissions, which includes those from customers processing iron ore to steel, should be set ""if not by the end of 2023, as soon as possible."" 
The technology to produce carbon-free steel has not yet been proven.

Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), the world's largest supplier of seaborne thermal coal, has committed to a scope three goal mainly by running down its coal mines.
ICMM members, which include Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) and  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA), have collectively cut emissions by 6% between 2016-2018, Dhawan said.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Airbus is sticking to its quest for record jet output after airlines reported glimmers of a post-pandemic recovery this week, and believes engine makers who have questioned its most ambitious proposals will be ""unable to resist"" demand.

Airbus has said it hopes to almost double jet production ina few years as borders reopen. Engine makers fear doing so tooquickly could upset their own recovery, by forcing existing jetsinto retirement rather than their repair shops. Interviewed at the airline industry's main annual event,Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer held out theprospect that Airbus would play on fierce competition betweenengine makers as it aims to secure future output of its A320neo. ""There will be engines. That is the beauty of having enginecompetition in the programme,"" he told Reuters on the sidelinesof a meeting of the International Air Transport Association, the first such industry gathering since the pandemic. ""There is a lot of rhetoric ... (but) at the end of the dayif customers ... demand more modern airplanes ... no enginemaker in the world is going to be able to resist the call ofnature. So I’m not concerned about it.” Airbus is sold out of its A320neo series until 2026, he said. In May, Airbus issued a mix of firm targets and scenariosthat could lift narrowbody A320-family output to 75 jets a monthby 2025 from about 40 this year, and 60 pre-COVID. The head of France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), part of the CFM engineventure with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), said earlier this year hewas not sure whether rates above 60 could be sustained. Also speaking in July, Greg Hayes, CEO of Pratt & Whitneyparent Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), expressed surprise at""pretty aggressive"" Airbus output plans. Both engine makers offer competing engines on the A320neo,the most-sold Airbus jet which competes with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. 'NO OVERPRODUCTION' Asked if Airbus had given up on studying the possibility ofincreasing A320neo output beyond the most recent firm target of63 a month to 70 or 75, Scherer said: ""absolutely not"". He added: ""It is a scenario right now. It is not a committedplan. But it is a sizing exercise that we must do because itcorresponds to demand – verified demand, not theoretical demand– that we are experiencing, including in meetings we are havingright here.” 
While IATA discussed tougher climate pledges, airlines,suppliers and leasing companies mingled behind the sceneshaunted by the losses and overdue payments left by the industry's worst ever crisis, while reporting some interest in new jets. Scherer said conversations were beginning to turn towardsrecovery after a spate of restructurings of plane orders. ""The realisation that the world is expecting movementtowards more sustainable, more eco-friendly flying isaccelerating the need for the most modern airplanes, he said. Scherer addressed some suppliers' concerns that Airbus wouldrace to build jets to meet that demand, but only temporarily,leaving them to absorb costly capacity if the recovery falters. ""I think recent history has shown Airbus has been able tomanage its supply and demand very, very rigorously almost to thedot on the right spot,"" Scherer said. ""You have to trust that we will continue to do that in thefuture and not shoot ourselves in the foot by overproducingairplanes that we can’t sell.""

It will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a four-month long investigation.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has said it would maintain Arm as a neutral technology supplier as it aims to allay concerns from customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Arm customers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) are supporters of the deal.

Privately-held Lilac is part of a growing number of technology developers seeking to extract lithium from saltwater brines faster, cheaper and with less water than evaporation ponds, which have long been the industry standard.
BMW, which already buys lithium from China's Ganfeng Lithium Co and other traditional lithium producers, said it sees Lilac's technology as a way to boost global production of the white metal as demand grows from the EV market.
""This holds the promise of becoming a new extraction technology that allows access to more green lithium,"" said Kasper Sage of BMW i Ventures, BMW's venture capital fund.
The German automaker is participating in Lilac's Series B funding round alongside SK Materials Co, Sumitomo Corp investment arm Presidio Ventures and others.
BMW declined to discuss its investment amount, though the total from all investors announced on Wednesday was less than $20 million, according to regulatory filings. T. Rowe Price and others were part of an initial $130 million funding round for Lilac's Series B announced last month.
Lilac plans to use the funds to construct a U.S. manufacturing facility for ion exchange beads, which are core to its extraction process.
The company last month agreed to use its technology https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/australias-lake-resources-teams-up-with-clean-tech-firm-lilac-develop-argentina-2021-09-21 to develop a lithium project in Argentina with Lake Resources NL.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean Internet service provider SK Broadband has sued Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to pay for costs from increased network traffic and maintenance work because of a surge of viewers to the U.S. firm's content, an SK spokesperson said on Friday. 
The move comes after a Seoul court said Netflix should ""reasonably"" give something in return to the internet service provider for network usage, and multiple South Korean lawmakers have spoken out against content providers who do not pay for network usage despite generating explosive traffic. 
Netflix said it will review SK Broadband's claim, and seek dialogue and explore ways in the meantime to work with SK Broadband to ensure customers are not affected. 
The popularity of the hit series ""Squid Game"" and other offerings have underscored Netflix's status as the country's second-largest data traffic generator after Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube, but the two are the only ones to not pay network usage fees, which other content providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are paying, SK said. 
Netflix's data traffic handled by SK jumped 24 times from May 2018 to 1.2 trillion bits of data processed per second as of September, SK said, riding on the success of several Netflix productions from Korea including ""Squid Game"" and ""D.P."" 
SK Broadband said it lodged a lawsuit against Netflix for it to pay for using SK's networks since Netflix began using SK's dedicated line starting 2018 to deliver increasingly larger amounts of data-heavy, high-definition video content to viewers in Korea from servers in Japan and Hong Kong. 
Last year, Netflix had brought its own lawsuit on whether it had any obligation to pay SK for network usage, arguing Netflix's duty ends with creating content and leaving it accessible. It said SK's expenses were incurred while fulfilling its contractual obligations to Internet users, and delivery in the Internet world is ""free of charge as a principle"", according to court documents. 
But the Seoul Central District Court ruled against Netflix in June, saying that SK is seen as providing ""a service provided at a cost"" and it is ""reasonable"" for Netflix to be ""obligated to provide something in return for the service"". 
SK estimated the network usage fee Netflix needed to pay was about 27.2 billion won ($22.9 million) in 2020 alone, the court document said. 
Netflix has appealed against the ruling, court records showed, with fresh proceedings to start in late December. 
Netflix said in a statement on Wednesday that it contributed to the creation of about 16,000 jobs in South Korea stemming from about 770 billion won in investments, as well as an economic effect of about 5.6 trillion won. 
Ruling party lawmaker Kim Sang-hee said on Wednesday that out of South Korea's top 10 data traffic generators, 78.5% of the traffic came from foreign content providers, up from 73.1% a year earlier, with ""Google-YouTube and Netflix that account for the majority turning a blind eye to network usage fees"". 

In the United States, Netflix has been paying a fee to broadband provider Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) for over seven years for faster streaming speeds. https://reut.rs/2Y8wOzb

Investing.com – Constellation Brands stock (NYSE:STZ) was volatile in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the company took a hit on its second-quarter earnings because of the divestiture of some of its wine and spirit brands.
The stock slipped as the company disclosed its June to August performance but recouped all the losses.
Wine and spirits shipment volume fell more than 36% while organic shipments rose nearly 6%. Beer volumes were strong and rose nearly 12%, led by Modelo Especial and Corona Extra.
The volume and the net sales the divested brands brought in during last year’s second quarter were 4.6 million (9-liter case equivalents) and $181 million, respectively.
President and Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands said consumer demand for its big brands remained strong and was the reason behind its revised guidance.
Constellation Brands now sees its comparable basis EPS outlook at a midpoint of $10.30 compared to $10.15 previously.

Investing.com – Palantir Technologies stock (NYSE:PLTR) soared more than 8% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the company secured an $823-million order from the U.S. Army.
Palantir will sell its Gotham analytics platform to the army to help build fighting capabilities against emerging near peer threats, the company said in a statement late on Tuesday.
The Gotham platform is an operating system for defense decision-making and is specifically designed to connect the dots between disparate sources. The Army intelligence community will use this capability to modernize its data foundation by migrating legacy programs to Capability Drop 2 program. The Army will also use CD-2 to serve as an enabler for future modernization efforts supporting joint all-domain operations.
Palantir said the CD-2 contract is “one of several” projects it is working on to modernize Army intelligence.
The software company, focused on defense contracts from government agencies, aviation, healthcare and financial services, said in August its second-quarter revenue rose 49% to $376 million.
Palantir had a direct listing a little more than a year ago. The shares have rallied 157% in a year.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Sweden's flat-pack furniture giant IKEA is planning to move more production to Turkey to minimise problems with global supply chains and increased shipping costs, the company's chief financial officer for Turkey said.
Products it expects to make and then export from Turkey, including armchairs, bookcases, wardrobes and kitchen cabinets, are currently shipped thousands of miles from east Asia to Middle East or European markets.
""Due to shipment problems we faced during the (Covid) pandemic, we are attempting to have more manufacturing in Turkey,"" chief financial officer Kerim Nisel told Reuters, declining to estimate how much capacity might be moved.
""We all saw in the pandemic that diversification is so important,"" Nisel said. ""It might not be a good strategy to produce items in one country and then try to transport them all around the world"".
The company has seven stores in Turkey and already exports three times as much as it imports into Turkey, where it currently produces textile, glass, ceramic and metal products for global export. 
Nisel said the cost of a container from east Asia had leapt to $12,000 from $2,000 before the COVID-19 outbreak last year. ""It is more rational to have them manufactured closer where they are sold. That's why we want to have them manufactured in Turkey"".
IKEA's move follows similar steps by other European brands such as Benetton, which is bringing production closer to home by boosting manufacturing in Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt with the aim of halving production in Asia.
CURRENCY CHALLENGES
Straddling Europe and the Middle East, Turkey says it is well placed to benefit from changes to global supply chains.
""Turkey with its strategic location, has posed a strong alternative to pre-Covid era's single-centred and Asian-based production network,"" Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Monday. 

While Turkey's strategic location and strong manufacturing base may be a plus, Nisel said hedging against moves in the lira - which fell close to a record low on Wednesday - remained a major challenge for retailers, while high interest rates pushed up financing costs for investors.
""It is really difficult to hedge FX positions when interest rates are above 20%,"" he said, adding the company was using 3- to 6-month hedging contracts to offset currency volatility.

Some 140 countries aim to finalise the first major overhaul in a generation of the rules for taxing multinationals at a meeting on Friday so the deal can be endorsed by the Group of 20 economic powers - possibly as soon as next week.
""It is essential that everyone is fully aware that it is at this very moment that all is up for play, and that everyone needs to show a spirit of compromise on the different technical parameters that are on the table,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at the OECD.
""We are one millimetre away from a global agreement,"" Le Maire later told CNBC.
An updated draft of a global corporate tax overhaul has dropped ""at least"" from a proposed minimum rate of ""at least 15%"", possibly clearing a major hurdle for Ireland as negotiations enter a final stretch, sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Tuesday.
""I am hopeful Ireland can be part of supporting this new measure but we have to wait for the final text which hopefully will be available this evening,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said.
""Ireland does not want to be isolated in this space,"" Coveney told RTE radio ahead of a cabinet meeting to decide on the matter on Thursday.
The minimum rate is intended to discourage multinationals from booking profits in low tax countries regardless of where their clients are, a loophole that big U.S. tech companies have used to reduce their tax bills to next to nothing in many countries.
Some eastern European countries such as Hungary that have long used low tax rates to attract foreign investment in manufacturing have made recommendations for a significant deduction from the minimum rate based on a company's assets and payroll in the country.

""If the other countries accept these, then there could be a compromise that would allow the introduction of the global minimum tax,"" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a statement.
He also proposed a 10-year transition period. Le Maire said that would require compromise, but added: ""why not?""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - After two deadly dam disasters that made Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) a pariah of the global green movement, Brazil's largest mining company is striving to put the environment and climate at the heart of its business, Chief Executive Eduardo Bartolomeo told Reuters.
Bartolomeo, speaking in an interview at the Reuters Impact conference, said the disasters - which killed nearly 300 people and caused huge environmental damage in Brazil - were a wake up call that forced the company to think differently.
""I think everybody woke up. I think the incidents, the tragedies, unfortunately pushed us to open up our minds. It's a driving force behind everything we do here at Vale and it is a driving force for the industry as well,"" he said.
Beyond improving safety, it helped Vale reconsider its wider role too, according to Bartolomeo. 
""We need to give back to society, we are a mining company, we extract natural resources, we are only going to be accepted if we share value with society,"" he said. 
Vale plans to invest between $4 billion and $6 billion to reduce emissions by 2030, aiming to cut its direct and indirect carbon emissions by 33%. It plans to hit zero net emissions by 2050.

Bartolomeo said his own remuneration package now sets targets for safety and sustainability, with 20% of his long-term compensation associated with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals. Vale is also developing a new iron ore pellet that aims to reduce the emissions of steelmaking clients. The so-called green briquette, the result of nearly 10 years of research and development, will be produced in 2023. It is made up of iron ore and a technological binder solution which includes sand from the treatment of mining tailings in its composition, and is capable of resisting high blast furnace temperatures without disintegrating. ""This is a new pellet, but a new pellet with 80% less carbon footprint,"" Bartolomeo said. The estimate is that, in the long term, the company will have the capacity to produce over 50 million tons per year of green briquettes, generating value as well as environmental gains. 
""It's a new business for Vale"", he said. ""This is not greenwashing.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -Gazprom's Swiss unit can challenge an EU gas rule that requires gas producers to be separate companies from those that control the pipeline, an adviser to the EU's top court said on Wednesday.
Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) owns operator Nord Stream 2 and is the planned gas supplier for the Russia-to-Germany link that was completed last month.
The opinion from Advocate General Michal Bobek, if confirmed by the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), may help the Russian company in its long-running fight with the bloc.
It would give Nord Stream 2 another avenue in its legal battle https://www.reuters.com/article/nordstream-gas-idAFL1N2R10JY to increase its gas sales to Germany. The issue is critical as Europe faces surging gas prices.
The EU Gas Directive aims to ensure fair competition in the market and to prevent companies from obstructing competitors' access to infrastructure.
""Nord Stream 2 AG can challenge before the EU Courts the directive extending the scope of the Gas Directive to pipelines connecting the EU with third countries,"" Bobek said.
""The adoption of the directive altered the legal position of Nord Stream 2 AG, which, in addition, was the only company actually affected by that legal act.""
The CJEU, which follows such non-binding opinions in four out of five cases, will rule in the coming months. 
The Nord Stream 2 operator said the EU rule, amended in 2019 was aimed at halting the pipeline. A lower-tier court last year rejected a challenge https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gazprom-nordstream-court-eu-idUSKBN22W25N by the operators of Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 against the rule.

Russia on Wednesday said it had not contributed to surging natural gas prices in Europe, where demand recovery, low storage levels and less supply to the spot market have all played into an energy market crisis.
The case is C-348/20 P Nord Stream 2 AG v Parliament and Council.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>",Tesla faces investor test after big jury award over racism,"By Hyunjoo Jin, Ross Kerber and Rick Linsk
SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - A contract worker has won a $137 million jury award over workplace racism against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, raising pressure on the electric vehicle maker whose shareholders will vote on Thursday on a proposal to review how it addresses similar complaints for full-time employees.
The nonbinding shareholder resolution asks Tesla's board to study the impact of the company's current use of mandatory arbitration to resolve complaints of harassment and discrimination in its workplace. Tesla opposes the plan.
On Monday, a San Francisco federal jury made the award to former Tesla worker Owen Diaz. “The verdict sends a message to corporate America that you need to make sure that racist conduct is not occurring,” Lawrence Organ, his attorney told Reuters.
Diaz was able to face a public trial because contract workers were not subject to Tesla's mandatory arbitration, which forces employees to resolve disputes outside judiciary courts. 
Tesla advised against the resolution because, it said, arbitration ""benefits both parties with a fair resolution and a speedier return to their respective priorities without miring them in lengthy litigation.""
Some technology companies have scaled back or eliminated mandatory arbitration. Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) no longer require mandatory arbitration in cases over sexual harassment. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ended mandatory arbitration in 2019. In April, nearly half of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) shareholders voted in favor of examining the bank's use of mandatory arbitration. 
Imre Szalai, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans, said such a verdict against Tesla would create ""shaming and awareness"" of problems at the company.
""The public becomes aware that Tesla needs to change and increases more pressure for the company, as opposed to confidential arbitration award that doesn't get that much publicity,"" he said.
Tesla arbitration agreements with employees and customers effectively bars them from publicly fighting in court disputes about pay, sexual harassment, race, disability and other kinds of discrimination, as well as product defects. 
There are around 100 cases in U.S. federal and state courts where Tesla sought to compel arbitration including lawsuits against the company over employment, personal-injury, and contract matters, according to Reuters' review of Westlaw case data.
Kristin Hull, CEO of Nia Impact Capital who filed the resolution, said Monday’s jury verdict could help boost support. A similar measure last year garnered a 27% share of votes cast. Musk has 23.1% of Tesla shares. 
""This will be alarming,"" she told Reuters after the verdict. ""That's a huge brand risk for Tesla to have these cases.""
Tesla's clean-transportation credentials have made it a popular investment for Environmental, Social and Governance investors. ""This has taken a lot of environmental investors by surprise and they're not happy,"" she said.
Nia Impact Capital has tried to sway major shareholder BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), whose funds voted against the resolution last year. BlackRock declined to comment. 
Tesla said that in the years since Diaz worked at the company it has added employees to investigate complaints and to promote equal opportunity.

In a blog post after the jury verdict Tesla Vice President Valerie Capers Workman wrote that ""we will continue to remind everyone who enters the Tesla workplace that any discriminatory slurs – no matter the intent or who is using them – will not be tolerated.""
Still proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis both have recommended investors support the proposal, as they did the similar proposal last year.

1047,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>",Dow Futures Fall 360 Pts; High Energy Prices Lift Inflation Worries,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Wednesday, handing back most of the previous session’s gains, with investors fretting that elevated inflation levels will prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than already expected.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 360 points, or 1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 54 points, or 1.3%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 215 points, or 1.5%.
The major indices posted solid gains on Tuesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 300 points, or 0.9%, the broad-based S&P 500 rising 1.1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.3%.
However, the tone has weakened Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked its benchmark interest rate for the first time in seven years, citing the need to get on top of inflationary pressures and adding that further removal of monetary policy stimulus was to be expected. 
While this move had been expected, it intensified the focus on the Federal Reserve, especially given high energy prices and bond yields at their highest in three-months. The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield rose as high as 1.57% overnight before stabilizing a little lower at 1.54%.
Also weighing on sentiment is the lack of action over the country’s debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could run out of cash by Oct. 18 if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended, potentially resulting in the U.S.’s first-ever default.
For Wednesday, the focus is on the U.S. labor market, with the payroll processing company ADP set to release its estimate of the month-on-month change in nonfarm employment at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), usually closely studied as a guide to Friday’s official employment report.
Private companies in the U.S. are expected to add 428,000 jobs in September, more than August’s 374,000, according to estimates compiled by Investing.com.
In corporate news, clothes retailer Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) and drinks giant Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) are scheduled to report quarterly earnings Wednesday, while social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will remain in the spotlight after Monday's outage and Tuesday’s testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen to Congress.
Oil prices remained near multi-year highs Wednesday, although the WTI contract slipped after U.S. inventories increased by 951,000 barrels for the week ended Oct. 1, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute. 
Investors now await official crude oil supply data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration later in the session for confirmation of this increase of stocks.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $78.61 a barrel, having earlier climbed to its highest level since November 2014. The Brent contract rose 1.2% to $82.23, after rising to a three-year high in the previous session.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,753.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1557.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",Tesco defies supply chain challenges to lift profit outlook,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, raised its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday after the unmatched scale of its store and online operations helped it outperform rivals in the first half and beat expectations with a 16.6% jump in profit.
British retailers are battling supply chain disruptions and labour shortages. Supermarkets also face tough comparisons against record sales during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), however, increased sales in the period.
""We've had a strong six months; sales and profit have grown ahead of expectations, and we've outperformed the market,"" CEO Ken Murphy said.
""With various different challenges currently affecting the industry, the resilience of our supply chain and the depth of our supplier partnerships has once again been shown to be a key asset.""
He told reporters the company ""maintained great availability"" during the half.
Tesco said the strong performance had enabled it to cut net debt by 1.7 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) since February, and it could now afford to start a multi-year share buyback, with the first 500 million pounds to be bought by October 2022. It also paid an interim dividend of 3.2 pence, in line with a year ago.
Tesco shares were up 4.4% at 1015 GMT, taking 2021 gains to 14.3%.
Murphy denied the buyback was a tactic to ward off potential private equity bidders. 
""This isn't defensive by any means, this is completely, as far as we're concerned, part of business as usual,"" he said
Morrisons, Britain's No. 4 supermarket group, is being taken over by U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, while shares in No. 2 Sainsbury's have been buoyed by takeover speculation. No. 3 Asda was purchased by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital earlier this year.
PRIORITIES
Tesco forecast a full-year adjusted retail operating profit of 2.5-2.6 6 billion pounds, having previously forecast a similar outcome to 2019-20, when it made 2.3 billion pounds.
The company, with a 27% share of Britain's grocery market, made an adjusted retail operating profit of 1.39 billion pounds in the first half versus 1.19 billion a year earlier.
Group sales rose 3% to 27.3 billion pounds, while UK like-for-like sales climbed 1.2%, having risen 0.5% in the first quarter.
Recent industry data has shown Tesco outperforming its main rivals.
Analysts say Tesco is also benefiting from a strategy to match prices at German-owned discounter Aldi on around 650 lines and the success of its 'Clubcard Prices' loyalty scheme.
The proportion of customers using Clubcard in large stores has grown to 80% from 69% last year, with about seven million shoppers now using the scheme through an app.
Despite inflationary pressures, Tesco said its customers saw prices fall in the first half and they were still falling in the second half.
Murphy also set out Tesco's strategic priorities going forward - value, customer loyalty, convenience and using cost savings to invest. 
""Customers are faced with an increasing range of choice as to where, when and how to shop and the competitive environment has materially changed,"" he said.

""We believe that against this backdrop we can thrive.""

A report in The Wall Street Journal said that Visa (NYSE:V) may tweak the way it processes certain Apple Pay transactions to help banks lower the fee they pay to the iPhone-maker.
According to the WSJ, Apple officials have informed Visa executives of their objections and it is possible the planned changes won’t kick in.
Apple Pay was launched in 2014 and banks pay the company a fee when their cardholders use its mobile wallet. Under the planned new process, the fees wouldn’t apply on automatic recurring payments such as gym membership fee and streaming service charges.
Card companies like Visa, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) provide the gateway between banks and payment wallets such as those offered by Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). They help banks load onto the wallets and facilitate transfer of money from the bank via debit or credit cards to the wallet and eventually to the merchant.
In Apple vs banks case, the change would apply to Visa cards, though other networks may follow, the WSJ report said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd is likely to turn in its best quarterly profit in three years and a record revenue, on rising memory chip prices and brisk sales of its new foldable smartphones, analysts' estimates show. 
Operating profit for the world's biggest memory chip and smartphone maker likely jumped to 16.1 trillion won ($14 billion) in the quarter ended September, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate from 16 analysts, weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate. 
That would be up 30% from 12.35 trillion won a year earlier and the highest since the third quarter of 2018. Revenue likely rose 11% to 74.6 trillion won, a record high. 
An unprecedented global shortage in semiconductor chips amid the pandemic has underpinned Samsung (KS:005930)'s results and shares, which soared 45% last year and hit a record high at the start of 2021. 
But the stock has dropped since then, compounded by losses in September when U.S. peer Micron (NASDAQ:MU) warned its memory chip shipments would slip in the near term, amid industry views that chip prices will tumble after peaking in July-September.
""Samsung shares have fallen due to Micron's guidance but unlike Micron, Samsung internalises major components ... and has other businesses like mobile and foundry to buoy performance,"" said Hanwha Investment & Securities analyst Lee Soon-hak. 
""Memory (chip) prices are seen rebounding next year after a short period of decline,"" Lee added.
Samsung will announce preliminary results on Friday.
CHIP DIVISION, SMARTPHONES
Samsung's chip division is likely to report an operating profit of 9.9 trillion won, an average of six analysts' forecasts shows, up 79% from a year earlier, helped by rising memory chip prices and shipments.
Prices of DRAM chips, used in servers, mobile phones and other computing devices, jumped 7.9% versus the June quarter, while those of NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market rose 5.5%, data from research provider Trendforce shows.
Analysts also forecast a double-digit operating margin for Samsung's chip contract manufacturing business as clients rush to secure production capacity.
Its mobile division likely saw about 3.7 trillion won in operating profits, analysts said, down from 4.45 trillion won a year earlier but up from the prior quarter's 3.2 trillion won on foldable smartphones sales.
An estimated 2 million Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 models were sold in a month since launching in late August, with South Korea topping sales followed by the United States, said Jene Park, senior research analyst at Counterpoint.

Market participants will be scouring Samsung's full results later this month for an update on its planned $17 billion U.S. semiconductor factory after sources said it was drawing closer to finalising the construction.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>",Factbox-How COVID-19 in Southeast Asia is threatening global supply chains,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Fresh coronavirus outbreaks in Southeast Asia have hurt factory activity across industries, threatening the region's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and disrupting global supplies of goods such as apparels, automobiles, and electronics.
Coronavirus curbs have led companies to shut factories and suspend or reduce operations at a time when Asia's manufacturing sector is already grappling with rising raw material costs and signs of a slowing Chinese economy.
Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are three of the region's major manufacturing hubs and produce goods for some of the world's largest consumer brands.
VIETNAM
A coronavirus wave since April forced Vietnam's largest cities and industrial hubs to impose strict lockdowns, prompting electronics, apparel and footwear manufacturers to suspend or reduce operations. The restrictions have been eased in recent weeks.
The outbreak initially hit northern industrial areas, where suppliers for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and other global tech firms are located.
In May, the northern province of Bac Giang ordered four industrial parks, including three that house production facilities of Taiwan's Foxconn, to temporarily shut down.
The outbreak spread further south and, in July, Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring industrial provinces imposed strict lockdown measures.
That month, Taiwan's Pou Chen Corp, which makes footwear for  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City and Changshin Vietnam, a South Korean firm manufacturing shoes for Nike, shut three of its factories.
Nike has cut its fiscal 2022 sales expectations and warned of holiday delays. Buyers of Apple's new iPhone 13 are facing longer-than-expected delivery times because of the outbreak in Vietnam, where components for the device's new camera module are assembled.
The Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association said several international fashion brands have shifted their orders away from Vietnam and 60% of apparel and footwear makers in the country have been fined for slow deliveries. 
MALAYSIA 
Several automakers and semiconductor companies have said in recent months that pandemic-related disruptions in Malaysia were hitting supply chains.
Malaysia imposed a lockdown in June as infections hit record levels but has gradually eased restrictions on manufacturing since July. 
Curbs in Malaysia, which supplies about 67% of the global rubber glove market, also forced many glove makers to suspend operations in June and July.
Malaysia is home to factories serving semiconductor makers such as Europe's STMicroelectronics and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), as well as major carmakers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
STMicroelectronics said in July it temporarily closed its assembly plant in Malaysia for 11 days due to the coronavirus.
German chipmaker Infineon said in August the firm will take a hit in the high double-digit million euros from shutdowns at its Malaysia plant.
That same month,  Ford Motor Co  said it would temporarily shutter the U.S. plant that builds its best-selling pickup truck due to a semiconductor-related parts shortage caused by the Malaysian outbreak.
THAILAND 
Thailand imposed tougher restrictions in July and August in high-risk provinces including Bangkok.
To avoid the factory shutdowns seen elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the government adopted ""bubble and seal"" measures, whereby confirmed COVID-19 cases are sent for treatment and close contacts isolated from the other workers.
But several companies have had to temporarily close operations for deep cleaning after COVID-19 cases in recent months, including Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai Plastic Industrial, and Soomboon Advance Technology.
In July, Toyota halted vehicle production at three of its Thai plants due to parts shortages caused by the pandemic..
Thailand is Asia's fourth-largest autos assembly and export hub for some of the world’s largest carmakers such as Toyota and Honda.

A shortage of migrant workers, due to strict border controls, infections and quarantines, has also hit food and rubber production.
Siam Agro-Food Industry, a Thai processed fruit exporter, has only been able to fill 400 of the 550 roles it has available as workers, who returned to their home countries, are unable to enter Thailand due to border closures.

By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's wealthy clients have raised $650 million for the biggest biotechnology impact fund ever, the Swiss bank said on Wednesday.
Impact investing - a term coined in 2007 - grew out of the desire to extend philanthropic goals into mainstream financial holdings.
Alongside financial returns, impact investments aim to generate measurable environmental and social impact, often in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which generally go beyond the basic principles of sustainable investing.
The Oncology Impact Fund 2, run by biotechnology investment firm MPM Capital, has raised a total of $850 million, including the $650 million obtained from UBS clients. It will invest 80% of its capital into privately held start-ups, and the remainder into public companies, developing innovative treatments for cancer and other serious illnesses.
Twenty percent of the performance fee the managers earn off their investments, as well as a portion of drug royalties, will be donated to improve access to cancer treatment for children in the developing world and to fund cancer research, portfolio manager Christiana Bardon said.
Together with its predecessor fund, for which MPM and UBS's wealth management raised over $470 million in 2016, it marks the Swiss bank's largest single theme-focused impact investment fundraising to date.
""With this fund, I feel like we tried to reimagine the impact space. The vision here is still extremely bold, which is to say: What if every drug that was developed and sold had that 1% go back to make the world a better place?"" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management, said.
""When we started on this journey, impact investing was about impact bonds and at the time they were being done in $5 million increments. To launch something that is 100 times the size of that was very ambitious, and shows how this theme clearly resonates with our clients,"" he added.
UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, had raised $6.9 billion for SDG-related impact investments as of end-2020. It aims to add $70 billion of invested assets classified as impact investing or as sustainably focused investments more broadly through 2025.
While impact investing has often been associated with concessionary returns, the managers said investors - which include large companies, insurers and other very wealthy individuals alongside UBS clients - would not need to forgo returns, based on the performance of the previous fund.

""Our impact fund is as profitable as our other funds, and they are generally top quartile performers within U.S. venture capital,"" MPM Managing Director Ansbert Gadicke said.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",Factbox: How COVID-19 in Southeast Asia is threatening global supply chains,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Fresh coronavirus outbreaks in Southeast Asia have hurt factory activity across industries, threatening the region's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and disrupting global supplies of goods such as apparels, automobiles, and electronics.
Coronavirus curbs have led companies to shut factories and suspend or reduce operations at a time when Asia's manufacturing sector is already grappling with rising raw material costs and signs of a slowing Chinese economy.
Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are three of the region's major manufacturing hubs and produce goods for some of the world's largest consumer brands.
VIETNAM
A coronavirus wave since April forced Vietnam's largest cities and industrial hubs to impose strict lockdowns, prompting electronics, apparel and footwear manufacturers to suspend or reduce operations. The restrictions have been eased in recent weeks.
The outbreak initially hit northern industrial areas, where suppliers for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (KS:005930) and other global tech firms are located.
In May, the northern province of Bac Giang ordered four industrial parks, including three that house production facilities of Taiwan's Foxconn, to temporarily shut down.
The outbreak spread further south and, in July, Ho Chi Minh City and neighbouring industrial provinces imposed strict lockdown measures.
That month, Taiwan's Pou Chen Corp, which makes footwear for  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), suspended operations at its plant in Ho Chi Minh City and Changshin Vietnam, a South Korean firm manufacturing shoes for Nike, shut three of its factories.
Nike has cut its fiscal 2022 sales expectations and warned of holiday delays. Buyers of Apple's new iPhone 13 are facing longer-than-expected delivery times because of the outbreak in Vietnam, where components for the device's new camera module are assembled.
The Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association said several international fashion brands have shifted their orders away from Vietnam and 60% of apparel and footwear makers in the country have been fined for slow deliveries. 
MALAYSIA 
Several automakers and semiconductor companies have said in recent months that pandemic-related disruptions in Malaysia were hitting supply chains.
Malaysia imposed a lockdown in June as infections hit record levels but has gradually eased restrictions on manufacturing since July.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Stablecoins to face same safeguards as traditional payments,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Stablecoins would have to comply with the same safeguards as their more traditional competitors in payments under proposals from regulators on Wednesday as authorities get to grips with a rapidly evolving sector.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable value relative to traditional currencies, or to a commodity such as gold, to avoid the volatility that makes bitcoin and other digital tokens impractical for most commerce.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s move in 2019 to introduce its own stablecoin Diem, then known as Libra, raised concerns among governments and central banks that a major payments competitor could emerge overnight with little regulation.
Since then, Diem has radically scaled back its ambitions and plans to launch a U.S. dollar stablecoin.
The IOSCO group of securities regulators and the Bank for International Settlements, a global forum for central banks, set out on Wednesday how current rules for major clearing, settlement and payments services should also be applied to 'systemic' or heavily used stablecoins.
The proposals, put out to public consultation before being finalised early next year, put into practice what regulators have long called for: the same rules for the same type of business and accompanying risks.
The rules mean a stablecoin operator must set up a legal entity which spells out how it is governed and manages operational risks like cyber attacks.
Though still little-used for commerce, the use of stablecoins in crypto trading has grown rapidly as retail and larger investors warmed to the emerging asset class during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Tether, the largest stablecoin, has a market capitalisation of around $68 billion versus just $15 billion a year ago. The value of circulating USD Coin, another major stablecoin, has also jumped dramatically to over $30 billion from just $2.7 billion a year ago, according to CoinMarketCap.
Countries that allow stablecoins to operate would be required to apply the principles as part of their affiliation to IOSCO and the BIS.

""This report marks significant progress in understanding the implications of stablecoin arrangements for the financial system and providing clear and practical guidance on the standards they need to meet to maintain its integrity,"" IOSCO Chair Ashley Alder said in a statement.
The proposals do not cover issues specific to stablecoins pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, which are being considered separately.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened sharply Wednesday on concerns that high inflation, fed by increasing energy costs, will force central banks to tighten monetary policy faster, choking off the post-pandemic recovery.
At 3:40 AM ET (0740 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.8% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1.3%.
German factory orders, a normally reliable leading indicator of trends in Europe's largest economy, set the negative tone with a shock 7.7% decline in August, a sharp slowdown from the 4.9% gain in July. The slump was caused largely by the key automotive sector, which has repeatedly flagged problems with its supply chain this year. 
European investors had already received a weak handover from Asia, after New Zealand's central bank hiked interest rates by for the first time in seven years in an attempt to get on top of inflationary pressures, and signalled further tightening was to come. In Europe, Romania had become the latest emerging country to hike on Tuesday and Poland is expected to follow suit on Thursday.
Energy markets continue to create headaches for industry, with U.K. gas prices hitting a new all-time high of 330 pence a therm, around 97 euros a megawatt-hour. 
Oil also traded at multi-year highs amid global concerns about energy supply, particularly after the so-called OPEC+ bloc decided against speeding up a pre-agreed pace of output increases.

In corporate news, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) stock soared 4.8% after the U.K. supermarket chain raised its full-year outlook as it reported a 16.6% rise in first-half core retail profit. It also announced a share buyback, with the first tranche of 500 million pounds in shares to be bought by October 2022. 
Bayer  (DE:BAYGN) outperformed, holding steady after a judge ruled that its Roundup weedkiller wasn't the cause of a boy's rare form of cancer - a welcome win in a series of largely unsuccesful legal battles over the product.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>",From bratwurst to jamon: EU pork sector crown shifts to Spain,"By Emma Pinedo, Michael Hogan and Nigel Hunt
MADRID/HAMBURG (Reuters) - When he was a child in Avila province, Albert Pascual's father bought 100 pigs, but the company he now leads has more than 9,000 - part of a major expansion that has put Spain on track to take over as the European Union's top pork producer this year.
""My father sold pigs at a time, in the 1990s, when this sector practically did not exist. Now we (Spain) are a world power, we have grown a lot and our company has grown in parallel to the development and growth of this sector,"" Pascual said.
Germany has long topped the table of EU pork producers, but an outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in September 2020 among wild boars meant it lost access to the lucrative Chinese market.
That has accelerated a shift in EU production towards ASF-free Spain that was already underway, helped by its less onerous regulations in areas such as planning and use of manure. 
China is by far the largest export market for EU pig products, accounting for about 56% of sales so far in 2021, according to European Commission data.
The country's appetite for imported pork has soared following its own ASF outbreak which has ravaged its vast hog herd, the world's largest.
""The fact that in recent years it (China) has been affected by African swine fever has caused demand to skyrocket,"" said Ramon Soler Ciurana, export manager of Faccsa-Prolongo, a pork producer in Malaga in the south of Spain which is expanding its pork packaging and freezing facilities.
EU shipments of pig products to China totalled 3.34 million tonnes last year, up more than 60% from 2.31 million in 2019 and almost triple the 1.28 million in 2018.
Exports have remained high this year and totalled 1.86 million from January to July, down just 0.1% from a strong 2020, EU data shows.
""It is taken for granted in the industry that China, no matter how hard it runs or tries to find alternatives, will not be able to get back to normality within four years,"" Soler said.
GERMAN WOES
Germany's export woes, however, have only accelerated a trend that has been developing for years.
Spain's pigmeat production totalled 2.60 million tonnes during the first six months of 2021, up 4.1% from the same period last year, according to European Commission data, and is track for an eighth consecutive annual rise.
In contrast, Germany's pigmeat production fell by 1.3% to 2.52 million tonnes and is heading for an fifth consecutive annual fall.
German market consultancy AMI says there were 24.6 million pigs on German farms in May 2021, down 3.5% from 25.5 million in May 2020, continuing a downward trend from 28.1 million in 2014.
The impact of ASF has been particularly severe in east Germany near the border with Poland where the disease has been found in wild boars and more recently domestic pigs. Measures such as a ban on breeding piglets have been imposed and some slaughterhouses have been reluctant to buy pigs from the region.
TOUGH RULES
Tougher animal welfare and environmental rules in Germany have contributed to the decline in pig farming along with falling domestic demand for the meat, linked partly to more health-conscious eating with avoidance of red meat and moves among young people to vegetarianism.
Germany has strict planning rules which has made it difficult for the industry to adapt to animal welfare legislation related to issues such as the use of sow stalls.
""Even if German farmers want to invest in new pig stalls, they often cannot get planning approval from local authorities,"" said Andre Vielstaedte, a spokesperson for Toennies, Germany's largest slaughterhouse and meatpacking group.
In part of Germany, restrictions have also been imposed on the use of manure, linked to concerns about high ammonia concentration in the air.
Spanish pig farmers, in contrast, benefit from strong demand for slurry, a natural fertiliser made from manure and water, as soils in much of the country have become depleted and lack sufficient organic matter. 
INVESTMENT IN SPAIN
Toennies is among those investing in Spain.
The company, based in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in the west of Germany, is building a meat packing and slaughterhouse plant in Calamocha in Spain, costing about 75 million euros ($87 million).
Operations will start in 2023 and the plant will slaughter 2.4 million animals a year, with up to 1,000 jobs created.
""The pork market in Spain is looking attractive and the political framework is positive,"" said Toennies’ Vielstaedte.
""Our new Spanish plant will be aimed exclusively at exports to markets including pork ribs to North America, bellies to Japan and other products such as pigs’ feet and ears to China and elsewhere in Asia."" 
Vielstaedte said Germany remained the company's ""core market,"" but ASF was just one factor making it less attractive for pig farming and the international marketing of pork.
""We have a one sided regulatory burden ... as animal welfare and protecting the environment create extra costs and need new investment, but which are often not faced by farmers in other countries,"" he said.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
    China has continued to report outbreaks of ASF this year, including in three of the top five pork producing areas, Henan, Sichuan and Shandong, with imports set to remain high in 2022.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service forecast earlier this year China's pork production would fall 14% in 2022, reflecting a smaller hog herd and low profits for domestic producers.
It projected imports would total 5.1 million tonnes in 2022, just shy of 2020's record 5.28 million.
Prior to its own ASF outbreak, however, China was only importing 1.5-2.0 million tonnes of pork a year and industry sources expect imports to eventually slow as its herd is rebuilt.
""This is one of the great challenges we face,"" Soler said.

""Obviously the Chinese market will return to normal sooner or later and we will return to pre-crisis figures. The objective of maintaining the level of production will depend on our capacity to open new markets.""

Germany-based TUI has taken on loans of over 4 billion euros and been bailed out multiple times by the German government after COVID-19 stopped holidays for much of last year and the beginning of this year.
But this summer, travel within Europe has returned, giving TUI the confidence to proceed with the equity raise on Wednesday, which it said would leave it better placed to take advantage of the recovery. 
Its largest shareholder, the Mordashov family, planned to undertake all subscription rights linked to its 32% holding in the group under the fully underwritten 10 new shares for every 21 existing shares offer. 
""The capital increase will enable us to take a significant step closer to our goal of rapidly repaying the government loans,"" TUI's chief executive Fritz Joussen said in a statement. 
Summer bookings had risen to 5.2 million, TUI said, compared to about 9 million in a typical summer, benefiting from a surge in demand in August driven by customers from Germany and the Netherlands.
TUI said it expected an uptick in travel this winter given restrictions had eased and it was planning to operate 60% to 80% of its normal programme. By summer 2022 it expected volumes to have returned to pre-pandemic levels, it added. 

Following the capital increase, TUI's cash and available facilities will rise to 4.5 billion euros from 3.4 billion euros on Oct. 4.

The move comes amid heightened scrutiny of environmental issues among consumers, especially from the younger generations, key sources of future revenue growth for luxury labels.
Dubbed the ""watch and jewellery initiative 2030"", the goals include targets to reduce carbon emissions, protect biodiversity and adopt practices defined by the Responsible Jewellery Council, a standard-setting industry body, by the year 2030.

Kering has already cast itself as an industry champion on the environmental front for the apparel industry. In 2019, its chairman, Francois-Henri Pinault, gathered dozens of international labels to sign the so-called Fashion Pact of commitments, including reducing emissions and plastic-use. 
The partners in the watch-and-jewellery initiative intend to start recruiting European labels before moving on to those from other countries, Cartier Chief Executive Officer Cyrille Vigneron said, citing a list of large brands, including Tiffany.
""We think there will be quite a rather large number of key brands and then the smaller ones as well but also key suppliers, with distributors who will join the initiative,"" Vigneron said.

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube said it has removed R&B singer R. Kelly's channels from its video platform, distancing itself from the singer who was convicted of sex trafficking last month.
R. Kelly was convicted by a federal jury in September in his sex trafficking trial, where prosecutors accused the singer of exploiting his stardom over a quarter-century to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex.
Two of his channels, RKellyTV and RKellyVevo, have been removed from one of the world's largest video platforms and the singer will no longer be able to create or own any other YouTube channel, YouTube said in a statement sent late on Monday, following Reuters' request for comment.
The catalog of his music will however be available on YouTube Music, YouTube's audio-streaming service, and the videos uploaded by other YouTube users will continue to be available. 
""We can confirm that we have terminated two channels linked to R. Kelly in accordance with our creator responsibility guidelines,"" a YouTube spokesperson told Reuters in a statement.
The MuteRKelly campaign, founded by two Black women in 2017 to try to remove the singer's music from the air waves, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/OffMuteRKelly/status/1445570932089626636, ""Waiting on you @youtubemusic, and you too @Spotify @AppleMusic @AmazonMusic, etc.""
Contacted outside of regular U.S. business hours, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters seeking comment on whether they would be taking similar action over R Kelly's music available on their platforms.
Kelly's music has largely disappeared from radio but is still available on streaming platforms. His hit record ""I Believe I Can Fly"" was for years a popular choice at graduation ceremonies.

Kelly faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars, and could face up to life in prison at his May 4, 2022, sentencing.
The singer, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is one of the most prominent people tried on sex charges during the #MeToo movement, which amplified accusations that had dogged him since the early 2000s.

PARIS (Reuters) - Defence company Thales and Google are partnering to offer state-vetted cloud computing services for the storage of some of France's most sensitive data, the companies said on Wednesday. 
The alliance between Thales, Europe's largest defence electronics supplier, and the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit fulfils a May government plan under which France acknowledged U.S. technological superiority in the field.
The French government said then that cloud computing services developed by Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be used to store France's most sensitive state and corporate data, provided the services were licensed to French companies. 
In their joint statement, Thales and Google Cloud said they will create a France-based company and Thales will be the majority shareholder. 
That company will provide the whole range of Google Cloud's services but its network and servers would be separate from those used for regular Google clients.
""The company is going to run Google software on its infrastructure... with layers of security to ensure cybersecurity and protection of data from extraterritorial rules,"" said Marc Darmon, head of secure communications and information systems at Thales. 
Google and Microsoft, along with market leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services, dominate cloud storage worldwide, fuelling concerns in Europe over the risk of surveillance by the United States in the wake of the adoption of the U.S. CLOUD Act of 2018.
The Thales-Google partnership will need the blessing of France's cybersecurity agency ANSSI to get a ""trusted cloud"" label. 
However, its head, Guillaume Poupard, has already welcomed the project, saying in a statement it fulfilled the criteria needed for the certification. 

The company should be created in first-half of 2022 and be running by the start of 2023, the two groups said. 
It would compete against Bleu, a joint company to be set up by IT consulting firm Capgemini and telecoms group Orange and which aims to use Microsoft's cloud technology.

Centaline filed a suit against Evergrande in September to recover HK$3.1 million ($398,196) in overdue commissions, a court filing showed, while the South China Morning Post newspaper reported Midland Holdings is claiming unpaid commission of HK$43.45 million for two developments in Hong Kong. 
An executive at Centaline China told Reuters they have also filed a suit against Evergrande in a Guangzhou court in southern China, seeking to claim hundreds of millions of yuan it says it is due. 
Centaline confirmed to Reuters it filed a claim in Hong Kong last month, but declined to comment further. Midland declined to comment, saying the case was going through legal procedures. Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hong Kong's exposure to debt-laden developer China Evergrande is ""very minimal"" at 0.05%, or HK$14 billion ($1.79 billion) of banking assets and will not cause any systemic risks, the newspaper reported on Sunday, citing the city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan. 
Evergrande has vowed to repay its suppliers and contractors in mainland China as soon as possible, in some cases offering apartments or other real estate assets, as construction at many of its sites have halted because of delayed payments.
With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its cash crunch could spread through China's financial system and reverberate globally, a worry that has eased with the Chinese central bank's vow last week to protect homebuyers' interests.
Growing worries about defaults at Chinese property developers triggered a rout in their shares and bonds on Tuesday with fresh credit rating downgrades and uncertainty about the fate of cash-strapped China Evergrande Group sapping investor sentiment. 

Last month it missed coupon payments on two dollar bond tranches and is scrambling to sell assets to pay creditors, prioritising repayment to onshore lenders in the last few weeks.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 10:20PM ET</span>",Airlines warn erratic global COVID-19 rules could delay recovery,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Tim Hepher
BOSTON (Reuters) - Global airlines on Tuesday wrapped up their first meeting since COVID-19 brought their industry to its knees, voicing optimism about pent-up demand but desperate for governments to harmonize disjointed border rules to avoid slipping back into recession.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which groups 290 airlines, said confusion over travel restrictions were holding back the industry's fragile recovery after the pandemic plunged air travel into its worst ever downturn.
""People want to fly. We've seen strong evidence of that,"" said Director General Willie Walsh. ""They can't fly because we have restrictions that are impeding international travel.""
IATA expects international travel to double next year compared with the depressed levels seen during the pandemic and reach 44% of pre-crisis 2019 levels. In contrast, domestic travel is tipped to reach 93% of the pre-pandemic levels.
The trade group, which includes dozens of state-owned carriers, blamed that gap on wide variations in entry rules and testing requirements in the top 50 air travel markets. 
Even some of the airline and leasing company leaders trying to attend the industry's annual gathering in Boston were unable to travel or had to carve out extra time for quarantine.
Airlines called for an end to restrictions on vaccinated travelers and for common health protocols at borders, though global coordination in aviation tends to move at a deliberate pace.
""Frankly, governments haven't made it easy for airlines or for the traveling public to understand what the rules are to fly,"" said Joanna Geraghty, president of JetBlue which hosted the gathering in a hotel shared with domestic tourists. 
Even so, the head of Dubai's Emirates, who has been among the most bullish executives on the prospects for recovery once restrictions end, said bookings in markets that were reopening like Britain and the United States had ""gone up exponentially.""
""That reflects a bow-wave of demand that we are seeing everywhere,"" its president Tim Clark said. ""The demand for air travel will restore itself... sooner rather than later.""
ATLANTIC TEST
Airlines were buoyed by the Biden administration's plan to reopen the United States in November to air travelers from 33 countries including in Europe on the vital trans-Atlantic run.
But airlines left the Boston gathering as they had arrived, with severely strained balance sheets, and Clark said most would remain risk-averse and focused on recouping cash for 2-3 years.
IATA warned serious challenges remained for carriers, while venting frustration at airports and other suppliers for not doing enough to share the pain inflicted by the crisis.
While the White House has not set a date for lifting travel restrictions on Europeans, JetBlue expects it to happen ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday next month.
""If the reopening is delayed, we are going to face consequences across the industry,"" Chief Executive Robin Hayes said after chairing the Oct. 3-5 conference, which also agreed a target to reach net zero emissions in 2050.
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the bookings for trans-Atlantic flights last week were higher than at the same period in 2019.

The world's largest leasing company, AerCap, said a successful reopening of the world's most important long-haul market would set a trend for other markets to follow.
""Airlines... don't have the resilience they had,"" Chief Executive Aengus Kelly told an audience of airline leaders. ""They just can't afford for this to go wrong.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Wednesday morning, as soaring inflation due to increasing energy costs continue to dampen investor sentiment about the economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.93% by 10:05 PM ET (2:05 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.85%, with data released earlier in the day showing that the consumer price index grew 2.5% year-on-year in September.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.43%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.22%, with the city's chief executive Carrie Lam handing down her annual policy address later in the day.
Chinese markets were closed for a holiday. However, worries about China’s property sector continued as regulatory tightening continues. The impact on investor sentiment was demonstrated on Tuesday when representatives of Man Group, Soros Fund Management, and Elliott Management raised concerns about the outlook for Chinese stocks.
Data released on Tuesday showed that the U.S. services purchasing managers index (PMI) was 54.9 for September, while the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) non-manufacturing PMI was 61.9. The higher-than-expected data, alongside the inflation risks from spiraling costs for crude oil and natural gas, are adding to the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to begin asset tapering.
Volatility has increased in global markets as investors prepare for a slower but still strong economic recovery, and other central banks also signal preparations to begin asset tapering.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked its interest rate to 0.50% from the previous month’s 0.25% as it handed down its policy decision earlier in the day, with the Reserve Bank of India will hand down its decision on Friday. The latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, will also be released on the same day.
The ongoing debate in the U.S. Congress over the nation’s debt ceiling and President Joe Biden’s economic agenda is also contributing to market uncertainty.
“For the last five or six months we’ve entered a period of kind of a mini-cycle in the U.S. where you’ve got a changing Fed regime, and we are at the extended end of a recovery,” Union Bancaire Privee Head of Equity Research for Asia Kieran Calder told Bloomberg.
“It leaves the market vulnerable to external shocks and increased volatility.”"

ZURICH (Reuters) -Switzerland's Federal Administrative Court has rejected Swisscom's appeal over the standards it has to use in expanding fibre-optic networks to consumers, the court said on Tuesday.
The case centred on whether Swisscom could use a different standard than the one telecoms companies had agreed in a round table with regulators, the court said in a statement. 
The Swiss Competition Commission had provisionally prohibited Swisscom from pursuing its network expansion until the commission had concluded an investigation, a decision that Swisscom had appealed against in January.
""Swisscom was unable to credibly substantiate to the court that there were sufficient technological or economic grounds to deviate from the fibre-optic standard,"" it ruled in a verdict that may be appealed at the Swiss supreme court.

The telecom company said that it regrets the court decision and considers the precautionary measures to be misguided.
""We are convinced that our conduct is fair and in line with competition law and will now consider our next steps,"" Swisscom CEO Urs Schaeppi said in a statement.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 09:26PM ET</span>",Facebook 'operating in the shadows' says whistleblower as U.S. lawmakers demand probes,"By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers pounded Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Tuesday, accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and they demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.
Zuckerberg, hours later in a public Facebook post, defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals.
""The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,"" he wrote. ""We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don't want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed."" 
During a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing, whistleblower Frances Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them. 
""As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable,"" said Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team. She left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents.
""The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" Haugen said.
In an era when bipartisanship is rare in Washington, lawmakers from both parties excoriated the company, illustrating the rising anger in Congress with Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp.
Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said he was concerned how Facebook and subsidiaries like Instagram affected the mental health of children. ""We're going to look back 20 years from now and all of us are going to be like, 'What the hell were we thinking?'""
Haugen revealed she was the person who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-oversight-board-seeks-clarity-review-system-high-profile-users-2021-09-21 and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teenage girls. She compared the social media services to addictive substances like tobacco and opioids.
Panel chair Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Facebook knew that its products were addictive. ""Tech now faces that big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he said.
He called for Zuckerberg to testify before the committee, and for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.
""Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror,"" Blumenthal said.
Blumenthal said after the hearing that he would want to ask Zuckerberg why he rejected recommendations to make products safer for users.
Zuckerberg, in his post, said Facebook would not stop researching its societal impact. But he wrote that Congress needed to update rules to make clear the legal age for teens to use internet services, how to verify their ages and where to ""balance teens' privacy while giving parents visibility into their activity.""
SHARES UP
Facebook's shares rose 2% on Tuesday to close at $332.96, roughly 13% below the record closing high on Sept. 7.
Coming a day after Facebook suffered an hours-long outage, Haugen pointed to the outage in her testimony: ""For more than five hours Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.""
As lawmakers criticized Facebook, the company's spokespeople fired back on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and in statements, arguing that Haugen did not work directly on some of the topics being raised.
""We don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about,"" Facebook spokeswoman Lena Pietsch said.
Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, accused Facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its services. ""It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users,"" she said.
Last week, Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, defended the company in front of Congress and said that it was seeking to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings.
Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, said she would write Facebook to insist that it not delete documents related to Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority Rohingya. An aide said she would ask for broader retention of documents.
A U.S. federal judge last month had ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media company had shut down.
Haugen said she would encourage ""oversight and public scrutiny"" into Facebook's content recommendation algorithms and their consequences. She suggested creating a dedicated body within the federal government to oversee social media companies.
Blumenthal said he might want to hold an additional hearing to discuss national security issues related to Facebook.
Haugen said Facebook had also done too little to prevent violence.
Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results.

Senator Edward Markey, speaking to the absent Zuckerberg, said during the hearing: ""Your time of invading our privacy and preying on children is over. Congress will be taking action.""
Throughout the hearing lawmakers referred to Zuckerberg as going sailing instead of facing his responsibilities. The CEO this weekend posted a video https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUlJKmYBjwa taken with the company's new smart glasses of his wife in a boat.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>",Factbox: How could America's debt ceiling showdown play out?,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is locked in a standoff that risks triggering a financial and economic meltdown if lawmakers don't raise a limit on government borrowing before Oct. 18, the day the U.S. Treasury could run out of cash for paying government bills.
The drama's central players are Senator Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republican minority in the Senate and has vowed to obstruct normal legislative efforts to raise the debt ceiling, and Senator Chuck Schumer, leader of the chamber's Democratic majority and an ally of President Joe Biden. 
Here are some ways the battle might play out in the Senate:
RECONCILIATION
Schumer has twice tried to win approval of a debt ceiling increase under regular legislative procedures and is set to try again on Wednesday. 
Prior attempts were blocked by McConnell's Republicans, who have used the Senate's filibuster rule which requires a 60-vote majority to approve most legislation. The 100-member chamber is evenly split and Democrats can only muster 51 votes when Vice President Kamala Harris casts a tie-breaking vote.
If Schumer's attempt on Wednesday fails, as expected, the Democrat could switch to using an arcane legislative process known as reconciliation. That bypasses the filibuster and Democrats would only need a simple majority to win. This path carries its own risks, however, as congressional rules would require a lengthy process https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-could-us-senate-democrats-raise-debt-limit-their-own-2021-10-04 in both the House of Representatives and Senate. 
MCCONNELL RELENTS
McConnell could lift the Republican filibuster blockade in the vote on Wednesday or in subsequent days if Schumer sticks with his current strategy and keeps bringing up the failed bill or a similar one for votes. 
Financial market investors have so far been largely sanguine about the risks, betting that Washington won't manufacture a financial crisis by defaulting on its debt.
But as Oct. 18 approaches, markets could swoon, ramping up pressure on McConnell.
FILIBUSTER REFORM
Democrats and Republicans have periodically sparred over the debt ceiling, particularly over the last 10 years as Washington has grown more polarized.
In the past, a minority party has often used the debate as leverage to pass other legislative priorities, such as deficit reduction. On Monday, McConnell has said his party has no demands and merely wants Democrats to use the reconciliation process.
Schumer could counter by moving to ban the use of the filibuster on debt ceiling bills, said William Hoagland, a former Republican Senate staffer now at the Bipartisan Policy Center. 
There are risks, however. Changing Senate rules would require every vote the Democrats can muster and some prominent members of the party are diehard supporters of the filibuster.
DEFAULT

While not seen as a likely scenario, if Washington exhausts the few remaining tools it has for coping with its $28.4 trillion borrowing limit around Oct. 18, it will only have incoming tax receipts for paying its bills. And because it currently borrows more than 20 cents for every dollar it spends, the Treasury would start missing payments https://www.reuters.com/business/standing-precipice-washington-courts-debt-limit-catastrophe-2021-09-29 owed to lenders, citizens or both. 
Shock waves would ripple through global financial markets. Domestic spending cuts would push the U.S. economy into recession as the government misses payments on everything from Social Security benefits for the elderly to soldiers' salaries.

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - U.S. tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) should be regulated by the EU country where they are based under proposed EU rules, a top lawmaker said on Tuesday, knocking back efforts by some countries to broaden the planned act's scope. 
The country of origin principle is set out in EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's draft rules known as the Digital Services Act which requires U.S. tech giants to do more to police the internet for illegal and harmful content.
The principle means Ireland is responsible for regulating Apple, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook because they have their European headquarters there while Amazon is subject to Luxembourg's supervision.
France and a few other countries are seeking to broaden the scope, worried that enforcement concentrated in just two countries may weaken the rules and also slow down decision-making.
Lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, who is steering the DSA through the European Parliament and has power to amend or add other provisions to it, supports the act's core proposal. 
""It makes sense to keep the country of origin principle,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
Schaldemose however wants to go one step further than Vestager by including a ban on some targeted advertising in the DSA.

""Targeted advertisements that are based on your behaviour on Facebook, for instance, that should not be allowed. Advertisements based on the fact that you have visited websites for buying shoes and things like that, classic commercial advertisements should probably be allowed,"" she said.
Schaldemoe said she hopes to finalise her draft with other lawmakers in the next two months so she can thrash out a deal with EU countries next year before the proposed rules can be implemented.

(Reuters) -An error during routine maintenance on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s network of data centers caused Monday's collapse of its global system for more than six hours, leading to a torrent of problems that delayed the repairs, the company said on Tuesday.
The outage was the largest that Downdetector, a web monitoring firm, said it had ever seen. It blocked access to apps for billions of users of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, further intensifying weeks of scrutiny for the nearly $1 trillion company.
At a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday, a former employee turned whistleblower accused Facebook of putting profits before people's safety, which the company denies.
In a blog post, Facebook Vice President of engineering Santosh Janardhan explained the company's engineers issued a command that unintentionally disconnected Facebook data centers from the rest of the world.
Facebook's systems are designed to audit commands to prevent mistakes, but the audit tool had a bug and failed to stop the command that caused the outage, the company said.
The outage was not caused by malicious activity, it added.
While users lost access to one of the world's most popular messaging apps - WhatsApp has more than 2 billion users - employees were also blocked from internal tools.
The outage knocked out tools that engineers would normally use to investigate and repair such outages, making the task even more difficult, Facebook said.
The company said it sent a team of engineers to the location of its data centers to try to debug and restart the systems.
However, it took the company extra time to get engineers inside to work on the servers due to the high physical and system security in place.
Even after network connectivity was restored to the data centers, Facebook said it worried a surge in traffic would cause its websites and apps to crash.

But because the company had run drills to prepare for such situations, access to its services returned relatively quickly.
""Every failure like this is an opportunity to learn and get better,"" Janardhan wrote. ""From here on out, our job is to ... make sure events like this happen as rarely as possible.""

(Reuters) -A2 Milk Co Ltd said on Wednesday Australian law firm Slater and Gordon has filed a class action lawsuit against the dairy firm on behalf of investors who bought its shares over a nine-month period when it issued multiple earnings downgrades.
Shares of a2 Milk, which had plunged 62% during the nine-month period from August 2020 to May 2021, fell as much as 5.3% to NZ$6.450 following the news and were on track for their worst session in more than a month.
The class action alleges that a2 Milk engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of the Corporations Act, and also breached continuous disclosure rules in posting four downgrades between September 2020 and May 2021, Slater and Gordon said in a statement.
The downgrades came amid Australia's souring ties with top trade partner China since 2018 and subsequent disruptions in the ""daigou"" channel, where Chinese shoppers buy products from outside China and resell it in the country. The channel accounts for a major portion of a2 Milk's revenue.
""There was a strong basis to allege that the company provided misleading guidance and was obliged to correct the market's understanding of its financial position at a much earlier time,"" Slater and Gordon Class Actions Practice Group Leader Kaitlin Ferris said. 

A2 Milk, which has lost nearly half its value since December, denied any liabilities and said it would ""vigorously"" defend the proceedings.
The lawsuit, which was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria, comes months after media reports concerning a potential class action by the law firm.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) won its first trial over claims its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer after a California jury found that the herbicide was not a substantial cause of a child's rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the company said on Tuesday.
Destiny Clark alleged that her son Ezra developed Burkitt's lymphoma after he was exposed to Roundup which she sprayed on weeds at the family residence. 
Clark sued  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), which is owned by Bayer (OTC:BAYRY), for failing to warn her of the cancer risks of using Roundup. 
The verdict is the fourth involving Roundup and the first in the company's favor. 
Roundup-related lawsuits have dogged Bayer since it acquired the brand as part of its $63 billion purchase of agricultural seeds and pesticides maker Monsanto in 2018.
Bayer said in a statement the verdict was consistent with decades of science and research showing the safety of glyphosate, the main ingredient in Roundup.
""While we have great sympathy for Ezra Clark and his family, the jury carefully considered the science applicable to this case and determined that Roundup was not the cause of his illness,"" the company said.
An attorney for Clark said they will consider an appeal.
""We're disappointed for the boy and his family,"" said Fletcher Trammel. ""We have multiple Roundup cases set across the country over the next year and look forward to trying them.""
Two of the other three verdicts are still being appealed by Bayer, including one the company hopes will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, where a ruling for Bayer could effectively end the Roundup cases.

The company has settled around 96,000 Roundup cases of about 125,000. 
In May, a federal judge rejected Bayer's plan to resolve future cases, which would have provided compensation but limited the ability of individuals to sue.

(Reuters) - About 1,400 Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co cereal plant employees went on a strike on Tuesday, hoping to get the packaged foods maker to negotiate what a labor union called a ""fair contract"" for the workers.
The Froot Loops cereal maker has been negotiating the payment and benefits terms of a new contract - the existing one expired at midnight on Monday - with union workers for a while now.
Kellogg has demanded that workers give up quality health care, retirement benefits, and holiday and vacation pay, said Anthony Shelton, president of Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union. 
Shelton said Kellogg has threatened to send additional jobs to Mexico if workers do not accept its proposals.
However, Kellogg, which brings in about a third of its sales from cereals, said its compensation and benefits for U.S. cereal plant employees were among the industry's best.
""We are disappointed by the union's decision to strike ... our offer includes increases to pay and benefits for our employees,"" Kellogg spokesperson Kris Bahner said.
The company also said it was implementing contingency plans to deal with supply disruptions, including internal and third-party resources.
The workers went on strikes at plants in Battle Creek, Michigan, Omaha, Nebraska, Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee.

The union used what looked like an angry version of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes mascot, Tony the Tiger, in posters asking people to join the picket. Pictures on social media showed several workers holding banners outside the facilities.
""The company has a pretty good idea on how long they are willing to hold out and we are going to stand fast as long as we have to,"" said Daniel Osborn, president of the local union in Omaha, noting the strike had gone on for 18 hours already.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is asking business leaders to meet with President Joe Biden on Wednesday about the need to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, according to a person familiar with the plans.
The proposed meeting is part of a broader White House strategy to pressure Republicans to vote for a debt ceiling increase or allow Biden's Democrats to increase it alone, without throwing procedural hurdles in the way.
The Treasury Department has estimated that it has until roughly Oct. 18 for Congress to raise the government's $28.4 trillion borrowing limit or risk a debt default that could spark potentially catastrophic consequences for the world's largest economy.
The meeting with business leaders could underscore that executives in the corporate community want to avoid the chaos of a battle over the debt ceiling and put pressure on top Republican leaders such U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Republicans in Congress tend to favor policies perceived to be business-friendly.
There were no details so far on which leaders or companies would be involved. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a leading business lobbying group, has pressed Congress to increase the debt ceiling and warned that default is not an option.
Democrats control both the House of Representatives and the Senate with razor thin majorities. But Republicans, with an eye toward the believed political benefit of painting Biden's party as overseeing out-of-control spending, have declined to vote for the increase.

The White House has argued that both parties have supported increasing the debt ceiling in the past, including multiple times during Republican President Donald Trump's term in office, when most of the debt being covered by this increase was accrued.
Biden and his aides have used significantly sharper rhetoric recently, accusing Republicans of voting directly to let the United States default.

The industry is still hampered by a semiconductor shortage, which is expected to last until next year. Hence, fundamentally weak EV stocks popular on Reddit such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Canoo Inc. (GOEV) are best avoided now.The Reddit community came into the limelight earlier this year, following the GameStop (NYSE:GME) short-squeeze in January. However, this squeeze was short-lived owing to GME’s weak fundamentals. The community is also taking an active interest in the growing electric vehicle (EV) industry.
Supported by federal funding, the EV market is expanding rapidly. However, according to the experts, in the United States, charging facilities are five to 10 times lower than they should be to fulfill Biden’s plan of “50% cars sold to be EVs by 2030.” It requires far more than the $7.5 billion allocated in the infrastructure bill to reach the goal. Additionally, the industry is still grappling with the semiconductor shortage. Since semiconductor is a key component in EV production, the deficit has been affecting the production targets of several companies. Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy expects the semiconductor shortage to continue into 2022 and can potentially extend beyond that.
Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Canoo Inc. (GOEV), which are popular on Reddit, look highly overvalued at their current price levels. So, these stocks are best avoided now.

In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Brooklyn, New York-based company disclosed a near 39% drop in revenue for the fiscal year 2020.
Rent the Runway, which was founded in 2009, lets users rent clothes and shop second-hand merchandise from over 750 designer brands. It had confidentially filed for a listing in July.
The company reported 2020 revenue of $157.5 million, down from $256.9 million a year earlier. Its net loss widened to $171.1 million in the same period, from $153.9 million a year earlier.
The company's top-line also took a hit in the first half of this fiscal year, with revenue down 9% for the six months ended July 31.
Rent the Runway raised funds last year at a valuation of $750 million, below its previous valuation of $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported in June. (https://bloom.bg/3mt348h)
Demand for second-hand clothes has jumped in recent months as customers become increasingly conscious about their carbon footprint, boosting revenues at subscription-based styling service  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) and online resale shop ThredUp.

Positive investor sentiment and fertile market conditions for new listings also helped other retailers like eyewear company Warby Parker and Roger Federer-backed shoemaker On Holding AG ace their market debuts last month.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>",Facebook blames 'faulty configuration change' for nearly six-hour outage,"By Subrat Patnaik, Eva Mathews and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) blamed a ""faulty configuration change https://tmsnrt.rs/3lcz40O"" for a nearly six-hour outage on Monday that prevented the company's 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.
The company in a late Monday blog post https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage did not specify who executed the configuration change and whether it was planned.
Several Facebook employees who declined to be named had told Reuters earlier that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems. 
The failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error, the employees said. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider were both plausible.
""We want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change,"" Facebook said in the blog.
The Facebook outage is the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector. 
The outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-senate-hearing-2021-10-03 accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.
As the world flocked to competing apps such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and TikTok, shares of Facebook fell 4.9%, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. Shares rose about half a percent in after-hours trade following resumption of service.
""To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I'm sorry,"" Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer tweeted, adding that it ""may take some time to get to 100%.""
""Facebook basically locked its keys in its car,"" tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.
Twitter on Monday reported higher-than-normal usage, which led to some issues in people accessing posts and direct messages. 
In one of the day's most popular tweets, video streaming company Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shared a meme from its new hit show ""Squid Game"" captioned ""When Instagram & Facebook are down,"" that showed a person labeled ""Twitter"" holding up a character on the verge of falling labeled ""everyone.""
Inside a Facebook group for ad buyers, one member wisecracked after service returned that ""lots of people searched today 'how to run Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ads for clients.'""
Facebook, which is the world's largest seller of online ads after Google, was losing about $545,000 in U.S. ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to estimates from ad measurement firm Standard Media Index.
Past downtime at internet companies has had little long-term affect on their revenue growth, however.
Facebook's services, including consumer apps such as Instagram, workplace tools it sells to businesses and internal programs, went dark noon Eastern time (1600 GMT). Access started to return around 5:45 pm ET.
Soon after the outage started, Facebook acknowledged users were having trouble accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem or say how many users were affected. 
The error message on Facebook's webpage suggested an error in the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations. A similar outage at cloud company  Akamai Technologies Inc  (NASDAQ:AKAM) took down multiple websites in July.

On Sunday, Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, revealed that she was the whistleblower who provided documents underpinning a recent Wall Street Journal investigation and a U.S. Senate hearing last week on Instagram's harm to teen girls.
Haugen was due to urge the same Senate subcommittee on Tuesday to regulate the company, which she plans to liken to tobacco companies that for decades denied that smoking damaged health, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters.

NEW YORK/MILAN (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Tuesday as U.S. and European tech stocks rebounded and the dollar strengthened ahead of U.S. payrolls data on Friday that could reveal the Federal Reserve's next move on tapering its support to the economy.
Most major U.S. and European stock indices rose more than 1%, while yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a touchstone for investor sentiment, edged above 1.5%. Another jump in crude oil futures fueled inflation fears. 
Investors are focused on Friday, when the U.S. unemployment report for September may determine when the Fed proceeds with plans to begin tapering $120 billion a month of bond purchases.
Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, said the day's rally in stocks was nothing more than a rebound after a weak stretch. The S&P 500 slid less than 4% peak-to-trough from late September, and is up almost 16% year to date.
Friday's report ""will be telling about the direction of both interest rates and the economy, and by definition the equity markets as well,"" Tuz said.
Non-farm payrolls data is expected to show continued improvement in the labor market, with a forecast for 488,000 jobs to have been added last month, a Reuters poll showed.
MSCI's all-country world index, a U.S.-centric gauge of stock performance in 50 countries, closed up 0.69% after trading above 1% earlier in the session.
European stocks closed up 1.17% as rising bank shares and encouraging results from chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) calmed nerves following a tech-fueled sell-off on Wall Street on Monday.
The European tech sector jumped 2.2%, breaking a seven-session losing streak in which it fell 11.7%. European bank stocks rose 3.5% to more than a 1-1/2 year high.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.92%, the S&P 500 gained 1.05% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.25%.
Inflation expectations jumped with the U.S. breakeven rate on five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) rising to 2.61%, the highest level since late July.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 5.5 basis points to yield 1.5362%. Germany's 10-year bund yield, the benchmark for the region, rose 3.5 bps to -0.183%, or 30 basis points higher than it was two months ago.
In Europe, a market-based gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations surged to a new six-year high as rising crude and record gas prices fanned inflation fears.
The five-year euro forward swap hit 1.8369%, the highest since July 2015. It was 1.26% at the start of 2021.
Short-dated yields have jumped as the U.S. Treasury eyes Oct. 18 as when it could run out of cash. Democrats planned a Wednesday vote in the Senate to suspend the U.S. debt ceiling, setting up yet another confrontation with Republicans that risks an economically crippling federal credit default.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, rose 0.16% to 93.997.
The euro slid 0.24% at $1.1593, while the Japanese yen traded up 0.58% at $111.5100. 
Brent crude futures rose to a three-year high while U.S. benchmark oil hit its highest since 2014 after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies stuck to their planned output increase rather than pumping even more crude.
Brent crude rose $1.30 to settle at $82.56 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up $1.31 to $78.93 a barrel.
Gold prices fell as firmer U.S. Treasury yields and a stronger dollar dented the safe-haven metal's appeal. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.4% at $1,760.90 an ounce. 
Market focus in Asia was on whether embattled property developer China Evergrande would offer any respite to investors looking for signs of asset disposals.

Trading in shares in the world's largest indebted developer was halted on Monday but other Chinese property developers grappled with ratings downgrades on worries about their ability to repay debt. 
Bitcoin rose above the $50,000 mark for the first time in four weeks, adding to a series of gains since the start of October. It was last up 4.5% on the day.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could run out of cash by Oct. 18 if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended, cautioning it would be its first-ever default. A two-year suspension of the debt ceiling expired in July and Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain at odds over whether extend or raise it.
""At this stage, given Republicans’ staunch refusal to vote to suspend or raise the debt limit, we expect that Democrats will likely reach an agreement within their own party to raise the debt limit through the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority of Democratic votes in the Senate (50 senators and the vice president), in time to avoid a default,"" the credit rating agency said in a report.
If the limit is not raised, Moody's said it believes the government would prioritize debt payments ""to preserve the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and avoid significant disruptions in the global financial markets."" Moody's said the U.S. faces interest payments of about $4 billion on Oct. 15, $14 billion on Nov. 1, and $49 billion on Nov. 15 and that a missed payment would be classified as a default. 
""Generally, we would not consider that outcome to be consistent with a Aaa rating and would most likely downgrade the rating for all Treasury securities, barring extraordinary

mitigating circumstances,"" it said. 
However, the impact on the U.S. sovereign credit profile and rating is expected to be limited as Moody's said its ratings reflect the expected loss on debt with a U.S. default presumed to be short-lived and cured with a 100% recovery rate.

Investing.com --Stocks rebounded as investors swooped in for bargains following Monday’s tech rout.
Growth stocks were bouncing back on Tuesday, supported by gains in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). Even  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was trading higher despite any fallout from its world-wide outage on Monday and harsh Congressional testimony about its business by a former employee. 
Crude prices continued to surge, as well. The price of Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark, reached above $79 a barrel. 
The international oil cartel decided on Monday they wouldn’t add extra production despite the rising prices. Instead, they are holding to their agreement to add 400,000 barrels a day each month until the pandemic-induced production cuts are restored. 
In Washington, lawmakers were still haggling over the details of a massive social spending and climate change package, including its ultimate size, while Democrat leaders are pressing for an increase to the debt limit. 
But the big event this week continues to be the release of the jobs report for September this Friday. Many believe the outcome will help pave the way for the Federal Reserve to begin easing off its monthly bond purchases. A preview comes early with the release of ADP’s private payroll report.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Private payrolls
ADP, the payroll processing company, will release data at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT) for the month-on-month change in nonfarm employment. According to estimates tracked by Investing.com, private companies in the U.S. are expected to add 428,000 jobs in September, more than August’s 374,000. The August number had come well below estimates.
2. Have a shot
Drinks giant Constellation Brands Inc Class A (NYSE:STZ) is seen reporting a profit per share of $2.78 on revenue of $2.3 billion for the second quarter. The company makes beer, wine, and spirits such as tequila but analysts will be listening for updates on sales of spiked seltzers.
3. Apparel earnings
Jeans and casual wear giant  Levi Strauss & Co  Class A (NYSE:LEVI) is expected to report a second-quarter profit per share of 37 cents and revenue of 1.48 billion.

Given the industry’s bleak growth expectation, it could be prudent to avoid stocks such as General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which are expected to see large sales declines in the third quarter.Auto manufacturing declined sharply, thanks to COVID-19 pandemic-induced restrictions and a decline in demand for new vehicles. And even as major economies are gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels of activity, the auto manufacturing industry continues to be impacted by a global semiconductor chip shortage. According to Cox Automotive, Edmunds, and J.D. Power/LMC Automotive forecasts, vehicle sales from July through September were down between 13% and 14% year-over-year.
As the semiconductor shortage is far from being resolved, several players are compelled to reduce output and close down factories temporarily. According to forecasts, the semiconductor chip shortage is expected to cost $210 billion in revenue to the global automobile market in 2021.
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) are expected to witness the largest third-quarter sales declines, so these stocks are best avoided now.

(Reuters) - Renault-owned sportscar brand Alpine wants to expand its global footprint but has to be well established in Europe before looking further afield, Chief Executive Laurent Rossi said on Tuesday.
Speaking to Reuters ahead of the announcement of Alpine's plans for endurance racing, Rossi did not rule out an eventual presence in Asia and the Americas but said that was not under current consideration.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) is absent from the U.S. market, after two previous failed attempts, but has a strong presence in Latin America. Alpine also has a team in Formula One, with the United States a key market for the sport.
The brand currently focuses on the A110 model but three new sporty electric cars are due to come on stream from 2024.
Rossi said increasing sales in Europe was an immediate priority. Alpine sold 1,200 cars in the first half of this year, mostly in France, Germany and Britain.
""The U.S. is 50% of the sportscar market. The Renault Group is not in the U.S. for good reasons. It exited the U.S. twice. We need to make sure that if we make a return, it’s a successful one,"" he said when asked about that possibility.

""We would probably err on the side of caution because you can’t really mess up a third time. And the Alpine brand is in a rebirth so we have a lot of things to accomplish first, to establish it as a solid, graduated brand in Europe."" 
Rossi said Alpine would use the Renault Group's network of dealers in Europe to drive growth and hoped the next generation of cars would sell in much greater numbers.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin, the world's largest cyrptocurrency in terms of market value, rose on Tuesday, passing the $50,000 mark for the first time in four weeks and adding to gains this month on mounting institutional interest.
In early September, bitcoin fell below $50,000 during a broad selloff in shares of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related firms. It fell further in September, hitting a low of $40,596 on Sept. 21.
On Tuesday, bitcoin rose as high as $50,808.25. It was last up 2.6% at $50,498.
Smaller coins, which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, were also up. Ether rose 1.5% to $3,434 and XRP was up 2.2% at $1.0656.
Market participants cited the increase in institutional crypto services from banks and financial institutions to cope with rising investor demand, as one factor driving bitcoin's surge.
On Tuesday, U.S. Bancorp announced it launched a cryptocurrency custody service for institutional investment managers who have private funds in the United States and Cayman Islands.
On Monday, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) published its first research coverage focused on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets as other mainstream financial institutions strengthen their involvement with the asset class.

The report also cited the surge in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which use blockchain to record the ownership of digital items such as images, videos, collectibles and even land in virtual worlds.

NFT sales surged to $10.7 billion in Q3.

""There is a duty to protect our air and water, and when companies harm these vital resources through negligence — it is a crime,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Mariner East has been slowed by numerous work stoppages by state and local officials mostly related to sinkholes that developed near the pipeline or spills of drilling fluids used to bore under waterways.
Energy Transfer, which was not immediately available for comment, said recently it planned to complete all phases of the pipeline expansion by the end of 2021.
Mariner East transports liquids from the Marcellus/Utica shale in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia.
The Attorney General's office said that in addition to repeatedly spilling thousands of gallons of drilling fluid, Energy Transfer on several occasions failed to report the spills to state environmental regulators in spite of the legal requirement to do so.
In addition, the Attorney General's office said the drilling fluid contained unapproved additives at multiple locations that affected drinking water in wells.
“If convicted, this company will be sentenced to fines and restitution. There is no jail time for these environmental crimes, and fines are not enough,"" Shapiro said, noting his office was ""calling for stronger laws to hold these companies accountable.""
Energy Transfer started work on the $2.5 billion Mariner East expansion in February 2017 and originally planned to finish the 350-mile (563-km) pipeline in the third quarter of 2017.
Since May 2017, Pennsylvania has issued about 125 notices of violation to Mariner East, mostly for drilling fluid spills, including two in September.

Another factor is that inflation looks likely to ease in the coming months as supply chain issues are sorted out. However, Taylor Dart explains why Q4 could be quite strong for silver.Precious metals bulls hoping for a stronger second half of the year have not been rewarded yet, with silver (SLV) sliding more than 16% in Q3, falling deeper into negative territory year-to-date. This horrid Q3 performance followed a sharp reversal and 6% drop in June, and it’s now up to the bulls to play strong defense as we Q4. The good news for investors is that silver seasonality is very strong in Q4, often finding a low in late Q3 or early Q4 and rallying into year-end. The other good news is that silver is the most hated it’s been in years, and when the scales are tipped too far in one direction for pessimism, we typically see snapback rallies. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: EquityClock.com)
Beginning with seasonality, we can see that silver followed its typical seasonality traits quite well to start the year, with a near parabolic rally out of the gate in January, though, it peaked earlier than expected in February vs. March typically. Silver then peaked again in Q2, which is typical of the metal, before wading through its seasonally weakest period: May to July. Unfortunately, the June softness persisted into Q3, which has caught several investors off guard. The silver lining, though, is that silver is now less than a week away from a period where it often makes it H2 low, with this low typically arriving in the 2nd week of October. If December 2021 is anything like December 2020, then the bulls should have a strong relief rally ahead, with silver up 15% last December and 12% in Q4. Obviously, there’s no guarantee that silver follows its seasonality traits. Still, the expected seasonal low is also arriving at the same time as a sentiment buy signal, placing more weight on a potential bottom.

The national airline of the Indian Ocean archipelago, established in 1978, has been battling debts of around $70 million owed to bondholders and secured while the carrier was in partnership with Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways. 
In August the bondholders filed a petition to wind up the airline after a standoff over the debt.

FIVN’s stock is currently trading 26% below its 52-week high of $211.68.

So, it could be wise to add quality restaurant stocks such as Dine Brands (DIN), Chuy’s (CHUY), and RCI Hospitality (RICK) to your portfolio now.With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases limiting traditional dining, the restaurant industry witnessed a setback. The National Restaurant Association’s Restaurant Performance Index (RPI) dropped to a 6-month low in August at 104.2, down 1.1% from 105.4 in July.
However, as several restaurants are adopting advanced technologies and increasing digital offerings to adjust to the new normal, the industry should witness solid sales growth this year and beyond. According to the National Restaurant Association, food and beverage sales in the restaurant and foodservice industry are expected to be $789 billion in 2021, up 19.7% year-over-year.
So, it may be wise to bet on fundamentally strong restaurant stocks such as Dine Brands Global, Inc. (NYSE:DIN), Chuy's Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHUY), and RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (RICK). They have a ‘Strong Buy’ rating in our POWR Ratings system along with an A or B grade for Quality.

(Reuters) - Ontario's largest electric utility, Hydro One Ltd, is seeking acquisitions worth up to C$500 million ($397 million) to boost its customer base and consolidate the fragmented industry, a spokeswoman told Reuters.
The government of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, is eager to bring down electricity costs for customers. To achieve that, the province is encouraging Hydro One to obtain customers through acquisition, according to sources.
""We believe this consolidation of our business benefits the community, Ontario and Hydro One as it makes the provincial grid more efficient, while reducing costs across the system,"" the Hydro One spokeswoman said.
Dealmaking will mainly focus on expanding service areas and customers, replacing aging infrastructure and improving grid reliability, said one of the sources.
Ontario's electricity distribution network is highly fragmented with 60 companies, 55 of which hold less than a 2% share of the industry, according to data from provincial regulator the Ontario Energy Board (OEB).
Hydro One, which has a market value of C$17.9 billion, declined to say how much it plans to increase its customer base from the current 1.4 million.
While the company has by far the largest market share in the province, with 35.5% of the industry total, Toronto Hydro-Electric System Ltd and Alectra Utilities Corp are top competitors, with 21.8% and 18.1% of the market, respectively.
LOWER BILLS
Two of Hydro One's smaller deals, worth a total C$132 million, won regulatory approval last year, encouraging the company to hunt for more opportunities.
""I think government over time has been trying to encourage consolidation,"" said Gavin MacFarlane, vice president-senior credit officer at Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The company, which had over C$2 billion in net cash as of December 31, 2020, according to its last annual report, plans to fund acquisitions using its balance sheet, said the spokeswoman. 
Hydro One last month estimated spending of C$1.91 billion on capital investment for 2021, but the spokeswoman declined to comment on how much would be spent on mergers and acquisitions. 
Dealmaking in Canadian power companies has accounted for $2.3 billion this year to date compared with $4.3 billion for the entirety of 2020, with Hydro One making up 2% of deals, according to data from Dealogic.
Hydro One most recently acquired the business assets of Peterborough Distribution Inc and Orillia Power Distribution Corp for a total value of C$104 million.
Hydro One told Reuters that customers in Peterborough and Orillia saw a 1% reduction in the base distribution part of their bills after the acquisitions.
""We believe there are further opportunities in Ontario for consolidation and we are open to pursuing these opportunities as they arise,"" said the spokeswoman. 
Hydro One, 47.3% owned by the government of Ontario, has been beefing up its mergers and acquisitions team by hiring experts from banks and other advisory firms, three sources told Reuters and the company confirmed. 
Among Hydro One's recent hires was new Vice President, Growth Matt Vines, an investment banker hired from Bank of Montreal in August who previously worked in M&A for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

While the spokeswoman for Hydro One said the company was ""strengthening"" its corporate strategy team, she declined to share the size of the current team with Reuters.

Fields succeeded Alan Mulally as president and CEO of the No. 2 U.S. automaker in 2014. He was ousted in 2017 and replaced by Jim Hackett.
Hertz Corp, a subsidiary of Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ), operates the Hertz, Thrifty and Dollar rental car brands. 
The parent company's shares were up nearly 10% in mid-day trade.
Fields joined the Hertz board of directors in June. He also is a member of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s board and is a senior advisor to TPG Capital.
At Hertz, Fields succeeds Paul Stone, who becomes president and chief operations officer, the company said.

In May, Hertz said a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management would fund the company's exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The 103-year-old rental car company was once owned by General Motors (NYSE:GM), which resold it to previous owner John Hertz in 1953. Subsequent owners included RCA, United Airlines parent UAL Corp and Ford, which sold the business in 2005 to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.

(Reuters) -PepsiCo Inc said on Tuesday it would likely raise prices again early next year, as it looks to overcome ever increasing supply-chain challenges that include everything from a shortage of Gatorade bottles to a lack of truck drivers.
Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) had to ""scramble"" to overcome a shortage of cans and Gatorade bottles in the last few months as demand for its beverages jumped at restaurants and theaters following the lifting of pandemic-induced restrictions.
PepsiCo has already raised prices of its sodas and snacks in recent weeks, echoing the strategy of broader packaged foods industry as rising raw material prices pinch profit margins.
""I do expect there will probably be some price increases in the first quarter of next year as well, as we fully absorb and lock down the impact of commodity inflation,"" Johnston said, adding that he expects most supply-chain disruptions to moderate by the end of 2021. 
PepsiCo's UK business has also been hit by a shortage of truck drivers in post-Brexit Britain due to immigration rules and a loss of about a year of driver testing and training.
However, Johnston said he does not expect a shortage of PepsiCo products in supermarkets, saying the company should be in better shape by the end of the fourth quarter.
The company said it was expecting fiscal 2021 organic revenue to rise about 8%, compared with its prior forecast of a 6% increase. https:// PepsiCo's third-quarter organic revenue rose 9%, 5-percentage points of which came from selling higher-priced products. Costs were up over 10%, driven by higher expenditure on distribution and marketing. 
Net revenue rose 11.6% to $20.19 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 4, above analysts' estimates of $19.39 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. PepsiCo shares rose marginally in premarket trading.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday said it will open a battery cell development center in southeast Michigan to help it drive down the cost and boost the driving range of electric vehicles with lithium ion and solid-state battery cells.
The Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, to be located on the No. 1 U.S. automaker's technical campus in Warren, Michigan, is expected to open in mid-2022 and begin building prototype cells in the fourth quarter, GM said.
""The key to making these vehicles affordable is going to be the cell cost in the battery packs,"" Ken Morris, GM's vice president of electric and self-driving vehicles, said on a conference call with reporters. GM will spend ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars on the new center, he added.
GM has said it will spend $35 billion through 2025 on EVs and autonomous vehicles, and is expected to outline targets beyond that period at its investor day on Wednesday.
Part of that push is GM's partnership with LG Energy Solutions, a unit of South Korea's LG Chem (051910.KS), to develop its Ultium batteries. The companies have announced two joint-ventures battery plants and GM has said it intends to open two more. 
GM has targeted eliminating emissions from all light vehicles it sells by 2035. 
A key elements to making EVs more attractive to consumers is driving down their cost and a big part of that is the batteries. GM has said it wants to have at least 60% lower battery costs in the next generation of Ultium and officials said future products will allow electric driving ranges of 600 miles (965 km) on a single charge.
The new facility, at almost 300,000 square feet (27,900 square meters), will work with the company's existing materials research and development and battery systems labs in Warren. It will also work with SES, a Massachusetts company with which GM formed a partnership with in March.
The center, named for Bill Wallace, a former executive who played a key role in the development of GM's advanced battery technology before he died from cancer in 2018, will be capable of building large-format, prototype lithium-metal battery cells, as well as developing silicon and solid-state technologies.

It will also develop new production methods to use in battery plants.
GM rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co in April said it would invest $185 million to open in late 2022 an EV battery development center.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will buy 300,000 courses of Merck & Co's experimental antiviral pill, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday, as Victoria logged the highest number of daily COVID-19 infections of any state in the country since the pandemic began. 
Molnupiravir, which would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19 if it gets regulatory approval, could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for people most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to experts. 
""These treatments mean that we are going to be able to live with the virus,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Nine News on Tuesday as Australia aims to reopen its borders next month for fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents. 
Molnupiravir capsules have to be taken twice a day for five days by adult patients for a course of 10, Morrison said. 
The drug is expected to be available in Australia by early next year if approved by the country's drug regulator, Morrison said. Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021.
South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia have all said they are in talks to buy the potential treatment, while the Philippines is running a trial on the pill. 
Australia, meanwhile, is stepping up its vaccination rate, with Sydney and Melbourne, its largest cities, and the capital Canberra enduring a weeks-long lockdown to combat the highly infectious Delta variant. The national first-dose rate in the adult population topped 80% on Tuesday morning. 
A total of 1,763 new infections were reported in Victoria, exceeding the previous daily high of 1,488 on Saturday, with the state looking to start reopening once full vaccination levels in its adult population reaches 70%, expected around the end of October, from 53% now. 
Dominic Perrottet, who was elected as the new premier of New South Wales on Tuesday, said the state was on track to exit lockdown on Oct. 11, the first Monday after it expects 70% of its population over 16 to be fully vaccinated. 

Daily infections in the state fell to the lowest in seven weeks on Tuesday at 608 new cases, the majority in state capital Sydney, down from 623 on Monday. Seven new deaths were recorded. 
Even with the Delta outbreaks, Australia still has relatively low coronavirus numbers, with around 115,800 cases. Total deaths stood at 1,357, with the mortality rate from the current Delta outbreak lower than during last year due to higher inoculation among the vulnerable population.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City agreed to hold off on requiring food delivery companies to share customer data with restaurants, the subject of a recent lawsuit by DoorDash Inc. In a joint filing on Monday with the U.S. District Court inManhattan, the city said it will not enforce a new law requiringthe disclosures while the lawsuit is pending, and DoorDashwithdrew its request for an injunction to block enforcement.
DoorDash sued the city on Sept. 15, calling a requirement that food delivery app companies provide customers' names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses to restaurants a ""shocking and invasive intrusion of consumers' privacy.""
The San Francisco-based company also said the law would let restaurants ""free-ride"" on data they would not demand from in-person diners.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, New York City has tried to help restaurants that had resisted food delivery app fees as high as 30%, but which became more dependent on delivery as dining rooms closed or limited capacity and people ate at home.
In a separate case, DoorDash and rivals Grubhub Inc and Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats sued the city on Sept. 9 over a law capping fees that delivery companies charge restaurants.

They said that law has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

Investing.com – Southwest Gas stock (NYSE:SWX) rose 7% Tuesday on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Carl Icahn has a significant stake in the natural gas provider.
According to the Journal, the activist has written to the utility to abandon a potential acquisition and instead work to improve its share price.
The company is currently pursuing a nearly $2 billion acquisition of Questar Pipeline Company, a gas transportation and storage business of Dominion Energy (NYSE:D). The talks between the companies are at an advanced stage, according to Reuters. The purchase price will include Questar’s debt. Dominion's share price traded 0.2% lower. 
Icahn said the company’s shares, with the proper changes, could appreciate 75%, according to the WSJ report.
Southwest Gas serves more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and California. Questar's natural gas pipeline and storage network runs across Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. The company also owns the Clay Basin storage facility, the largest underground storage reservoir in the Rocky Mountains, according to its website.
The proposed deal between Southwest and Dominion comes after the energy arm of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) abandoned in July its $1.7-billion pursuit of Questar, including debt, because of fears antitrust regulators would block it. This was part of a wider deal to purchase Dominion's gas infrastructure business, Reuters said.

Furthermore, President Biden’s infrastructure bill and the growing external and domestic demand have created optimism around the industrial sector for the first time in months. This should help fundamentally sound industrial stocks like CEMEX (CX),  Owens Corning  (NYSE:OC), GMS (NYSE:GMS), and Huttig Building Products (HBP) deliver solid returns in the upcoming months.Industrial production increased 0.4% in August and rose 0.3% above its pre-pandemic (February 2020) level despite Hurricane Ida-induced plant closures and the pandemic not being completely over. Some contributing factors are increased government focus on infrastructure, higher capital expenditures, and an expanding global economy. Investor optimism surrounding the industrial sector’s prospects is evident from the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 28.8% returns over the past year.
Although the ongoing supply chain issues could curb growth, the acceleration in demand for manufacturing, logistic, non-residential, and business outsourcing services should enable the industrial sector to witness a steady growth trajectory. Moreover, President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which is expected to be passed by the end of October, should boost the sector.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality industrial stocks CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (CX), Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) (OC),  GMS Inc . (GMS), and Huttig Building Products, Inc. (HBP). They are expected to deliver significant returns in the near term based on their strong position in the market, persistent modernization, and diverse portfolio.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca seeks U.S. approval for drug cocktail to prevent COVID,"By Ludwig Burger and Sachin Ravikumar
(Reuters) -AstraZeneca has requested emergency approval from U.S. regulators for its antibody cocktail, the first protective shot other than vaccines against COVID-19, another potential major step in the global fight to combat the virus.
While vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, Astra's biotech compound known as AZD7442 contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
COVID-19 therapies based on the same class of monoclonal antibodies are sold by rivals Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and its partner Vir to stop the disease from worsening during early, milder stages of the infection. 
The AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) therapy, designed to last several months to a year, could protect people who do not have a strong enough immune response to COVID-19 vaccines due to, for instance, chemotherapy or anti-rejection drugs after organ transplants.
The drug, given in two sequential injections, could also supplement a vaccination course for those, such as military personnel, who need to booster their protection further, AstraZeneca has said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Regeneron's drug in September for use in preventing COVID-19 after exposure to infected people. AstraZeneca's application is however for prevention before any exposure. 
Astra's AZD7442 fell through in the post-exposure setting in a trial in June. Another trial https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04723394 is ongoing to test the drug as a treatment of the infected.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it included data in its filing with the FDA from a late-stage trial that showed the drug reduced the risk of people developing any COVID-19 symptoms by 77%. The positive trial data was published in August.
SUPPLY TALKS
A U.S. authorisation for AZD7442 - based on antibodies discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the United States - could be a major win for AstraZeneca, whose widely used COVID-19 vaccine has yet to be approved by U.S. authorities.
Talks regarding supply agreements for AZD7442 are ongoing with the United States and other governments, AstraZeneca said.
The company agreed in March to supply up to half a million extra doses of the antibody cocktail to the United States. The $205 million U.S. extension deal built on a U.S. contract a year ago for initial supplies of 200,000 doses.
In June last year, the U.S. provided $23.7 million in early funding for the development project.
Britain's government also has an in-principle agreement over a million doses of AZD7442. The government declined to provide an update.
Under a plan to set up a global production network, Astra enlisted contract manufacturer Lonza a year ago to produce the antibody treatment in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, starting in the first half of 2021.

The company did not immediately respond to a request for an update on the supply and production agreements. 
Astra's pioneering filing contrasts with delays in its quest for approval for its COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria in the United States, where the vast majority of those willing to get immunised have already received shots from the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

Investing.com – Lordstown stock (NASDAQ:RIDE) plunged more than 8% to touch Tuesday’s low of $5.20 after  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the stock could go down to as little as $2.
The stock is already well below its year’s high of $31.55.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas’ previous target for the stock was $8 with an equal weight rating, according to reports. He is now underweight on the stock.
Jonas’ pessimism focuses on the terms of the company’s deal with Foxconn that the analyst feels leaves little for the EV-maker’s shareholders.
Lordstown is selling its Ohio plant for $230 million to the iPhone-maker which now has ambitions to make electric vehicles. The firm had estimated the sale to fetch it $1.3 billion, more than five-times the final value.
The two companies jointly plan to make electric vehicles at the plant.  
As per reports, the analyst believes the firm’s proposed full-size electric pick-up truck, Endurance, already several months behind schedule, may not yet be commercially viable."

1130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 11:09AM ET</span>",Biggest U.S. Banks Expand Trading Dominance Over European Rivals,"(Bloomberg) -- As the coronavirus helps the big get bigger across industries and regions, a trio of U.S. banking powerhouses is seizing market share from European rivals in trading revenue.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) captured almost 46% of the global market for trading stocks and bonds in the first half of 2021, an increase of nearly six percentage points from the same period in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, the portion of the market commanded by European lenders fell to about 32%, a decline of roughly four percentage points, with firms such as  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) ceding ground.
America’s biggest financial institutions are building on their gains with huge technology budgets and their equity market dominance, which allowed them to benefit when the pandemic sparked the most volatile period on record. The U.S. banks have been encroaching on European territory for more than a decade, after rebounding more quickly from the 2008 financial crisis courtesy of cost-cutting and regulation aimed at reining in risk.
“In times of uncertainty over the last year and a half or so, the big players have been able to step up,” said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analyst Jason Goldberg. “The biggest U.S. banks have been able to capture more than their fair share as they leverage both relationship and technology. I don’t see them going backward.”
 
The U.S. trio has been adding market share since at least 2017, according to the data, which compared revenue from 12 U.S. and European banks for the first half of each year. The biggest jump came between the first six months of 2019 and the same period in 2020, when they captured almost five more percentage points, bringing their combined share to nearly $40 billion.
At the top of the list was Goldman Sachs, which has increased its overall share of the market by more than five percentage points since 2017, the most of the 12 banks. 
The Wall Street giant was able to snag more of the pie as it amped up technology investments and emphasized relationships with individual clients over single transactions, according to Marc Nachmann, who helps lead the trading division at New York-based Goldman Sachs.
“We’ve made a conscious decision to invest in technology in lots of parts of our business,” Nachmann said in an interview. “It becomes a scale game. You have to be able to afford to keep up with the technology spend to be one of the top performers.”
Goldman Sachs invested $4 billion in technology in 2019, according to a presentation that year. JPMorgan has been increasing its investments, and has a $12 billion annual tech budget overall, including for its retail operations. Morgan Stanley’s Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said in June that its tech budget is well over $4 billion.
Back to Normal
Wall Street’s biggest banks raked in massive hauls from trading as the pandemic roiled markets and the Federal Reserve’s rescue measures bolstered asset prices. But the string of banner quarters waned in the three months through June, following warnings by bank bosses that activity would normalize. As banks gear up to report third-quarter earnings next week, investors will focus on whether that trend continues. 
One consequence of more normal revenue streams could be intensified rivalries over global trading, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Alison Williams. 
“As things start to stabilize and some of that liquidity comes out of the system, there could be less activity,” Williams said. 
In Europe, Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) saw the biggest decline in market share from 2017 through 2021, following its exit from the global equities business in 2019 in a sweeping restructuring. The company, which lost 3.1 percentage points in the five-year period, began clawing some of that back in first six months of 2021, when it recouped 0.8 percentage point.
Barclays Plc was the only lender surveyed in the region to pick up market share from 2017 to 2021, helped by its stronger foothold in U.S. capital markets.
U.S. lenders’ bigger inroads into the European market will probably soon give way to more incremental gains, a trend analysts attributed to politically disruptive issues such as Brexit as well as the over-banked nature of the market, with its lower margins.
Europe is “not a good hunting ground for banks in the global market,” said Tim Jennison, a partner at Boston Consulting Group. “I still think the American banks will continue to gain share -- if not as dramatic in Europe, then the market will continue to gain share in Asia.”  
There may already be signs of a return to pre-pandemic levels. In the first half of 2020, European banks had 31.6% of the market, and that barely changed in the first half of this year, the data show. U.S. banks overall even saw their share wane slightly, from 68.4% in the first half of 2020 to 68.38% for the same period this year.
“The European banks’ resolve to stay committed to investment banking has been amazing -- it’s remarkable, in light of the subpar returns and lost market share,” Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said in an interview. But for now, “Goliath is winning.”

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>","South African union starts indefinite strike, auto industry fears impact","By Wendell Roelf
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest metalworkers union on Tuesday launched an indefinite strike to press for wage rises in the engineering sector, action that threatens to spill over and block supplies of parts to make new cars, industry and union officials said.
With around 155,000 members organised in the sector, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has called for a total shutdown of the engineering industry after wage talks with employer bodies deadlocked.
""We are left with no choice but to strike and to withhold our labour indefinitely until the bosses give into our just demands,"" NUMSA said.
The union organised marches and rallies across the country on Tuesday, with thousands attending a march in downtown Johannesburg.
NUMSA had sought an 8% across-the-board wage rise in the first year of a pay deal, and an increase equal to the rate of inflation plus 2% for the following two years. Annual inflation is currently around 5%.
Industry body Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa had offered 4.4% for 2021, inflation plus 0.5% in 2022 and inflation plus 1% in the third year
Lucio Trentini, chief executive at the federation which represents more than 1,000 firms, from small family-owned businesses with less than 20 employees to large listed companies, said a poll among members on Tuesday showed a worker absenteeism rate of around 26%.
""And I fear ... that this number will grow as the strike continues through the week,"" he told Reuters.
UNION DEMANDS
Trentini said they were in contact with NUMSA to try and reach a ""mutually acceptable"" compromise and prevent a repeat of a damaging four-week strike in 2014 that cost the economy an estimated 6 billion rand ($398 million) in lost output.
Smaller union, UASA, said it was balloting members to determine if they also supported strike action, with a final decision expected on Friday. 
South Africa's economy, including its export-focused auto sector, was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, making employers reluctant to give in to union demands for above-inflation salary hikes.
Domestic car sales and vehicle production fell by roughly 30% last year, hitting major brands such as Ford, BMW and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) which all have local plants.
""We urge parties to speedily resolve the impasse and prevent long-term damage and possible line stoppages to vehicles being assembled in SA and abroad,"" Renai Moothilal, executive director at the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers, told Reuters.

A Ford spokeswoman said they would not comment for now, while a Nissan spokeswoman said they were monitoring the situation ""and do not foresee any impact on our side"".

Investing.com – Robinhood stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) rose 2.3% Tuesday as the company said it would roll out a 24/7 phone line in an effort to strengthen its customer support.
The company said the phone support service will be available for trades in cryptos as well as equities. In all cases, the request for support will have to come through the Robinhood app, the company said.
Prices of cryptocurrencies surged on Tuesday. Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) rose past the $50,000-level, where it hasn't been since September 7 and traded 4.4% higher at 10:30 AM ET.
Ethereum ETH/USD and Binance Coin BNB/BTC were up 4% each. Dogecoin DOGE/USD gained 7%. 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s last week’s comments that the U.S. has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies has provided further impetus to the adoption of digital assets. The cryptos have also shrugged off last month’s warning by the Chinese central bank against trading in cryptos.
At $233 million, cryptocurrencies contributed to more than half of the $451 million in revenue Robinhood earned from transactions on the platform. More than 60% of Robinhood accounts traded cryptocurrencies in the second quarter, the company said.
Second-quarter revenue soared 131% to $565 million as retail traders from the Reddit gang and everywhere else piled on the platform to trade in cryptocurrencies and equities.
But the company warned that while many things went in its favor in the second quarter, it expected considerably fewer new funded accounts in the third.

(Reuters) - Many countries are preparing to make COVID-19 vaccine booster shots available, but there is no consensus among scientists that they are necessary and the World Health Organization wants the most vulnerable people worldwide to be fully vaccinated first.
Here are some of the options countries and regions are considering:
NORTH AMERICA
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sept. 24 backed a booster shot of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech vaccine for Americans aged 65 and older, some adults with underlying medical conditions and some adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization is recommending https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/summary-september-10-2021-additional-dose-covid-19-vaccine-immunocompromised-following-1-2-dose-series.html booster shots of an authorized mRNA vaccine to those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. 
EUROPE
The European Union's drug regulator recommended on Oct. 4 a third dose of Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA vaccines for those with a severely weakened immune system, but left it to member states to decide if the wider population should get a booster.
Several EU member states launched their own booster campaigns before the long-awaited EMA guidance.
Recent contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have included the potential for the bloc to buy booster shots. 
These European countries are offering boosters to people after they received a full dose of a vaccine: 
** Austria (wider rollout to start on Oct. 17); Czech Republic; Hungary; Russia; Romania (only boosters from Pfizer or Moderna were approved); Serbia; Slovakia 
These countries are offering boosters to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable: 
** Belgium (mRNA); Bulgaria (recommended for front-line medics, immunosuppressed people, living in care homes and over 65); Britain (mRNA); Denmark; Finland (may expand to other Finns later in the autumn); France; Germany (mRNA); Ireland; Italy; Lithuania; Netherlands; Norway (mRNA); Poland; Portugal; Slovenia; Spain; Sweden (larger population to get a jab in 2022) 
Switzerland will not use boosters for now - authorities say they do not see protection slipping over time, but that they are still monitoring the data. 
AFRICA
** Morocco, which administered the most doses in Africa, will soon start giving a third dose, the Health Ministry said on Oct. 1
** Tunisia (for people over 75)
ASIA, MIDDLE EAST
These countries are offering boosters to people after they received a full dose:
** Bahrain (Sputnik V, all over-18s at least six months after second dose); Cambodia (AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)); Indonesia (health workers only, wider population planned in 2022); Israel (all over-12s); South Korea (initial doses to high-risk groups or people with weakened immune systems); Turkey; Thailand (AstraZeneca or mRNA-type booster shots to people who were administered Sinovac brand); UAE (mandatory for people inoculated with Sinopharm vaccine)
These countries are offering boosters to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable:
** China; Singapore
LATIN & CENTRAL AMERICA
These countries are offering boosters to people after they received full dose:
** Uruguay (offers a Pfizer dose for those fully vaccinated with Sinovac)
These countries are offering boosters only to the immunosuppressed:
** Ecuador, Panama
These are offering boosters to elderly, vulnerable and at-risk people:
** Chile; Brazil (over 60s and healthcare workers); Dominican Republic, El Salvador
COMPANIES
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized on Sept. 22 a booster dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for those 65 and older, all people at high risk of severe disease, and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
The FDA authorized a third dose by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc on Aug. 13 for people with compromised immune systems. 
An advisory panel of FDA experts will also meet later in October to discuss authorizing booster doses of Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccines, the regulator said on Oct. 1.
Pfizer and BioNtech also submitted data for vaccine booster authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Moderna said on Sept. 3 it had asked the EU drugs regulator for conditional approval of a booster shot of its vaccine at a 50 microgram dose, or half the dosage of its two-shot vaccine. 
The company also said it had completed data submission for the use of a booster dose to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

On Aug. 5, Moderna said its COVID-19 shot was about 93% effective four to six months after the second dose, showing hardly any change from the 94% efficacy reported in its original clinical trial.
AstraZeneca said it was looking into how long the vaccine's protection lasts and if a booster dose would be needed.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, in a rebound that failed to change the predominant mood of caution ahead of the government's September labor market report on Friday. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 156 points, or 0.5%, at 34,160 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite, which fell over 2% on Monday, had rebounded by 0.4%.
Official data released earlier showed imports into the U.S. hit a fresh record high in August, running 10% ahead of the pre-pandemic levels of two years ago, suggesting that businesses are busy building up inventories ahead of the key holiday season. The data are corroborated by an unprecedented backlog of ships waiting to enter West Coast ports, notably at Los Angeles.
The data are a reminder that complaints and warnings about supply chain problems come against a backdrop of demand that has been supercharged for the last year and a half by fiscal and monetary stimulus. Strong demand was also in evidence from the latest non-manufacturing survey from the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM's PMI rose to 61.9 from 61.7, instead of falling to 60 as expected. The sub-index for prices paid, having fallen from a record high last month, resumed its upward trend with a rise to 77.5.
Among individual movers,  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) stock rose a relatively modest 0.9% despite raising its earnings guidance for the full year. Concern about slowing volume sales growth took the edge off an otherwise robust quarter.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock recovered 1.0% after falling nearly 5% on Monday on a cocktail of concerns over its worst-ever outage and its chronic weaknesses in governance, highlighted in excruciating detail by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Haugen is due to testify to the Senate that the company poses ""one of the most urgent threats"" to the U.S.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock ground another 1.8% higher, still enjoying the support from its record third-quarter deliveries and dismissing concerns about a $130 million punitive damages award against it after it lost a second case in four months on the treatment of black employees. A third such case is waiting for it in a California state court. 
Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock was taking a breather after two sessions of big gains that had propelled it to its highest since the start of the pandemic. The company's experimental drug for treating Covid-19 promises to be the first treatment for the disease that can be taken in pill form, something that could radically expand global access to protection and hasten the end of the pandemic.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock, which had fallen most sharply in response to news of what may prove to be a cheap and effective rival for its Covid-19 vaccine, recovered 2.3%. It's still down 14% over the last week, however.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 09:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Diamond giant De Beers hunts for treasure in Greenland's waters,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Clara Denina 
COPENAGHEN/LONDON (Reuters) - Mining giant De Beers has commissioned a survey of the ocean floor off Greenland's coast in a first step to determine whether it could hold deposits of highly-prized marine diamonds.
The eight-day survey of around 800 kilometers of seabed off Greenland's west coast, near the town of Maniitsoq, ended on Thursday last week, a spokesperson for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), told Reuters.
The GEUS confirmed it had carried out the survey on behalf of De Beers and said it would take months to analyse.
""De Beers Marine (DBM) would like to determine whether the offshore environment is conducive to the formation of secondary diamond deposits,"" an Environmental Mitigation Assessment prepared by De Beers for Greenland's mineral resource authority and seen by Reuters showed.
De Beers, which together with Russia's Alrosa is one of the world's leading diamond miners, said the survey, carried out at a water depth of between 50 and 200 meters, was preliminary.
""The focus of the small-scale, early stage survey is to understand the topography of the region,"" De Beers, a unit of diversified mining company  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), said in an emailed statement.
Deposits of diamonds, created under high pressure in volcanoes, are known to be present onshore in west Greenland.
Offshore diamonds are generally of higher quality and command a higher price because any gems with flaws tend not to survive the journey out to sea.
Since the 1990s, marine diamond production has been concentrated in Namibia, where it accounts for around 75% of production volumes.
That percentage could rise as mines on land near the end of their life.
In Namibia, De Beers has a 50/50 joint venture with the government that operates special mining vessels.
The vessels suck up hundreds of square meters of sand and silt each hour from below the seabed, which is sifted on board and then semi-processed diamonds are flown to land by helicopter.
Some scientists and environmentalists have called for a ban on the practice, saying too little is known about its impact.
De Beers says it is scrupulous in protecting the environment.
The survey in Greenland avoided important fishing grounds, the report said. The waters of southwest Greenland represent the most abundant marine life in the country.
Greenland's mineral resources ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland relies on fishing and on annual grants from Denmark. 

The vast Arctic island is rich in mineral resources but has only two small producing mines. Its mining industry is dominated by small exploration companies, although Anglo American secured a number of onshore exploration licences in 2018 and 2019. 
Demand is strong for minerals, such as copper and cobalt, needed for the transition to a low carbon economy. Diamond demand, which is closely linked to GDP, is more uncertain, although it has been recovering from the impact of the pandemic.

Investing.com – Johnson & Johnson stock (NYSE:JNJ) rose 0.7% Tuesday as the company applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use approval to administer the booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine to adults. 
The company seeks to administer the booster dose to adults who have already received the single shot of the vaccine. J&J’s is the only single-dose vaccine available in the U.S. 
The company's submission comes after a phase-3 study found that a booster given 56 days after the primary shot provided 94% protection in symptomatic cases and 100% shield against severe Covid.
Antibodies rose nine-fold if the booster was given six months after the first shot.
There was no evidence of reduced effectiveness over the study duration conducted from March to July 31. Comparable vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated when the study was extended to August 31, including when the Delta variant became dominant in the U.S., the company said.
Delta is the most dominant variant in most countries and is also the most infectious, the reason behind the second wave of infection in those countries.
The administration has so far permitted only  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) to go ahead with its booster dose for individuals 65 years and older or those adults who are at risk.

Yellen told CNBC in an interview that she opposes the minting of a $1 trillion platinum coin to resolve the crisis.
The idea comes from a legal loophole that allows the Treasury to mint platinum coins in any denomination it chooses. Some progressive commentators and Democratic lawmakers have suggested minting one or more $1 trillion coins to break an impasse in which Republicans have refused to support an increase in the $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.
""I'm opposed to it and I don't think we should consider it seriously,"" Yellen said. ""It's really a gimmick."" 
Yellen said such a move ""is equivalent to asking the Federal Reserve to print money to cover deficits that Congress is unwilling to cover by issuing debt. It compromises the independence of the Fed, conflating monetary and fiscal policy.""
She added that it would ""do the opposite"" of showing that Congress and the administration can be trusted to pay U.S. bills.
Asked if she would back a process called ""reconciliation"" for getting the limit increased without any Republican support, Yellen said: I support getting it done... We have to raise the debt ceiling as a routine matter whenever the country runs budget deficits.""

Yellen added that it was up to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ""to figure out"" how to raise the debt ceiling in Congress. ""What I can tell you is that it's utterly essential that this be done.""
She said she continues to regard Oct. 18 as a deadline for raising the debt ceiling. That is when the Treasury will exhaust its extraordinary borrowing capacity and will have limited cash reserves that will be expended very quickly. A default would be ""catastrophic"" and cause a recession, she said, putting the reserve status of the dollar at risk.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 08:31AM ET</span>",REUTERS IMPACT-Tesco treads tricky path to greener future,"By Kate Holton and James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - Customers and investors want supermarkets to improve their environmental credentials but are not prepared to accept higher prices or lower returns as a trade-off, the head of Britain's biggest retailer Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) told the Reuters Impact conference. 
Addressing the challenge of how the industry can navigate the shift to net zero emissions, Ken Murphy said it had to strike a balance, for example cutting the use of plastic packaging without increasing the food waste that might follow.
Asked if customers were willing to pay higher prices for more sustainable goods, Murphy replied: ""I think there is always a small proportion of very committed customers who are willing to pay a premium, but actually the vast majority are not is the honest truth. 
""What our customers expect us to do is find ways to innovate, to make sustainable products for them.""
Investors, he said, also insist that supermarkets increasingly focus on environmental goals but did not want to see a lower return on their investment as a consequence.
""So we're constantly juggling these priorities, and hopefully doing a decent job,"" he said. 
NET ZERO TARGET
Tesco, the 102-year-old supermarket that dominates British retail, has set out plans for its operations to hit a net zero carbon target by 2035 through using renewable energy, cutting plastic and encouraging more sustainable diets. 
Many environmental campaigners are sceptical about the willingness of major companies to cut emissions, seeing it as more of a public relations exercise. But large companies that have recently set out targets, such as fast-fashion chain Primark, say they can make a difference due to their sheer size. 
For Tesco, a company with global supply chains and 360,000 staff, it requires change across many elements of the business.
It has turned to vertical strawberry farming to cut water usage, introduced unwashed potatoes that have a longer shelf life and launched reusable packaging. It has also increased recycling of soft plastic packaging that often ends up in landfill and is electrifying its home delivery vehicle fleet.
Murphy said in Britain the move to use less plastic had suffered a setback during the pandemic, when consumers sought out plastic packaging in the hope it would increase safety. 

Like the shift to eating more plant-based products and less red meat, Murphy said Tesco could not dictate what its customers should do, but he said the group, the wider industry and government could help to educate people about the benefits.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 07:47AM ET</span>",J&J files for authorization of COVID-19 vaccine booster,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said on Tuesday it had submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its COVID-19 vaccine in people aged 18 and older.
J&J said its submission includes data from a late-stage study that found a booster given 56 days after the primary dose provided 94% protection against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States and 100% protection against severe disease, at least 14 days after the booster shot.
While scientists are divided over the need for booster shots when so many people in the United States and other countries remain unvaccinated, the Biden administration announced the push for an extra dose in August to shore up protection against the highly transmissible Delta variant.
J&J's filing comes after the FDA last week scheduled an Oct. 15 meeting of its expert advisory committee to discuss whether to authorize a second shot of the company's single-dose vaccine.
Shares of the healthcare conglomerate rose nearly 1% in trading before the opening bell.
The FDA has already authorized a booster dose of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech for 65-year olds and older, people at high risk of severe disease and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
Pfizer had also asked the FDA to expand its vaccine approval to include boosters for all people aged 16 and older, but the regulator decided to limit their use saying evidence showed they were helpful to older people and those at high risk.
Rival vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) also submitted an application seeking authorization for a booster shot of its two-dose vaccine last month, and an FDA panel will hold a meeting on Oct. 14 to discuss the extra dose.

J&J said it plans to submit the data to other regulators, the World Health Organization and National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups to inform decision-making on local vaccine administration strategies, as needed.
About 15 million Americans aged 18 and older have received one dose of J&J's vaccine, according to latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

PURFLEET, England (Reuters) -British military personnel in fatigues began delivering fuel on Tuesday to ease an acute trucker shortage that triggered panic buying at the pumps, though Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied the world's fifth largest economy was heading into crisis.
A post-Brexit shortage of workers exacerbated by the global strains of the COVID crisis has sown chaos through supply chains for everything from fuel and pork to poultry and bottled water, raising concerns growth could be crimped.
Military personnel were photographed by Reuters at several fuel depots in southern England driving tankers, some with instructors, and then delivering fuel to a gas station. 
Asked by BBC radio if the United Kingdom was in crisis, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""No."" 
Johnson said there would be no 1970s-style inflationary spiral and demanded that business kick a decades-long addiction to cheap imported labour.
""I think that on the contrary, what you are seeing with the UK economy and indeed the global economy is very largely in the supply chains the stresses and strains you would expect from a giant waking up and that is what is happening,"" he said.
""What you saw in the last 20 years or more, almost 25 years, has been an approach whereby business of many kinds, was able to mainline low wage, low cost, immigration for a very long time,"" Johnson said.
An air of chaos has gripped Britain in recent days as a deficit of truckers left fuel pumps dry across the land, and a spike in European wholesale natural gas prices tipped energy companies into bankruptcy.
Reuters reporters said many gas stations remained closed on Tuesday in London and across southern England. 
BACK TO 1970S?
Johnson said Britain was not heading back to the 1970s when inflation peaked at 22.6%, labour disputes brought the economy to a standstill and the government had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund during a sterling crisis.
Asked if the United Kingdom could suffer a repeat of the inflationary spiral seen in the 1970s, Johnson said: ""I don't think that the problem will present itself in that way and I think actually that this country's natural ability to sort out its logistics and supply chains is very strong.""
With fuel companies and supermarkets warning that a shortage of drivers was hitting deliveries, the government said late last month that it would temporarily reverse its immigration rules and give 5,000 visas for EU drivers to operate in Britain. 
It said 300 of those could arrive immediately to drive oil tankers. Johnson said 127 drivers had applied. 

""What that shows is the global shortage,"" he said. 
The Times newspaper reported that just 27 fuel tanker drivers had applied.

Investing.com – PepsiCo stock (NASDAQ:PEP) traded 1.2% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as the company raised its guidance for the year after beating estimates for the third quarter.
Hopes for a better year were kindled at the company as more people returned to restaurants and theaters, boosting demand for its snacks and beverages.
The company now expects full-year organic revenue to increase approximately 8% compared to its previous forecast of 6%.
The shares initially reacted negatively, amid signs of a slowdown in sales growth by volume, but quickly recovered to trade higher.  
For the 12 weeks ended September 4,  Pepsico  recorded 9% organic revenue growth, comprising 4 percentage points of volume growth and a 5-percentage-point contribution from price and mix.
This compares to volume growth of 7 percent in the second quarter, when revenue rose 12.8%.
North America is the biggest market for Pepsico and that threw up some challenges for it.
PepsiCo Beverages North America delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the third quarter while Frito-Lay North America posted 5%. The two businesses in the region had grown by a far faster 21% and 6%, respectively, in the second quarter. International organic revenue grew 14%.
The company said it grew its market share in the carbonated soft drink category in North America, driven by trademark Mountain Dew. It also gained share in the ready-to-drink tea and water categories.
Pepsico’s third-quarter net revenue rose nearly 12% to $20.18 billion but profits fell as cost of sales rose more than 15% and selling expenses also went up by 10%. Profit fell 3% to $2.22 billion, but on a per share basis, it was higher than estimates."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Lidar developer Ouster Inc said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy solid-state lidar startup Sense Photonics in an all-stock deal, and will set up a new automotive division to be run by Sense CEO Shauna McIntyre.
Ouster said it will buy privately held Sense for 9.5 million Ouster shares, which had a value of about $68 million as of Monday's close. 
The acquisition comes as investors have reined in their enthusiasm for lidar startups. Automakers and autonomous driving companies have delayed high-volume deployment of the sensors to the middle of this decade, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk has said Tesla can do without the technology.
Ouster's share price is down 47% for the year to date. Rival Luminar Technologies has fallen by 57% since January, while Velodyne Lidar Inc has plunged 75% for the year.
Lidar sensors build a detailed picture of a vehicle's surroundings using laser light. Tesla aside, most automakers and autonomous vehicle developers are using lidar as part of the sensor arrays in their automated driving systems.
Ouster CEO Angus Pacala told Reuters acquiring Sense Photonics will accelerate by a year Ouster's effort to land high-volume contracts with auto manufacturers. Sense brings solid-state lidar technology, engineers and prospects for contracts to supply sensors to five automakers by 2025-26, Pacala said.
""We can provide a five-lidar system for $1,000 that goes around the vehicle, vs a single forward-looking lidar that may cost $1,000 to $2,000,"" Pacala said.

Ouster will set up an automotive division, augmenting its efforts to land contracts to supply lidars for off-road vehicles and industrial equipment. About 80 Sense employees are expected to join Ouster, and certain Sense executives have agreed to five-year retention deals, Ouster said.
Current lidar sensors are too costly for all but the most expensive consumer vehicles. Ouster and rivals are racing to develop lower-cost digital and solid-state lidars, and are targeting models to be launched within about four years.

The company, which introduced the jets on Monday, described the Gulfstream G800 as the longest-range aircraft in the Gulfstream fleet and the Gulfstream G400 as the first new entrant to the large-cabin class in over a decade.
""The G400 and G800 announced last night flesh out Gulfstream's upper-end product line ... Risks and R&D look moderate as both are derivatives,"" Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said on Tuesday.
He said the G400 is positioned to beat Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's Challenger 650, and given it is at a price point where Gulfstream has no products, it should not cannibalize demand for existing Gulfstream models.
The pandemic has fueled demand for private jet travel in the United States, with a shortage of pre-owned business jets and demand from wealthy travelers to fly with fewer people underpinning prices and filling order books for new corporate aircraft.
Gulfstream, which engages in business jet services, however, continues to be hit by pandemic-related shutdowns and shortages. In the second quarter this year, the company delivered only 21 jets, compared with 32 a year earlier.

General Dynamics said it expects to start customer deliveries of the G800 in 2023, while deliveries of the G400 are estimated to begin in 2025.
Business jet maker Bombardier last week announced an order worth $534 million for 20 units of an upgraded variant of its Challenger 350 aircraft. The jet is expected to enter service in the second half of 2022.

The major indices sold off sharply on Monday, with rising U.S. Treasury yields prompting the tech heavyweights Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to all fall at least 2%, dragging the Nasdaq Composite 2.1% lower. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 300 points, or 0.9%, while the broad-based S&P 500 lost 1.3%.
Helping the tone has been the hope that the economy will grow more strongly as the Delta-variant Covid-19 wave ebbs. Global cases hit their lowest in nearly two months on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins data, while Merck (NYSE:MRK) has received optimistic results for its oral treatment and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has filed for authorisation for its vaccine booster.

Crude oil prices continued pushing higher Tuesday, following the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to continue increasing output only gradually.
This decision came despite requests from consumers, including the U.S. and India, to increase supply as a method of curbing prices as demand recovers from the Covid-19 hit.

1151,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Equities Storm Looking Overblown as Volatility Gauge Stays Calm,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s fear gauge is relatively sleepy after Monday’s stock rout, prompting some strategists to play down fears that stagflation and the debt-ceiling battle will set off a steep correction.
The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, closed at 22.96 on Monday, close to its lifetime average of 19.5. More notably, its term structure shows expectations of increased volatility further out in the future rather than close in, signaling relative calm.
“When the VIX spikes and when the VIX term structure inverts, we know markets are bracing for large near-term volatility events,” Fundstrat strategists including Tom Lee wrote in a report Monday. “Stocks might be over-reacting” to some of the negative drivers out there, including the debt-deadline issue, they wrote. 
The S&P 500 is down 5.2% from its early-September record. The drop came as U.S. yields rose with the Federal Reserve talking about tapering stimulus, and as supply-chain woes underscore concerns inflation will remain elevated. President Joe Biden’s warning that the U.S. government is at risk of breaching the legal limit on its debt in two weeks is also a key risk. 
If the debt ceiling is at risk of being breached, the one-month VIX future should exceed the four-month contract -- but it isn’t -- signaling a ‘buyers strike’ for stocks might end sooner rather than later, Fundstrat said. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) AG also says the VIX is signaling a lack of sharp concerns, arguing investors may have already hedged pretty well into the declines. 
“A lot of downside risks have already been priced into the volatility surface, and thus the hurdle to get a real vol move is much higher,” Credit Suisse strategists led by Mandy Xu wrote in a note Monday. They recommend put-option spreads as a way to take advantage of steep skew, a situation where bearish options are relatively expensive compared with bullish ones.
Susequehanna, on the other hand, sees the calm as a potential signal that stock investors aren’t actually very worried about an increase in Treasury yields -- which aren’t all that high relative to long-term norms.
“It seems like the volatility markets are getting more comfortable and less surprised by the UST-yield induced turmoil,” Susquehanna derivatives strategist Chris Murphy wrote. “Investors might be expecting more choppiness but not any additional tail risk as investors adjust to a ‘return to normal’ for UST yields.”

“While we strongly believe that these facts don’t justify the verdict reached by the jury in San Francisco, we do recognize that in 2015 and 2016 we were not perfect. We’re still not perfect. But we have come a long way from 5 years ago. We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns,” Valerie Capers Workman, Tesla’s vice president of people, wrote to staff in an email.
It is the second time in recent months that the electric-vehicle maker has been found liable in a case of alleged racial discrimination.
Melvin Berry, another black former Tesla worker, won a $1 million relief in May after an arbitrator found that he was called racial slurs by his supervisors at the Fremont factory.
Tesla faces similar claims in California state court, where a former Tesla assembly worker, Marcus Vaughn has sued, alleging Tesla created a hostile environment for blacks."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries about the debt ceiling are beginning to rattle investors as the deadline nears for Congress to raise the U.S. borrowing limit to avoid a historic default on U.S. debt. 
With two weeks before the Oct. 18 deadline, President Joe Biden said Monday he cannot guarantee the government will not breach its $28.4 trillion debt limit unless Republicans join Democrats in voting to raise it.
Concerns are mounting in the market for short-term bills, credit default spreads on U.S. debt and in general market sentiment. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the government will run out of cash around that date unless Congress raises the limit on the federal debt.
""The debt ceiling and infrastructure talks out of (Washington), D.C., will continue to be front and center this week amid more hints that ratings agencies could take the U.S. credit rating down a notch if the drama continues,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.
SHORT-TERM TREASURY SPREADS
There are signs of tension in the Treasury bill market, with 1-month bills that would be affected by a potential default yielding higher than 3-month bills.
One-month bills currently yield 0.1%, close to their highest levels since March on an intraday basis, compared with a 0.038% yield in three-month bills. The spread between one-month and three-month bills is the widest since March 2020. 
Portfolio managers typically avoid bill issues at risk of default even if the likelihood of a failed payment is very low. This can send yields on some issues higher than those on longer-dated debt, an unusual occurrence in the yield curve, which is typically upward-sloping.

U.S. REPO MARKET
Except for some minor volatility, the U.S. overnight repurchase agreement (repo) market has shown little signs of stress. 
Overnight repo rates on Monday closed at 0.05%. There were some pockets of volatility, traders said, in the last few days. Last week, overnight repo rates traded as high as 0.07%, but fell as low as -0.10%.
As the debt ceiling deadline looms, repo rates have become volatile because with the U.S. Treasury expected to run down its cash balance, the excess funds flow into the banking system as reserves. Banks can either choose to invest in the repo market, which pushes rates lower, or lend to the Federal Reserve via its reverse repo facility. That takes money away from the repo market and tends to lift overnight rates a little higher.
""Except for perhaps some elevated volatility, I don't see anything outsized at this point that makes me think it's resulting from increased angst about the debt ceiling,"" said Dan Belton, fixed-income strategist, at BMO Capital in Chicago.
Rates in the repo market are also affected at certain dates of the month by inflows from government state enterprises such as Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Last Thursday, volume at the Fed's reverse repo window soared to a record $1.604 trillion, as investors flocked to the U.S. central bank facility where they are paid a guaranteed 5 basis for overnight cash without counterparty risk.

OPTIONS MARKET 
When investors are anxious about an upcoming event, they typically load up on options hedges, thereby driving up volatility embedded in those options. 
Options on S&P 500 and its tracking ETF, expiring on Oct. 15, just prior to the debt ceiling deadline, display just a little bit extra volatility priced into them when compared with contracts expiring before and after. 
A more significant rise in volatility for expirations on and around the Oct. 18 deadline in coming days would tell that the debt ceiling showdown is garnering more attention from investors.

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
Thinly traded credit default swaps that would pay off in the case of a U.S. government default have spiked in recent days, though they remain far below where they traded during the summer of 2011 when prolonged debt ceiling negotiations led to ratings agencies downgrading U.S. debt, according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analytics. 
One-year credit-default swaps are now trading at levels last seen in December 2020, according to Refinitiv data, through remain approximately 40% lower than they were in March 2020 when much of the U.S. economy shutdown during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.

MONEY MARKET FLOWS

In one sign of rising nervousness, investors sent approximately $33 billion into money-market funds the week that ended Sept. 29. That move to cash pushed the total assets of the $3.9 trillion money market industry to its highest levels since June, according to data from the Investment Company Institute.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 06:23AM ET</span>",Battery giants face skills gap that could jam electric highway,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean battery giants powering many of the world's electric vehicles face a skills shortage that could drag on the global race towards zero-emissions transport.
The country's three major players, which command a third of the global electric vehicle (EV) battery market, told Reuters they were all grappling with a shortage of research and engineering specialists as demand for the technology balloons.
LG Energy Solution (LGES), SK On, and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co Ltd all rank in the top-six https://graphics.reuters.com/SOUTHKKOREA-BATTERIES/TALENT/lbvgngxzmpq/chart.png global battery makers, and supply the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co among others. 
Yet they are facing growing demands from big automakers and can't find enough technicians with the training needed to keep advancing cutting-edge tech such as solid-state batteries https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-will-solid-state-batteries-make-electric-vehicles-better-2021-09-07.
""Although we are seeing such a growth in the industry, it appears that we are facing a shortage of talent,"" an official at LGES said. ""It is crucial to recruit external talents as well as nurturing our own talent.""
This was echoed by its two big domestic rivals, with SK On describing the sector's expansion as ""exponential"".
Indeed the global battery sector has doubled in size over the past five years and South Korea is short of almost 3,000 graduate degree-level positions in areas such as research and design, according to the most recent data from the Korea Battery Industry Association, from late 2020. LGES, SK On and Samsung SDI currently have a total of about 19,000 employees. 
The Korean crunch reflects a growing talent shortage across a wider global battery market that, according to IHS Markit forecasters, will triple in size to almost $90 billion by 2025.
The EU's European Battery Alliance planning group, for example, says ""re-/up-skilling"" is needed in the bloc because its battery industry needs 800,000 new workers by 2025.
If the global skills gap is not plugged, some industry experts say it could slow the pace of advances in batteries, which are being counted on to clean up road transport, one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. 
""Talent demand in the battery industry outweighs supply, and battery makers are anxious to ensure that they have got this small group of people who can work on this technology, and won't be left behind in the fast-growing market,"" said Samsung Securities analyst Cho Hyun-ryul. 
'COMPETITIVE PACKAGES'
In a sign of the skills pressure, LGES - South Korea's No.1 battery maker by volume - plans to launch a new ""battery-smart factory department"" at the prestigious Korea University next spring with guaranteed jobs for graduates. 
More immediately, executives have been flying to the United States to lead recruiting events at schools there. The LGES CEO and his managers went to Los Angeles last month while the SK Innovation CEO and staff hosted an event in San Francisco on Saturday. 
These companies are not only competing with other established Asian players, including market leader CATL from China and Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY), but fast-growing U.S. and European rivals like Sweden's Northvolt bridging the technology gap. 
The talent shortage in South Korea is being compounded by some existing employees moving to foreign competitors that had offered better pay, according to two industry sources with knowledge of the matter. They declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Northvolt, which counts Volkswagen as a client, has previously said that some of its employees were recruited from top battery makers, including LGES and Panasonic. 
""We do have few people working for Northvolt that are from South Korea, which is obviously a very impressive country when it comes to battery manufacturing and development with several well-respected companies active in this space,"" a spokesperson for the company told Reuters last week. 
""We try to offer competitive packages to our employees – everyone working here is a shareholder in the company for instance,"" he added, though did not specify pay details.
Battery specialists in South Korea newly graduated with doctorate degrees can earn as much as 100 million won ($85,000) a year, and those without that level of qualification average about 80 million won after gaining a few years of experience, according to two sources at major South Korean battery firms.
South Korea's average annual salary was 37.4 million won in 2019, according to tax agency data. 
'WIN FOR AMERICAN AUTOS'
The Korean sector has also been mired in internal conflict, with LGES and SK Innovation, which wholly owns SK On, locked in a two-year dispute over technology, trade secrets and staff poaching until April this year when they settled their differences.
In a signs of the global importance of the two conglomerates, U.S. President Joe Biden - who has made boosting EVs a top priority - described the settlement as ""a win for American workers and the American auto industry.""
""We need a strong, diversified and resilient U.S.-based electric vehicle battery supply chain,"" he added.
Even in the face of the growing skills gap, the worldwide demand for their products has supercharged the battery makers' expansion plans. 
LGES expects its production capacity to reach 155 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of batteries by the end of this year and plans to raise that to 430 GWh in 2025 that could power about 7.2 million EVs. 
SK Innovation aims to boost its annual production capacity more than five-fold to 220 GWh by 2025 and last week announced the plan to invest 10.2 trillion won with Ford to build three battery plants in the United States. https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-sk-invest-114-bln-add-electric-f-150-plant-three-battery-factories-2021-09-27 
Richard Kim, principal analyst at IHS Markit, said the skills gap was likely to be a problem for years to come.

""The labour shortage in the battery industry has already been a global issue, and the reality is that there has been an imbalance of supply and demand of manpower as many companies start to expand their capacity,"" he added.

1156,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",Factbox-Electric-vehicle batteries: major players and their expansion plans,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - The global auto industry's shift to electric vehicles (EVs) has spurred an expansion race among battery makers, and caused a growing a skills shortage. See main story:
Global sales of EVs, estimated at 2.5 million vehicles in 2020, is forecast to grow more than 12-fold to 31.1 million by 2030 and account for nearly a third of new vehicle sales, according to consulting firm Deloitte. 
Here are major players' expansion plans in key EV markets of China, the United States and Europe.
CATL
As of end-June, the Chinese company has annual battery production capacity of 65.45 Gigawatt hours (GWh), and has an additional 92.5 GWh of capacity under construction.
The global industry leader by market share https://graphics.reuters.com/SOUTHKKOREA-BATTERIES/TALENT/lbvgngxzmpq/chart.png, its clients include Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (NYSE:GM), BMW >BMWG.DE> and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) as well as Chinese auto makers.
The company announced a plan in August to set up a production base in Shanghai, a move that will put it close to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Chinese production base.
LG ENERGY SOLUTION (LGES)
The South Korean leader expects its production capacity to reach 155 GWh by the end of this year and plans to raise that to 430 GWh by 2025 - which could power about 7.2 million EVs.
It plans to invest more than $4.5 billion in its U.S. battery production business through 2025. The plans include two new plants, jointly built with GM in Ohio and Tennessee, which would allow LGES to manufacture a total of 70 GWh of batteries in the United States by 2024.
LGES already has a factory in Michigan with annual production capacity of 5 GWh.
In China, where the company makes cylindrical battery cells for Tesla, it has invested about 5.7 trillion won ($4.8 billion) and plans to invest another 1.5 trillion won.
It has invested about 6.8 trillion won in Poland since 2016 to secure an annual production capacity of 70 GWh and plans to make another 2.5 trillion won investment.
In July, LGES and Hyundai Motor Group said they would invest $1.1 billion to jointly set up a EV battery cell plant in Indonesia.
PANASONIC
The Japanese company manufacturers cylindrical NMA (Nickel-Manganese-Aluminum) batteries in the United States at a plant in Nevada and in facilities in Japan. Nearly all goes to Tesla.
It does not disclose its manufacturing capacity, but in May said it was aiming to expand the 35 GWh Nevada facility because of increased demand from Tesla. The Nevada plant, built at a cost of $1.6 billion, was opened in 2014.
Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) plans to begin a test line in Japan this year to make a new cylindrical battery designed by Tesla to halve battery costs. It also has a joint venture with  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) established in February, Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, to develop prismatic batteries.
The company has said it is considering building an auto battery plant in Norway to expand into Europe, but has yet to give details. 
SK ON
SK On has a combined global annual production capacity of 40 GWh - 27 GWh in China, 7.5 GWh in Hungary and the rest from South Korea. 
It plans to boost that more than five-fold to 220 GWh by 2025, with the expansion primarily focused on the U.S. market. 
SK On is building two EV battery plants in Georgia with a combined annual production capacity of 21.5 GWh that will begin production from early 2022.
With partner Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, it has a 10.2 trillion won investment plan to build three separate battery plants in the United States with a combined annual capacity of 129 GWh of batteries, enough to power about 2.2 million EVs. 
SAMSUNG SDI
The affiliate of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd has EV battery cell plants in Hungary, China and South Korea. 
It does not disclose breakdowns of its investments or production capacity. 

In July, Reuters reported that the company, whose customers include Ford and BMW, may build a battery cell plant in the United States. Samsung (KS:005930) SDI has been in talks to supply batteries manufactured at a potential U.S. factory with EV makers including Stellantis and Rivian, which is backed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford.

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Investors eye Big Tech as stock market wobbles,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Technology stocks are bearing the brunt of a recent market selloff, putting a spotlight on how an extended downturn in the sector could weigh on broader equity indexes.
After Monday's sharp drop, the S&P 500 technology sector is down 6.7% since the overall S&P 500 closed at a record on Sept. 2, compared with a 5.2% decline for the broader index over that time.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, is down 7.3% from its Sept. 7 closing high, getting closer to marking a 10% correction.
The tumble comes amid a cluster of worries that hit markets in recent weeks, including a looming unwind of the Federal Reserve's easy money policies, a jump in Treasury yields and a nasty battle among lawmakers over the U.S. debt ceiling.
Many investors are hesitant to cut their exposure to technology-focused stocks, which have led markets for most of the last decade and are expected to deliver strong earnings growth even if the economic climate worsens. Previous dips over the years have often been met by furious buying.
Still, a heavy weighting in broader indexes, comparatively elevated valuations and wide ownership have led some investors to worry over the repercussions of a prolonged period of underperformance for tech and tech-related names.
Here are a few of the metrics investors are studying as they weigh whether to stay the course in tech or pare back their holdings:
A CROWDED TRADE
Years of solid performance have made tech stocks a mainstay in portfolios across Wall Street, periodically spurring concerns that they may be susceptible to violent market swings if investors try to sell all at once. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have ranked among the top five most popular hedge fund long positions for the past 15 consecutive quarters, a study by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) showed.
At the same time, 40% of fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research in September said buying U.S. technology stocks was the market's most crowded trade, a designation tech stocks have received for three straight months.
WEIGHTING IN THE S&P 500
The tech sector by itself holds a 27.7% weighting in the S&P 500, more than twice that of the number two sector, healthcare. Adding four tech-related companies that are in other sectors -- Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) -- boosts that weighting to 38.8%.
VALUATIONS
The technology sector trades at 25.8 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with 20.7 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream. 
While growth and technology stocks have typically commanded greater valuations in recent years, some market participants worry that the category's reputation for delivering gains year after year has helped stretch their prices beyond levels that may be justified by fundamentals.

EARNINGS 
The tech sector's earnings held up much better than those of the broader market last year as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked widespread economic havoc. As the world emerges from lockdowns this year, tech's profit growth has not been quite as strong as S&P 500 companies overall.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) traded 1.6% higher in premarket a day after a six-hour global outage shuttered all the apps under its umbrella and took the share nearly 5% lower at close.
The disruption, the worst in the company’s history, kept billions of users out of the parent app, Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook messenger. Zuckerberg later apologized for the outage.
While Facebook has gone from strength to strength in operational terms since the pandemic started, the company has faced an increasing number of headwinds in recent weeks. The stock had already fallen 3% on Monday before the outage, due to the publicity given to a whistleblower's allegations against it that provided the basis for a series of Wall Street Journal articles and CBS's 60 Minutes at the weekend. The whistleblower, Frances Haugen, will repeat the allegations in Congress later Tuesday.
In addition, Politico reported late in September that shareholders have filed suit against the company, claiming that it overpaid a fine from the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg avoided personal liability for allowing earlier violations of customers' data privacy by the firm Cambridge Analytica.
The social media giant said the outage was due to a faulty configuration change on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between its data centers. The disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way its data centers communicate, bringing the services to a halt, Santosh Janardhan, Facebook’s vice-president, infrastructure, said in a blog post.
The breakdown wasn’t limited to the world outside. Many of the internal tools and systems the company uses in its day-to-day operations were impacted too. This made it tough for its engineers to diagnose and fix the problem, Janardhan said.
Reports of a malicious hack that circulated on Monday have not been confirmed by the company.

""We will certainly be delivering less than we could have sold, and that also applies to next year,"" he said at a roundtable with journalists on Tuesday, echoing recent warnings from competitors like Traton that profits could fall in the second half due to supply chain issues. 
""It's a fight over every chip,"" Daum said. 
While passenger vehicle producers such as BMW or Daimler can increase prices to offset chip losses, truckmakers do not have this flexibility, he said.
Still, the company has committed to a 15% fixed-cost reduction from 2019 levels by 2025, and cuts are ""well underway"", he said. A concrete update will be provided at the company's Capital Markets Day on Nov. 11.
Daimler Trucks & Buses, which prior to the pandemic reaped annual profits of around 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), is set to become the world's largest truckmaker once the spin-off from Daimler - approved by shareholders on Friday - is complete.
Between chip troubles and lacking infrastructure for the hydrogen and electric trucks it is betting on for 60% of its revenues by 2030, the newly spun-off firm is entering a challenging market.
Its latest results show profit margins lagging behind competitors such as Traton's Scania and Volvo Group's Volvo Trucks.
The truckmaker will start production of its first electric truck series, eActros, in Germany this week. High production costs mean the price is roughly three times that of a diesel equivalent.

""As battery prices fall, we will certainly pass this on to our clients. But how quickly this will happen, I can't say,"" Daum said, adding that CO2 pricing was urgently needed to disincentivise the production of fossil fuel-burning cars.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The summer spike in cases fueled by the Delta variant of the coronavirus is likely the last big COVID-19 wave in the United States, but the pandemic is far from over globally, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Monday.
""I think this Delta wave is probably the last major surge of SARS-CoV-2 infection that we have in the U.S., barring something unexpected happening,"" Gottlieb, author of ""Uncontrolled Spread,"" a new book on the U.S. response to the pandemic, said in an interview.
Although Delta is waning in Southern U.S. states, he said infections are picking up in some states in the West and Midwest. 
""It's largely coursed its way through the U.S., and so maybe by Thanksgiving, on the back-end of that, we'll start to see prevalence levels nationally decline in a more uniform scale,"" he said.
""I think the big question mark is what happens in the Northeast,"" said Gottlieb, adding that infections there have only picked up slightly, but likely will rise despite its being the most heavily vaccinated part of the country.
""I still think that Delta is going to sweep through the Northeast,"" he said. 
Gottlieb, who serves on the board of directors of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), which co-developed one of the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), said the challenge for the rest of the world will be getting vaccine distributed to remote settings.
Over the next 12 months, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers collectively will produce between 10 and 15 billion doses of vaccines.
With a global population of 7.5 billion, and 5 to 6 billion doses already distributed, lack of supply is no longer the biggest challenge, he said.
""The challenge is going to be getting the distribution on the ground in hard-to-reach settings, and that's where there really isn't any focus.""

The World Health Organization should focus on building the infrastructure required for global distribution, he said.
""I think that's where the world should be putting some money. I think the supply will be there.""

1165,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 03:27AM ET</span>",China’s Developers Priced for Meltdown as Contagion Risk Spreads,"(Bloomberg) -- A missed bond payment by a Chinese developer reignited investor angst about the health of the nation’s property sector on Tuesday.
Chinese junk dollar bonds were poised for their biggest selloff in at least eight years amid renewed concern that authorities will do little to alleviate the credit crisis gripping the industry. Yields are near a decade high. Developer shares tumbled, with Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. falling more than 10%. A gauge of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong headed for its lowest close since 2016. China Evergrande Group’s silence on a reported stake sale in a unit left its shares suspended.
Fantasia Holdings Group Co. became the latest property company to fail to repay a maturing bond on Monday, while a series of rating downgrades from global risk assessors and a slump in U.S. markets overnight added to investor jitters. Credit traders blamed thin volumes for the scale of the meltdown. Mainland China is closed for a week-long holiday, shutting off liquidity channels like stock links into Hong Kong and the central bank’s daily cash injections.
Fantasia’s missed payment “provides a clear sign that despite piecemeal bailouts of select Evergrande assets, property market stresses remain elevated,” said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. “The rot is unlikely to stop here.”
The average price of China’s high-yield dollar bonds fell about 5 cents on the dollar, with single B rated firms down as much as 10 cents, according to credit traders. Dollar bonds of Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. and Modern Land China Co. were set for their biggest declines in at least a year. A gauge tracking shares of mainland developers slumped 4.1% as of 2:50 p.m. in Hong Kong.
The declines shattered a period of calm that had been spurred by speculation authorities would support the industry and limit damage to the economy. Chinese developer shares rebounded 11% in the previous five days -- the longest gaining streak since March -- after the central bank pledged to safeguard the real estate market and protect home buyers’ rights. The People’s Bank of China also added funds to the banking system for 10 straight days, pushing interbank borrowing costs lower.
The government is unlikely to ease its curbs on the property sector, despite the recent speculation, according to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. 
“Beijing’s hawkish stance on the property sector remains intact,” Nomura analysts led by Ting Lu wrote in a note dated Monday. “We expect Beijing to maintain its property-related tightening measures and a rapid weakening of the property sector to deal a severe blow to headline GDP growth and government revenue.”
The government has so far maintained strict rules that force indebted developers to reduce leverage, as well as measures aimed at preventing a bubble in home prices.
The result is refinancing debt is becoming increasingly difficult for the sector, with junk-rated or unrated real estate firms selling the least amount of notes in the third quarter since late 2017. At the same time, sales of homes are plunging. Major developers recorded a 30% drop in sales in September from a year earlier, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note, citing China Real Estate Information Corp. data.
Fantasia failed to repay a $205.7 million bond that was due Monday, according to a company statement. Separately, Country Garden Services Holdings Co. said that a unit of Fantasia didn’t repay a 700 million yuan ($108 million) loan that also came due on Monday and that a default was probable. Fantasia ranked 60th in a list of contracted sales in the first quarter of this year, while Evergrande was third.
Evergrande -- which is at the epicenter of investor concern -- has yet to publish an update since halting shares pending an announcement on a “major transaction.” The company agreed to sell a majority stake in its property services unit to a Guangdong-based developer, Cailian reported on Monday, citing unidentified people. Last week, Evergrande agreed to sell a 20% stake in Shengjing Bank Co. to the local government in a deal that S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said marked the first step toward solving Evergrande’s liquidity crisis.
A Bloomberg index of Chinese real estate stocks is trading at less than 0.4 times book value. That shows stock traders are applying a significant discount to the value of assets held by Chinese developers -- near the largest in data going back to 2005. 
Fifteen of the country’s most stressed property developers will have $2.1 billion in bond payments due this month, according to calculations by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts, comprised mostly of coupons. The bill will more than double in January as principal payments come due, indicating market stress may reach another maximum around that time, the analysts wrote in a note.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Tesla ordered to pay over $130 million to Black former worker over racism -WSJ,"(Reuters) -A federal jury on Monday has ordered Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc to pay more than $130 million in damages to a Black former worker, finding he was subjected to a racially hostile work environment, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The jury determined that the company failed to take reasonable steps to prevent Owen Diaz, a contract worker who was employed as an elevator operator at Tesla's Fremont factory in 2015 and 2016, from being racially harassed, the newspaper said.
In a message to employees that Tesla posted on its website, the automaker noted the trial concerned racial slurs heard on the factory floor and racist graffiti in the bathrooms.
It also said the three times that Diaz complained about harassment, Tesla stepped in and made sure action was taken by staffing agencies.
The jury awarded Diaz $6.9 million in compensatory damages and $130 million in punitive damages, according to the newspaper. 
""While we strongly believe that these facts don't justify the verdict reached by the jury in San Francisco, we do recognize that in 2015 and 2016 we were not perfect,"" Tesla said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters query asking if it would be appealing the verdict. Diaz's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Before the trial began, presiding judge William Orrick rejected efforts by Tesla to exclude one juror from the jury, saying he believed the attempt was based on race and ""purposefully discriminatory.""

Tesla said in its blog post that since Diaz worked at the Fremont factory it had made changes including the establishment of teams dedicated to investigating employee complaints and to ensuring employees had equal opportunities at the company.
Last year, the electric carmaker disclosed in its first U.S. diversity report that Black employees make up just 4% of Tesla's American leadership roles and 10% of its total workforce in the country.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",George Floyd recommended for posthumous pardon on drug conviction,"(Reuters) - The Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles voted on Monday to recommend George Floyd get a full posthumous pardon for a 2004 drug conviction, the Harris County District Attorney said.
Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died in handcuffs with a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck for over nine minutes during a 2020 arrest, became the face of a movement challenging police brutality and bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.
The Texas board voted 7-0 to recommend the pardon, media reported, adding that the recommendation would be passed on to the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, for a final decision.
Floyd's conviction was related to a February 2004 case when a police officer accused him of selling $10 worth of crack cocaine in a sting operation in Texas when he lived there, the Associated Press report. 
Floyd later pleaded guilty to a drug charge and was sentenced to 10 months in a state jail, the news agency said.
""We lament the loss of former Houstonian George Floyd and hope that his family finds comfort in Monday’s decision by the Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend clemency for a 2004 conviction,"" Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement https://www.harriscountyda.com/statement-district-attorney-kim-ogg-clemency-george-floyd Monday.
Ogg urged the state governor to follow the board’s recommendation and grant clemency.
In April, an application for a posthumous pardon was filed on behalf of Floyd and his surviving family on the grounds that the arresting officer had manufactured the existence of confidential informants to bolster his cases, media reported.
The Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles and Abbott's office were not immediately available for comment late on Monday night.
Floyd's death, which a passerby caught on video, stoked social upheaval, racial tensions and political strife in the United States and beyond.

In June, a judge sentenced a former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin to 22-1/2 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd. 
The verdict was widely seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open just higher Tuesday, helped by strength in the heavyweight energy sector, but gains are likely to be restrained following the previous session’s broad selloff on Wall Street.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
The positive open for Europe comes despite concerns over losses on Wall Street on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, in particular, falling more than 2% on the back of rising Treasury yields as the standoff over the U.S. debt ceiling continues. 
Tech weakness nonetheless translated to selling in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling more than 2%, while markets in mainland China remain closed. 
Back in Europe, the important energy sector is set to get a boost from crude oil prices rising to multi-year highs after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, decided to continue increasing output only gradually despite demand recovering as the Delta-variant Covid-19 wave ebbs. Global cases hit their lowest in nearly two months on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins data.
OPEC+ ignored requests from a number of countries, including the U.S. and India, the largest and third largest consumers in the world, to produce more to lower prices.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $77.64 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $81.30. Both contracts gained well over 2% on Monday, with WTI hitting a seven-year high and Brent reaching a three-year peak.
In corporate news, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) will likely be in the spotlight after the reinsurer estimated Tuesday its preliminary claims burden from Hurricane Ida at $750 million, while updating its loss estimate for the July floods in Europe to approximately $520 million. In the U.K., bakery chain Greggs will get attention after raising its profit forecast for the full year despite warning of rising cost pressures.
The auto sector may also be in focus after British new car registrations fell last month by 35% year on year, according to preliminary industry data Tuesday, marking the weakest September for at least 23 years.
Additional economic data scheduled for release Tuesday include French industrial output, the latest Italian GDP reading and the final PMI data for the European region.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,758.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1595.

Fitch Ratings cut Fantasia’s credit grade several notches to CCC- on Monday, while Moody’s Investors Service also cut the company’s rating by one notch to B3. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings lowered its long-term rating for Fantasia Holdings to CCC from B on Sep. 29, due to “elevated risk” that it may not be able to implement a concrete repayment plan over the next several weeks for upcoming maturities."

The White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is hosting the event that will discuss critical applications of quantum computing, which is expected to operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) are also expected to attend, according to an administration spokesperson.
""There's a lot of excitement about quantum computers and quantum sensors, and there's some hype associated with that,"" said Charlie Tahan, assistant director for quantum information science at OSTP.
""But what we really want to get down to: what are the applications that a future quantum computer could run that could really benefit our society.""
The technology, which is based on core principles of physics, is still in its infancy but has become a darling of investors aspiring to revolutionize healthcare, finance, artificial intelligence, weather forecasting and other areas.
President Joe Biden's administration is especially focused on the national security implications of quantum technology, which promises the ability to easily crack encryption standards in use today. 
China, which Washington regards as its chief rival abroad, has also made significant efforts to develop the technology.
The Biden administration is also hoping to encourage more students to enter the field and to increase cybersecurity around private research and development to prevent snooping, Tahan said.

Congress has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the industry, including quantum research laboratories, and bills currently under consideration now could add billions more.
The White House meeting will also include the organizations ColdQuanta, D-Wave, IonQ, QC Ware, Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Economic Development-Consortium, Rigetti Computing, Vector Atomic and Zapata.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it had urged U.S. airports to limit the use of firefighting foam with the chemical PFAS due to the environmental and public health risks as it evaluates possible alternatives.
PFAS, nicknamed ""forever chemicals"" because they do not break down easily, have been associated with various illnesses including kidney cancer. They have been used for decades in household products such as nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant textiles, rugs, food packaging, photo imaging, and in industrial products. Many states have already outlawed their use in food packaging.
The FAA said more than 400 research tests have been completed which evaluated 15 fluorine-free firefighting foam products. The FAA said it ""expects a replacement product to be identified and eventually adopted.""
The FAA and Defense Department have been researching alternatives to extinguish a fuel fire or other emergencies.
""The FAA continues to evaluate firefighting foam that protects the flying public, human health and the environment,"" the agency said in a statement.
In 2018, Congress directed the FAA by Oct. 4 to ""not require the use of fluorinated chemicals to meet"" fire-fighter performance standards.
Airports Council International – North America said ""at present, FAA requirements compel us to use firefighting foam that contains PFAS, known as aqueous film forming foam.... We continue to collaborate with the FAA to ensure that airports are able to operate their facilities in safe, secure, and environmentally responsible ways.""
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson noted in an August letter that the FAA's alternative firefighting agent research project had been impacted by disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Airport operators are under considerable pressure from state and local governments and local communities to reduce or eliminate the use"" of PFAS at airports, Dickson said in the letter.

""There are significant and growing concerns about the human health impacts and associated liability associated with PFAS contamination on and near airports."" 
Since 2019, the FAA has taken several steps to effectively eliminate the need to discharge firefighting foam that contains PFAS except during an aircraft emergency.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Global airlines on Monday projected a sharp reduction in industry losses next year as a multi-speed recovery from the coronavirus crisis gets under way, but revised up the financial toll inflicted by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
The International Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade body, predicted that net losses at airlines would narrow to $11.6 billion in 2022 from $51.8 billion this year. 
The losses for 2021 were revised up from $47.7 billion estimated in April. IATA also revised up losses for 2020 to $137.7 billion from $126.4 billion estimated earlier.
While airlines across all regions are expected to perform better, those in North America are forecast to return to profit next year.
""We are past the deepest point of the crisis,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh told the group's annual meeting. ""While serious issues remain, the path to recovery is coming into view.""
Yet, IATA urged governments to keep wage support measures and slot wavers in place until international traffic recovers.
It expects international travel demand to double next year and reach 44% of the 2019 levels. However, the vaccination rate as well as the lifting of government-imposed border restrictions will determine the pace of recovery.
""People ... are being held back from international travel by restrictions, uncertainty and complexity,"" said Walsh.
As governments are viewing inoculations as a way out of the health crisis, Walsh said vaccines need to be made available to anybody who wants them. 
Domestic travel demand is estimated to reach 93% of the pre-pandemic level in 2022 - an improvement of 20 percentage points from this year.

Total passenger numbers are expected to increase to 3.4 billion next year from 2.3 billion in 2021, IATA estimates, but will be below 4.5 billion in 2019. 
Passenger revenue in 2022 is expected to jump about 67% year-on-year to $378 billion. Air cargo is forecast to remain a bright spot, with demand seen rising 13.2% above the 2019 levels, IATA said.

The Chu family control Hopson Development and could become the latest wealthy family to help shore up finances for Evergrande, after Hopson reportedly agreed to buy a controlling stake in its property services business, according to Cailian. Chu Mang Yee is described as an “invisible magnate” by Chinese media.
Hopson Development Plans Evergrande Property Stake (11:53 a.m.)
Hopson Development plans to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property Services, Cailian reported, citing unidentified people. That would give the management unit a valuation of more than HK$40 billion, Cailian said in an amended story. Hong Kong trading in Evergrande Property Services shares was suspended on Monday along with those of its parent. 
Hopson Development’s USD Bonds Tumble (11:35 a.m.)
Hopson Development’s dollar notes are set for their biggest losses on record Monday after Cailian reported the firm plans to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property Services. The company’s 6.8% dollar bond due 2023 sank 4.9 cents on the dollar to 90.2 cents, Bloomberg-compiled prices showed. The firm’s 7% note due 2024 declined 5 cents to 89.2 cents.
China Builder Sinic Faces Creditor Demanding $75 Million Payment (10:24 a.m.)
Amid heightened scrutiny on Chinese property firms as Evergrande contagion fears ripple through the sector, Sinic Holdings Group Co. received a demand to repay some debt after missing two local interest payments.
A creditor of the Chinese developer is demanding repayment of $75.4 million in outstanding principal and accrued interest, after the firm failed to repay 38.7 million yuan ($6 million) of interest on two onshore financing arrangements on Sept. 18, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing dated Sept. 30.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 09:02PM ET</span>",Ford JV partner SK sees U.S. battery shortage persisting until 2025,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co's battery joint venture partner, Korea's SK Innovation, expects the U.S. vehicle industry to face a battery supply shortage until 2025 because of the long lead times to build production facilities, top SK executives told Reuters.
SK Innovation's battery unit, SK On, is also considering developing lithium iron phosphate batteries (LFP), which have an advantage in cost and thermal stability despite a lower driving range, Kim Jun, chief executive of SK Innovation and Jee Dong-seob, CEO of SK On, said.
Tight supplies of batteries - key to electric vehicles - pose a challenge to the Biden administration, which aims to boost EV production and reduce the country's reliance on imports for battery cells, components and materials. 
""The current U.S. battery capacity is far short of meeting demand. Building a factory to meet demand requires a lead time of 30 months, and I see a battery shortage continuing at least until 2025,"" Kim said, referring to the time needed to supply battery cells domestically, including factory site selection, construction and product testing. 
In contrast, China is expected to have a battery oversupply, and Europe's supply will be in line with demand, he said. 
Ford and SK On plan to invest $4.45 billion each to build three new factories in the United States, with production slated to begin in 2025. 
With the deal for the plants, which will be the biggest in the United States, SK said it has an industry-leading order backlog of 1,600 gigawatt hours, enough for 27 million vehicles. 
SK Innovation spun off its battery business into its wholly-owned unit, SK On, as of Oct. 1. 
Kim said Ford Motor (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley told him that Ford's electrification destiny is ""in your hands.""
He said there was only a slim chance that some automakers would succeed in efforts to build cells by themselves without partnering with cell makers who have experience of mass production.
""Cell manufacturing is not that simple. It has to go through a lot of trial and error,"" Kim said.
SK is considering developing LFP batteries for specific applications such as low-priced vehicles, the two executives said.
""There is an interest in LFP technology from automakers,"" SK On's Jee said.
Ford and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are diversifying into LFP technology, which is the mainstay of Chinese battery makers, following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s lead.
The lower-range, cheaper LFP battery is also gaining attention for its thermal stability, after a series of vehicle fires involving nickel-based batteries produced by LG and used in GM's Bolt cars. 

SK, which does not have a record of fire accidents, plans to produce high-nickel, pouch-type batteries at its joint venture with Ford. 
SK On is considering other joint ventures and financing options, but will not hurry to go public, Kim said.

CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Pharmacy operators including CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc fueled the U.S. opioid epidemic by failing to stop massive quantities of addictive painkillers from reaching the black market, a lawyer for two Ohio counties said at the start of a trial on Monday.
Mark Lanier told a federal jury in Cleveland hearing the first trial the pharmacy chains have faced in nationwide litigation over the epidemic that the companies bore responsibility for drug abuse in the counties of Lake and Trumbull.
""They just dispensed like a vending machine,"" Lanier said in his opening statement.
He said the four pharmacy operators now on trial, who also include Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Giant Eagle Inc, were ""the last line of defense"" against people obtaining pills to illicitly sell on the streets.
Lanier said the companies did not employ enough pharmacists to do the job right, failed to identify ""red flags"" of misuse and prioritized filling prescriptions quickly while patients shopped at their retail stores.
""From the very beginning, they were supposed to train their pharmacists, and they didn't,"" Lanier said. ""From the very beginning, they should have given the pharmacists the tools they'd need and they didn't.""
Kaspar Stoffelmayr, a lawyer for Walgreens, countered that others were to blame for the surge in pain pills, including doctors who prescribed them and regulators who saw pain as needing vital treatment.
""Pharmacists don't create demands,"" he said. ""They don't tell doctors what prescriptions to write.""
Most instances of opioids being diverted for illicit uses did not involve pharmacies, Stoffelmayr said. He cited a study showing that most prescribed pain pills go unused and sit in medicine cabinets. ""A lot of them end up in wrong hands.""
Opening statements will continue on Tuesday with arguments from the other companies. They deny wrongdoing, saying criminals were more likely to obtain opioids illegally from other sources, including pill mills, crooked doctors and drug traffickers.
More than 3,300 cases have been brought largely by state and local governments seeking to hold the companies responsible for an opioid abuse epidemic that U.S. government data shows led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2019.
The pharmacy operators have never faced trial before in the litigation.
Should jurors find the companies created a public nuisance, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster will determine how much they must pay to abate, or address, the health crisis in the communities. He has urged the parties to settle.

The trial comes after the three largest U.S. distributors that supply pharmacies - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp - and the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in July proposed paying up to $26 billion to settle cases against them.
A bankruptcy judge in August approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners that the company values at more than $10 billion.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd expects to order more than 100 narrowbody and regional planes next year as well as widebodies capable of the world's longest commercial flights from Sydney to London, its chief executive said.
Qantas plans to select the preferred supplier to replace its ageing fleet of 75 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-800s and 20 717s in December, CEO Alan Joyce said in a virtual press briefing on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) annual meeting in Boston.
""It is only once in a generation you go through a major fleet renewal like this,"" he told reporters. ""This is a really strategic decision for our future.""
The orders would be worth billions of dollars and provide a boost to aircraft manufacturers that cut production during the pandemic at a time when many airlines, including Qantas, postponed deliveries due to lower demand.
Qantas will place a firm order for the planes by mid-2022, with deliveries expected from late 2023 to 2034, Joyce added.
The options under consideration include the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A320neo family, the A220 and  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ)'s E-Jet E2 family, Qantas said, confirming an earlier Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/qantas-launches-contest-replace-small-jets-sources-2021-10-03.
The airline said the new planes would reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions by around 15% and it would also work with the manufacturers on accelerating the use of sustainable aviation fuel in a bid to meet a target of net zero emissions by 2050.
Qantas is also looking to add to its long-haul fleet as it begins to recover from the pandemic. The airline last year postponed plans to order up to 12 Airbus A350 jets capable of Sydney-London and Sydney-New York flights, but Joyce said the widebody order is back on the agenda. 
""We're hoping in early 2022 we can make a call on it,"" he said. ""So the decision could happen at the same time (as the domestic fleet) or maybe even slightly ahead,""
The ultra-long haul flights could start in 2024 or 2025, he added.

Qantas also has an existing order for 109 A320neo family jets https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airshow-qantas-idUSKCN1TK06Q, which it said will mainly be used to replace budget arm Jetstar's fleet of A320 aircraft. 
The first plane from that order is due to be delivered in the second half of 2022, with the remainder to be received by the end of the decade, it said in a statement.

Three stocks that fit the bill include  LKQ  Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ), Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X).September and October have historically been considered two of the worst months for the market, and this year has been no different. Investors are dealing with an assortment of concerns ranging from the debt crisis to supply chain issues. In times of volatility, one strategy I like to employ is investing in “cash cow” stocks. These companies continuously produce steady cash flow.
It is named cash cows due to the similarity of cows producing milk regularly. Companies that produce steady cash flow are more equipped to navigate rocky markets or economic conditions than companies with low cash flow. This is because they have excess money to use as they see fit. A great place to find cash cow stocks is to look at the A-rated Pacer U.S. Cash Cows 100 ETF (COWZ).
The ETF screens the Russell 1000 for the top 100 companies based on free cash flow yield. Plus, since the beginning of September, the ETF has outperformed the S&P 500. So I imported the ETF's holdings into a screen to find the stocks with a Buy rating or higher in our POWR Ratings system. Some of the top stocks included LKQ Corporation (LKQ), Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD), and United States Steel Corporation (X), which is why I am highlighting them below.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen will urge the U.S. Congress on Tuesday to regulate the social media giant, which she plans to liken to tobacco companies that for decades denied that smoking damaged health, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters.
""When we realized tobacco companies were hiding the harms it caused, the government took action. When we figured out cars were safer with seatbelts, the government took action,"" said Haugen's written testimony to be delivered to a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""I implore you to do the same here.""
Haugen will tell the panel that Facebook executives regularly chose profits over user safety.
""The company's leadership knows ways to make Facebook and Instagram safer and won't make the necessary changes because they have put their immense profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" she will say. ""As long as Facebook is operating in the dark, it is accountable to no one. And it will continue to make choices that go against the common good.""
Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is on the subcommittee, said that she would ask Haugen about the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. 
""I am also particularly interested in hearing from her about whether she thinks Facebook did enough to warn law enforcement and the public about January 6th and whether Facebook removed election misinformation safeguards because it was costing the company financially,"" Klobuchar said in an emailed comment. 
The senator also said that she wanted to discuss Facebook's algorithms, and whether they ""promote harmful and divisive content.""
Haugen, who worked as a product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team, was the whistleblower who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls.
Facebook owns Instagram as well as WhatsApp.
The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Haugen added that ""Facebook's closed design means it has no oversight — even from its own Oversight Board, which is as blind as the public.""
That makes it impossible for regulators to serve as a check, she added.
""This inability to see into the actual systems of Facebook and confirm that Facebook’s systems work like they say is like the Department of Transportation regulating cars by watching them drive down the highway,"" her testimony says. ""Imagine if no regulator could ride in a car, pump up its wheels, crash test a car, or even know that seat belts could exist.""
The Journal's stories, based on Facebook internal presentations and emails, showed the company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm; failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy; and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls.
Haugen said Facebook had done too little to prevent its platform from being used by people planning violence.

""The result has been a system that amplifies division, extremism, and polarization — and undermining societies around the world. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people,"" she said.
Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and in the Jan. 6 assault by Trump supporters who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the U.S. stock market's four most valuable companies, each dropped more than 2%. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the fifth most valuable company, slumped almost 5% after its app and its photo-sharing platform Instagram were down for thousands of users, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
""For Big Tech, this is a short- to medium-term thing, part of a correction process.

U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors fretted about the lack of a debt ceiling fix in the U.S. Congress and looked ahead to the release this week of September employment data, which could pave the way for the tapering of Federal Reserve asset purchases.
President Joe Biden said he cannot guarantee the government will not breach its $28.4 trillion debt limit unless Republicans join Democrats in voting to raise it, as the United States faces the risk of a historic default in just two weeks.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Camera operators, make-up artists and other behind-the-scenes workers on Hollywood films and television shows voted resoundingly to authorize a strike if they cannot reach agreement with producers on a new contract, their union said on Monday.
The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) which represents some 60,000 off-screen workers, said that 90% of its members cast ballots and more than 98% of the votes returned were in favor of authorizing a strike. 
The vote strengthened the hand of IATSE leaders in stalled contract talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). 
The two sides will meet on Tuesday in the first contacts for two weeks, a union source said after the results of the ballot were announced. It was not clear whether the meeting would lead to a full resumption of talks.
""I hope that the studios will see and understand the resolve of our members,"" IATSE President Matthew Loeb said in a statement. ""If they want to avoid a strike, they will return to the bargaining table and make us a reasonable offer.""
""Our people have basic human needs like time for meal breaks, adequate sleep, and a weekend,"" Loeb added. 
The union is seeking to reduce working hours that can stretch to about 14 hours a day as the demand for TV shows and films has increased, particularly for streaming platforms such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) , Disney+, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Video.
It also wants raises for workers on streaming projects, who get paid less than for work on mainstream and cable TV shows under an agreement signed in 2009, when streaming and online media was in its infancy.
The AMPTP said in a statement it was ""committed to reaching an agreement that will keep the industry working"" but said it would require both parties showing ""a willingness to compromise and to explore new solutions.""
The last major strike in Hollywood was by film and television screenwriters in late 2007 and early 2008. It lasted three months and shut down all scripted shows and forced television networks to air re-runs of comedies and dramas.
The AMPTP has offered to improve rest periods between projects and to increase wage rates for crew members working on streaming shows, but the rates would still be below mainstream productions.

IATSE has won the support of powerful Hollywood unions representing actors, directors and writers. Actors Ben Stiller, Danny DeVito, Brie Larson, Seth Rogen and Kevin Bacon are among those who have sent messages supporting its demands. 
""They haul sets, equipment, designs, at all hours in all weather. They are the 1st in & last out. They're owed livable wages & hours, & we owe them our unwavering support. Without them, there is no show,"" tweeted ""Law & Order: SVU"" actress Mariska Hargitay.

""The market is really focused on Washington, D.C., and the uncertainty of being unable to come to agreement on the infrastructure, social spending plan and raising the debt limit,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 1.5 basis point to 1.4824%, after trading above 1.5%.
Adding to the growth worries, investor morale in the euro zone fell for the third month in a row in October.

1193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",Facebook Shares Suffer Worst Drop This Year as Tech Losses Mount,"(Bloomberg) -- Technology stocks were hammered again on Monday, extending recent declines for some of the world’s most valuable companies, which have been under pressure amid rising bond yields. 
The selloff was particularly painful for  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). with reports of global outages for users of its social-media apps helping to fuel the biggest drop in nearly a year. The company also is facing questions from a whisteblower who will be testifying before Congress. Its shares finished down 4.9%, the most since Nov. 9.
Three of the biggest U.S. technology companies fell more than the Nasdaq 100 Stock index, which sank 2.2% for its third decline of at least 2% in the past 11 trading days. In addition to Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). dropped 3%, followed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). sliding 2.5%. In addition,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). lost 2.1% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. retreated 2%.
 
Technology stocks are bearing the brunt of selling amid a spike in Treasury yields, which are used to calculate the present-day value of profits expected to be delivered far into the future. A sudden surge in those yields last week helped send the Nasdaq 100 to its worst weekly loss since February.
With the Nasdaq 100 now looking like it could fall for a fifth consecutive week, damage is beginning to mount for some its largest members. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, on Monday joined Facebook and Amazon.com in correction territory, which is signified by a drop of at least 10% from a peak. The iPhone maker has now fallen 11% from a Sept. 7 record, erasing about $300 billion in market value. 
Amazon.com has now lost 15% since a July high and is trading lower than it was at the start of the year. Facebook has declined 15% from its Sept. 7 closing high. Alphabet is down 8% from its record, though it’s still up 53% in 2021.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed lower Monday, as investors continued to abandon tech at a time when rates continue to climb and inflation is expected to remain elevated.      
The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.9% or 323 points, the Nasdaq was down 2.1%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down 5%, led the slump in tech after a Facebook whistle-blower named Frances Haugen alleged that the social media company prioritizes profit over the well-being of its users.  
The news brought the regulatory spotlight back onto the social media companies, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) falling more than 5%.
The selloff in tech was exacerbated by a further malaise in sentiment on growth stocks as investors price in higher rates and inflation.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell more than 2%.
Growth stocks like tech, with high valuations, tend to cash flow that extend further out into the future, which is unattractive in an inflationary environment.
Health care also contributed to the sea of red on Wall Street, led by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) as investors continued to ditch the stock following positive news of Merck’s late-stage trial for their new anti-viral pill.
Energy stocks bucked the trend, underpinned by rising oil prices after OPEC+ decided to stick with an existing agreement to hike oil output by 400,000 barrels per day in November.
Sentiment on Wall Street was also soured by ongoing uncertainty in Washington on several fronts including the need to raise the debt ceiling before the Oct. 18, to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt.
In other news, auto stocks rose, with Tesla and General Motors in the ascendency.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) climbed 1.6% after Engine No. 1, an activist hedge fund, said it had bought a stake in the company, citing optimism over the its electric vehicle expansion plans.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, was up 0.8% after reporting that vehicles in Q3 swelled to a record high despite the ongoing chip-supply shortage that is weighing on the activity in the industry.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s trophy U.S. campus is becoming an Internet meme.
The visually stunning complex, sometimes compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ring and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Googleplex campuses, opened in 2014 as Exxon stood atop of the global oil market. Its centerpiece is a giant cube that appears to float above the office and research facility. 
The cube has become the emblem for a wrenching staff exodus and Exxon's financial fall. Hundreds of departing employees this year have posted images on social media of them standing in front of it on their last day of work, and versions have spread among Exxon facilities worldwide. 
A historic, $22.4 billion loss last year fueled the departures of thousands of employees. Cost-cutting will pare 14,000 jobs by year-end, and this year's job review has led to voluntary and forced departures - accompanied by the social media postings of the cube. 
""You should scan social media and find all the people who are excited to be joining ExxonMobil,"" Exxon spokeperson Casey Norton told Reuters. Restructuring cuts finished last December and any positions opened this year due to performance-related dismissals may be refilled, he said.
Auld Lang Syne 
""That picture will always remind me of the positive experiences I had,"" said former Exxon finance supervisor Jason Crawford, who posted his own three weeks ago. He resigned after concluding that top management was ill-prepared for challenges ahead and Exxon's ""days of being a global leader are long behind them."" 
The cube was designed to showcase Exxon's engineering and technology prowess. A feat of engineering, it looms over the 385-acre campus, floating over an open courtyard and reflecting pools. 
Officially called Exxon Energy Center, it opened in 2014 at a time the firm was atop the global oil and gas market. Oil was selling for $100 a barrel and Exxon's market value, now about $258 billion, approached half a trillion dollars. 
The building initially provided a symbol of Exxon's high-tech ambitions for itself and a lure for talented engineers then flocking to high-tech companies. The campus has walking paths that wend through the area, restaurants, a gym with trainers, and physical science laboratories. 
HIGH-TECH LURE
Avery Smith, who posted his photo in front of the cube earlier this year, was one of those drawn to the complex. The 26-year-old data scientist worked at Exxon Mobil Research & Engineering and left last January to start Snow Data Science. 
Exxon's ""rigid culture"" limited the projects he wanted to pursue and its pandemic work-from-home restrictions grated on him. ""I was a little trapped in my position and wanted to do bigger projects,"" Smith said, choosing to launch his own enterprise. 
The cube represents the company at its best, said Smith and others who posted their cube portraits. 
""I was challenged to work with people all over the world,"" wrote engineer Margaret Webb, with assignments ""tackling some of the largest problems in the world today."" 
Although she left Exxon in February ""before this trend became popular,"" Webb recently felt compelled to add hers after seeing hundreds materialize from colleagues.
""The biggest thing I take away is this - something needs to be done about how engineers consider the ethical, social and environmental impacts of their daily work,"" she wrote. 
A LEGO REPLICA

Cube references now appear in goodbyes far from Texas. An Exxon scientist in Calgary, Alberta, built a Cube replica from Legos for his goodbye image. A Buenos Aires, Argentina, finance supervisor drew on a photo from a prior visit for his.
""I don't have the customary energy cube picture,"" lamented Krishnan Kumaran, 55, who last month took early retirement after 18 years at the company. His goodbye included ""a picture of the (Exxon) building located in pastoral Clinton, New Jersey,"" where he worked as a computational scientist.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 03:51PM ET</span>",Evergrande eyeing $5 billion property unit sale; rival Fantasia misses payment,"By Tom Westbrook and Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Debt-saddled China Evergrande is set to raise more than $5 billion by selling a majority stake in its property management arm, Chinese media said on Monday, a deal which would be the struggling giant's largest asset sale yet if it goes ahead.
Once China's top-selling property group, Evergrande is facing one of the country's largest-ever defaults as it struggles with more than $300 billion of debt. Its fate is also unsettling global markets wary about the fallout of one of China's biggest borrowers toppling.
Evergrande on Monday said it requested a halt in the trading of its shares in Hong Kong pending an announcement about a major transaction. Evergrande Property Services Group, a spin-off listed last year, also requested a halt and said it referred to ""a possible general offer for shares of the company.""
China's state-backed Global Times said Hopson Development was the buyer of a 51% stake in the property business for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), citing unspecified other media reports. Hopson also said it had suspended its shares, pending an announcement related to a major acquisition of a Hong Kong-listed firm and a possible mandatory offer.
Neither Hopson nor Evergrande responded to requests for comment on the Global Times report. 
Analysts said the possible deal signals the company is still working to meet its obligations. But it also underscored concerns about the rest of China's property sector and the broader economy if there is a fire-sale of Evergrande's assets.
""Selling an asset means they are still trying to raise cash to pay the bills,"" said OCBC analyst Ezien Hoo. ""Looks like the property management unit is the easiest to dispose in the grand scheme of things.""
There was another key development in the sector on Monday too as one of Evergrande's smaller rivals, Fantasia Holdings', said it had missed a $206-million bond payment deadline. 
Credit ratings agency Fitch had slashed the firm's credit rating by four notches earlier in the day, too, after the firm revealed it had underwritten another bond that it had previously not disclosed on its books.
With a market value of $415 million, Fantasia is a minnow. But its missed deadline adds to worries of a sector-wide crunch that could put further pressure on China's already slowing economy.
The $5 billion Evergrande would earn from its reported sale meanwhile would theoretically cover the firm's international bond payments for the next six months. It has around $500 million in coupon payments due by the end of the year, followed by a $2-billion dollar bond maturity in March.
The price represents a roughly 17.5% discount to the Services Group's December 2020 listing valuation, although Evergrande's group shares have slumped 80% since then. 
In contrast, Hopson's shares have jumped 40% this year making it worth around HK$60 billion ($7.8 billion).
NERVOUSNESS
Evergrande's property services business, which says it managed a total contracted floor area of 810 million square metres at the end of June, was also profitable in the first half of 2021, based on its financial statements.
With liabilities equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, Evergrande has sparked concerns its troubles could spread through the global financial system.
Nervousness has eased after China's central bank vowed to protect homebuyers' interests, but ramifications for China's economy kept investors on edge - particularly as signs of distress have begun spreading to Evergrande's peers. 
Monday's share trading suspension knocked the offshore yuan, which fell about 0.3% against the dollar, and weighed on the Hang Seng benchmark index.
Still, the possible deal activity lifted shares in Evergrande's electric vehicle unit by 29% but cast a pall over regional stocks and global markets. [MKTS/GLOB]
""It is definitely a positive move towards solving Evergrande’s liquidity crisis and we expect more to come,"" said Gary Ng, senior economist Asia Pacific at Natixis.
""However, having said that, offloading some assets may not be totally sufficient, the key for Evergrande is to get project construction going and to sell inventory.""
Shares in Evergrande have plunged 80% so far this year, while its bonds have held steady at distressed levels.
The group said last month it had negotiated a settlement with some domestic bondholders and made a repayment on some wealth management products, largely held by Chinese retail investors. 
Holders of the company's $20 billion in offshore debt appear further back in the creditor queue and bondholders have said interest payments due in the past few weeks have failed to arrive.

Evergrande faces deadlines on dollar bond coupon payments totalling $162.38 million in October.

Tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)sold off during the session. 
It didn’t help when St. Louis Federal Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said inflation could remain elevated for some time because higher expectations become entrenched.
But some areas were showing a healthy bounce. Electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) rose after it revealed it delivered a record number of electric cars in the third quarter.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Eli Lilly’s recalled emergency diabetes drug came from plant cited by FDA,"By Dan Levine and Marisa Taylor
(Reuters) - A recently recalled batch of Glucagon Emergency Kits, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co’s therapy for diabetic patients in crisis, was manufactured at an Indiana factory cited by U.S. health regulators this year for quality-control violations, including several involving that product, according to the company and a Reuters review of federal inspection records.
The Indianapolis-based company on Sept. 24 issued a voluntary U.S. recall of one lot of the kits whose key ingredient is Glucagon, a drug used to treat dangerously low blood sugar in diabetes patients. The company issued a voluntary recall in Canada the following day.
Lilly’s recall notices said that the company had received a report of a patient who experienced seizures even after being injected with the drug, a sign that the treatment was not potent enough to work. The company said the product failure might be related to its manufacturing process, without elaborating.
In response to Reuters’ inquiries, Lilly told the news organization that the affected kits were produced at a company facility in Indianapolis, and that the kit that prompted the recall had been distributed in Canada. As Reuters reported in May, the Indianapolis plant had been cited by U.S. health regulators https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-lilly-hit-by-staff-accusations-fda-scrutiny-covid-drug-factories-2021-05-05 for substandard sanitation and quality control procedures.
Separately, Lilly is facing a federal criminal investigation https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/exclusive-us-opens-criminal-probe-into-alleged-lapses-eli-lilly-plant-2021-05-27 into alleged manufacturing irregularities involving another of its U.S. factories in New Jersey, details of which were first reported by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elililly-special-report/special-report-insider-alleges-eli-lilly-blocked-her-efforts-to-sound-alarms-about-u-s-drug-factory-idUSKBN2B31K5 earlier this year. The recall of Glucagon kits made in Indianapolis is the first indication of potential patient harm due to recent manufacturing issues at the company’s plants.
“Lilly is deeply committed to manufacturing high-quality medicines for patients who need them—nothing is more important to us,” the company said in a statement. “We take our obligations seriously and have rigorous quality systems in place to ensure compliance with stringent regulatory requirements.”
In all, roughly 66,000 Glucagon Emergency Kits were affected by the recalls, Lilly spokeswoman Kathryn Beiser told Reuters. She said about 19,000 of those were distributed to U.S. customers and nearly all the rest in Canada. She said the kits were produced at the Indianapolis plant around May 2020. Beiser declined to say whether Lilly has received other reports of adverse events related to the Glucagon kits.
EMERGENCY KITS
The recalled Glucagon Emergency Kit was designed for diabetes patients whose blood sugar is plummeting, and who need to raise it quickly to avoid complications that can include seizures or death. The kit consists of a vial, which is supposed to contain freeze-dried Glucagon powder, and a separate syringe filled with liquid.
Normally, a caregiver inserts the liquid-filled syringe needle into the Glucagon vial in order to dilute the powder before administering it. Lilly's recall announcement said the vial used by the stricken patient contained liquid, instead of powder.
The company’s Indianapolis plant performs what is known in the industry as “fill and finish” - receiving raw drugs made at other facilities, putting them into vials and syringes, and shipping them to customers.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspection records from March 2021 viewed by Reuters cited numerous quality-control violations at that plant, such as staff failing to properly monitor environmental conditions where the finished drugs are made and failing to establish appropriate procedures to prevent contamination.
The FDA inspectors said they observed lapses in the manufacturing of the Glucagon kits as well as in Lilly’s COVID-19 antibody therapy bamlanivimab and several other drugs, according to the inspection records, dated March 16. They concluded that Lilly must take steps to remedy the lapses but did not recommend regulatory action on the part of the FDA.
Lilly spokeswoman Beiser said U.S. distribution of Glucagon Emergency Kits from the lot that was later recalled had ceased by March 25, a little more than a week after the FDA inspection report. Beiser said the distribution of the lot followed its regular process via wholesaler channels and was not related to the FDA report, adding that “any suggestion"" it ended for other reasons is false.
Meanwhile, emergency kits from that same batch continued to be distributed in Canada, Beiser said. Distribution of 44,000 kits in Canada began in February 2021 and continued through the middle of September, she said. The patient complaint that triggered the late September recall involved a kit that had been shipped to Canada, Beiser told Reuters.
Beiser declined to comment specifically on why distribution of Glucagon Emergency Kits from the batch continued for another six months in Canada after distribution had ceased in the United States. She did not answer questions about whether the affected patient recovered.
Health Canada, a regulatory agency similar to the U.S. FDA, declined to comment about Lilly’s voluntary recall of the Glucagon Emergency Kits, or why kits from the batch continued to be distributed in Canada for months after they had ceased to be distributed in the United States.
The FDA declined to comment on distribution of the kits, whether it had received other reports of adverse events, had re-inspected Lilly's Indianapolis facility or if it planned additional actions related to the recall.
“It is important to note that this recall was a voluntary action taken by the company,” FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said, without elaborating. “We have been closely evaluating this event and will continue to monitor the marketplace and manufacturing efforts to help ensure the availability of safe products for U.S. consumers.”
FEDERAL PROBE
The recall comes as Lilly faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into alleged manufacturing irregularities and records-tampering at a separate factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, that produces bamlanivimab and other drugs.
The Justice Department has not accused Lilly of any wrongdoing, and the company said earlier this year that it is cooperating in the probe. Lilly did not respond to a question from Reuters about the status of that investigation. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Bamlanivimab, the COVID-19 antibody, manufactured at the Branchburg facility has been sent to the Indianapolis fill-and-finish plant to be put into vials and shipped.
A group of FDA inspectors arrived at the Indianapolis plant in mid-February and stayed for more than two weeks, according to a redacted version of their report, which Reuters obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.
In their report, the inspectors listed Glucagon as among the drugs where Lilly “failed to establish an adequate system for monitoring environmental conditions,” and noted that Lilly failed to establish and follow appropriate written procedures “to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile.”
In addition, the inspectors said Lilly did not properly conduct quality-control sampling of glass components like vials and pharmaceutical ingredients for drugs including Glucagon, bamlanivimab and the cancer drug Cyramza.

In Lilly’s April 6 response to the FDA obtained by Reuters through an open records request, the company said it takes the inspectors’ findings “very seriously” and is implementing actions to resolve concerns “on aggressive timelines.”
Lilly said it has established a comprehensive environmental monitoring program designed to assess microbiological control of manufacturing spaces, the redacted response said. The company did not respond to questions about the status of its efforts to rectify violations noted by the FDA at the Indianapolis plant.

As the crisis is not expected to wind down anytime soon, we believe companies such as  Nike  Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON), and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), are best avoided now.As the pandemic-induced constraints are easing, the demand for energy, labor, and transport has surged. This sudden acceleration in demand is putting a huge strain on supply chains and affecting several companies.
Moreover, despite the change in administrative power, Trump-imposed tariffs on about $350 billion of Chinese-made products continue to remain in place, leading to high costs for importers. While the Biden administration comprehensively evaluates US-China trade policy, the pressure to address the problem is mounting as the global supply chain problems worsen.
Shares of Nike Inc. (NKE),  Peloton Interactive Inc . (PTON), and Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY) have fallen due to the ongoing supply chain disruptions, as investors expected their financials to be impacted in the near term. So, it could be wise to avoid these overvalued stocks.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slumped Monday, paced by a selloff in tech at a time when investors are fretting about rising inflation and slowing growth.
The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.1% or 385 points, the Nasdaq was down 2.4%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), down nearly 6%, led the slump in tech after a Facebook whistle-blower named Frances Haugen alleged that the social media company prioritizes profit over the wellbeing of its users.  
The news brought the regulatory spotlight back onto the social media companies, with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) falling more than 6%.
The selloff in tech was exacerbated by a further malaise in sentiment on growth stocks as investors price in higher rates and inflation.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell more than 2%.
Growth stocks like tech, with high valuations, tend to cash flow that extend further out into the future, which is unattractive in an inflationary environment.
Health care also contributed to the sea of red on Wall Street, led by Moderna (MX:MRNA) as investors continued to ditch the stock following positive news of Merck’s late-stage trial for their new anti-viral pill.
Energy stocks, bucked the trend, underpinned by rising oil prices after OPEC+ decided to stick with an existing agreement to hike oil output by 400,000 barrels per day in November.
Sentiment on Wall Street was also soured by ongoing uncertainty in Washington on several fronts including the need to raise the debt ceiling before the Oct. 18, to avoid the U.S. defaulting on its debt.
In other news, auto stocks rose, with Tesla and General Motors in the ascendency.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) climbed 1% after Engine No. 1, an activist hedge fund, said it had bought a stake in the company, citing optimism over the its electric vehicle expansion plans.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, was up 1% after reporting that vehicles in Q3 swelled to a record high despite the ongoing chip-supply shortage that is weighing on the activity in the industry.

BOSTON (Reuters) - An upcoming United Nations climate summit will give world leaders a chance to push for standardized measures of areas like corporate carbon emissions, the head of the largest U.S. pension fund said on Monday. 
Marcie Frost, chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said she is optimistic leaders at the event known as ""COP26"" will take an important step in slowing global warming by helping investors decide which companies to buy or sell.
""When institutional funds like Calpers are making allocation decisions on this data, we believe that will be a bit of an inflection point,"" said Frost, speaking in an interview at  the  Reuters Impact conference.
With $469 billion under management as of June 30 Calpers has been influential in driving the adoption of standards to measure corporations' so-called ESG impact on environmental, social and governance topics.
Currently investors are faced with a wide variety of ESG ratings systems from private companies to measure areas ranging from their greenhouse gas reduction targets to the diversity of their workforces. Corporations have space to offer statements that sound ambitious but don't stand up to scrutiny, Frost said.
In some instances, ""You ask three probing questions and it all rather dissolves,"" she said.
Frost said it could still be a year or two before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivers official standards for how companies might report audited information.
Other helpful steps would be if governments removed fossil fuel subsidies and adopted carbon pricing systems, Frost said.
Some pension funds in other Democratic-led states have moved to divest from fossil fuels. Resisting such calls, Calpers instead has embraced a strategy of pressing for changes from within.

Frost noted Calpers' role in the Climate Action 100+, an investor network created to pressure companies. It also backed the activist campaign that led to the election of new directors at ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp this year.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>",Senator asks Facebook CEO to answer questions on teen safety,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic Senator Ed Markey on Monday asked for answers from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg after new research suggested the social media company failed to prevent display of harmful advertisements to teen Facebook users.
Markey cited comments by a Facebook executive before Congress last week that the site does not allow weight-loss ads to be shown to people under the age of 18 already, or any tobacco ads.
Markey said ""new research shows Facebook allowed advertisers to target with exactly these types of inappropriate and dangerous content to teen users."" Facebook did not immediately comment.
Markey cited research conducted by the Campaign for Accountability’s Tech Transparency Project, that as recently as last month Facebook allowed advertisers to target teen users as young as 13 with ""inappropriate and dangerous content, including advertisements promoting 'pill abuse, alcoholic beverages, anorexia, smoking, dating services, and gambling.'""
Markey added: ""“These findings cast serious doubt on Facebook’s compliance with promises your employees have publicly made, and they are particularly concerning in light of other recent reports, which suggest that Facebook has direct knowledge that its platforms are harmful to young people.""
On Tuesday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen will testify at a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing about Facebook and Instagram’s impacts on young users.
Haugen told ""60 Minutes"" in an interview that aired Sunday that ""Facebook's own research says, as these young women begin to consume this -- this eating disorder content, they get more and more depressed. And it actually makes them use the app more.""

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, chair of the subcommittee holding the hearing, said the testimony is ""critical to understanding what Facebook knew about its platforms' toxic effects on young users, when they knew it, and what they did about it.""
Last week Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook, said it had hit a pause on a new app it is creating for children.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 02:16PM ET</span>","Facebook again asks judge to dismiss U.S. lawsuit to force sale of Instagram, WhatsApp","By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Facebook Inc asked a judge on Monday to dismiss the U.S. government's revised antitrust case that seeks to force the social media giant to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said in a court filing that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had failed to provide a ""plausible factual basis for branding Facebook an unlawful monopolist."" The company added it appears the FTC ""had no basis for its naked allegation that Facebook has or had a monopoly.""
The social media giant asked that the lawsuit be dismissed with prejudice, which would make it harder for the agency to amend the lawsuit. The FTC declined to comment.
Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in June that the FTC's original complaint filed in December failed to provide evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in the social-networking market.
The FTC's amended complaint, filed in August, added more detail on its accusation the social media company crushed or bought rivals and again asked Boasberg to order the sale of Instagram and WhatsApp.
The FTC argued at length in its revised complaint that Facebook dominates the U.S. personal social networking market with more than 65% of monthly active users since 2012.
Facebook filing said the FTC's complaint was ""at odds with the commercial reality of intense competition with surging rivals like TikTok and scores of other attractive options for consumers.""
The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines in August to file the amended lawsuit and denied Facebook's request that agency chair Lina Khan be recused.
In its motion, Facebook argued that the FTC vote to file the amended complaint was not valid because Khan participated.
It included a long series of statements from Khan, made before she became chair of the FTC, which were critical of the social media giant. In a series of tweets from December 2020, she praises lawsuits brought by the FTC and state attorneys general saying ""hopeful that it marks yet another step forward in the growing efforts to rehabilitate antitrust laws.""
Facebook also notes that the FTC is suing to undo mergers that it had approved: Instagram, which it bought in 2012 for $1 billion, and WhatsApp, which it bought in 2014 for $19 billion.
""The FTC challenges acquisitions that the agency cleared after its own contemporaneous review...,"" the motion said. ""The case is entirely without legal or factual support. This is as true now as it was before.""

Facebook also included a dissent from FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, a Republican, who had voted to oppose filing the amended lawsuit because the FTC had raised no objections to the Instagram and WhatsApp deals. 
""The FTC's fictional market ignores the competitive reality: Facebook competes vigorously with TikTok, iMessage, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snapchat, LinkedIn, YouTube, and countless others to help people share, connect, communicate or simply be entertained,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""The FTC cannot credibly claim Facebook has monopoly power because no such power exists.""

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>","Banks make slow progress on UK gender pay, while gap widens for insurers","By Carolyn Cohn and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Major banks in Britain made a slight dent in their gender pay gaps last year, according to a Reuters analysis, though industry observers say they still have a long way to go. Several insurers went backwards. 
Companies in Britain with more than 250 employees have been required to publish the difference between the pay and bonuses of their male and female employees since 2017. 
They got a reprieve last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic - though many still filed data - and had an extra six months to publish data for 2019/2020. The deadline is Oct. 5.
The financial services sector has typically shown one of the largest gender pay gaps in Britain, often attributed to a lack of women in senior jobs. 
Reuters collated pay gap data from 21 major financial institutions, which showed a narrowing in their average mean gender pay gap of just 0.4 percentage points to 33.4% in the year to April 2020, from 33.8% in 2019. 
Banks alone had a pay gap which narrowed by one percentage point.
The mean average gender pay gap for all UK employers in the year ending April 2019 was 14.6%. 
""The UK's financial services industry has often been singled out,"" said Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute. 
""It really does have to get its house in order - the industry is a huge employer in the UK and it has a real opportunity to lead by example.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) had the widest gender pay gap in the year to April 2020 among the companies surveyed by Reuters, though the gap narrowed more than at other banks compared with a year earlier.
Goldman posted a gender pay gap of 51.8%, a tightening of 1.4 percentage points. The bank told staff in a memo in April that narrowing the gap further was a ""critical priority"" and its firmwide goal was to have 40% representation of women at vice president level by 2025. 
""There is clearly more still to be done,"" a spokesperson for banking lobby group UK Finance said, adding many of its members had committed to the government's Women in Finance Charter.
FTSE 100 insurers Prudential (NYSE:PUK), Legal & General and M&G reported a widening in their pay gaps, according to government filings and company reports. 
Graphic: Slow progress: Finance firms edge down gender pay gaps https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-FINANCE/egpbkydykvq/chart.png 
Prudential's UK gender pay gap widened to 45.2% from 40.3%, which the Asia-focused insurer attributed in its latest gender pay gap report at least in part to the spin-out of its UK life insurer and asset manager M&G in 2019. 
However, M&G also reported a widening in its pay gap in the most recent year, to 30.5% from 25%.
""We are determined to narrow our gender pay gap and will do this by achieving better representation of women in all roles at all levels of our organisation, especially in leadership positions,"" an M&G spokesperson said by email.
Legal & General's mean gender pay gap widened to 30.8% from 27.6%. 
""Legal & General is tackling the underlying causes of its pay gap by creating a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive culture through sustained, long-term action,"" the insurer said in its latest gender pay report. 

Among the large firms surveyed by Reuters, only insurer Admiral had a gender pay gap lower than the most recently published average across all sectors. Admiral had a gender pay gap last year of 12.8%.
The 21 firms surveyed were  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), NatWest, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs International, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), PGMS (a Phoenix unit), abrdn, Schroder Investment Management, St James's Place, Legal & General, Prudential,  Admiral Group  (LON:ADML),  Aviva  (LON:AV) and M&G.

While scientists are divided over the need for booster shots when so many people in the United States and other countries remain unvaccinated, the Biden administration announced the push for an extra dose in August as part of an effort to shore up protection against the highly transmissible Delta variant.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week scheduled an Oct. 15 meeting of its expert advisory committee to discuss whether to grant emergency use authorization for a booster shot of J&J (NYSE:JNJ)'s vaccine. 
Over 15 million Americans have received J&J's vaccine, which is administered as a single dose, according to the latest data https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The healthcare conglomerate last month said an additional second shot of its vaccine given about two months after the first increased its effectiveness to 94%, compared with 70% protection with the single dose.
J&J declined to comment on the NYT report and pointed to its press release dated Sept. 21, saying the company has submitted available data to the U.S. health regulator and intends to submit the data to other regulators.

The FDA has already authorized a booster dose of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech vaccine for those 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
Rival  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc also submitted its application seeking authorization for a booster shot of its two-dose vaccine last month and FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee panel will hold a meeting on Oct. 14 to discuss the additional dose.

However, this doesn’t mean every stock is necessarily a good buy. We believe investors are better off avoiding cannabis stocks  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC), Hexo (HEXO (NASDAQ:HEXO)), and Flora Growth (FLGC) because of their weak growth potential and bleak fundamentals. Read on.Cannabis stocks have been quite volatile over the past year. Stocks surged as retail investors piled in and growth stocks outperformed. Then, the sector had another leg higher as Democrats winning the executive and legislative branches made people optimistic about it being legalized at the federal level. 
On the other hand, many cannabis producers are struggling as the crop’s price keeps trending lower due to advances in growing technology and increasing yield. Further, there are no barriers to entry. 
Given this backdrop, it could be wise to stay away from fundamentally weak cannabis stocks Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC), Hexo Corp. (HEXO), and Flora Growth Corporation (FLGC).

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 12:17PM ET</span>",REUTERS IMPACT-Al Gore: China could surprise the world at Glasgow climate talks,"By Axel Threlfall and Timothy Gardner
(Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore is hopeful China and the United States will set aside their differences at U.N. climate change talks in Glasgow, just as they came together in 2015 to help hammer out the Paris Agreement.
Speaking in an interview broadcast on Monday at the Reuters Impact conference, Gore also said China could surprise the world by bringing forward one or both of its targets for reaching peak emissions and becoming carbon neutral.
Gore said frictions between China and the United States, the world's top two greenhouse gas polluters, had to be taken into account. Beijing and Washington have clashed over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as military activity in the South China Sea. 
But Gore, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on informing the world about climate change, held out hope that tensions between the two could ease at the U.N. COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, which start on Oct. 31.
""It's true that in the earlier part of this year ... it didn't seem as if the stars were aligned,"" he said. ""Since then, we have seen a welcome pledge from (President) Xi Jinping at the U.N. General Assembly, announcing that China will halt its financing of overseas coal plants.""
Xi announced last month https://reut.rs/3oBZPhv that China would stop building new coal-fired power plants overseas after similar pledges by Japan and South Korea earlier this year. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry had urged China to follow their lead.
Ahead of COP26, global business leaders and politicians are taking part in the Reuters Impact conference to discuss efforts to mitigate climate change and drive sustainable growth.
'ABSOLUTELY FALSE INFORMATION'
Gore said he believes Xi could pull forward one or both of the climate targets that he set at last year's U.N. General Assembly - that China would reach peak emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060.
""China could surprise the world at Glasgow,"" Gore said.
U.S. President Joe Biden pledged in September https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-seeks-double-climate-change-aid-developing-nations-biden-2021-09-21 to work with Congress to double funds to help developing countries deal with climate change to $11.4 billion a year by 2024 and Gore said this could help push other countries to boost their pledges.
An increase in funding could help achieve a global goal set more than a decade ago of $100 billion per year by 2020 to help countries vulnerable to climate change, a deadline that has come and gone without the target being hit. 
Gore also said he was hopeful about recent actions by business groups such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group of investors with $43 trillion in assets that have joined a push to limit greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. 
But he called out efforts by fossil fuel companies pushing, ""absolutely false information to try to deceive people into thinking that the climate crisis is not real or not that bad, or that they have solutions in their purview"". 
He criticized announcements by U.S. energy company  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) about expanding capacity of renewable natural gas, or gas captured at land fills and from agricultural waste. 
""That's ridiculous. There is no such thing,"" Gore said about so-called renewable natural gas. 
Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Despite being hopeful, Gore said the world was not moving fast enough.

Without more action, extreme weather could lead to an increase in refugees fleeing developing countries, which can trigger ""xenophobia"" and ""populist authoritarian impulses"", in the countries they move to, he said.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 12:16PM ET</span>",EU regulator backs mRNA vaccine booster for people with weak immunity,"By Ludwig Burger and Yadarisa Shabong
(Reuters) -The European Union's drugs regulator said on Monday people with weakened immune systems should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), but left it to member states to decide if the wider population should have a booster. 
The long-awaited guidance comes after several EU member states pre-empted the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) opinion and launched their own booster campaigns, although they vary widely over who is eligible. 
The EU joins the United States, Britain and Israel where regulators have approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech boosters, although there is no consensus among scientists about how broadly they should be rolled out. Israel is the outlier, deploying them across the whole population.
The EMA said people with a severely weakened immune system should be given a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines - both based on so-called mRNA technology - at least 28 days after their second one.
Many treatments for cancer patients or for people with organ transplants suppress the immune system, making them particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus infection with reduced help offered from vaccines.
Results from Italian studies released on Monday showed COVID-19 vaccines are less effective on people with weakened immune systems.
The EMA also said a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be considered for adults with normal immune systems around six months after the second dose, but added that was up to individual countries. 
Governments are under pressure to revive their ailing economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant, and avoid further lockdowns this winter. 
The EMA's ruling comes after the EU's infectious diseases centre warned last week the region's coverage of vaccines was still too low and there was a risk of a significant surge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks.
MORE DATA
Marc Van Ranst, virologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium said decision on boosters was expected and would ""legitimise the choices that some governments already made"" in Europe.
He added the EMA’s broad go-ahead could lead to a further fragmentation of national decisions on the use of boosters, but more data was needed for the regulator to justify a more specific verdict.
Antonella Viola, professor of immunology at Italy's University of Padua, said the risk of heart inflammation from the mRNA vaccines, albeit rare, needed to be taken into account and the benefit of a booster for younger adults was questionable.
The World Health Organization has criticised rich nations for hoarding COVID-19 vaccines for booster campaigns for larger population groups while poorer countries are struggling to rollout even first doses. 
Allowing EU countries to decide broader use of a booster is consistent with the EMA's earlier decisions in the pandemic - for instance it largely left it up to member states to decide whether to restrict vaccines in the face of potential side effects.
The EMA said it was hoping to see more data to underpin recommendation updates.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech presented data in their filings for their booster that showed levels of virus-fighting antibodies in the blood of vaccinated people wane over time and that a third shot was shown to cause a fresh surge in antibodies.
Researchers say immune cells, another important factor in immunisation, might confer longer-lasting protection against severe disease but their presence in the blood is more difficult to measure and more research is needed. 
The University of Padua's Viola said the young and healthy, in particular, should be not get a repeat shot.
""The vaccines we have used protect everyone from severe disease with very high efficacy,"" she added.

The EMA said on Sept. 6 it had begun evaluating data submitted by Pfizer and BioNTech for a booster dose in people with a functioning immune system, with infections among vaccinated people adding urgency to its review.
It also started evaluating last week the merits of a booster dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Investors argue Musk should repay $9.4 billion to Tesla for SolarCity deal,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A Delaware judge should order Elon Musk to repay $9.4 billion to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for the benefits he received by pushing the electric vehicle maker in 2016 to buy an ailing solar company he partly owned, according to Tesla investors in a court filing late Friday.
The investors said a ""simple and practical"" way to undo the benefits they say Musk improperly received from the $2.6 billion deal for SolarCity would be to order the chief executive to return the Tesla shares he received for his stock in the rooftop solar company. 
Musk received 2.4 million Tesla shares, which have grown to 12 million shares due to stock splits and are currently worth about $9.4 billion. The investors said Musk, one of the world's richest people, could also repay the value of the stock to the company.
Tesla stock was up 2.5% in early Monday trading at $792.76 per share.
The lawsuit was brought by union pension funds and asset managers. They allege in their post-trial brief that Musk did not recuse himself from the deal negotiations and never disclosed SolarCity was nearly out of cash.
Musk said in his own post-trial brief filed late Friday that SolarCity was the culmination of a decade-long plan to create a vertically integrated clean energy company offering roof-top solar generation combined with Tesla's battery storage and vehicles.
He said the deal was struck at a fair price and approved by 85% of Tesla shareholders.
The briefs follow a two-week trial in July in Wilmington, Delaware.

The judge, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights, must still answer a key question that could determine the outcome of the case - whether Musk is a controlling shareholder despite owning a minority stake in Tesla.
Slights has scheduled post-trial arguments for January and a ruling would likely take place months after that.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines said that its ticket sales had stabilized and started to improve, putting it on course to deliver third-quarter revenue within its original forecast range. ""For Delta, they bottomed out in the later part of August and the first part of September,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian told reporters on Sunday on the sidelines of a meeting of airlines group IATA. ""Business traffic is growing back in the U.S."" In July, the company had forecast a 30%-35% drop in third-quarter adjusted revenue versus 2019 levels. Last month, the airline said quarterly revenue would be at the lower end of the forecast after a resurgence in COVID-19. A Delta official on Monday said there has been no update to the outlook the company provided last month. The airline is due to report results for the quarter through September on Oct. 13. Bastian said domestic travel bookings are expected to surpass 2019 levels next year. Later, the airline said it would boost its capacity at Boston by more than 20% next summer over the 2019 peak, by adding five new routes including two international destinations.
The company is also seeing a surge in demand for trans-Atlantic flights after the White House's decision late last month to reopen the country to fully vaccinated travelers from around the world.
Trans-Atlantic flights accounted for 11% to 17% of 2019 passenger revenues for the big three air carriers - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta.
Bastian said Delta's staff vaccination rate had risen to 84%, driven in part by the company's decision to impose a $200 monthly health insurance surcharge for those who had not been vaccinated. He said he expects the rate to surpass 90% by Nov. 1.
Delta, however, is the only major U.S. airline that has still not mandated coronavirus vaccines for employees despite the pressure from the White House.
Bastian said the company has not decided whether to mandate COVID-19 vaccines.
""We're obviously studying it,"" he said, referring to President Joe Biden's executive order (EO) requiring federal contractors to mandate vaccinations. 

""I'm not sure how far you need to go in order to be in compliance with the EO,"" the CEO said.
The White House is pressing major U.S. airlines https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/exclusive-white-house-pressing-us-airlines-quickly-mandate-vaccines-2021-10-01 to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for employees by Dec. 8 - the deadline for federal contractors.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell for a third straight session, down 0.5%, holding near 11-week lows hit in last week's selloff. 
A move into the black during the session on a materials stocks rally was outweighed towards close as falls in technology stocks intensified after peers on Wall Street were pressured by an uptick in Treasury yields. (N)
Banks and luxury stocks also lost on fears of a slowdown in global growth, as China, the world's second largest economy, deals with fresh COVID-19 restrictions, a property sector slowdown and regulatory clampdowns.
French luxury goods makers  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH, which draw a major portion of their revenue from China, fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.
""Investors should brace for more stock market volatility throughout October, which is also a seasonally turbulent time for stocks, as worries about inflation, supply chain issues, China and (U.S. Federal Reserve) policy are still with us,"" Jay Pestrichelli, chief executive of investment firm ZEGA Financial, said.
A survey showed investor morale in the euro zone fell to its lowest level since April in October on dimming economic expectations. 
STOXX 600 has dropped about 5% from a record high hit in August due to signs of slowing growth and inflation. BofA Global Research last week predicted a nearly 10% drop by year-end, given a shift in the macro backdrop towards ""anti-goldilocks"". 
Morrisons dropped 3.7% after U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) won the auction for the British supermarket group with a 7 billion pound ($9.5 billion) bid.
Rivals Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Sainsbury gained 1.5% and 3.4%, and along with a rally in oil stocks, helped UK's FTSE 100 cap losses. (L)
UK telecoms group BT Group (LON:BT) fell 4.7% after media reports said Sky was closing in on broadband investment deal with Virgin Media O2, which analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said could threaten BT's Openreach. 
BT expects Sky to need to use the telecom provider as its partner for full fibre services, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Airline stocks including Ryanair and British Airways-owner ICAG rose 3% and 0.1% following reports that the UK will open up more countries for hotel quarantine-free travel later this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have agreed to settle a legal battle over the latter's use of the name ""BlueCruise"" to market its hands-free driving technology.
In a notice filed in court late on Friday, the two automakers said they are in the ""process of settling all claims and counterclaims at issue."" A judge agreed to dismiss the suit on condition the automakers finalize a settlement within 60 days. No details were released.
A Ford spokesman said the settlement has not been finalized but said the No. 2 U.S. automaker will ""continue to use the BlueCruise name, as we do today for F-150 and Mustang Mach-E and next for the 2022 Expedition.""
GM said both automakers ""have resolved the case and related proceedings amicably. At this time, we have no further comment.""
In July, GM and its Cruise robo-taxi subsidiary filed a lawsuit to stop Ford from using the name BlueCruise. GM said in July the automakers had held ""protracted discussions"" over the matter but failed to resolve it.
""Ford knew what it was doing,"" GM said in the lawsuit. ""Ford's decision to rebrand by using a core mark used by GM and Cruise will inevitably cause confusion.""
GM announced in 2012 it would use the name Super Cruise for its hands-free driver assistance technology, and has been marketing the technology using that name since 2017.
Ford previously called the lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, ""meritless and frivolous,"" saying ""drivers for decades have understood what cruise control is, every automaker offers it, and 'cruise' is common shorthand for the capability."" 
Automakers are racing to deploy technology to enable drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel in traffic jams or on highways. The so-called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's semi-automated Autopilot technology, are not supposed to allow drivers to disengage fully from driving for extended periods.
Automakers have used the word ""cruise"" for decades to describe systems that allow drivers to set a speed the car will maintain, usually in highway driving.

GM's majority-owned Cruise self-driving vehicle unit has been operating since 2013.
Ford announced it would use the name BlueCruise https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-offer-hands-free-driving-some-car-truck-models-later-this-year-2021-04-14 for its hands-free driving technology in April this year.

Investing.com –  Veoneer  stock (NYSE:VNE) climbed more than 4% Monday after it accepted the joint offer made by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and SSW to buy the company.
The Qualcomm-SSW combination outbid  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) which had first made the offer for Veoneer.
The maker of Snapdragon chips had offered $37 in cash for each share of Veoneer, 18% higher than Magna’s July 23 offer of $31.25.
Qualcomm and SSW’s offer values Veoneer’s equity at $4.5 billion. The transaction is expected to close next year. Qualcomm stock fell 1.6%.
At per the deal structure, SSW Partners will acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Veoneer, shortly after which it will sell the Arriver business to Qualcomm and retain Veoneer's tier-1 supplier businesses.
Veoneer designs, develops and manufactures software, hardware and systems for occupant protection, advanced driving assistance systems, collaborative and automated driving.
Its sensors and software solutions are aimed at preventing traffic accidents and, when accidents are unavoidable, its restraint control systems help lessen the effects of a crash.
Qualcomm will incorporate Arriver's computer vision, drive policy and driver assistance assets into its leading Snapdragon Ride Advanced Driver Assistance Systems solution. This will enhance Qualcomm's ability to deliver an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and tier-1s at scale.
Veoneer has terminated its prior acquisition agreement with Magna and shelved its October 19 special meeting that was previously scheduled to approve that agreement, Qualcomm said in a note.
As cars get smart, demand for products made by companies like Veoneer is only expected to increase, providing the likes of Qualcomm an opportunity to go beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing chips for mobile and other gadgets.  
Veoneer pegs its total addressable market at ~$18 billion by 2023 and ~$29 billion in 2026.
Due to dependence on premium brands, Veoneer is over-represented with OEMs which tend to have lower light vehicle volumes. Over the next five years, Veoneer expects to increase its percentage of sales with the top 10 OEMs, based on light vehicle production.

The whistleblower, Frances Haugen, who had worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, shared internal documents with newspapers and attorneys general from several U.S. states. 
A statement from European Parliament lawmakers said they were requesting further investigations into the revelations.
""The Facebook Files – and the revelations that the whistleblower has presented to us – underscores just how important it is that we do not let the large tech companies regulate themselves,"" said Danish lawmaker Christel Schaldemose.
Schaldemose is the lead rapporteur for the Digital Services Act, announced by the European Commission in December last year that requires tech companies to do more to tackle illegal content. 
""The documents finally put all the facts on the table to allow us to adopt a stronger Digital Services Act,"" Alexandra Geese, a German lawmaker at the European parliament, said. 
""We need to regulate the whole system and the business model that favours disinformation and violence over factual content – and enables its rapid dissemination,"" she said.
Both Geese and Schaldemose said they are in touch with Haugen.
A Facebook spokesperson said: ""Every day, we make difficult decisions on where to draw lines between free expression and harmful speech, privacy, security, and other issues.""
""But we should not be making these decisions on our own ... we've been advocating for updated regulations where democratic governments set industry standards to which we can all adhere.""
European Union regulators have been considering whether all online platforms, or only larger ones or those at particular risk of exposure to illegal activities by their users, should be subjected to take-down notices, and how prescriptive these should be.
""Our position is clear: the power of major platforms over public debate and social life must be subject to democratically validated rules, in particular on transparency and accountability,"" an European Commission spokesperson said when asked about the allegations against Facebook.

Tech companies have said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tech-regulations-idUSKBN22W2Q7 it was unfair and not technically feasible for them to police the internet. The current EU e-commerce directive says intermediary service providers play a technical, automatic and passive role.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Sun Life Financial (NYSE:SLF) said it will acquire U.S. dental benefits provider DentaQuest for $2.48 billion in its biggest deal in two decades, becoming the latest cashed-up Canadian insurance company pursuing growth outside its home market. 
The deal to acquire the United States' second-largest dental benefits provider, with more than 33 million members, will add about $100 million to its U.S. underlying income in its first full-year after closing, executives at Canada's second-largest life insurer said on an analyst call on Monday. 
Sun Life announced the deal late on Sunday.
It is the biggest acquisition since Sun Life bought Clarica Life Insurance, from where Chief Executive Kevin Strain joined the company, for C$7.3 billion ($5.8 billion) in 2002, according to a spokeswoman. 
Sun Life shares rose 1.7% to C$66.20 in morning trading in Toronto, compared with a 0.4% decline in the stock benchmark.
After synergies, expected to be $60 million, the firm is expected to add 24 Canadian cents to underlying earnings per share and 50 basis points to its return on equity, Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Chan said, adding the transaction is ""expected to support Sun Life's peer-leading ROE metrics."" 
The deal follows a slew of other acquisitions in recent years by Canadian life insurers, who, facing limited growth at home and holding record levels of capital, pursue deals overseas, particularly in the United States recently. 
Great-West Lifeco was the latest, agreeing in July to pay C$4.45 billion to buy Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU)'s full-service retirement business.
Sun Life itself has been expanding in the U.S. group benefits business, albeit with smaller deals, including that of U.S. medical intelligence and health-care navigation provider PinnacleCare and benefits platform Maxwell Health https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sun-life-financial-acquires-maxwell-health-300659355.html.
It had previously flagged an appetite to grow its group benefits and stop-loss business, which protects against unpredictable losses. 
The deal gives Sun Life the ""flexibility to maneuver"" in future and make additional investments, particularly as it seeks to expand its pharmacy stop-loss business as well as to take advantage of potential expansions of health care services and funding in the U.S., executives said on the call. 

Sun Life will incur transaction and integration costs of $250 million, the executives said.

As per StreetInsider, Swinburne believes that while a duopoly is unlikely in the connected TV industry, platforms that can combine a large user base with a scaled offering to advertisers through ad tech, an operating system, and a highly engaged streaming service can derive long-term strategic value.
The streaming industry is heading toward streaming through smart TVs and not connected devices, according to the analyst.

(Reuters) - Even before China Evergrande Group's debt crisis sent the country's property sector into a tailspin, Chinese property firms were struggling to earn enough to make interest payments on their debt, data showed.
At the end of June, the aggregate interest coverage ratio of 21 big Hong Kong-listed Chinese real estate developers fell to 0.94, the worst in at least a decade, according to Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv data. The ratio - of a company's interest expenses to earnings before interest and tax - was 1.47 at the end of last year. 
Graphic: Hong Kong listed Chinese property developers' interest cover ratio https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgvdwkzljpo/Hong%20Kong%20listed%20Chinese%20property%20developers'%20interest%20cover%20ratio.jpg 
Once China's top property developer, Evergrande missed its second offshore bond interest payment last week. The company, once the country's largest, is reeling under a $305 billion debt pile and faces a massive restructuring.
""Rattled investor confidence from China Evergrande Group's recent troubles and likely default could spell a potential funding crunch for the Chinese property sector and speculative-grade issuers,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said in a report.
China had already started to push property firms to cut excessive borrowing and land buying, and the crackdown hit them hard and limited their ability to refinance debt that is maturing in coming quarters.
Sunshine 100 China Holdings, China Oceanwide Holdings and China Fortune Land Development have all defaulted on payments this year. 
""The risk that China allows some of these firms to declare bankruptcy is significant.""
""Allowing an effective default here is a clear statement from the government that they'd like to deflate the housing bubble and that they'd be willing to let other major builders default to further that,"" said Eric Leve, chief investment officer at Bailard.
The country's real estate firms did try to accelerate efforts to cut debt last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios. The median debt-to-equity ratio for these 21 firms fell to 1.8 at the end of June - the lowest since 2017 - from 1.9 in December, the calculations showed.
But their net debt-to-EBITDA held at 4.9 in June from 5.2 at the end of last year, a score considered risky by industry experts, suggesting it would take a long time to pay off the debt.

""Currently, under the 'Three Red Lines,', Guangzhou R&F and Evergrande are among our tracked developers that are categorised beyond the 'yellow' group, indicating weaker-than- peers' financial positions,"" said Cynthia Chan, analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets.
""In terms of cash-to-short-term debt ratios, besides Evergrande and Guangzhou R&F, which have very low ratios of below 1x, Gemdale, Agile and China SCE also have relatively low cash-to-short-term debt ratios of 1.2x or below.""

Guangzhou R&F Properties Co 2777.HK was raising as much as $2.5 billion by borrowing from major shareholders and selling a subsidiary, according to exchange filings last month, highlighting the scramble for cash as signs of distress spread in China's property sector.

One way to do that is to invest in lower-risk stocks, but another option is reducing risk by diversifying your portfolio in general. A great way to do that is by investing in stocks from outside the United States. While there is some performance overlap between domestic and international stocks, they aren’t totally correlated.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Engine No. 1 on Monday formally announced it has taken a stake in General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and was supportive of its transition to battery electric vehicles, sending the shares of the No. 1 U.S. automaker up 3.2%.
The position of support for GM was in contrast to the hedge fund's against-the-odds challenge against Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobile Corp earlier this year that enabled it to land three board seats. Engine No. 1 had criticized the energy giant's track record and targets on reducing its carbon footprint.
However, Engine No. 1 said in a statement on Monday that it believed in the path GM and Chief Executive Mary Barra have laid out, targeting the elimination of tailpipe emissions in all light vehicles sold by 2035.
""The company's early lead on battery technology, along with Mary Barra and the board's leadership, creates tremendous advantages,"" Engine No. 1 founder Chris James said. ""There's a narrative that only tech companies can move quickly to embrace change and win as the world changes. We don't think that's true. GM has that leadership.""
Engine No. 1 took its stake in GM in August but had not spoken publicly about its intentions around the automaker since then. Engine No. 1 has a stake of almost 400,000 shares in GM, according to Refinitiv data.
Engine No. 1 said it has had ""very constructive and collaborative two-way conversations"" with GM, and said the automaker was poised to ""recapture market share"" thanks to its advantages in battery technology. 
GM has said it will spend $35 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles through 2025 and is expected to outline additional financial targets through 2030 on Wednesday at an investor conference. 
Engine No. 1 was launched in December 2020 and immediately made a splash by taking on Exxon and pressuring the oil giant to reduce its carbon footprint. 
Coming from a tiny firm, founded by veteran investor James, the battle to challenge Exxon quickly turned into a David versus Goliath narrative on Wall Street, where many seasoned investors expected the newcomer to falter. But the arguments resonated with some of the world's biggest money managers, including Vanguard, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and  State Street  (NYSE:STT), which supported Engine No. 1's bid to win board seats. 
Engine No. 1's activism campaigns are run by Charlie Penner, who joined the new firm from activist firm Jana Partners where they made headlines by taking on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to push the iPhone maker to do more to limit children's smartphone use. Soon after the Exxon win, Engine No. 1 launched an exchange traded fund, making a bet that Main Street investors want portfolios to back environmental, social and governance proposals.

The hedge fund also released a white paper on Monday detailing why the auto industry must transition to battery electric vehicles and what role automakers, especially GM, will play in that transition. 
""We value the perspectives of all stakeholders as we continue driving the future of mobility,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain said in an email.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Monday as crude oil prices hit a seven-year high, reinforcing fears that higher energy prices might choke off the recovery and drive inflation higher. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its key allies indicated they won't release any more crude to the global market than the 400,000 barrel-a-day increment already planned, disappointing many - including the White House - who had hoped that the bloc would act to keep a lid on prices as global demand recovers more quickly than expected.
However, the opening statement of the so-called OPEC+ group's decision-making body was more cautious about the outlook for demand in 2022. News agencies reported unnamed sources close to the bloc as saying there would be no change to its output timetable. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely holding above the gain line, while the S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%. The Nasdaq typically underperforms when higher commodity prices bolster arguments for higher inflation and tighter monetary policy.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 1.6% while ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stock rose 2.5% and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock - of all U.S. majors the one most levered to the price of crude - rose 3.0%.
The gains were funded partly by the release of money from tech stock holdings, as investors rotated back into cyclical names at the expense of growth stocks. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock both fell 1.8% while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.6%.

The allegations, which Haugen will repeat in Congress this week - were the basis of a series of damaging revelations by The Wall Street Journal over the last two weeks.
The exception to general tech stock underperformance was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which rose 2.9% to test the $800 level after a surprisingly strong quarter, in which deliveries rose by over 70% from a year earlier despite the global chip shortage that has hamstrung rivals over the summer.
Tesla's news not only pulled money back into the stock from rival EV names - Lucid and Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs were both down -  but also put the relative performance of legacy carmakers in an unflattering light. General Motors (NYSE:GM) on Friday had reported a sharp drop in output during the quarter due to component shortages. However, GM stock rose 3.7% on Monday after a vote of confidence from Engine No. 1, the activist investor vehicle who came to prominence in its attack on Exxon Mobil's climate change policies.
“GM, with the support of a really strong management team and a great board, has decided that they’re going to embrace the future."" Engine No. 1's Chris James told CNBC. ""They’re going to make the investments necessary in order to be successful during this transition.” 
Elsewhere, Merck stock extended the gains it made on Friday after reporting encouraging early-stage trial results from its experimental Covid-19 drug, which could be the first oral medicine to treat the disease effectively. Money continued to pour out of vaccine stocks as a result, with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock losing 7.3% and BioNTech stock losing over 5%.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) were broadly unchanged, however."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) on Monday set a new target to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, from the beef in its burgers to the light bulbs in its restaurants.
The burger chain also said it was working with the nonprofit Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to revamp its existing climate change targets. It aims to lower absolute emissions by about a third for both its suppliers and its nearly 40,000 company-run and franchised restaurants around the world by 2030.
""We're trying to send a signal to our partners, to our investors, to our suppliers, to other brands in the global community, to policymakers, that we share that vision for 2050,"" McDonald's Chief Sustainability Officer Jenny McColloch told Reuters in an interview.
United Nations scientists say the world's net emissions must fall to zero by 2050 to limit the rise in global temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius versus pre-industrial levels.
Net zero plans require companies to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and offset any remaining emissions using projects that capture the gas.
More than 1,000 companies have signed similar pledges through the UN or SBTi.
On Wednesday, funds managing nearly $30 trillion in assets called for 1,600 of the world's most polluting companies to set science-based emissions targets, as wildfires, droughts and floods make slowing climate change more urgent.
McDonald's is one of the largest beef purchasers in the world. Roughly 80% of its total emissions come from its supply chain, in particular its use of beef, chicken, dairy and other proteins. It will use new guidelines from SBTi, with which it already works, to focus on cutting emissions in agriculture, land use and forestry.

""Beef is a big opportunity to help drive impact in the world with our farmers and rancher partners,"" McColloch said. 
McDonald's 2050 net zero goal includes emissions from direct sources like corporate offices and restaurants and indirect sources, particularly franchised restaurants and suppliers' goods and services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has rejected a 2019 petition to open a formal investigation into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) vehicle fires, according to a federal filing on Monday.
The agency opened a formal review in October 2019 of the petition filed by the offices of California lawyer Edward C. Chen on behalf of Tesla owners over non-crash fire concerns including reports of three fires in China.
The NHTSA said in 2019 it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars that year instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could result in battery fires.
The petition alleged Tesla was ""using over-the-air software updates to mask and cover up a potentially widespread and dangerous issue with the batteries in their vehicles.""
""Tesla’s investigation of the non-crash fires in China did not identify a root cause or positively link the incidents to any design or manufacturing defect conditions,"" NHTSA's denial said, adding: ""The available data indicate that non-crash battery fires in Tesla vehicles are rare events.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The NHTSA added ""no fires related to the subject condition have been observed globally since three fires in China and Hong Kong over a 48-day period from late-March to mid-May 2019."" It added ""there have been no fires in the United States related"" to the issue.

The multiplex operator said it has new post-reopening records for global attendance, admission revenue and food and beverage sales for a single weekend.
Sony’s Let There Be Carnage grossed an estimated $90 million in ticket sales, the second-biggest ever domestic opening of an October movie in cinema history.
The 25th James Bond movie shattered ticket sales records across the Atlantic. Including Saturday, one-day ticket admission revenue in the U.K. was the highest for any Bond movie ever since the franchise was launched back in 1962.
AMC said more than 2.4 million moviegoers watched a movie at its U.S. theatres Thursday through Sunday.
The approximately 3.9 million attendance, Thursday through Sunday, at all AMC Entertainment locations globally is a new post-reopening weekend high, the company said.

Investing.com –  Amplify Energy  stock (NYSE:AMPY) plunged 62% in Monday’s premarket trading after a large spill from an oil platform operated by a subsidiary was found off the southern California coast.
Amplify Energy Chief Executive Martyn Willsher said Beta Offshore's production has been shut off and any remaining oil in the pipeline suctioned off.
The leak has forced the shutdown of Huntington Beach, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles, and scheduled activities in the region.

Kim Carr, the mayor of Huntington Beach, called the spill an ""environmental catastrophe"" and a ""potential ecological disaster"".
The spill was caused by a breach connected to the Elly oil rig and stretched down to Newport Beach, an area popular with surfers and sunbathers.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ordered a fishery closure for coastal areas affected by the spill.
The closure will extend from Huntington Beach to Dana Point for the coastal areas, and it will extend up to six miles off the coastal points for the offshore area, the department said."

BANGKOK (Reuters) -Thailand's government is in talks with Merck & Co to buy 200,000 courses of its experimental antiviral pill for COVID-19 treatment, the latest Asian nation to scramble for supplies of the drug after lagging behind Western countries for vaccines.
Somsak Akksilp, director-general of the Department of Medical Services, told Reuters that Thailand is currently working on a purchasing agreement for the antiviral drug, known as molnupiravir.
South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia said they are also in talks to buy the potential treatment, while the Philippines, which is running a trial on the pill, said it hopes its domestic study would allow access to the treatment.
They all declined to provide details on purchase negotiations.
The rush to order the drug comes after data from interim clinical trials released on Friday indicated https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-covid-19-pill-cuts-risk-death-hospitalization-by-50-study-2021-10-01 it could reduce by around 50% the chance of hospitalisation or death for patients at risk of severe disease from COVID-19.
The molnupiravir pills, designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.
Many Asian countries want to lock in supplies early after they were hit by tight supplies in their vaccine rollouts this year, putting them behind wealthier countries which bought hundreds of millions of doses.
""We are now working on a purchasing agreement with Merck that is expected to be completed by this week ... we have pre-booked 200,000 courses,"" Somsak said
He said the pills could arrive as soon as December, though the deal would be subject to the pills' approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Thai regulator.
Representatives at Merck's Thailand office were not immediately reachable. 
Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand fell below 10,000 on Monday for the first time since mid-July. The country has administered 55.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far, fully inoculating about 31% of the population. 
Merck has said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021. It has a U.S. government contract to supply 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course.
The company has said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria.
In the Philippines, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference on Monday that, ""We see we can have more access to this medicine because we have this clinical trial counterpart.""

A spokesman for the European Commission said Brussels may launch a joint procurement of the therapy for the bloc, a similar strategy used to buy COVID-19 vaccines, but there was no particular information on Merck's drug.
A German health ministry spokesperson said the government monitors the development of new therapies, but declined to comment on whether Germany plans to order Merck's pill.

(Reuters) - A  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) whistleblower on Sunday accused the social media giant of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation, and said her lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, appeared on Sunday on the CBS television program ""60 Minutes,"" revealing her identity as the whistleblower who provided the documents that underpinned a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teen girls.
Facebook has been under fire after the Journal published a series of stories based on Facebook internal presentations and emails that showed the social media company contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm, failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy and was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls. 
Haugen will testify before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday in a hearing titled ""Protecting Kids Online,"" about the company's research into Instagram's effect on young users.
""There were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,"" she said during the interview. ""And Facebook over and over again chose to optimize for its own interests like making more money.""
Haugen, who previously worked at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), said Facebook has lied to the public about the progress it made to clamp down on hate speech and misinformation on its platform.
She added that Facebook was used to help organize the Capitol riot on January 6, after the company turned off safety systems following the U.S. presidential elections. 
While she believed no one at Facebook was ""malevolent,"" she said the company had misaligned incentives.
Facebook published a statement disputing the points that Haugen made after the televised interview.
""We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content,"" said Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch. ""To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.""
Ahead of the 60 Minutes interview, Facebook Vice President of global affairs Nick Clegg said on CNN https://edition.cnn.com/videos/media/2021/10/03/facebook-spokesperson-social-media-january-6-riot-rs-stelter-vpx.cnn it was ""ludicrous"" to assert that Jan. 6 occurred because of social media.
INTERNATIONAL TALKS
On Sunday, Haugen's attorney John Tye, founder of legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid https://whistlebloweraid.org/#, confirmed a New York Times report that some of the internal documents have been shared with attorneys general from several states including California, Vermont and Tennessee.
Tye said the complaints were filed to the SEC on the basis that as a publicly-traded company, Facebook is required to not lie to its investors, or even withhold material information.
The complaints compare Facebook's internal research with its public statements on the issues it researched, according to the 60 Minutes interview.
Tye said Haugen has also spoken with lawmakers in Europe and is scheduled to appear before the British parliament later this month, in hopes of spurring regulatory action.

He and Haugen are also interested in speaking with lawmakers from countries in Asia, since many of the issues that motivated Haugen stem from the region, including the ethnic violence in Myanmar, he added. 
Whistleblower Aid, which is representing Haugen pro-bono, has also launched a GoFundMe to raise $50,000 for her legal costs.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) was 1% lower in premarket trading as whistleblower Frances Haugen prepares to testify before Congress on allegations of poor governance at the company.
Haugen, whose material was behind the series of exposes in The Wall Street Journal criticizing the company over the last two weeks, gave it another airing on CBS's 60 Minutes at the weekend, repeating her core allegation that the company had prioritized profit over the safety and health of its customers. 
Haugen joined the social media giant in June 2019 and left it in May this year, having tired of trying to improve the company from within.
The former product manager was hired to help protect against election interference on Facebook, but, according to her, what she saw was the company’s lack of openness about its platforms’ potential for harm and unwillingness to address its flaws.
Recent coverage by the Journal, which relied on Haugen’s documents and interviews with current and former Facebook employees, said the company is “acutely aware that the products and systems central to its business success routinely fail”.
According to Haugen, Facebook also relaxed election-related safeguards too soon, a move she said was a factor in the spread of misinformation, leading up to the deadly Capitol riot. One such step was lifting of the cap on live videos.
As per internal documents, the company was aware that Instagram use was leading to high anxiety, mental-health, body-image and confidence issues in teenage girls.
The outcry that followed the WSJ revelations forced Facebook last week to pause work on Instagram Kids, a version of the popular app it was targeting at an even younger population.

The Hang Seng China Enterprise (CEI), whose most heavily weighted stocks include Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., tumbled another 2.4% to a five-year low on Monday. The gauge also trailed behind all counterparts over the past month, three months, six months, year-to date and over 12 months. 
Investor concerns earlier this year about sky-high valuations coupled with Beijing’s regulatory crackdown sent the gauge tumbling by nearly 21% so far this year. Traders bold enough to take advantage of any bargain hunting opportunities have repeatedly been battered. 
The extent of the losses show just how far Beijing has gone to tighten its grip over some of the most powerful private enterprises in the country. Since its February peak, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech index -- which has a lot of overlap with the HSCEI -- has seen its members lose $1.4 trillion in market value. That index traded near new lows on Monday. Even the Hang Seng Index fell into a bear market in August. 
And it’s not just tech. From Macau casinos to after-school tutoring to property shares, nearly every corner of China’s stock market has felt reverberations of the months-long crackdown. Regulatory curbs also unseated Hong Kong as the No. 2 market in Asia behind Japan in late July and briefly removed Tencent from the list of the world’s 10 largest companies by market value. 
Traders are bracing for more clampdowns when market participants in mainland China return after their Golden Week holiday that will run through Thursday. Many fear things could still get worse before they get better.

Investing.com – 3M Company stock (NYSE:MMM) traded 1.5% lower in Monday’s premarket following another adverse ruling in a case involving the use of company’s earplugs in the military.
A federal jury on Friday accepted a U.S. Army veteran’s plea that combat earplugs sold by 3M caused him to suffer hearing loss and tinnitus. As per the order, the company now needs to pay the plaintiffs $8.2 million.
The plugs, used widely by the U.S. Army and other branches, were designed to block all noise if inserted in one direction, while in the opposite direction the plugs would let in nearby sound but still shield the ear from harmful ballistic decibels.
For the earplugs to work properly, the flexible cups on the side protruding from the ear sometimes had to be folded back. If not, the plugs would loosen and let the noise filter in.
The plaintiffs alleged the company hid design flaws, fudged test results and failed to provide clear instructions for their proper use. The Army employed the ear plugs from 2007 to 2013. 3M stopped selling them in 2015.
3M told Reuters it was ""ready to defend ourselves against plaintiffs' allegations at all upcoming trials.""
The earplugs were developed by Aearo Technologies, which 3M bought in 2008.
The jurors had penalized the company with fines in three previous trials involving the ear plugs.

At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 110 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 80 points, or 0.6%.
The major indices started the new month strongly on Friday, helped by Merck’s news of positive results for its oral Covid-19 treatment, boosting stocks associated with the reopening. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 500 points, or 1.4%, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8%.
That said, September was a tricky one, as equity investors fretted about high levels of inflation, likely Federal Reserve tapering and rising interest rates.
Friday sees the release of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls release, which could influence the Fed’s decision on when to taper its bond-buying program.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",Analysis: Zoom's abandoned Five9 deal shows hurdles to expansion,"By Krystal Hu, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Echo Wang
(Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc's aborted $14.7 billion acquisition of call center software firm Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) Inc has spotlighted issues that will weigh on the virtual meeting giant's next attempt to expand through dealmaking, analysts and investment bankers said.
Zoom's unwillingness to add cash to its bid and rely solely on its stock as currency to pay for the Five9 deal backfired after its shares slipped by as much as 29% in the weeks after the deal was announced in July, on concerns that the return to physical meetings as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes will erode its business.
Five9 shareholders voted down the deal last week.
Investment bankers and analysts said Zoom's stock would likely remain volatile until investors establish what the prospects of its business will be once the pandemic is over. This decreases the chances of another acquisition target accepting Zoom's shares as currency in the near term, they said.
Zoom carries almost no debt but it had only $2 billion in cash as of the end of July, which it needs to fund growth initiatives.
""Zoom has to figure out how to keep some of the customers that signed up as individual subscribers that may not need Zoom when they return to more physical lives,"" said Alex Zukin, an analyst at Wolfe Research.
Zoom declined to comment.
Another hurdle that could give the next company that will attract Zoom's acquisition interest pause is its ties to China. U.S. prosecutors charged a former China-based Zoom executive last year with disrupting video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown at the request of the Chinese government.
A U.S. Justice Department-led committee said last month it was reviewing Zoom's proposed acquisition of Five9 to see if it ""poses a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests.""
While Five9 shareholders voted down the Zoom deal before that review concluded, analysts said the regulatory intervention exposed a risk that will continue to weigh on the minds of other acquisition targets.
""The U.S. government is likely to give increased scrutiny to transactions involving companies with engineering talent or other operations in China,"" said Sujit Raman, a former U.S. Associate Deputy Attorney General who is now partner at law firm Sidley Austin LLP specializing in government investigations. 
ACTIVIST HEDGE FUNDS
Zoom sought to acquire Five9, whose call center software is used by more than 2,000 companies across the globe to interact with their clients, offering more products beyond its flagship teleconferencing. Without any transformative acquisition, Zoom shareholders are likely to grow anxious over the company's reliance on virtual meetings, whose popularity has peaked, some investors said.
Dianne McKeever, chief investment officer of investment firm Ides Capital Management said it was possible that an activist hedge fund would seek to take advantage of the situation by amassing a stake in Zoom and push for changes.
""When a deal falls apart, forced selling by often short-term focused, event driven funds can create an outsized valuation opportunity for a long-term investor,"" McKeever said.
Examples of companies that attracted the wrath of investors after botching an acquisition attempt abound. Hedge fund TCI Fund Management, one of the biggest investors in Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co, is calling on the railroad's CEO to resign following its failed $29 billion acquisition bid for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU).
Activist hedge funds Starboard Value LP and Elliott Management Corp have amassed stakes in Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc, whose $30 billion merger with insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc was called off earlier this year because of objections from U.S. regulators.
To be sure, Zoom's stock may be expensive for some activist hedge funds, analysts said. It is also not obvious whether there would be an acquirer for Zoom, which is something some activist hedge funds might push for.

Still, a failed deal can be interpreted by some investors as a signal by a company's board that it cannot unlock more value, said Lawrence Elbaum, co-head of law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP's shareholder activism practice.
""This immediately makes their board seats vulnerable in an activism campaign,"" Elbaum said.

If approved, the drug could be the world’s first oral antiviral medicine for Covid. The stock had jumped 8.4% on Friday after Merck said trials showed it could halve the risks of hospitalization and death from the infection.
Merck plans to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. “as soon as possible”.
The company said the drug demonstrated consistent efficacy across Gamma, Mu and Delta, the most infectious of the virus variants.
Merck already has contracts in India and elsewhere to provide raw materials for making the drug.
The company expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with more doses expected to be produced in 2022. It will supply approximately 1.7 million courses to the U.S. government under an existing agreement, assuming all the approvals are in place.
The potential shown by the drug has raised hopes of quicker treatment of the disease that continues to plague the world two years after the first case was found in China. The greater ease of manufacturing, distributing and administering medicine in tablet form all suggest that it could significantly bolster the world fight against Covid-19, at a time when much of the developing world still lags rich countries badly in vaccination rates.
Shares of manufacturers of Covid vaccines, likely to be the most adversely impacted if the drug gets marketing rights, fell sharply on the Merck news Friday. They were extending losses on Monday.
BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), Moderna and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) traded 1.5%-3% in premarket trading.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) fell 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively, reflecting the fact that sales of Covid vaccines account for a small part of their revenue.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 1.6% higher in Monday’s premarket as the company recorded a 73% jump in deliveries in the third quarter.
The company handed over 241,300 vehicles while production jumped 64% to 237,823 units.  
Tesla delivered a combined 232,025 Model 3 sedans and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicles in the third quarter. Delivery of higher-end models, Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles, came in at 9,275 units.
The maker of electric vehicles thus defied the semiconductors shortages plaguing the industry to stay on course to meet its full-year target of 50% more deliveries than last year’s 499,550.
Most of Tesla’s rivals have been hit badly by a shortage of semiconductors as factories in China, Vietnam and southeast Asia – where much of the production of these chips happens -- have been forced to stay shut to prevent the spread of the pandemic.
From tweeting, “Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it” in early June, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said late September that the chip crunch should be over by next year.
In contrast to Tesla, supply chain issues dragged third-quarter delivery volumes by around a third at General Motors (NYSE:GM).
GM’s dealers delivered 446,997 vehicles in the U.S. in the third quarter, down 218,195 units from a year ago as semiconductor supply chain disruptions and historically low inventories hurt sales.
Covid-related supply chain disruptions in Malaysia were behind the drop, according to the company.

British Airways, owned by IAG (LON:ICAG), was looking for alternative uses for its Gatwick slots but could now stay to compete there against low cost airlines such as easyJet (LON:EZJ) if pilots give it the go-ahead in a ballot later this week. 
British Airways had said on Sept. 23 it would end its short-haul operations at Gatwick, blaming pilot union BALPA's rejection of the plans for the new unit, but talks were now back on. 
""Last week BALPA asked us to resume discussions. These talks were constructive, addressed key concerns and have secured the efficiencies required,"" a BA spokesperson said on Monday. 
BALPA confirmed on Monday that it was consulting with its BA members about improved pay and conditions for Gatwick pilots, adding: ""The result of the ballot will be declared later this week."" 
BA's main operations run out of London and Britain's biggest airport Heathrow. During the pandemic, when it has struggled financially, it has focused on Heathrow's more profitable routes. 
Historically it says its short-haul operations at Gatwick have been unprofitable, and it wants to create a new unit which runs more cheaply but which it says will offer a ""full service"" with the look and feel of BA. 

Shares in BA traded down 0.3% to 187 pence at 0914 GMT, paring earlier gains of 2%.
The news was first reported by The Telegraph newspaper.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Audi CEO sees chip shortage as 'perfect storm' but will get through it,"By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Premium car brand Audi, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s biggest profit contributor, has to troubleshoot on a day-to-day basis to tackle an ongoing shortage of auto chips, its chief executive said.
""We had a very strong first half in 2021. We do expect a much weaker second half. We really have trouble,"" Markus Duesmann told Reuters ahead of the Reuters Events Automotive conference, calling the situation ""a perfect storm"".
Duesmann's comments highlight the problems global carmakers are facing in navigating a global chip supply crunch that has hit car production around the world.
But while the car industry's vehicle sales have suffered it has softened the blow through price increases that have boosted margins.
Audi in July said it had been unable to build a mid five-digit number of cars in the first half of the year. But its profit margin in the period surged to 10.7%, even surpassing the 8% in 2019 before the pandemic struck. 
""We are dealing with it pretty well I would say,"" Duesmann, who also sits on the management board of Volkswagen, said. He said the group was seeking closer ties with chipmakers and that the carmaker would emerge stronger from the crisis.
""But at the moment it's a day-to-day troubleshooting process,"" he said.
Audi, which accounted for more than a quarter of Volkswagen's first-half operating profit, has embarked on an ambitious shift towards battery-powered vehicles, meaning all new models it will release from 2026 will be fully electric.
Meantime, production of internal combustion engines will be gradually phased out up to 2033. Audi's CFO in August said it would only take 2-3 years before profitability of electric vehicles (EV) would match that of combustion engine cars.
Duesmann thinks this could happen even more quickly.
""The point where we earn as much money with electric cars as with combustion engine cars is now, or ... next year, 2023. They are very even now, the prices,"" Duesmann said.
Apart from efforts to challenge Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and become the biggest seller of EVs, Volkswagen, the world's No.2 carmaker, is also doubling down on efforts to develop software, which CEO Herbert Diess said is the industry's real gamechanger.
Duesmann, who took over as Audi CEO last year, has previously said that Volkswagen would make most of the automotive software needed for the group's transformation on its own and that it was too early to think about partnerships.
""Because at the moment ... it would take away speed, it would add complexity,"" Duesmann said. ""Certainly we could share our software platform with other automotive companies but that's more mid-term, long-term ... 5-10 years.""
Duesmann, a former BMW executive, now also has responsibility for luxury brands Lamborghini, Ducati and Bentley which have been brought under the Audi roof.

The 52 year-old Ducati enthusiast brushed off recurring speculation that one of them could be sold, even though there was regular outside interest.
""These brands ... are very valuable very profitable brands, where we can even expand the synergy level in the future,"" Duesmann said. ""There are no plans whatsoever to get rid of them.""

S&P announced the deal to create a new data powerhouse last November, underscoring the consolidation in the financial information services industry, as companies race to create one-stop shops to lure the biggest clients and invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
S&P submitted its offer on Friday to the EU competition enforcer, which extended its deadline for a decision to Oct. 22 from Oct. 8. 
The Commission, which did not provide details in line with its policy, will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the proposal, demand more or open a four-month long investigation.
To address regulatory concerns about the deal, S&P struck a deal in August to sell its U.S oil pricing agency Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) and related assets to News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), subject to the closing of its IHS Markit deal.

The UK competition agency is also investigating the deal, with a decision to be announced on Oct. 19.

Sainsbury's stock was up 4.2 pence at 288.9 pence at 0858 GMT, valuing the business at 6.7 billion pounds ($9.1 billion).
Fortress was defeated in Saturday's shootout for Morrisons, Britain's No. 4 supermarket group, bidding 286 pence a share - a penny less than rival Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.
However, managing partner Joshua A Pack signalled Fortress remained interested in UK assets.
""The UK remains a very attractive investment environment from many perspectives, and we will continue to explore opportunities to help strong management teams grow their businesses and create long-term value,"" he said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Fortress declined to comment on Sainsbury's, which trails only market leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) in UK grocery sales.
A Sainsbury's spokesperson also declined to comment. 
Shares in Sainsbury's are up 28% this year, buoyed by bid speculation.

That started in April when Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky raised his stake in Sainsbury's to just under 10% and has been fuelled by the bid battle for Morrisons and signs CEO Simon Roberts's ""food first"" strategy is starting to work.

The blue-chip life insurer, which invested over 700 million pounds in sustainable assets in the first half of 2021, double the amount from a year earlier, said the interim targets were part of its goal to achieve net zero carbon for investments by 2050. 
""Across all the portfolios what we will be looking to do is to be engaging with companies. It is not a case of excluding those companies that don't have a good carbon footprint because we want to work with them to help them make their industry green,"" Phoenix boss Andy Briggs told Reuters.
Briggs said that if companies were not putting enough effort into making themselves greener, Phoenix would likely exclude them from its portfolios.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, weighed by ongoing concerns over the health of property giant China Evergrande Group and ahead of an OPEC meeting.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.1%.
The main driver of these losses was worries about China’s property sector as trading in shares of debt-laden Evergrande was suspended after it missed a key interest payment for the second time last week as it struggles to refinance over $300 billion in liabilities.
""Evergrande has a $260 million offshore note maturing today, which only has a five-day “grace” period, and if no sign of payment occurs, the negative noise around the company and China’s property market will increase once again,"" said OANDA strategist Jeffrey Halley in a note to clients.
Reports circulated Monday that the distressed developer will sell half its stake in its property management unit to Hopson Development for more than $5 billion. However, local media issued conflicting reports on the deal's price and there was no clarity as to how the funds from any sale would be allocated.
In corporate news, Petrofac (LON:PFC) stock spiked 10% at the open but quickly reversed to be down over 2%. The oil services company is due to find out today how big a fine it will have to pay after pleading guilty to seven charges of bribery in a U.K. court.
WM Morrison (LON:MRW) stock fell 3.8% after private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice won a lengthy battle for the U.K. supermarket chain in an auction at the weekend, although the winning bid was some 3% below Friday's market close.
Elsewhere, Aena (MC:AENA) stock rose 2%, climbing to a 52-week high, the Spanish airport company rebounding as international travel recovers from the pandemic. 
Repsol (OTC:REPYY) stock also reached a 52-week high, up 3.2%, as the Spanish energy company benefited from the region’s record high gas prices.   
Also of interest Monday will be a meeting of Eurozone finance ministers to discuss matters including the EU’s recovery plans as well as progress on the much-delayed banking union project.

1274,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 01:09AM ET</span>",Christmas at Risk as Supply Chain ‘Disaster’ Only Gets Worse,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s the beginning of October, just the start of what the retail world simply calls “peak.” But the industry is already in various forms of panic that usually don’t take hold until the weeks before Christmas.
Early in the year, the hope was that the bottlenecks that gummed up the global supply chain in 2020 would be mostly cleared by now. They’ve actually only gotten worse — much worse — and evidence is mounting that the holiday season is at risk.
Across Europe, retailers such as apparel chain H&M can’t meet demand because of delivery delays. In the U.S.,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) cut its sales forecast after Covid-19 triggered factory closures in Vietnam that wiped out months of production. And Bed Bath & Beyond’s stock plunged amid shipping woes, with Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton warning that disruptions would last well into next year. “There is pressure across the board, and you will hear about that from others.”
Covid outbreaks have idled port terminals. There still aren’t enough cargo containers, causing prices to spike 10-fold from a year ago. Labor shortages have stalled trucking and pushed U.S. job openings to all-time highs. And that was before UPS, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and others embark on hiring hundreds of thousands of seasonal workers to take on the peak of peak.
“I’ve been doing this for 43 years and never seen it this bad,” said Isaac Larian, founder and CEO of MGA Entertainment, one of the world’s largest toymakers. “Everything that can go wrong is going wrong at the same time.”
Now comes the rush of goods into the U.S. for Santa’s sleigh, which will only exacerbate all of this. It’s going to be a daunting holiday season — one that investors appear to be shrugging off despite analysts raising concerns that margins will likely take a hit. The S&P Retail Select Industry Index, which encompasses 108 U.S. companies including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Macy’s and Best Buy, is up about 40% this year and almost doubled since the start of 2020. Its combined market cap is $3.3 trillion, just a sliver below a record high from earlier this year.
That jubilance clashes with what’s happening behind the scenes. Retailers have resorted to buying goods made a couple years ago to make sure they at least secure some inventory, according to Steve Azarbad, co-founder and chief investment officer of the hedge fund Maglan Capital, which invests in retailers and distressed companies. In normal times, these items would be liquidated at closeout stores or in foreign markets, but not now.
“Retailers are having a really hard time filling their shelves,” Azarbad said. “I talk to a lot of suppliers, and they're telling me ‘I just can't fill all the orders I'm getting.’”
On the supplier side, Jay Foreman’s been making toys with manufacturing partners in China for more than three decades, and he’s never seen anything like this. His mid-sized toy company, Basic Fun, is on pace for its best year ever — possibly reaching $170 million in sales. There is no shortage of demand, with parents loading up on gifts as the pandemic drags on. But a dearth of cargo containers has left thousands of the company’s Lite Brites and TinkerToys waiting to be shipped. At just one factory in Shenzhen, there’s roughly $8 million worth of finished goods that could fill 140 containers.
“I got Tonka trucks in the south and Care Bears in the north,” Foreman, the company’s CEO, said of logistical troubles in China. “We’ll blow last year’s numbers away, but the problem is we don’t know if we’ll get the last four months of the year shipped. The supply chain is a disaster, and it’s only getting worse.”
MGA’s Larian is willing to pay more than $20,000 per shipping container — up from about $2,000 a year ago — and counts his blessings that he runs a private company that doesn’t have to answer to shareholders. He’s having trouble simply getting goods off cargo ships in the port of Los Angeles. MGA recently had more than 600 containers, filled with toys like its top-selling L.O.L. Surprise dolls, waiting to be unloaded for more than six weeks.
“There will be a shortage of toys this fall,” Larian said. “It’s going to be a tough year for retailers.”
When the pandemic knocked the global economy down in early 2020, factories slowed output or closed. Turns out, that was the easy part. Re-starting has been much more difficult. The supply chain has been choked by so many events, such as the Suez Canal blockage, and market dynamics like labor shortages and the spike in transportation costs that it feels like there’s been one “black swan” event after another, according to Lee Klaskow, a logistics analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.
“The supply chain has never had the opportunity to get back to normal,” Klaskow said.
One of the better scenarios for the fourth quarter is that big retailers drastically increase spending on logistics — including resorting to using costlier air freight or chartering entire cargo ships — but still maintain their sales targets. That will likely mean they’ll see a hit to profit margins, but it could also lead to taking market share from smaller competitors who can’t match their deep pockets.
“We feel better than most that we'll get our product here for holiday,"" said Michael Mathias, chief financial officer for apparel chain  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO). The retailer has spent more on air freight to secure goods for Christmas. “There will be some players out here who might not even get their product.”

Ken Hicks, chief executive officer of Academy Sports and Outdoors, is counting on that advantage to boost results. The chain, based in Katy, Texas, has been using its scale to prep for this peak season for months. That’s included importing goods sooner, moving shipments away from the overwhelmed west coast to ports like Galveston, Texas, and booking cargo capacity earlier in the year.
But even with all those mitigation efforts and the scale of a company that generated $4 billion in sales last fiscal year, Hicks said inventory levels were only “adequate.” There’s enough items to meet its sales goals, but he estimated the retailer is about 10% below where he’d like it to be. During the peak of the pandemic last year, the chain simply couldn’t source items like bicycles, exercise equipment and fishing rods. Now it can, just not as much as it wants. For example, each store would ideally have seven treadmills in stock, but it’s actually about half that, he said.
Making smart decisions on shipping and supply chain was enough for Janine Stichter, an analyst for Jeffries, to recently upgrade shoemaker Steve Madden to a “buy” after having a “hold” on it since starting coverage at the beginning of 2018. The company has shifted about half its production to Mexico and Brazil, reducing exposure to Asian markets, such as Vietnam. Making goods closer to the U.S. has made its lead times twice as fast as competitors, she said.
“Supply chain issues are getting continually worse,” Stichter said. For the rest of the year, “the key success factor will be the ability to supply product on time, or relatively on time.”
Meanwhile, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) last week downgraded department-store chain Kohl’s from the equivalent of a buy rating to a sell and cut its target price on the shares by about a third because of mounting logistical costs.
The bigger, more systemic risk — one that could hurt every retailer — is that American spend less than expected because there isn’t enough inventory. The available goods may also not be all that enticing. The boom in shipping prices has forced manufacturers to make hard decisions about what to transport. Hicks, the Academy Sports CEO, predicted that shoppers “will have to settle more because they just won’t have as good of a selection.”
Shipping big items and goods with lower value don’t make as much economic sense right now. iPhones are small and pricey, making them an ideal good to ship or air freight amid spiking transport costs. But the same case can’t be made for low-end furniture or big stuffed animals. At Basic Fun in Boca Raton, Florida, Foreman is exporting a lot more Mash’ems because $135,000 worth of the small, squishy collectibles can fit on a single container. He’s moving far fewer Tonka trucks because they are bulky and take up more space, limiting the dollar value that can go in a container to just $36,000.
At Whom Home in Los Angeles, CEO Jon Bass said he had to remove about 70% of the company’s products — totaling thousands of items including wall decor and furniture — from the websites of retail partners such as Walmart and Wayfair (NYSE:W) because the company can’t source them. Or in some cases, surging costs for materials and transportation made an item pricer than a retailer was willing to pay.
“Consumers lose because their options are limited,” said Bass, who has been manufacturing goods for three decades. “It’s not a normal time in the business world. There is no stability.”
Rising costs in the supply chain, such as cotton prices hitting a 9-year high, and labor are also likely to boost what consumers pay, which could dampen spending. Or it might cause a bigger shift from hard goods to experiences and services — a trend already in place this year as Americans get back to traveling and eating out. The industry also expects much fewer promotions than usual because inventories are tight, which will turn off bargain hunters.
Add that consumer expectations are sky high, thanks to the ease and speed of e-commerce, and the retail industry is primed to severely disappoint the masses. If last holiday season was dubbed “shipageddon,” what will this year be called? It’s easy to see a boom in gift cards out of frustration as Americans tire of out-of-stocks and logistic mishaps.
“There is a certain amount of underappreciating for the risk” to the results of retailers, said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence whose coverage includes mass merchants. “Supply chain affects everybody. Meeting customer expectations in an environment where everything is up in the air is nearly impossible.”
Some investors are wising up. Short interest in the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) exchange-traded fund, which mimics the S&P Retail Select Industry Index that’s surged this year, recently hit the highest level since late 2019.
But the retail industry has seen this coming. Large firms with the financial wherewithal have been storing goods in their own warehouses or renting space to make sure they can start filling shelves over the next few weeks. It’s another example of how “scale will be the pivotal differentiator” this holiday season, Bartashus said.
There’s also a push to get Americans to shop sooner for the holidays. One effort is trying to create a new shopping event in early October that will include retailers such as Guess? hosting livestream events on their websites. However, this seems like a gargantuan task considering e-commerce has trained the masses that purchases arrive in a few days like clockwork. Retailers have also traditionally saved some big promotions for the week before Christmas to drive a late spending push.
“Consumers might see news about port backups, but that won’t hit home until they try to buy the toy of the year and can't get it,"" Bartashus said. “That’s when they’ll hit crisis mode.”
Many retailers are already there.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>","With help from Tesla, nearly 80% of Norway's new car sales are electric","(This October 1st story corrects spelling of name in 12th paragraph of Oct. 1 story)
By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - Demand for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's mid-sized models helped push up electric car sales in Norway to nearly 80% of total car sales last month, data showed on Friday.
The country has been a global leader in switching to electric vehicles and seeks to become the first to end the sale of petrol and diesel engines by 2025.
Battery electric vehicles made up 77.5% of all new cars in September, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said, up from 61.5% a year ago.
Tesla Model Y, a compact sports utility vehicle, was the top selling vehicle with 19.8% of the car market followed by the company's Model 3 sedan with 12.3%. Skoda's Enyaq was a distant third at 4.4%.
First unveiled by California-based Tesla in March 2019, the Model Y was only recently made available to European customers.
By exempting fully electric vehicles from taxes imposed on those relying on fossil fuels, oil-producing Norway has become a leader in ending the use of combustion engines, and in 2020 EVs outsold all other cars for the first time.
However, Norway's zero-tax policy could change if the centre-left winners of last month's national election go ahead with plans to tax the most expensive models.
LUXURY TAX
The next government is expected to be headed by Labour's Jonas Gahr Stoere, and will be made up of parties which have vowed to introduce 25% VAT on the fraction of the price tag of a new car that exceeds 600,000 Norwegian crowns ($69,300).
While Tesla's Model Y, costing less than the tax threshold, may be unaffected, the company's high-end S and X models are priced at up to 1.3 million crowns and could face substantial levies. Porsche, Audi and Mercedes-Benz would also be affected.
Labour says the tax will bring in extra cash to state coffers and is motivated by a sense of fairness.
The tax exemption for electric car purchases was meant as a way to introduce new technology, and can't last indefinitely, said Svein Roald Hansen, a Labour tax policy spokesman.
""It is a subsidy. And... the more expensive the car is, the bigger the subsidy,"" he said.
""We have in the last couple of years received a lot of new models... there is plenty to choose from for those who still want to buy a car while there is a VAT exemption,"" Hansen added.
A tax on electric luxury vehicles would be ill-timed and ultimately slow Norway's electrification, said Christina Bu who heads the Norwegian EV Association, an interest group.
Even in the northernmost part of the country with freezing temperatures in winter and reindeer roaming the streets, electric car sales have recently been outselling those powered by petrol, diesel and hybrid engines, Bu said.

""Now finally the more rural areas are starting to buy more electric cars and it's not the time now to remove the tax exemption because we need to also get these areas with higher market shares,"" she added.

Lilly will transfer its rights in India to sell, promote and distribute its Trulicity and Humalog products, while continuing to maintain its existing operating model for the remaining portfolio of its products, the companies said.
The deal will allow Cipla to expand access to the drugs in the country with the second-highest number of diabetic people in the world. India has more than 70 million adults with diabetes, according to government estimates.
Trulicity, a once-weekly shot to control blood sugar through the week, is Lilly's best-selling drug that raked in sales of $1.54 billion in the second quarter. Its Humalog, a fast-acting insulin injection, is also a key part of its diabetes portfolio.

""Developing strategic partnerships to adopt different operating models is the key to... make innovative medicines available to more people in India,"" said Luca Visini, Lilly's managing director for the Indian subcontinent.
""Cipla has a strong local footprint and is well established to expand access to (Trulicity and Humalog) around India.""

Investing.com – Shares of China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) in Hong Kong were suspended on Monday after some bondholders said the developer missed a second key bond interest payment in the past week.
Shares of  Evergrande Property Services Group  (HK:6666), a China Evergrande unit, were also suspended on the same day, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, no reason for either suspension was given and it was unclear which party initiated them.
China Evergrande shares plunged 80% so far in 2021, while those for Evergrande Property Services Group have dropped 43% as the company scrambles to raise funds to pay its lenders and suppliers.
Although the People’s Bank of China eased some initial worries after it owed to protect homebuyers’ interests, the Hong Kong suspension re-ignited concerns in the market. The offshore yuan was knocked a little lower and the Hang Seng Index slid 2.49% by 12:09 AM ET (4:09 AM GMT).
With the company already having missed two offshore payments in September, worries are mounting about whether the company can meet the deadlines on dollar bond coupon payments totaling $162.38 million in October 2021.
China Evergrande said on Sep. 30 that its wealth management unit made a 10% repayment of wealth management products due on the same day. The company has been prioritizing domestic creditors over offshore bondholders.
The Chinese government also reportedly tapped state-owned firms and state-backed property developers, both directly or indirectly about purchasing some of China Evergrande’s assets, according to Reuters."
1278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 03, 2021 10:54PM ET</span>","Evergrande, Property Management Unit Share Trading Halted","(Bloomberg) -- Trading of China Evergrande Group shares was suspended in Hong Kong along with those of its property management unit, as the property giant contends with a deepening cash crisis. 
No reason was given for the halts, which also affect all structured products relating to the company, a stock exchange filing showed on Monday morning. Hopson Development Holdings Ltd. plans to acquire a 51% stake in Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. for more than HK$40 billion ($5.1 billion), Cailian reported, citing unidentified people.
Evergrande shares have plunged 80% this year, and its bonds have tumbled to levels that suggest investors are bracing for a default. With more than $300 billion in liabilities, the developer has been trying to sell assets in a bid to raise cash. The saga has roiled financial markets in recent weeks on concern that it may spread to hurt the economy and financial system.
The trading suspension may be related to a major asset disposal or capital restructuring, said Patrick Wong, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. Weak property sales “may accelerate its asset disposal,” he said.
A representative for Hopson Development declined to comment in a text message.
Evergrande Property Services is the Chinese conglomerate’s most valuable business, with a market value of about HK$55 billion, surpassing the parent company’s HK$39 billion. Evergrande said in September that it had been “actively exploring” sales of parts of the unit, along with its electric vehicle arm, though no material progress had been made. 
Evergrande’s 8.25% dollar bond due March 2022 was indicated 0.2 cent higher on the dollar at 25.4 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Mainland China markets are closed for a national holiday. 
While Evergrande’s onshore bonds suffered regular halts last month, trading in the company’s Hong Kong shares had until now been continuous throughout its latest debt woes. Monday’s filing didn’t specify whether Evergrande requested the suspension, though it’s unlikely the stock exchange would mandate a halt without saying it had done so. Under Hong Kong listing rules, an issuer must demonstrate “exceptional circumstances” when requesting a trading halt and has to publish a public update as soon as possible.
Evergrande last requested a stock trading suspension in October 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of its property unit were halted in January, when it announced it had purchased a rival firm.
Went Public
The property services business went public in December, raising $1.84 billion in the sale. At the time, the offering valued the unit at about HK$95.1 billion, making it the second-largest listed property-management company in Hong Kong after Country Garden Services Holdings Co., according to Bloomberg calculations.
The stock has tumbled 43% this year, dragged down by Evergrande’s debt problems. Shares of the developer’s other Hong Kong-listed unit, China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd., haven’t been suspended. Its shares fell as much as 8.3% on Monday morning. 
Chinese authorities have been trying to limit any fallout from the Evergrande debacle. Last week, officials met with banks to ease credit for homebuyers and support the property sector, and the government bought out Evergrande’s stake in a struggling lender.
Homebuyers are losing confidence in the embattled developer, which has pledged to deliver projects that have been left unfinished. Evergrande’s contracted sales probably plunged 86% in September from a month earlier, according to China Real Estate Information Corp. figures.
Evergrande has fallen behind on payments to banks, suppliers and holders of onshore investment products, and hasn’t given any indication that it paid two recent dollar bond coupons.
Now it faces a fresh debt test, with the maturity of a bond issued by a related entity. People familiar with the matter have said that a dollar note due Oct. 3 issued at an initial amount of $260 million by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises is guaranteed by Evergrande. As the maturity is a Sunday, the effective due date is Monday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning. However, investors started the fourth quarter of 2021 on a cautiously optimistic note as they hope for a pickup in economic growth to override inflation pressure concerns.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.27% by 9:55 PM ET (1:55 AM GMT) and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 2.31%. In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.81%.
South Korean and Chinese markets were closed on Monday.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 rose over 1% Friday after  Merck & Co  .'s (NYSE:MRK) COVID-19 pill showed promising results, and the U.S. Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers index, released on Friday, was a better-than-expected 61.1 for September.
The dollar declined for a third day, with tensions in Asia, alongside U.S.-China tensions, high due to a record number of flybys by Chinese warplanes close to Taiwan. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yields slipped to 1.45%.
“The greenback’s rally has stretched the momentum indicators, and a correction/consolidative phase seems likely ahead of the latest U.S. jobs report” due on Friday, Bannockburn Global Chief Market Strategist Marc Chandler told Bloomberg.
Investors in Asia Pacific will also be monitoring the news from China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), whose debt woes continue. Investors will also be awaiting comments from an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies meeting, taking place later in the day, as crude prices continue to soar.
With fears of a slowing economic recovery from COVID-19 continuing to mount, the U.S. jobs report will be a focal point for investors. Global shares had their worst month since March 2020 in September over concerns about rising inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks, a growing global energy crisis, and a slowdown in China’s economic recovery.
However, some investors remained cautiously optimistic, pointing out historical patterns where stocks tend to show strength nearer the end of a year.
“Investors need to be mindful of seasonal market strength. When the fourth quarter is ugly, it tends to be really ugly, but if it is strong, it tends to be quite strong,” Tallbacken chief executive officer Michael Purves told Bloomberg.
In central bank news, the Reserve Bank of Australia will hand down its policy decision on Tuesday, followed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand a day later. The Reserve Bank of India will round up the week when it hands down its decision on Friday."
1280,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2021 08:15PM ET</span>","Amid COVID-19 booster data dilemma, EU nations' plans diverge","By Josephine Mason, Anthony Deutsch and Nikolaj Skydsgaard
LONDON (Reuters) - A patchwork of campaigns for an extra COVID-19 shot are being rolled out across the European Union even before the region's drug watchdog rules on whether they are safe and effective.
Italy, France, Germany and Ireland have already started to administer booster shots and the Netherlands plans to do so soon but only to people who are immuno-suppressed.
But several EU countries are waiting for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to give its opinion this week.
The fragmented picture mirrors the different approaches seen in the roll-out of shots across one of the world's wealthiest regions at the turn of the year.
They also highlight the lack of consensus among scientists about how broadly they are needed, while governments seek to revive their ailing economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant, and avoid further lockdowns in the winter.
Underscoring what is at stake, the EU's infectious diseases centre said on Thursday the region's coverage of vaccines was still too low and there was a risk of a significant surge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks. 
Only 61% of the total population have been fully vaccinated, and only three countries - Malta, Portugal, Iceland - have vaccinated more than 75% of their total population, it said. 
That compares with less than a quarter of the population in Bulgaria, one of the big laggards in EU vaccinations.
Still, the bloc's push towards boosters will stir the debate over rich nations' use of vaccines while poorer countries struggle to access supplies and inoculate their citizens. 
The World Health Organization has called on countries to delay boosters until more people around the world have been inoculated.
EU NEXT IN LINE
If the EMA gives its backing for the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) booster, the 27-member bloc will join the United States, Britain and Israel, which have already received the green light to administer them.
Those have relied on data from Israel where boosters are being offered to the whole population showing that more than 1.1 million people aged 60 and older received a booster dose of Pfizer, resulting in a decline in overall infections as well as severe illness from COVID-19 in that group.
Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also each released analyses of clinical trial data showing that the effectiveness of their shots, initially estimated at over 90% against symptomatic COVID-19 infection, wanes over time.
Many vaccine experts say the data so far only suggest a need for boosters in older adults and people with compromised immune systems.
A decision by the EMA is expected on Monday, although the regulator is unlikely to provide detailed guidance on who should receive a booster shot.
The EMA and the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have both said there is not enough data on the issue.
On Thursday, the ECDC said additional doses may be given to people with severely weakened immune systems as they may not have adequate protection from standard vaccination.
As a precautionary measure, older frail people, in particular those living in care homes, could also get a booster, while healthcare workers and other staff who are exposed to the virus could also be considered, it said.
But it said it was still assessing data on waning immunity after vaccination and reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant.
DIVERGING MOVES
In the meantime, EU countries are implementing their own policies.
Italy has started to administer shots across the immuno-compromised, the elderly and healthcare workers who are vulnerable or at high risk of infection, targeting a total of about 9 million people. 
In contrast, the Netherlands is limiting its boosters to the immunosupressed - up to 400,000 people - and has stressed the need for primary vaccinations. 
""For the time being, the current COVID-19 vaccines offer an undiminished high level of protection against it. The only clues so far for a diminishing protections are coming from Israel, but these indications in themselves still offer too little basis for a booster campaign in the Netherlands,"" the health council said.
In Denmark, the government is pursuing a similar strategy but plans to hand out extra doses to medical staff and anyone over 65 if the EMA gives the go-ahead. 
Switzerland will not use boosters for now because the authorities say they do not see protection slipping over time, but they are still monitoring the data.
The decision-making has exposed domestic divisions too. Germany's federal and regional health ministers were worried about slowing vaccination rates and voted for third doses to a large portion of the population.

But the country's vaccine expert panel STIKO has only endorsed a extra shot for the immunocompromised, such as cancer patients or people with organ transplants.
It said it was considering widening to other groups and it would make a recommendation over the coming weeks.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2021 07:40PM ET</span>",U.S. aerospace firms commit to net zero emissions by 2050 -sources,"By Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - U.S. aerospace manufacturers are poised to strengthen a climate target by pledging to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, echoing a commitment to be discussed by global airlines on Monday, according to industry sources and a document seen by Reuters.
The U.S. Aerospace Industries Association will commit on Monday to work with airlines and governments to achieve the target, joining a growing aviation industry consensus that also includes airports, according to the sources.
AIA was not immediately available for comment.
Global airlines are expected to vote on a similar proposal at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Boston on Monday.
A broader aviation industry lobby, the Air Transport Action Group, is also expected to sign up later this week.
The target replaces a previous goal of halving net emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels, which was intended to mirror the Paris climate agreement to limit global temperature increases this century to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
A U.N. report this year said there was now a 40% chance that global temperatures would temporarily reach 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the next five years.
Environmental groups say the emerging net-zero 2050 target does not go far enough and must be enforced by government action. Aviation accounts for some 3% of global emissions.
""Aviation won't get to net zero by 2050 unless it accepts binding climate laws set at national level,"" said Andrew Murphy, aviation director at Brussels-based Transport & Environment.
The commitment includes commercial aviation manufacturers such as planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and suppliers Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON) and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR).
European planemaker Airbus has already said it would back the 2050 target. 
Boeing referred questions on the goal to AIA and ATAG.

To help meet the new target, manufacturers have pledged to expand their investments in a new generation of technology for more efficient planes, such as hybrid jet engines expected to enter service during the next decade, the sources said.
Airlines, airports and aerospace manufacturers are pressing for government support for increasing production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) needed to reach the targets.

Israel was an early adopter of Pfizer/BioNtech booster shots -- administering them to members of risk groups in July and by the end of August to anyone above the age of 12. Its campaign is being watched closely by other countries.
The new green pass is being issued to those who received three shots or recently recovered from COVID-19, replacing a previous system that required just two shots. It raises the bar for what the government considers full immunization.

Starting on Tuesday, store owners or event organizers will have to scan a customer's digital barcode before allowing entry. There will be some exemptions, such as museums and libraries.
About 37% of Israel's 9.4 million population has received a booster shot. The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalised in serious condition has been dropping in recent days, as has the number of confirmed daily cases, which fell to below 4,000 after topping 10,000 last month.

SYDNEY/BOSTON (Reuters) -Qantas Airways is in talks with several planemakers over plans to renew its main narrowbody and regional airliner fleets and is expected to formalise the negotiations with a tender announcement within days, industry sources said.
The Australian carrier is studying the Airbus A220 and Brazilian Embraer's E2 to replace a regional fleet of 20 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 717s and 18 Fokker 100s, they added. 
Boeing's 737 MAX 7, the smallest member of its best-selling single-aisle family, is also seen as a contender.
In the busiest part of the market, Airbus and Boeing are competing head to head as Qantas also seeks to replace Boeing 737-800s, the oldest of which are nearly 20 years old. 
The combined moves could lead to staggered purchases of as many as 100 jets including options, the sources said. 
In Boston, where airline executives were gathering for an industry meeting, Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce declined to comment ahead of a virtual news briefing scheduled for Monday. Planemakers Airbus, Boeing and Embraer also declined to comment.
Talks over the influential airline's business have been under way for months, but Qantas is expected to set out its requirements publicly within days as it and other airlines eye potential bargains for jets in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.
""We've said for some time that the renewal of our domestic narrowbody fleet is on our agenda,"" a Qantas spokesperson said.
""It's a long-term proposition and when we have any material updates to provide, we will.”
Qantas had initially planned to place an order in 2020 https://www.reuters.com/article/qantas-fleet-orders-idUSL3N20G2W6 but that was delayed by the pandemic. Chief Financial Officer Vanessa Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said in February a tender would be launched this year.
Qantas budget arm Jetstar has 109 A320neo family planes on order https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-airshow-qantas-idUSKCN1TK06Q, but the start of deliveries has been postponed until at least July 2022 due to the impact of the pandemic. 
In a separate contest dubbed 'Project Sunrise,' Qantas selected Airbus over Boeing for jets capable of staging the world's longest commercial flights from Sydney to London, but the plans were delayed by the pandemic.
Joyce said in August that order for A350-family jets would not be revisited until international borders reopened.

Australia said on Friday it would begin a staged opening of international borders https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-ease-international-travel-curbs-sources-2021-10-01 next month but only vaccinated citizens and permanent residents would be included and they would be required to quarantine at home for seven days on arrival.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Facebook does not believe it is a primary cause of polarization -exec to CNN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) executive said in an interview on Sunday with CNN that the company does not believe that its social media service is a primary contributor to the political polarization that has become widespread in the United States.
The company's vice president of policy and global affairs, Nick Clegg, spoke ahead of an expected Sunday evening segment on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" featuring a whistleblower who alleges the company moved too quickly to lift some election-related restrictions it had put in place around the November 2020 contest.
Clegg acknowledged that the company's platform can serve as a conduit for hate speech and disinformation.
""The way people exchange information ... now takes place online,"" he said in the interview. ""So of course, we as one of the largest social media platforms have a responsibility to understand where we contribute to negative and extreme content or hate speech or misinformation and so on.""
The whistleblower is expected to testify to a Tuesday Senate hearing about what one of the senators announcing the meeting called the social media company's toxic effects on young users.
Clegg rejected as ""ludicrous"" that social media should shoulder the blame for the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump, fueled by his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.

""The insurrection on that day lies squarely with the people who inflicted the violence and those who encouraged them, including President Trump,"" Clegg said. ""I think it gives people false confidence to assume that there must be a technological or a technical explanation for the issues of political polarization in the United States ... It's too easy to say it's Facebook's fault.""
U.S. senators last week grilled Facebook about its plans to better protect young users on its apps, drawing on leaked internal research that showed the social media giant was aware of how its Instagram app harmed the mental health of teens.

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>","Box Office: 'Venom' Sequel Feasts on Monstrous $90 Million Debut, Setting Pandemic Record","By Rebecca Rubin
LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" roared to $90.1 million in its debut, setting a new pandemic record. It's an impressive result, one that provides a lifeline to struggling movie theaters and (once again) proves Marvel's might at the box office. 
The much darker ""Venom"" follow-up comes from  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Pictures and is separate from Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe, which recently delivered ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and ""Black Widow"" -- the two highest-grossing films of the year at the domestic box office. If its first three days in theaters are any indication, ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" looks to find itself among that group as 2021's biggest earners. The film is playing only in cinemas as opposed to a hybrid release on-demand, a factor that should help ticket sales. 
""We are also pleased that patience and theatrical exclusivity have been rewarded with record results,"" Sony's chairman Tom Rothman said in a statement to press. ""With apologies to Mr. Twain: The death of movies has been greatly exaggerated."" 
The supervillain sequel, starring Tom Hardy as the otherworldly lethal protector, blew past the pandemic-era benchmark set last July by ""Black Widow,"" which opened to $80 million in theaters. It made an additional $60 million on Disney Plus, where it was available to purchase on the same day as its theatrical debut. 
""Young adult audiences are less deterred by current pandemic conditions than older and family moviegoers, which is benefitting superhero, action and horror movies,"" says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. He adds: ""For these movies, playing exclusively on the big screen is clearly an advantage."" 
Making inaugural ticket sales for ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" even more impressive: It had a bigger opening weekend than its predecessor, 2018's ""Venom."" The first comic book adventure with Hardy at the helm opened to $80 million, years before the devastating global health crisis. Despite terrible reviews, the original became a box office juggernaut and grossed $213 million in North America and $856 million globally. ""Venom"" was particularly huge in China, where the 2018 movie collected $269 million. 
The sequel doesn't have a release date yet in China, a market that will be crucial to its success. Though it is expected to open there, the country has denied ""Black Widow,"" ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and other major Hollywood titles. 

""Venom: Let There be Carnage"" wasn't the only new movie to inject some life into the box office. MGM's animated adventure ""The Addams Family 2"" pulled in a better-than-expected $18 million from 4,207 theaters while it was simultaneously available to rent on-demand. 
Meanwhile, the Warner Bros. movie ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" a prequel to ""The Sopranos,"" flopped in its debut, generating a paltry $5 million from 3,181 venues. Like the studio's entire 2021 slate, the film opened concurrently on HBO Max at no extra cost to subscribers. 
Elsewhere at the domestic box office, ""Shang-Chi"" collected $6 million in its fifth weekend of release, boosting its overall total to $206 million. It's the first, and so far only, pandemic-era movie to gross more than $200 million in the U.S. and Canada. The superhero tentpole has generated $386 million globally, which is far less than a Marvel movie would make in non-COVID times but ranks as one of the best hauls at a time when attendance hasn't come close to reaching pre-pandemic levels.

ADNOC Drilling, whose share offering attracted more than $34 billion in demand, is expected to be among the 10 largest companies on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, based on a market capitalisation at listing of about $10 billion.
Its shares surged over 30% to 3.05 dirhams in early trading.
""This important milestone will bolster the expansion and diversification of Abu Dhabi’s equity capital markets and further the development of the UAE’s economy and private sector"", ADNOC said in a statement.
The IPO is the latest move by Gulf oil giants ADNOC and  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) to raise cash from outside investors as they try to diversify sources of income in their oil-dependent economies.
Saudi Aramco listed in late 2019, raising $29.4 billion in the world's biggest IPO.
ADNOC will continue to own an 84% majority stake in the unit, while Baker Hughes will retain its 5% shareholding.  Helmerich & Payne  (NYSE:HP) will hold 1% through its IPO cornerstone investment.

ADNOC increased the size of the IPO to 11% of share capital because of oversubscription. It had previously targeted selling a minimum stake of 7.5%.
The sale is the second public flotation of a company owned by the Abu Dhabi oil major after the 2017 listing of ADNOC Distribution, the largest operator of petrol stations and convenience stores in the UAE.

The AW609 is a twin-engine tilt-rotor aircraft that can take off like a helicopter but flies like a plane, giving it greater speed and distance than normal helicopters.
Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said the first two AW609s built for a customer were in production and would be delivered as soon the aircraft is certified, which he expects will be next year.
""We're pretty close to the final step,"" he told Reuters at the Dubai Expo world fair.
An FAA representative said in response to a Reuters query that the agency ""does not comment on certification projects.""
Leonardo forecasts civil, government and military demand for the AW609, including for transport to offshore oil and gas sites, search and rescue operations, border patrol and surveillance.
""We are seeing a lot interest,"" Profumo said, including from potential buyers in the United States, Australia and Japan.
An AW609 prototype first took flight in 2003 and four prototypes have been built including one that crashed in 2015, killing the two pilots on board.
Italy's flight safety agency recommended aerodynamic and software changes to the aircraft following the crash.

Presidential hopeful Ciro Gomes took part in the protest in Rio de Janeiro and was also expected at the demonstration in São Paulo, according to local media.
Former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whom polls show ahead of Bolsonaro in a simulated 2022 matchup, did not attend the protests.
In addition to criticizing right-wing Bolsonaro and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrators also protested inflation and high fuel prices.
In Rio de Janeiro, the protest brought together hundreds of people, with the support of trade unions and left-wing parties. One group brought a huge inflatable gas canister bearing the inscription: ""Is it expensive? It's Bolsonaro's fault.""
Saturday's demonstrations were a response to a rally of Bolsonaro supporters on Sept. 7. Protesters also gathered in the central region's capital of São Paulo and in northern state capitals such as Recife and Belém.

The protests against the president brought together center-left parties, trade unions and social movements, marking an attempt by the opposition to show unity.

LONDON (Reuters) -Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) has won the auction for Morrisons with a 7 billion pound ($9.5 billion) bid, paving the way for the U.S. private equity firm to take control of Britain's fourth-biggest supermarket group. 
The board of Morrisons recommended CD&R's 287 pence per share bid on Saturday, hours after its bid beat a consortium led by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) owned Fortress Investment Group, which had made an offer worth just a penny less per share at 286 pence.
CD&R's victory marks a triumphant return to the UK grocery sector for Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Britain's biggest supermarket chain Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), who is a senior adviser to CD&R.
The board recommended that shareholders vote in favour of the 287 pence per share offer at a meeting slated for Oct. 19, saying the private equity group had confirmed its previously stated intentions towards Morrisons remained unchanged.
""Today's final offer from CD&R represents excellent value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders,"" Morrisons Chairman Andrew Higginson said in a statement. 
If shareholders approve the offer, CD&R could complete its takeover by the end of the month, making Morrisons the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity after a buyout of no. 3 player Asda, completed in February. 
EGGS AND BUTTER
CD&R has committed to retaining Morrisons' headquarters in Bradford, northern England, and its existing management team, led by CEO David Potts. 
It also says it will execute the supermarket chain's existing strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and maintain staff pay rates. 
These commitments are not legally binding, however.
Morrisons started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899. It listed its shares in 1967 and is Britain's fourth-largest grocer after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.
The takeover battle which has been running since May is the most high-profile of a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets.
CD&R's winning bid was only marginally above its 285 pence a share offer which had already been recommended in August. 
The final offer represents a 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June. Some analysts have said the victor may have to sell off assets, such as factories, warehouses or stores, to make a decent return.
CD&R could combine its 918 Motor Fuel Group (MFG) fuel forecourts with the 339 owned by Morrisons, opening Morrisons convenience stores on the sites, but that could face scrutiny from the competition regulator.
Leahy was CEO of Tesco for 14 years to 2011 and will now be reunited with Morrisons' Potts and Higginson, two of his closest lieutenants at Tesco.
Potts, who joined Tesco as a 16-year-old shelf-stacker, will make more than 10 million pounds from selling his Morrisons shares to CD&R. Chief operating officer Trevor Strain will pocket about 4 million pounds.
Fortress is left to lick its wounds and mull the cost of the saga. Documents published in July showed that Fortress expected to incur banking and advisory fees and expenses of 263.5 million pounds.
In a statement Fortress said: ""The UK remains a very attractive investment environment from many perspectives, and we will continue to explore opportunities to help strong management teams grow their businesses and create long-term value.""

Sainsbury's has in recent months been mooted as another possible target for private equity and investment companies.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has weathered the chip crisis better than rivals, with its overall deliveries surging 20% in the July to September period from its previous record in the second quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter-on-quarter gains. . 
In China, rising exports to Europe and the introduction of a cheaper Model Y helped boost Tesla's production, analysts said. 
Musk said Tesla suffered an extremely severe parts shortage earlier in the third quarter and had urged employees to make quarter-end delivery push, Reuters reported last month, citing an internal company email. 
""The end of quarter delivery wave is unusually high this time,"" he said in the email. 
Tesla delivered 241,300 vehicles globally in the July to September quarter, up 73% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected the electric-car maker to deliver 229,242 vehicles, according to Refinitiv data. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM), Honda and some of its bigger rivals posted declines in U.S. sales in the third quarter, hit by a prolonged chip shortage. GM's third-quarter U.S. sales fell nearly 33% to its lowest level in more than a decade. 
Tesla said it delivered 232,025 of its Model 3 compact cars and Model Y sport-utility vehicles and 9,275 of its flagship Model S and Model X cars to customers in the quarter.
Total production in the third quarter rose over 15% to 237,823 vehicles from the prior quarter.
CHINA 
Gary Black, portfolio manager at the Future Fund and a Tesla bull, said that Tesla's deliveries were driven by record deliveries in China, which was ""putting to rest any notion China demand is slowing."" 

Tesla faces scrutiny from both regulators and the public and growing competition from local rivals. 
Tesla has not released its September China sales yet, and in August, its Shanghai factory exported more than two thirds of its vehicles to Europe and Asian countries.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Joaquim Silva e Luna said there was ""zero"" risk that the state-run Brazilian oil company would seek to artificially control fuel prices even amid growing public outrage over inflation.
Petroleo Brasileiro, as the company is formally known, will have to raise gasoline and diesel prices in line with its international price parity policy despite political pressure to the contrary, the executive said.
Petrobras this week raised diesel prices by about 9%, its first such hike in 85 days. 
So far this year, diesel prices at the refinery have risen more than 50%, prompting politicians like center-right Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco to call on Petrobras to exercise a ""social function"" by helping to limit inflation. 
""There is no chance of this [controlling prices] happening,"" Luna said in a phone interview late on Friday. ""I consider it zero. Petrobras is a very well regulated company, with compliance rules. No board is going to approve such a thing.""
Earlier governments led by the left-wing Workers Party limited Petrobras' ability to pass oil price hikes onto consumers, generating billions of dollars in losses for the company, Luna said.
Lula said President Jair Bolsonaro, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes are convinced that artificially controlling prices would be detrimental to Petrobras.
""The best way for Petrobras to contribute is by paying taxes, dividends, royalties and [creating] jobs, not making a social policy,"" Luna said.
Oil prices are likely to rise in the final quarter, driven by demand for fuel derivatives in the Northern Hemisphere, and domestic price adjustments will largely depend on the exchange rate. On Friday, oil settled above $78 a barrel, just shy of a three-year high reached earlier this week, on expectations that OPEC ministers will maintain a steady pace in raising supply. 

""We are in the perfect storm,"" Luna said. ""Everyone is rooting for the dollar to fall, but I'm rooting for it more than anyone else."" 
The Brazilian real has lost nearly 6% of its value against the U.S. dollar in the past 3 months, putting further pressure on goods priced in dollars on the Brazilian market.

In its brief statement, Reliance Industries, which operates the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in western India, gave no reasons for its decision to set up the new unit and its reasons to locate it in the UAE, though it is in line with it becoming more international in its focus. 

It previously bought stakes in a number of overseas exploration and manufacturing assets, and in June it entered an agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to build a multi-billion dollar chemical project in Ruwais, marking the group's first investment in a greenfield overseas project.

Under its Trinity project, VW has been developing a flagship electric sedan to be built at Wolfsburg from 2026.

(Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump asked a federal judge in Florida on Friday to ask Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to restore his account, which the company removed in January citing a risk of incitement of violence.
Trump filed a request for preliminary injunction against Twitter in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, arguing the social media company was ""coerced"" by members of the U.S. Congress to suspend his account.
Twitter and several other social media platforms banned Trump from their services after a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in a deadly riot on Jan. 6. 
That assault followed a speech by Trump in which he reiterated false claims that his election loss in November was because of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.
Twitter ""exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate,"" Trump's lawyers said in the filing. The filing was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Twitter declined to comment on the filing when contacted by Reuters. 
At the time of removing Trump's account permanently, Twitter said https:// his tweets had violated the platform's policy barring ""glorification of violence"". The company said at the time that Trump's tweets that led to the removal were ""highly likely"" to encourage people to replicate what happened in the Capitol riots.
Before he was blocked, Trump had more than 88 million followers on Twitter and used it as his social media megaphone.

In the court filing, Trump argued Twitter allowed the Taliban to tweet regularly about their military victories across Afghanistan, but censored him during his presidency by labeling his tweets as ""misleading information"" or indicating they violated the company's rules against ""glorifying violence"".
In July Trump sued https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-suing-facebook-twitter-google-claiming-bias-2021-07-07 Twitter,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, as well as their chief executives, alleging they unlawfully silence conservative viewpoints.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>",Battle for Britain's Morrisons culminates in $10 billion auction,"By Sarah Young and James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - An auction to decide who wins a $10 billion, six-month battle for British supermarket chain Morrisons begins on Saturday, with the result expected to be announced later.
The one-day auction pits U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (CD&R) against a consortium led by Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) owned Fortress Investment Group.
CD&R, whose 285 pence a share bid was recommended by Morrisons' board in August, is advised by Terry Leahy, a former CEO of Britain's biggest supermarket chain Tesco (OTC:TSCDY).
Morrisons, based in Bradford, northern England, began as an egg and butter merchant in 1899. It listed its shares in 1967 and is Britain's fourth-largest grocer after market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.
The battle for Morrisons is the most high-profile among a spate of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating assets.
The Takeover Panel, which governs the process for M&A deals in Britain, moved to an auction because neither bidder has declared their offers final.
The contest will consist of a maximum of five rounds.
In the first, either bidder may increase their offer. If neither does, CD&R's existing agreed offer wins.
In the event of a higher bid in round one, the other bidder can raise their own offer in three subsequent rounds.
If there is still no winner, both offerors may make an increased bid in a fifth and final round.
To prevent a draw any fifth round offer by Fortress must be at an ""even"" number of pence, while CD&R must bid an ""odd"" number of pence.
The panel will make a statement once the auction has completed and although Morrisons then has until Tuesday to make its recommendation, it could make a statement as early as Saturday after its board meets.
Morrisons shares closed at 297 pence on Friday, indicating investors expect a higher bid.

Both CD&R and Fortress have committed to retain Morrisons' Bradford headquarters and its existing management team led by CEO David Potts, execute its strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and to maintain staff pay rates. 
However, the commitments are not legally binding.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electric truck maker Rivian Automotive, which currently sources batteries from South Korean supplier Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, plans to build battery cells in-house, its filing for a U.S. initial public offering showed on Friday. 
The startup, backed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, said in the filing that its own battery cells would ""complement third-party cell procurement which will provide supply continuity and support our anticipated growth.""
Rivian, which disclosed losses of nearly $1 billion in the first half of the year, said it sees capital expenditure of approximately $8 billion through the end of 2023 to invest in additional manufacturing capacity, battery cell production, charging networks and others.
""Given the paramount importance and impact of the battery system on vehicle range, performance, and price, we have built in-house capabilities across the entire value chain,"" Rivian said, adding that includes battery cell development, battery manufacturing expertise and critical raw materials sourcing. 
""Over time, we intend to expand our capabilities related to proprietary cell development and in-house cell manufacturing and expect that these functions will grow substantially in the coming years,"" it said. 
Rivian announced in April that it had selected Samsung SDI as a battery supplier for its R1T pickup and R1S sport utility vehicle. 
Samsung SDI is considering building a battery plant in central Illinois where a Rivian factory is located, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters in August.    

Reuters reported in July that Rivian plans to build a second U.S. assembly plant that will also include battery cell production, citing people familiar with the matter.
Rivian rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc last year announced a plan to build battery cells in-house, but Tesla earlier this year canceled a plan to launch its longest-range Model S Plaid+ sedan with the new battery cells.

(Reuters) - A senior manager on Google's global security team crudely joked about a company security guard in text messages, part of a pattern of workplace harassment against the gay, Black employee, according to a lawsuit filed by the employee this week.
David Brown, who according to the lawsuit is jointly employed by the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit and security company Allied Universal, is seeking unspecified monetary damages for alleged physical and emotional harassment at Google's Los Angeles offices based on his sexual orientation and race, which it says took place between 2014 and last year. 
Google and Allied Universal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Many major companies including Google last year stepped up efforts to create more inclusive worksites after social protests calling attention to racism. Some workers at Google, including over 2,000 who signed an open letter on the issue in April, have said the company does not sufficiently hold perpetrators accountable. 
Brown's supervisor accounted for much of the alleged problematic behavior, including ""grabbing him on the buttocks, kicking him in the groin, throwing him through a window head first and brutally grabbing his nipples,"" according to the lawsuit, which was filed in a state court in Los Angeles.
The supervisor, Henry Linares, was fired for other reasons this year, according to the filing. A LinkedIn profile indicates he left Google and Allied Universal in July. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Google's senior manager for global community operations, Rus Rossini, ""participated in the discrimination and sexual harassment and took no corrective action,"" the lawsuit further alleges. 
During a chat last year about items missing from Google's offices, which were quiet due to the pandemic, Rossini messaged the supervisor, ""Strip searches for all,"" according to the lawsuit and a screenshot of the exchange seen by Reuters.
After the supervisor responded that, ""David is going to love that,"" Rossini followed, ""Tell David to bend over."" The supervisor, who shared the screenshot with Brown, responded, ""hahah I'll tell him you said Hellooo.""
Rossini did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He remains employed at Google, according to a LinkedIn profile.
Brown's attorney V. James DeSimone said Rossini should have addressed the abuse, especially after Brown ""turned those screenshots to human resources, implicating Rossini in the harassment.""

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 08:27PM ET</span>",White House pushes U.S. airlines to mandate vaccines for staff by Dec. 8,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is pressing major U.S. airlines to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for employees by Dec. 8 - the deadline for federal contractors to do so - and is showing no signs of pushing back the date, four sources told Reuters on Friday.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients spoke to the chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Thursday to ensure they were working expeditiously to develop and enforce vaccine requirements ahead of that deadline, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Large U.S. airlines have a number of federal contracts. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last month requiring federal contractors to mandate https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-white-house-wants-millions-government-contractors-vaccinated-by-dec-8-2021-09-24 COVID-19 shots for employees, with the White House last week setting the Dec. 8 deadline for completing the vaccinations.
American Airlines on Friday evening said more than 100,000 U.S.-based employees will need to get vaccinated, but did not specify a compliance date. It added that employees will be able to seek religious or health exemptions to vaccination.
""While we are still working through the details of the federal requirements, it is clear that team members who choose to remain unvaccinated will not be able to work at American Airlines,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in a memo https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1444077561684938764/photo/1. ""We realize this federal mandate may be difficult, but it is what is required of our company, and we will comply.""
Some airline officials had asked the White House to push back the requirements, signed by Biden last month, until after the busy holiday travel season.
Zients urged the airlines ""to act sooner than later to ensure as smooth of an implementation process as possible,"" one source said, and made clear the White House does not intend to relax the deadline. Zients also urged them to look at the United Airlines vaccine requirement https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/united-airlines-says-more-than-99-us-employees-have-been-vaccinated-2021-09-28 that was announced in August.
The three airlines separately confirmed the calls took place but declined to discuss the specifics. Zients did not respond to a request for comment on the calls, first reported by Reuters.
""Employers should act now to protect their workforce,"" Zients told a press briefing on Friday, without directly discussing airlines. ""More and more companies are stepping up to make vaccine requirements the standard across all sectors.""
The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) is among the federal contracts for major U.S. carriers. The reserve fleet was activated in August in support of the Pentagon, as airlines helped ferry people who have been evacuated from Afghanistan.
Biden's administration notified carriers on Thursday it will seek a modification of CRAF contracts to require vaccinations of airline employees, sources told Reuters. Other government agencies are also expected to seek amendments to contracts with airlines.
LABOR SHORTAGE WORRIES
The Allied Pilots Association https://www.alliedpilots.org/Portals/0/Public/DEPT/COMMUNICATIONS/Documents/Blast%20Docs/APA_VaccineMandate_AMOC_Final.pdf, which represents 14,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines, last week said that ""mandatory vaccinations could result in labor shortages and create serious operational problems for American Airlines and its peers."" Some employees of various U.S. businesses have quit rather than comply with vaccine mandates.
Two smaller airlines said earlier on Friday they would comply with the vaccine mandate for federal contractors. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) said it had ""communicated this vaccine requirement to our crew members.""
Alaska Airlines said it would comply with the federal contractor vaccine requirements, saying it believes it and other major U.S.  airlines are covered by the executive order.
Alaska Airlines said it ""means all of our employees, including  certain  contractors and vendors, will be required to be fully vaccinated, or be approved for a reasonable accommodation such as medical conditions or religious beliefs that prevent them from being vaccinated.""
It added: ""The date by which employees must be fully vaccinated has not been confirmed by the government, but it could be as early at Dec. 8.""
The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, which provides guidance to U.S. agencies on contracts and procurement, issued a memorandum https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FAR-Council-Guidance-on-Agency-Issuance-of-Deviations-to-Implement-EO-14042.pdf on Thursday on incorporating a clause into their solicitations and contracts on vaccines. It is expected to issue guidance on exemptions on Oct. 8, sources said.
Separately, the Labor Department will issue an emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/the-great-reboot/us-retail-industry-seeks-90-day-lead-time-covid-19-rules-2021-09-21order covering more than 80 million private-sector employees to require either regular COVID-19 testing or vaccines. That order is expected this month https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/white-house-wants-millions-government-contractors-vaccinated-by-dec-8-2021-09-24.
Delta said on Friday that 84% of its employees are vaccinated and it continues ""to evaluate the administration's plan."" Southwest said it ""continues to strongly encourage employees to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.""

United Airlines said 99.5% of its U.S.-based employees have been vaccinated, excluding those who have sought an exemption. The carrier said only 320 U.S.-based staff are not in compliance with its vaccination policy.
United, which in August became the first U.S. carrier to require vaccinations for all domestic employees, had asked staff to provide proof of vaccination by Monday or face termination.

(Reuters) -An experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19, according to data that experts hailed as a potential breakthrough in how the virus is treated.
If it gets authorization, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19. 
Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said they plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible and to make regulatory applications worldwide.
""An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game-changing,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. 
Current treatment options include  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD)'s infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, both of which are generally only given once a patient has already been hospitalized.
""This is going to change the dialogue around how to manage COVID-19,"" Merck Chief Executive Robert Davis told Reuters.
Existing treatments are ""cumbersome and logistically challenging to administer. A simple oral pill would be the opposite of that,"" Adalja added.
The results from the Phase III trial, which sent Merck shares up more than 9%, were so strong that the study is being stopped early at the recommendation of outside monitors.
Shares of Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a similar COVID-19 treatment, were up more than 21% on the news. 
Shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-covid-19-pill-success-slams-moderna-shares-shakes-up-healthcare-sector-2021-10-01  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc were off more than 10%, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) was down less than 1%.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said investors believe ""people will be less afraid of COVID and less inclined to get vaccines if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID.""
Pfizer and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) are also racing to develop an easy-to-administer antiviral pill https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-19-pill-developers-aim-top-merck-pfizer-efforts-2021-09-28 for COVID-19. For now, only antibody cocktails that have to be given intravenously are approved for non-hospitalized patients.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said on Friday that molnupiravir is ""a potential additional tool... to protect people from the worst outcomes of COVID,"" but added that vaccination ""remains far and away, our best tool against COVID-19.""
A planned interim analysis of 775 patients in Merck's study looked at hospitalizations or deaths among people at risk for severe disease. It found that 7.3% of those given molnupiravir twice a day for five days were hospitalized and none had died by 29 days after treatment. That compared with a hospitalization rate of 14.1% for placebo patients. There were also eight deaths in the placebo group.
""Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” Wendy Holman, Ridgeback's CEO, said in a statement.
'A HUGE ADVANCE'
Scientists welcomed the potential new treatment to help prevent serious illness from the virus, which has killed almost 5 million people around the world, 700,000 of them in the United States.
“A safe, affordable, and effective oral antiviral would be a huge advance in the fight against COVID,"" said Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford.
The study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who had symptoms for no more than five days. All patients had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome, such as obesity or older age.
Drugs in the same class as molnupiravir have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck has said similar studies of molnupiravir – for longer and at higher doses than used in humans – indicate that the drug does not affect mammalian DNA.
Merck said viral sequencing done so far shows molnupiravir is effective against all variants https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-says-research-shows-its-covid-19-pill-works-against-variants-2021-09-29 of the coronavirus including the highly transmissible Delta, which has driven the recent worldwide surge in hospitalizations and deaths.
It said rates of adverse events were similar for both molnupiravir and placebo patients, but did not give details.
Merck has said data shows molnupiravir is not capable of inducing genetic changes in human cells, but men enrolled in its trials had to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or agree to use contraception. Women of child-bearing age in the study could be pregnant and also had to use birth control.
The U.S. drugmaker said it expects to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of 2021.
The company has a U.S. government contract to supply 1.7 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course.
Davis said Merck has similar agreements with other governments, and is in talks with more. Merck said it plans a tiered pricing approach based on country income criteria.
The U.S. government has the option to purchase up to an additional 3.5 million treatment courses if needed, a U.S. health official told Reuters. The official asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the contract. 
Merck has also agreed to license the drug to several India-based generic drugmakers, which would be able to supply the treatment to low- and middle-income countries. 

Molnupiravir is also being studied in a Phase III trial for preventing infection in people exposed to the coronavirus.
Merck officials said it is unclear how long the FDA review will take, although Dean Li, head of Merck's research labs, said, ""they are going to try to work with alacrity on this.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks surged to a higher close on Friday, entering the final quarter of 2021 in a buying mood boosted by positive economic data, progress in the battle against COVID, and Washington developments on the potential passage of an infrastructure bill.
All three major U.S. stock indexes seesawed earlier in the session, but began trending higher by late afternoon, led by economically sensitive cyclicals.
The rally gained momentum after the White House announced U.S. President Joe Biden was getting more involved in negotiations over the infrastructure spending bill being debated on Capitol Hill.
Even so, all three indexes ended below last Friday's close, falling between 1.4% and 3.2%, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posting their biggest weekly percentage drops since February.
""There was a broad based recovery today. Markets were not fixated today on new taxes or tapering,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
""In a shift from the past few weeks there's been no big news from Washington, so markets were forced to focus on positive economic data and a new COVID medication.""
Merck & Co Inc revealed that a recent study showed its experimental oral drug for COVID-19 cut risk of death and hospitalization by about 50%, sending its shares jumping 8.4% and boosting economic reopening sentiment.
While Biden signed into law a stop-gap bill to keep the government running through Dec. 3, lawmakers only succeeded in kicking the can down the road.
This lack of resolution prompted rating agency Fitch to warn that the United States' 'AAA' credit rating could be at risk.
""Markets don't believe the debt will be downgraded or a debt ceiling deal won't be struck but it still adds uncertainty which is always a problem for the markets,"" Carter added.
A host of economic data released on Friday showed increased consumer spending, accelerated factory activity and elevated inflation growth, which could help nudge the U.S. Federal Reserve toward shortening its timeline for tightening its accommodative monetary policy.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker repeated his view expressed in a speech on Wednesday that he believes the central bank should begin tapering its asset purchases ""soon,"" but reiterated that he did not expect it to hike key interest rates until late next year or early 2023.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 482.54 points, or 1.43%, to 34,326.46; the S&P 500 gained 49.5 points, or 1.15%, at 4,357.04; and the Nasdaq Composite added 118.12 points, or 0.82%, at 14,566.70.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare stocks ended higher.
The sector was weighed down by a 11.4% drop in shares of COVID vaccine maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in the wake of the Merck news.
Economic optimism prompted value stocks to outperform growth, and transports and smallcaps to fare better than the broader market.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.63-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 136 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.02 billion shares, compared with the 10.70 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada said majority of the affected individuals experienced relatively mild illness and recovered quickly.

The risk of cardiac complications, including heart inflammation, has been shown to be substantially increased following COVID-19 infections, with the risks higher after the infection than after vaccination, according to the statement.
The benefits of mRNA shots in preventing COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risks, regulators in the United States, EU and the World Health Organization have said.

So, it could be wise to invest in quality retail stocks Industria de Diseño Textil (IDEXY),  Shoe Carnival  (NASDAQ:SCVL), and Tilly's (NYSE:TLYS) that have gained momentum and are well-positioned to maintain the same.Investors’ concerns over the pace of economic recovery due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases have kept the market volatile. In addition, consumer confidence slumped to a seven-month low in September. Moreover, the United States faces severe supply-chain disruption and shortages due to shipping delays, which further aggravates the already high inflationary environment. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed worries over inflation and expects the current pressures running into 2022.
However, the retail sales increased 0.7% in August compared to the expectation of a 0.8% decline. Also, the upcoming holiday season is expected to drive better-than-usual sales. So, turning to retail stocks with solid momentum could be rewarding.

The influential proxy advisory firm is backing management and the board instead of supporting the founder of NextGen, Sheldon Razin, who has nominated four directors to the board. Razin has criticized the company's poor financial returns.
ISS said recent changes to the board and management ""appear sufficient to put the company in a stronger position to execute its strategy to grow revenue,"" and added, ""The dissident has not made the case that additional change is preferable at this time.""
NextGen last month hired healthcare information technology veteran David Sides as its chief executive officer, three months after his predecessor left.

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Delta variant increases risks for pregnant women
Compared to coronavirus cases earlier in the pandemic, infections with the Delta variant lead to worse outcomes for unvaccinated pregnant women, new data suggest. Doctors studied 1,515 pregnant women with COVID-19 who received care from a large public health system in Dallas from May 2020 through Sept. 4, 2021. Overall, 82 women - 81 of whom were unvaccinated - developed severe illness, including 10 who needed ventilators and two who died. The proportion of severe or critical cases among pregnant women was around 5% until early 2021, and were ""largely nonexistent"" in February and most of March 2021, the researchers said in a statement. In late summer, during the peak of the surge of the Delta variant, the proportion of pregnant COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization jumped to 10% to 15%, they reported in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Pregnant women face greater risks for complications with any type of severe respiratory infection, so these findings of the higher risk from the Delta variant further emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated for COVID-19, study leader Dr. Emily Adhikari of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center said in a statement. On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for ""urgent action"" to increase COVID-19 vaccination among people who are pregnant, recently pregnant, including those who are breastfeeding, or who might become pregnant in the future, saying ""the benefits of vaccination outweigh known or potential risks.""
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine antibodies disappear in many by 7 months
Six months after receiving the second dose of the two-shot vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), many recipients no longer have vaccine-induced antibodies that can immediately neutralize worrisome variants of the coronavirus, a new study suggests. Researchers analyzed blood samples from 46 healthy, mostly young or middle-aged adults after receipt of the two doses and again six months after the second dose. ""Our study shows vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the original vaccine strain, but these levels drop by nearly 10-fold by seven months"" after the initial dose, Bali Pulendran of Stanford University and Mehul Suthar of Emory University said by email. In roughly half of all subjects, neutralizing antibodies that can block infection against coronavirus variants such as Delta, Beta, and Mu were undetectable at six months after the second dose, their team reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Neutralizing antibodies are not the immune system's only defense against the virus. Still, they ""are critically important in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" said Pulendran and Suthar. ""These findings suggest that administering a booster dose at around 6 to 7 months following the initial immunization will likely enhance protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants."" 
Experimental Merck pill halves hospitalizations, deaths

Merck & Co's experimental oral antiviral drug for COVID-19, molnupiravir, reduced by around 50% the chance of hospitalization or death for patients with mild or moderate infections who had risk factors for severe disease, according to interim clinical trial results announced by the company https:// on Friday. A planned interim analysis of 775 patients in Merck's study found that 7.3% of those given molnupiravir twice a day for five days were either hospitalized or had died by 29 days after treatment, compared with 14.1% of placebo patients. There were no deaths among those given molnupiravir but eight in the placebo group. Due to the positive results, the Phase III trial is being stopped early at the recommendation of outside monitors. ""An oral antiviral that can impact hospitalization risk to such a degree would be game changing,"" said Amesh Adalja, from Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who was not involved in the study. Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the pill as soon as possible, and to submit applications to regulatory agencies worldwide. If authorized, molnupiravir, which is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus, would be the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose on Friday as the prospect of the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19 boosted the sectors that could benefit most from a recovery in economic growth, but the market still posted a decline for the week.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended up 80.62 points, or 0.4%, at 20,150.87. Wall Street also rose.
Gains for stocks came as experts hailed an experimental antiviral pill developed by Merck & Co as a potential breakthrough in how the COVID-19 virus is treated.
""Because we've been floundering for a few weeks, investors have seized on this as a potential catalyst to perhaps speed up the timeline of recovery from COVID,"" said Elvis Picardo, a portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.
""You are seeing the cyclicals move up nicely today.""
The industrials and consumer discretionary groups both rose 0.9%, while the heavily-weighted financial services sector ended 0.7% higher.
Data showed that Canada's economy expanded 0.7% in August after a slight contraction in July.
Still, the Toronto market fell 1.2% for the week, its fourth straight weekly decline.
""The whole scare about inflation, investors might be taking it a little bit more seriously,"" Picardo said. ""You have seen (bond) yields tick up, you've seen crude oil come back really strongly.""

U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.1% higher at $75.88 a barrel on Friday, supported by tight supplies due to OPEC+ supply curbs.
The energy sector on the TSX rose 0.5%, while technology was up 0.6%.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 05:37PM ET</span>",Stocks bounce but inflation fears persist,"By Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global shares bounced in volatile trading on Friday with debate over the timing of future interest rate rises on both sides of the Atlantic intensified by euro zone inflation jumping to a 13-year high.
Earlier in the week, global shares suffered their worst rout since January with major U.S. and European indices feeling the heat. The S&P 500 had its worst month since the onset of the pandemic in September, reflecting concerns about COVID-19, inflation fears and budget wrangling in Washington.
The first day of October, the month for some of history's most infamous market routs, marked a see-saw session with major indices repeatedly switching direction amid investor uncertainty.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.45%. 
Prior to Friday's rally, the index had been on track for its longest daily losing streak since last February.
Wall Street strengthened as the day progressed, with sentiment boosted by drugmaker Merck announcing progress in the development of an oral COVID-19 drug and rising hopes an infrastructure bill will be passed.
Even so, all three indexes ended lower than last Friday's close, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posting their biggest weekly percentage drops since February.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 483.53 points, or 1.43%, to 34,327.45, the S&P 500 gained 49.55 points, or 1.15%, to 4,357.09 and the Nasdaq Composite added 118.12 points, or 0.82%, to 14,566.70.
In Europe, it was a different picture with the STOXX 600 index falling 0.4%.
""There's clearly still plenty of nerves in the markets at the moment, which is perfectly understandable under the circumstances,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. 
""There's an enormous amount of uncertainty as we move into the end of the year and central banks removing stimulus, even raising rates, in the midst of that doesn't inspire confidence.""
With stellar economic growth figures now in the rear view mirror, markets are looking ugly going into October, Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, said.
""There is a sense that, with October's reputation, worries about surging energy prices, supply chain disruptions, concerns about inflation and power shortages, October could be a fairly windy affair,"" Hewson said.
Consumer price inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 3.4% year on year in September, from 3% a month earlier, the highest reading since the height of the global financial crisis in September 2008.
""A sharp rise in the cost of living poses a threat to consumers and savers, so that is influencing the mood in the markets,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. 
So far, central bankers have insisted that rises in inflation are temporary.
""We think there are high chances that this inflation is less transitory than all central banks, including the European Central Bank, are suggesting,"" BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) economist Luigi Speranza said.
Data overnight showed that Asia's manufacturing activity broadly stagnated in September as signs of slowing Chinese growth weighed on the region's economies, weighing on Asian shares.

DOLLAR, TREASURY YIELDS SLIP
The dollar slipped, having begun the last quarter of 2021 near its highest levels of the year and heading for its best week since June as currency markets braced for U.S. interest rates to rise before those of major peers.
The dollar index fell 0.303%, with the euro up 0.15% to $1.1598.
Gold inched higher, following Thursday's 1.8% surge, as the weaker dollar and worries about rising inflation countered bets for looming interest rate hikes, keeping bullion on course for a small weekly gain.
U.S. gold futures settled up 0.1% at $1,758.4. Spot gold added 0.2% to $1,759.47 an ounce. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 17/32 in price to yield 1.4702%, from 1.527% late on Thursday.
Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2.3% to the lowest level since Sept. 3. An MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks slid 1.22% to its lowest since Aug. 24.
Chinese markets are closed for a week from Friday for the Golden Week holiday.

Crude prices rose but were still below the $80 a barrel Brent hit earlier in the week for the first time in three years.
U.S. crude oil futures settled at $75.88 per barrel, up 1.1%. Brent crude futures settled at $79.28 per barrel, up 1.2%.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 05:36PM ET</span>",What to watch for in the U.S. SEC's GameStop report,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to soon release its long-awaited report on the GameStop trading saga and it could have implications for brokerages, wholesale market makers, exchanges, and retail investors.
The SEC report is expected to address the issues around the market chaos in late January when a flood of trading through commission-free retail brokerages drove shares in  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and other popular ""meme stocks"" to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds that had bet against them.
Amid the intense volatility, several brokerages restricted trading in the affected stocks, curbing the rally, infuriating retail traders and rattling market confidence.
Here are some topics the SEC has said it is scrutinizing:
THE GAMIFICATION OF TRADING
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said the ""gamification of trading"" by commission-free retail brokerages is a growing concern because it could encourage more trading than is in investors' best interests.
Gensler highlighted retail brokerages' use of artificial intelligence, predictive data analytics, and machine learning to push customized products to their customers and boost revenues.
In March, brokerage Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets scrapped the use of confetti animation on its trading app that had marked users' first trades, among other changes, following criticism from politicians and regulators.
PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW 
Gensler has been critical of payment for order flow (PFOF), the practice of retail brokers, like Robinhood or  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, sending most of their customers' orders to wholesale market makers rather than to exchanges, in return for payments. 
Gensler has said PFOF raises potential conflicts and has questioned https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-global-exchange-fintech-2021-06-09 whether brokers are incentivized to encourage their customers to trade more frequently to maximize the payments.
PFOF proponents say it is a major reason most brokerages were able to stop charging trading commissions, which helped fuel retail trading boom. The majority of Robinhood's revenue comes from PFOF. 
PFOF defenders say it benefits retail traders because wholesale brokers execute their trades at the best prices found on exchanges or better.
But Gensler has said that because so many trades are now executed away from exchanges, where stock prices are formed, the best prices shown on exchanges may not accurately reflect market sentiment, causing wider bid-ask spreads to the detriment of all investors.
MARKET MAKER CONCENTRATION
The GameStop saga highlighted the small number of market-makers that dominate the retail market, with Citadel Securities executing around 37% of all U.S.-listed retail volume https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options. That could pose competition issues, Gensler has said.
EXCHANGE PRICING
Nearly half of all trades are executed away from exchanges. That is partly due to rules that allow market makers to offer fractional sub-penny price improvement on bids and offers, whereas exchanges have to quote in pennies, which Gensler has said has created an unleveled playing field. 
The ""sub-penny rule"" that limits exchanges to penny quotes was enacted in 2005 over concerns that if smaller pricing increments were allowed, sophisticated traders might use them to jump ahead of retail orders.
CLEARINGHOUSES AND SETTLEMENT TIMES
January's massive volatility in ""meme"" stocks prompted the post-trade clearinghouse that guarantees trades to demand billions of dollars in extra collateral from retail trading platforms.
In response, several brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks, sparking speculation on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum that the brokers were protecting hedge funds that stood to lose out if the shares rose.
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has argued the problem was largely due the two-day time period it takes to settle a trade, and if settlements were in real time, collateral would not have been an issue.
Gensler has indicated https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-global-exchange-fintech-2021-06-09 he is in favor of shortening the settlement cycle.
SHORT SELLING DISCLOSURES
Most of the stocks in the GameStop saga were heavily shorted - a strategy used to bet a stock price will fall - with more than 140% short interest in GameStop, implying that more shares were shorted than available to trade. 

That is possible on paper because when shares are borrowed to short and then sold back into the market, the new owner of the shares has no idea they are on the other side of a short sale, and can lend them out, just as the previous owner did.
Gensler has said he considering greater disclosure around short selling and securities lending.

1324,By StockNews,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",Bucking the Market Trend,"The market loves nothing more than to confound investors and traders. And, this past week was certainly confounding… but in a good way. As we discussed in the previous commentary, low-priced stocks tend to underperform the market on down days as liquidity tends to vanish first on the fringes of the market. So, it was surprising that our portfolio has been steadily gaining while the S&P 500 (SPY) has encountered significant selling this week. In this week’s commentary, I will discuss why this is happening and what it means. Read on below to find out more….Over the past week, the S&P 500 is down by 3.5%. What’s interesting is that the Russell 2000 is down by 2.3% and the microcaps index (IWM) is down even less – 1.6%. This state of affairs was reflected in our portfolio which was up 2.1% over the past week.
Why is this happening? My hunch is that we are seeing some selling pressure from the Fed signaling that a taper is imminent, either at this meeting or the next. This has been leading to strength in rates which is pressuring many growth and income stocks.
BUT, this weakness is offset by an improving economic situation especially as coronavirus case counts continue to tumble.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel plans to discuss a draft bill requiring companies that go public with dual-class stock to sunset the structure after seven years, according to a copy of the proposed legislation published late Thursday.
Dual-class share structures, which give some stockholders more voting power, are out of favor among investors, but popular with fast-growing technology companies. U.S. investors have been pushing companies to abandon the structure for years but have stopped short of not investing in those firms. 
The draft bill targets newly public companies, and would grandfather in social media companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat parent  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). The bill also allows for the dual-class structure to remain in place for an additional seven years if a majority of shareholders in each class approves it.
Shareholder advocacy group the Council of Institutional Investors wrote to the committee on Friday in support of the bill, along with the New York State Comptroller, which oversees $268 billion in public pension money, and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), with $113 billion in assets under management.

OPERS wrote in the letter that divesting from companies with dual-class stock eliminates the ""possibility of any constructive dialogue"" it could have with the firms. 
The bill also calls for companies to disclose the racial and ethnic diversity of their boards and executive officers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is already planning to implement a similar rule.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 05:11PM ET</span>",U.S. eyes Israeli military data for Pfizer COVID-19 booster safety,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials are hoping data on Israeli military personnel can help clarify the risk of heart muscle inflammation in younger people who have received Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 booster shots - a potential factor for U.S. regulators as they consider granting full approval of these boosters.
A condition called myocarditis has in rare cases been linked to the two-dose mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), mostly in younger males, but U.S. health officials are trying to better understand the risk.
""The real question that we have not yet answered is the safety data of an mRNA in young people vis-a-vis myocarditis,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser and the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said in a telephone interview.
""The Israelis will relatively soon have that data because they're vaccinating everybody in the country I think from 12 years old up, including their military recruits,"" Fauci added.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August granted full approval for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for people age 16 and older but the agency has not yet given full approval for its use as a booster shot. Instead, the FDA approved  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s booster under an emergency use authorization with approval on the full biologics license application (BLA) still pending. 
In their review of Pfizer's application regarding booster shots, FDA advisers in particular called out the lack of data on myocarditis in younger individuals.
Fauci said the Israel military data should help address the gap in safety information on mRNA vaccines, ""which is one of the things that the advisory committee was interested in."" Fauci said he expects data from Israeli military recruits specifically to shed light on the safety of the vaccines in younger people in the context of myocarditis. 
Biden's administration had sought a broad campaign of boosters for all Americans in light of evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness over time.
The FDA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September narrowed the recommendation for the Pfizer/BioNTech booster to Americans 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
Fauci has said he believes the proper regimen for the mRNA vaccines will end up being an initial two doses a few weeks apart, followed by a booster shot a few months later.
In June, the FDA added warnings to labels on the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines about rare cases of myocarditis in adolescents and young adults.
The FDA has granted emergency use authorization but not full approval to the Moderna vaccine as well as a one-dose Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shot. The FDA on Friday said it will consider Moderna's application for booster shots at an advisory panel meeting on Oct. 14, and J&J's booster application on Oct. 15.
Israel's national digitized database includes data from the country's four healthcare providers, which administer the vaccines, as well as other institutions including the military.

Fauci said U.S. officials plan to follow up with the Israeli Health Ministry about vaccination data involving military recruits. The ministry, which regularly analyzes the data, has shared its findings on vaccine effectiveness and safety with bodies such as the FDA.
An Israeli health ministry spokeswoman said she was unaware of any specific study of boosters among military personnel.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a proposed rule on Friday to list the Tiehm's buckwheat flower as an endangered species, the latest blow to ioneer Ltd's plans to build a Nevada lithium mine that would supply the electric vehicle industry. 
The move, which had been expected , will start a 60-day period for public comment once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register later this month. A final decision is expected within a year.
Anyone is free to send comments to the agency, which said in a statement that ""more information is needed to conduct an economic assessment of potential impacts to the species.""
The endangered species designation would not necessarily block the project, but could impede permitting. Construction had been slated to start this year, with the mine opening by 2023.
The regulatory review reflects the ongoing tension between environmentalists and industry as the United States tries to wean its economy off fossil fuels and go electric. 
Australia-based ioneer said it supports the agency's move and is ""highly confident that with a combination of avoidance, propagation and translocation, we can achieve the successful coexistence of Tiehm's buckwheat and our environmentally significant project.""
The environmental group Center For Biological Diversity has long said the flower - found nowhere else on earth - must be preserved at all costs. The group called Friday's move a ""banner day for native plant conservation.""
The ongoing review has not stopped financing efforts or scared off potential customers, though.

South African miner Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) Ltd last month bought half of the Nevada project for $490 million. 
That deal came after South Korean battery maker Ecopro Co Ltd agreed in June to buy roughly a third of the project's planned annual output of 7,000 tonnes of lithium.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 rose sharply Friday,  as positive results from Merck's Covid-19 pill stoked investor optimism and triggered a sea of green on Wall Street following a sloppy September.
The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4%, or 482 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.8%.
Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) reported that its experimental Covid-19 pills cut the risk of death and hospitalization by 50% in a study, sending its share price more than 8% higher.
The positive Covid-19 treatment news stoked investor optimism about the recovery amid an ongoing drag from the impact of the Delta variant.
Cyclical stocks including materials and energy took the lead, with the latter helped by expectations that energy prices will continue to climb to as high as $100 a barrel.
“If all these factors come together, oil prices could spike and lead to a second round of inflationary pressures around the world,” Bank of American said in a note.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) was up nearly 4% after raising its forecast on third-quarter earnings, citing higher oil and gas prices. The oil major said higher energy prices could boost earnings by as much as $1.5 billion.
Bets on reopening stocks – those that benefit from easing pandemic restrictions – renewed, with cruise and airlines companies leading the way.
United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL),  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) were sharply higher.
Big tech, which fell victim to rising interest rates recently, found its footing.  
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended in the green. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed lower.
On the economic front, the faster pace of inflation shows little sign of abating, but the consumer, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, continues to spend.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 3.6% in the 12 months through September.
Consumer spending in July rose by 0.8% month-on-month, from a 0.1% decline in the prior month.
“We remain constructive on consumer spending in the coming quarters. Even as the impulse from fiscal stimulus targeted at households fades, labor market  income and a savings cushion should support continued spending,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
In Washington, meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay a planned vote on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package amid ongoing wrangling within the Democratic caucus.
The House was hoping to pass the bipartisan infrastructure package and the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill simultaneously, as part of a two-track strategy. But Sen. Joe Manchin said he would support a reconciliation package worth only $1.5 trillion, well short of the proposed $3.5 trillion. 
Looking ahead, investors anticipate another wild week amid several events that could dominate direction in the broader market, including the Federal Reserve's September meeting minutes, the OPEC meeting, and the monthly jobs report to round out the week.

Those figures are up from the 392,909,995 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Thursday out of 474,245,945 doses delivered.

About 4.36 million people have received an additional dose of either  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna's vaccine since Aug. 13, when the U.S. authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's announcement on Friday comes as health authorities seek to mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide. 
FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) panel will hold a meeting on Oct. 14 to discuss a booster dose of Moderna vaccine, and Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 15. 
VRBPAC will discuss authorizing Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five through 11 on Oct. 26, the FDA said.
Last month, the agency authorized a booster dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for older adults and some Americans at high-risk of illness. 
About 4 million Americans had received a booster dose as of Thursday, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The panel will also review data on receiving a booster dose of a different vaccine than the one used in the original vaccine series, called ""mix and match"" boosters. 
Reuters reported in June that infectious disease experts were weighing the need for booster shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna's mRNA-based vaccines for Americans who received the J&J one-dose vaccine due to the prevalence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.

Separately, the FDA does not plan to extend the shelf life of hundreds of thousands of J&J vaccine doses beyond the current recommendation of six months from the manufacturer, NBC News, citing an internal email. 
The FDA and J&J did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), coal prices are expected to average $190 from October to December. Moreover, in Europe, coal prices have risen to $169, up from $65 in mid-March. In addition, with China’s bulk of electricity still being generated by coal, growing demand from the power sector should further drive the prices higher.
According to the Energy Information Administration, in the U.S., the share of electricity generation from coal is expected to rise from 20% in 2020 to about 24% in both 2021 and 2022 due to increased natural gas prices.
Therefore, fundamentally sound small-cap coal stocks Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (HCC), SunCoke Energy, Inc. (SXC), and Ramaco Resources, Inc. (METC) could benefit significantly from the rising coal prices and deliver solid returns in the near term.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 02:07PM ET</span>",Fast-food chains close some indoor seating as U.S. cities mandate vaccine checks,"(Corrects home state of Seattle to Washington in last paragraph)
By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) -As New York, San Francisco and a few other U.S. cities and counties require restaurants to check proof of COVID-19 vaccination to dine indoors, some fast-food chains are simply shutting their seating areas altogether - a move that may dent their sales. 
The burger chain White Castle shut the seating sections in its more than 20 New York City locations in September, after New York City began asking customers over the age of 12 to prove they received at least one does of the vaccine in order to eat indoors. 
By eliminating dine-in options, restaurants are forced to rely entirely on carry-out, drive-thru and delivery orders – which are generally more profitable. That also means they can eliminate costly labor required to clean seating areas and check customers' proof of vaccination, and perhaps have an extra employee work the kitchen or counter instead. 
White Castle Chief Operations Officer Jeff Carper said the chain was ""able to redeploy some labor to focus on drive-thru, delivery and pick-up,"" for instance. 
Taco Bell, a unit of Yum Brands Inc, said it encouraged customers to place digital orders for pickup and delivery, adding that ""our restaurants comply with federal, state and local regulations and guidelines to keep our team members and customers safe."" Two Taco Bell locations that Reuters visited had closed their indoor seating. 
At McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), franchisees consider multiple factors when deciding to close indoor seating, including COVID case counts, local regulations and staffing levels, the company said. On Sept. 16, 3 of the 8 McDonald's locations in New York City visited by Reuters had closed their indoor seating. 
""We continue to monitor the Delta variant closely and, as we have throughout the last 18 months, remain able to adapt quickly while maintaining our safety standards,"" the company said. 
Overall, consumer spending at U.S. restaurants has rebounded from last year's mid-pandemic lows, up 9% to $440 billion in the 12 months ended in August, according to data from The NPD Group/CREST. 
But the first mandate to check for proof of vaccination went into effect in New York City on August 17, and the city began to enforce the requirements as of Sept. 13. 

Inspectors for New York City visited 18,182 establishments by Thursday, giving out 2,211 warnings and 6 violations of $1,000 for failing to check vaccination cards.
King County, Washington, home to Seattle, will require restaurants to check proof of full vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test beginning Oct. 25. San Francisco began requiring indoor diners to show proof that they had been fully vaccinated on Aug. 20.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo must face shareholder fraud claims over its recovery from scandals,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Thursday rejected  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's bid to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders about its ability to rebound from five years of scandals over its treatment of customers.
The fourth-largest U.S. bank has operated since 2018 under consent orders from the Federal Reserve and two other U.S. financial regulators to improve governance and oversight, with the Fed also capping Wells Fargo's assets.
Shareholders said bank officials falsely claimed in TV interviews, analyst calls and congressional testimony that the bank was mending its ways, when regulators actually viewed its progress as ""deficient"" and ""unacceptable.""
U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan said the shareholders plausibly alleged that some statements by various bank officials, including former Chief Executive Tim Sloan, were ""deliberately or recklessly false or misleading.""
According to shareholders, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo lost more than $54 billion of market value as the truth was gradually revealed over a two-year period ending in March 2020.
Woods also dismissed claims against current Chief Executive Charles Scharf, saying he was not culpable for the challenged claims.
The scandals prompted Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc to shed nearly all of its 10% stake in the bank.
""We will continue to vigorously defend the litigation and strongly disagree with the claims,"" Wells Fargo said in an email.
Sloan's lawyer Josh Cohen said in an email on Friday that his client's statements were truthful, and that Sloan ""worked tirelessly to bring Wells Fargo into compliance with consent orders and regulatory demands.""
The decision is a setback for Wells Fargo's rebound from revelations including that it opened about 3.5 million accounts without customer permission, and charged hundreds of thousands of borrowers for auto insurance they did not need.
Wells Fargo has paid more than $5 billion in fines, and the Fed's $1.95 trillion asset cap restricts the bank's growth.
Sloan stepped down abruptly as chief executive after 2-1/2 years in March 2019. One year later, Wells Fargo canceled a $15 million bonus for him.
In his 61-page decision, Woods did not decide whether bank officials intended to defraud shareholders.
But he said it would have been ""nearly impossible"" for Sloan to be unaware of the regulators' criticisms.
""Based on the facts on the ground, Mr. Sloan knew or, more importantly, should have known that he was misrepresenting material facts related to the corporation,"" Woods wrote.
The shareholders are led by the state of Rhode Island, and pension funds in Louisiana, Mississippi and Sweden.

Their lawyer Steven Toll said he was pleased they can sue over the ""vast majority of the alleged fraudulent statements.""
The case is In re Wells Fargo & Co Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-04494.

While antitrust enforcers have brought labor antitrust cases in the past, and the Trump Administration's Justice Department brought one against a no-poach agreement between rail equipment suppliers in 2018, they are rare.
""The division has become increasingly alert to and concerned by business conduct and transactions that harm competition for working people,"" said Richard Powers, acting head of the division, in a conference in New York.
Powers added that the coronavirus pandemic made the focus on labor even more critical. ""If it was important for enforcers to protect competition in labor markets decades ago, and I believe that it was, it is essential now,"" he said.

He called any violation of antitrust law to hold down wages ""just as irredeemable as agreements to fix product prices and allocate markets, conduct that the division has prosecuted for over 100 years."" Powers added that the division was investing ""substantial time and resources"" in labor markets.
Two of the most common targets of criticism in labor markets are no-poach agreements, in which companies agree not to hire each others' workers, and non-compete agreements, in which workers sign contracts pledging not to leave to work for a rival.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",Exclusive-GM aims to profit from software as it broadens its EV lineup,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) plans to position itself as a technology platform company that is as focused on software as it is on making electric vehicles when it meets with investors next week, including revealing a scheduled rollout for at least 20 EVs in the United States over the next several years. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said it will talk on Wednesday about its growth strategy, EV and software platform advantages, its self-driving vehicle business and the related financial road map as it seeks to draw new investors and a valuation closer to that of EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. A spokesman declined to disclose further details.
GM executives will provide a more detailed look at the company's plans to spend $35 billion through 2025 on EVs and autonomous vehicles, and will give revenue and profit margin growth targets for the five-year period after that, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified.
""GM's gone from an automaker to a platform company and here are all the things you can do with that,"" one of the sources said. 
""The question you should ask yourself is will we see doubling of revenues? Will we see margin expansion? Those are the sorts of things that you're going to see over a period of time,"" the person added. ""Stay tuned for pretty impressive numbers on revenue and margin expansion.""
GM's revenue last year was almost $122.5 billion.
The strategy of GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, who took the helm in 2014, so far has lifted the company's share price from a narrow band around its 2010 initial public offering price of $33 to almost double that at one point. The shares were trading at around $53 on Friday.
Next week's event is aimed at persuading investors to value GM (with a market capitalization of about $75 billion) more like Tesla ($762 billion). 
MORE EV PICKUPS COMING
Also on Wednesday, GM will reveal greater detail around its planned EV product launches beyond the upcoming GMC Hummer pickup, EV600 delivery van and Cadillac Lyriq crossover. That includes plans for electric versions https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-pickup-money-machine-gets-technology-tuneup-2021-09-09 of GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups in late 2022 and late 2023, respectively, according to the sources as well as an industry forecast provided by AutoForecast Solutions (AFS).
Part of the investor day will include outlining what percentage of GM's total vehicle sales will be EVs by 2030, the sources said. The automaker in January set a goal to sell all new light vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035.
When it comes to software, GM will discuss what its offerings allow it to do financially and how that will make the Detroit company's business less cyclical than auto companies have been historically, the sources said. 
Last week, GM introduced the branding for its software platform, Ultifi https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-evs/gms-barra-accelerates-all-out-pursuit-of-global-ev-leadership-idUSKBN27Z2QI - coming in 2023 - and discussed building an App store-like approach to making the platform open for developers. 
Software-oriented products and services are key to GM and other automakers sustaining profit margins during the transition to connected and electric vehicles, but that will compel companies to build skills and workforces they have lacked in the past.
GM also will explain how it will leverage its Ultium battery partnership with LG Energy Solutions (LGES), a unit of LG Chem, and how scaling up production of batteries will allow the company to cut costs, Ken Morris, GM vice president of EVs and AVs, said at a conference this week. ""We're really knitting together all elements of our growth strategy,"" he said.
GM will launch at least 20 new electric vehicles in the United States - mostly pickups, SUVs and crossovers - through early 2028, according to AFS, whose data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. 
More concrete details, including the timing, pricing and projected volumes of future EVs, could be critical in wooing investors as GM copes with the costly and damaging recall https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-recalling-73000-bolt-evs-cost-1-billion-halts-sales-2021-08-20 of the Chevy Bolt EV for battery-related fires. 
At the same time, competitors are ramping up their own EV initiatives, including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's announcement this week of an $11.4 billion blitz https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-sk-invest-114-bln-add-electric-f-150-plant-three-battery-factories-2021-09-27 with Korean battery partner SK Innovation.
While GM has laid out its EV lineup into late 2022, the following year is scheduled to feature the launches of at least five more, including the GMC Hummer SUV, Cadillac Celestiq sedan which is expected to sell for well over $100,000, and Chevy Blazer SUV, AFS said. 

After that, GM plans to introduce another five EV models in 2024, two in 2026, two in 2027 and another in 2028, AFS said. Among the future entries are all-electric editions of the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon SUVs, and a new Cadillac crossover called Symboliq.
GM intends to build many of its future EVs at five plants in North America: Orion Township and Detroit-Hamtramck in Michigan; Spring Hill, Tennessee; Ingersoll, Ontario, and Ramos Arizpe, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, AFS said.

Investing.com – Disney stock (NYSE:DIS)  rose 3.5% Friday as the entertainment giant settled a dispute with Scarlett Johansson over the release of Black Widow.
Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
Johansson had taken the company to court in July against its decision to stream the movie on Disney+ platform at the same time as its theatrical release, a move she said was in violation of the contract between the two parties. She claimed that the studio sacrificed the film’s box-office collections to boost its fledgling streaming service.  Disney  countered that Johansson was paid $20 million for the film.
The case was a much-watched one given the implications it had for everybody -- from studios to stars. As streaming has come to occupy its unshakeable place, studios are now confronted with timing their box-office releases and streaming rollouts.   
Black Widow earned $379 million at the worldwide box office to date, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  
While the company has to share about half of revenue from theater ticket sales, it keeps all of the revenue from its digital platform. Black Widow was the first Marvel film Disney released to theaters in more than two years.  
The movie began its international rollout on July 7, a Wednesday, while the U.S. preview happened the next day, a day before its release in the country. At that time, Disney claimed the online sales generated more than $60 million globally through its direct-to-consumer Disney+ Premier Access platform over Thursday to Sunday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A judge dismissed  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s challenge to a U.S. anti-kickback law that the drugmaker said prevents it from helping Medicare patients afford two drugs that treat a sometimes fatal heart condition, but which cost $225,000 a year.
In a Thursday night decision, U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil in Manhattan rejected Pfizer's request to offer two copay support programs for patients taking its Vyndaqel and Vyndamax drugs.
The judge said Pfizer's plan to offer direct payments to patients ran afoul of a federal ban on ""knowingly or willfully"" providing financial support to induce drug purchases, even absent corrupt intent.
She also called it premature to let New York-based Pfizer fund an independent charity to help with copays, saying the program had not undergone government review and its details were ""ill-defined and vague.""
Pfizer had sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in June 2020, seeking a court declaration that both programs were legal.
In an email on Friday, Pfizer said it was disappointed in the decision, and that copay assistance was ""an equitable way to lower out-of-pocket costs for this breakthrough treatment.""
Drugmakers cannot subsidize copayments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government-run healthcare program for older Americans, but may donate to independent nonprofits that offer copay assistance. 
The government argued that a ruling for Pfizer on the proposed direct assistance program could leave Medicare on the hook for ""astronomical"" drug prices industrywide.
Also known as tafamidis, Vyndaqel and Vyndamax treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, a rare condition that causes the heart to stiffen, impedes blood flow and can lead to progressive heart failure.
Sales of the drugs totaled $953 million in the first half of this year. A February 2020 study https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.045093 by the American Heart Association called tafamidis the most expensive cardiovascular drug launched in the United States.

Pfizer agreed in 2018 to pay $23.85 million and enter a corporate integrity agreement to resolve U.S. civil charges it used a purportedly independent charity to cover copayments for three other drugs.
The case is Pfizer Inc v U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-04920.

""This (more recent) cartel's practices have been particularly damaging since, in some cases, the effects of the fraud have lasted until 2040 due to the duration of some of the contracts,"" the watchdog said in a statement. 
Fines totalling 483,000 euros were handed out to 10 executives from the companies, CNMC added. 

ACS subsidiary Cobra received the largest fine of 30 million euros, followed by Nokia, which must pay 24 million euros. Siemens and its Siemens Rail subsidiary were fined a combined 28.9 million euros.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Spain to negotiate with China's Great Wall Motor to take over Nissan plant,"By Joan Faus
BARCELONA (Reuters) -Spanish authorities and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) will enter talks with China's Great Wall Motor over a possible takeover of the Japanese carmaker's plant in Barcelona, which is due to shut in December, they said on Friday.
National and regional authorities, together with Nissan, also picked Spanish electric motorcycle manufacturer Silence and local engineering firm QEV Technologies - which leads an electric vehicle production hub integrated by Swedish manufacturers Inzile and Volta - to negotiate the fate of two smaller plants.
Nissan's three Barcelona plants employ around 3,000 people directly and 20,000 indirectly. 
But only 1,600 direct jobs are at stake since the rest of the workers will benefit from early retirement and other measures, a CGT union source told Reuters. 
The source said Great Wall was interested in the larger plant and would study whether it might have use for the other two, while Silence and QEV Technologies are only interested in the smaller factories. 
""We are convinced we will be able to find solutions that are beneficial to everyone,"" Nissan's industrial head in Spain, Frank Torres, said in a statement. 
In a severe blow to Spain, Europe's second-largest car producer, Nissan announced last year it would shut its three factories as part of a global restructuring.
It initially said the plants would close by December 2020 but later pushed the date back a year, as it started looking for an alternative industrial project with authorities. 

Great Wall Motor has not made public its plan for the factories, but a source with knowledge of the talks said it could keep around 1,300 jobs.
A project presented by Belgian carmaker Punch for Nissan's plants has been left out of the upcoming negotiations, although officials said no option was fully excluded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Global technology firm Foxconn and startup Lordstown Motors Corp said on Friday they plan to pursue a U.S. Energy Department loan from a program to help pay for the costs of retooling a factory to build electric trucks.
Foxconn agreed in principle to buy a Lordstown assembly plant in northeast Ohio for $230 million and take over production of a new pickup truck, the companies said on Thursday. In January, Lordstown said it was in advanced talks with the department for a retooling loan.
Under the in-principle agreement, the Taiwanese tech giant, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, will manufacture Lordstown Motors’ Endurance full-size pickup truck at its Lordstown facility, and it will also support start-up automaker Fisker Inc, a Foxconn partner and customer.
Lordstown shares were down 12.5% in early trading on Friday.
Lordstown told Reuters in January 2020 it was pursuing a $200 million loan from the program and it formally applied in May 2020. The Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program, which previously awarded loans to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) to retool factories, has not made any new loans since 2011.
Lordstown and Foxconn said in a filing they will each ""seek a proportionate amount of the ATVM Loan and will be responsible for a proportionate amount of any and all expenses incurred in obtaining the ATVM Loan.""
The companies hope to complete a purchase agreement by Oct. 31 and complete the deal by April 30.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, best known for assembling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone, will invest $50 million in Lordstown equity. Lordstown Motors plans to enter into a long-term lease for a portion of the existing facility for its Ohio-based employees, and Foxconn plans to offer employment to many Lordstown employees.
Lordstown, which has struggled to launch production of its Endurance pickup, had previously said it was in talks to build vehicles for other automakers or lease space in its factory. It currently uses only 20% of the plant's 6.2 million square feet.

(Reuters) -Four large pharmacy chains are set to face their first trial over the deadly U.S. opioid epidemic, creating new pressure to reach settlements with state and local governments who accuse them of contributing to the public health crisis.
The Ohio counties of Lake and Trumbull allege that oversight failures at pharmacies run by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Giant Eagle Inc led to excessive amounts of opioid pills in their communities.
Lawyers for the counties and companies are set to deliver opening statements on Monday to a federal jury in Cleveland, where thousands of similar lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, drug distributors and pharmacies are pending.
More than 3,300 cases have been brought largely by state and local governments seeking to hold the companies responsible for an opioid abuse epidemic that U.S. government data shows led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2019.
Should a jury find the companies liable, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster will later determine how much they must pay to abate, or address, the epidemic in the communities.
Lawyers for the local governments have said the pharmacy chains are among their next targets for settlement.
Polster, who oversees most of the opioid lawsuits, on Tuesday renewed his long-running push https://www.reuters.com/article/us-opioids-litigation-judge/judges-unorthodox-approach-has-huge-opioid-settlement-within-reach-idUSKBN1WX1AT for a global settlement by the companies. ""Use this trial as an opportunity to engage in the kind of meaningful discussions that have not happened over the last couple of years, all right?"" he said.
At trial, the two counties are expected to argue the pharmacies created a public nuisance by failing to identify red flags and ensure prescriptions were valid, causing an oversupply of pills, overdoses and deaths.
""The national chain pharmacies in our case refused to give their pharmacists the necessary tools and opportunities to follow the law and stop the diversion and improper sale of opiates,"" said Mark Lanier, the counties' lawyer.
The companies deny wrongdoing, saying criminals were more likely to obtain opioids illegally from other sources, including pill mills, crooked doctors and drug traffickers.
""Opioid prescriptions are written by doctors, not pharmacists,"" CVS said in a statement. ""Our pharmacies fill legitimate prescriptions written by licensed doctors.""
Walgreens said it took ""great pride in the judgment of our pharmacy professionals,"" and Giant Eagle said regulators who inspected its pharmacies in the two counties found it complied with the law. Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.
The trial comes after the three largest U.S. distributors that supply pharmacies - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp - and the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in July proposed paying up to $26 billion to settle cases against them.
A bankruptcy judge in August approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its wealthy Sackler family owners that the company values at more than $10 billion.

The pharmacy chains in the Ohio case have only settled one case nationally. Ahead of a trial in New York, they and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp agreed pay $26 million to settle with two counties.
Rite Aid settled pre-trial in Ohio and agreed to pay Trumbull at least $1.5 million. Lake County has not disclosed its recovery.

Investing.com – General Motors stock (NYSE:GM) fell 0.8% Friday as supply chain issues continued to drag its third-quarter delivery volumes by around a third.
The company said dealers delivered 446,997 vehicles in the U.S. in the third quarter, down 218,195 units from a year ago as semiconductor supply chain disruptions and historically low inventories hurt sales.
Covid-related supply chain disruptions in Malaysia were behind the drop, according to the company.
From America's GM to Germany's Volkswagen (OTC:VWAPY) to Japan's  Toyota  (NYSE:TM), the shortage of semiconductors has hurt every automaker in the world with varying degrees. The pandemic has kept factories in China, Vietnam, Malaysia and the rest of southeast Asia shut for extended periods, crippling production and choking supply chains. Many have been forced to cut their annual production and revenue targets.    
The company said dealer inventory, including in-transit units, was 128,757 units at the end of September, with availability projected to improve during the ongoing quarter.
As of this week, GM said all of its full-size pickup, full-size SUV and midsize pickup truck plants in North America are operating.
Lansing Delta Township Assembly in Michigan, which builds the Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse, and Lansing Grand River Assembly, which builds the Cadillac CT4, CT5 and Chevrolet Camaro, will resume regular production starting Monday, the company said.
GM said its financial outlook is still expected to be within the calendar year guidance range as it continues to make efforts to mitigate the effects of the semiconductor shortage and Chevrolet Bolt EV recall.
The company expects its full-year profit per share to be between $5.40 and $6.40 on a profit of $7.7 billion-$9.2 billion."
1366,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 11:02AM ET</span>",News Corp Australia tweaks climate targets amid scrutiny of editorial line,"By Helen Coster and Byron Kaye
NEW YORK/SYDNEY(Reuters) - The Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) has set new environmental targets, an internal email showed, shoring up employee engagement with climate issues as it prepares an editorial campaign calling for curbs on carbon emissions.
The new goals, which have not been formally announced, are incremental to previous targets for News Corp's Australian unit, but reflect a company polishing up its green credentials inside and out in a market where it has experienced fierce criticism of its coverage of climate-related issues.
""News Corp Australia has indeed been continuously reducing carbon emissions over the past 5 years, averaging 7.4% reduction a year over that time,"" a News Corp Australia spokesman said in an email.
With that success, he said, ""we have now set new and ambitious targets we are confident are meaningful and achievable."" 
After some commentators at News Corp and Fox News, which is owned by Murdoch-controlled Fox Corp, questioned the role of global warming in Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020, Murdoch's son James quit the News Corp board citing editorial differences, while other staff in the country went public with complaints about its climate coverage.
Australia operations were responsible for 62% of News Corp's carbon emissions globally in the 2020 financial year, according to News Corp's ""carbon footprint"" report, which said that emissions for News Corp had declined 7% since the year before.
""We are re-imagining and re-powering our 1 Degree environmental program and inviting all at News Corp Australia to get involved,"" said the Sept. 27 email, seen by Reuters, referring to a 2007 company campaign to raise awareness of sustainability practices.
The new goals ""align with the targets agreed to by our News Corp colleagues around the world"", added the email to the company's 8,000 Australian staff that was signed by country CEO Michael Miller and community ambassador Penny Fowler.
The new measures, as described in the email, appear to mirror goals already established by News Corp globally, while updating environmental goals that were last set out by the Australian unit in 2017.
One goal already established by the parent company but new for News Corp Australia, according to the email, is to cut emissions in the company's supply chain by 20% by 2030. Another is to achieve zero waste to landfill across its major sites by 2025, with a special focus on reducing single-use plastic.
The email also establishes a timeline for News Corp Australia to source 100% of newsprint from certified material - by 2025 - and for reducing the company's carbon footprint by 60% by 2030.

The Australian unit is meanwhile planning a public editorial campaign to coincide with the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this month to ""inform Australians about the key environmental and climate issues"", according a report in the Australian.
The editorial campaign would push for Australia to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, in line with a previously stated News Corp goal, and would mostly take place in its main metro tabloids like Sydney's Daily Telegraph and Melbourne's Herald Sun, according to media reports.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Santa's sleigh is coming out of its garage a little earlier this year.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT), Pottery Barn, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), Gap and PacSun are among retailers promoting holiday decor and gifts as early as mid-September amid a global supply-chain logjam that threatens to limit availability of some merchandise later during the holiday season.
Americans are expected to spend about $1.3 trillion this holiday season, a 7% to 9% increase over last year, according to Deloitte. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, generally marks the start of the season in the United States, although major retailers typically start advertising holiday merchandise in early November. 
This year, they face shipping snarls and other logistics challenges that could leave them unable to meet consumer demand during the fourth quarter if people wait until the last minute to make gift purchases. Target is launching holiday promotions between Oct. 10 and 12, compared to Oct. 13 last year. 
“We think advertisers will start advertising very soon to persuade consumers"" to buy Christmas gifts and merchandise, said Jed Meyer, senior vice president media domain leader at data analytics firm Kantar. 
""That's compounded by the fact that there's a lot of anticipation that there may be delivery delays from online shopping, especially ... close to the holidays.""
Pottery Barn's Instagram posts as of Sept. 17 feature $250 Christmas wreaths. It is pushing out holiday messages several days earlier than in 2020, and more than a month earlier than in 2019. The company was unavailable to comment on the timing of its holiday advertising. 
Gap is previewing its gift guides in October in hopes of prodding shoppers to begin making purchases before the holiday gift-giving scramble.

“With the pandemic’s continued and evolving impact on retail, we’re giving customers the ability to start their holiday shopping early to help ease the holiday rush,” said Mary Alderete, global head of Gap marketing.
PacSun, which began planning for the holidays about four weeks earlier this year, will hold its pre-holiday digital campaign events in mid-October, similar to its timing in 2020, President Brieane Olson said.

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s recent privacy changes for iPhones are signs it may look to tap into an internet advertising market dominated by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said.
Since an April software update, most iPhones have allowed users to decide which apps can track user activity - crucial information that helps companies like Facebook deliver tailored ads to users and measure their impact.
The feature, which Apple calls App Tracking Transparency (ATT), has worried many digital advertising and mobile gaming companies including Facebook, which says it has made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on its platforms.
""We view (the privacy changes) as a sign that Apple may want to compete in global advertising,"" RBC analyst Brad Erickson said in a client note late Thursday, while starting coverage of Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with ""outperform"" ratings. 
Erickson is rated four stars for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on internet companies and recommendations, according to Refinitiv data.
""(Apple) can use data privacy as cover while it invests in a search algorithm behind the scenes,"" Erickson said, referring to potential advertising revenue from a Google-like search engine.
If advertisers had ""no choice but to fly blind with the loss of signal from Apple,"" Google-owned YouTube and Amazon's Connected TV could benefit as advertisers' next best alternatives, Erickson said.

Evercore ISI analysts also pointed to Apple's possible advertising ambitions in August, saying ""hampering third-party advertising"" would give it a successful start in advertising. Still, they noted that ATT was meant for user privacy rather than monetization.
Apple, Facebook and Alphabet did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Billions of people use Google because it's the best, not because of deals the company made to stay competitive, Google's lawyer said on Friday, wrapping up a week of testimony as the U.S. tech giant fights a record $5 billion antitrust fine.
The European Commission hit Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google with a 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) fine in 2018 for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet searching from 2011. 
At issue are deals requiring phone makers to pre-install the Google Search app and the Chrome browser app together with Google Play, as well deals blocking some variants of Android.
""The reason why billions of people choose Google as their search tool every day is not because of an abuse of dominance. It's because it's the best,"" lawyer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Pickford told the EU's General Court, the bloc's second highest.
Pickford said the deals were far from being anti-competitive tools, rather they were to ensure Google stayed competitive.
""You can still compete hard and compete on the merits. Consumers aren't stupid. If Bing or another search engine were better than Google, people would turn to it,"" he said, referring to a rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) search engine.
""Successful companies don't stay successful by resting on their laurels and failing to compete,"" Pickford told the court.
The European Commission's lawyer, Nicholas Khan, said the deals showed that Google had stacked the odds in its favour and urged judges to uphold the Commission's decision and fine.
""Google gives itself the laurel wreath even before the race has started,"" Khan said. ""The scale of the practices entirely justify the fine that was imposed.""

It was not clear when there will be a verdict in the case, which is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) shareholders on Friday voted in favour of spinning off the company's truck division Daimler Truck Holdings AG, with shares in the new company to start trading in December. 
Daimler Trucks & Buses is set to become the world's largest truckmaker after the spinoff is complete. 
Shareholders representing 56.45% of Daimler's capital took part in the vote at an extraordinary shareholder meeting, with 99.9% voting in favour.
""Until now we've had to orient ourselves to the route taken by our car colleagues. In the future we can plan our own route and choose the path that is ideal for us,"" Daimler Trucks CEO Martin Daum said at the meeting.
Daimler shareholders will receive one share of Daimler Trucks for every two Daimler shares they own. Daimler will keep a 35% stake in Daimler Trucks, and provide it with a net liquidity of 5 billion euros until the end of the year.
Spin-offs have been a prominent way for large corporations to unlock value and respond to investors demanding a sharper business model. 
The luxury carmaker, to be renamed Mercedes-Benz Group AG from next February to reflect its focus on the car and van business, expects the spun-off truckmaker to join it on the DAX listing of Germany's 40 largest firms in the first quarter of 2022, it said on Friday. 
Daimler Trucks reported an 8.2% profit margin in the second quarter of this year, a recovery to pre-pandemic levels but still below competitors like Traton's Scania and Volvo Group's Volvo Trucks.
Prior to the pandemic the business turned over approximately 40 billion euros ($46.33 billion) in annual revenue with profits of around 2 billion. 

The truckmaker will focus on developing its high-margin heavy truck business, CEO Daum has said, and is betting on a mix of battery-electric and hydrogen vehicles to reach its goal of CO2 neutral production by 2039.
It expects an annual return on sales of between 6-7% in 2021 rising to 8-9% in a stronger market environment, Daum said, below Daimler's expected return for its car and van business of 8-10%.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, reversing overnight losses in futures after potentially game-changing news on the pandemic front from U.S. pharma giant Merck. 
Merck announced encouraging early results from a small-scale trial of a antiviral pill to treat Covid-19, which showed a clear drop in the rate of severe illness among those taking it. If the drug is found to be both safe and effective, it could radically change the outlook for building humanity's defenses against the disease. 
Such considerations ensured that the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 149 points, or 0.4%, higher in the first few minutes of trading, while the S&P 500 rose 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite, which habitually underperforms on news supporting the reopening of pandemic-stricken economies, fell 0.2%. 
All three indices had been clearly lower in premarket trading before Merck's news broke.
Merck stock rose 7.8% on the news. Before the news, it had been down around some 10% since the start of the pandemic, underperforming rivals such as  Moderna  and  Pfizer  who had successfully brought to market a new generation of messenger RNA-based vaccines.
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was down 9.8% on the news, while BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock was down 11% and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) stock down 2.2%.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock fell 17%, while AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) ADRs fell 1.2%.
The news also gave wings to other sectors typically sensitive to social distancing and lockdown measures. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 5.2% while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 5.8% and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock rose 3.7%.  Hotel operators Hyatt (NYSE:H) and Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) each rose 3.8%, and cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) both rose around 4%. Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 3.6%.
Elsewhere, Jefferies  (NYSE:JEF) stock rose 1.9% after reporting earnings that nearly doubled in the latest quarter due to the boom in merger and acquisition activity in the U.S. 
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock rose 0.6% and Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) stock rose 0.5% as the two companies abandoned plans to combine. 
Earlier, a week full of economic data had ended on an upbeat note, with both the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing survey and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment coming in ahead of expectations. The ISM study in particular remains indicative of a strong expansion, with an index at a four-month high of 61.1. Personal income and spending data, released earlier showed incomes nearly flatlining in August, but spending still running ahead of expectations with a monthly gain of 0.8%. 
Price data for personal consumer expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, didn't change expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin phasing out its bond purchases in November. Minnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari, a noted inflation 'dove' said on Thursday said he was comfortable with such a timeline, suggesting that there is no resistance among policymakers to such a move."

By (8:45 AM ET 1345 GMT),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was down 4.9%, while BioNTech stock was down 5.3% and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock was down 1.9%.  Pfizer has traditionally been the least price-sensitive to vaccine news because it has many other revenue sources, whereas the other two are, for the present at least, pure plays on Covid-19 treatments. 
Merck (NYSE:MRK) had said earlier that an early-stage trial of its experimental pill had led to clear reductions in hospitalizations among the sample group, all of whom had taken it after developing moderate symptoms of Covid-19. 
The study was stopped early, as is often the case when an experimental drug shows signs of efficacy.
Scientists have searched feverishly for a Covid-19 remedy that can be manufactured, distributed and administered at massive scale without arousing the suspicions and mistrust that often accompany new vaccines. Such a pill could transform the vaccination status of many poorer countries, where Covid-19 is still spreading more or less unimpeded due to the lack of vaccines in the developing world.

Investing.com – Merck stock (NYSE:MRK) climbed more than 7% in Friday’s premarket trading after the company said trials of a drug it is developing against Covid showed reduced risks of hospitalization and deaths.
If approved, molnupiravir, the drug, could be the world’s first oral antiviral medicine for Covid, the company said in a note. Merck plans to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. as soon as possible.
The company said the drug demonstrated consistent efficacy across viral variants Gamma, Mu and Delta, the most infectious of the lot.
The company is jointly developing the drug with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.
The drug was administered to 775 patients in a phase-3 trial and at the time of the decision to stop the recruitment based on the interim efficacy results, the company said the trial was approaching full recruitment of the phase 3 sample size of 1,550 patients.
Eligibility criteria required that all patients had laboratory-confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, with symptom onset within 5 days of study randomization. All patients were required to have at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcome at study entry
Merck expects to produce 10 million courses of treatment by the end of 2021, with more doses expected to be produced in 2022. It will supply approximately 1.7 million courses to the U.S. government under an existing agreement, assuming all the approvals are in place."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A global scheme designed to ensure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines will this month for the first time distribute shots only to countries with the lowest levels of coverage, the World Health Organization said.
Co-led by the WHO, COVAX has since January largely allocated doses proportionally among its 140-plus beneficiary states according to population size.
This made some richer nations that had already secured vaccines through separate deals with pharmaceutical firms eligible for COVAX doses alongside countries with no supplies at all.
With some nations administering booster shots while others are still giving first jabs to the most vulnerable, the WHO has now tweaked the rules.
""For the October supply we designed a different methodology, only covering participants with low sources of supply,"" Mariangela Simao, WHO Assistant Director General for Access to Vaccines, said in a recording of a conference presentation last week posted on the WHO's website.
The change comes 15 months after the launch of the COVAX programme and as WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus seeks renomination. 
Slides from Simao's presentation showed that, of the more than 90 poorer nations served by COVAX, about half had immunised less than 20% of their populations and 26 less than 10%. Many wealthy nations reached 70% coverage during the northern hemisphere summer.
About 75 million doses of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Sinopharm vaccines will be distributed in October to 49 countries considered among the least covered, the slides showed, without indicating the recipient nations.
Alfred Driwale, Program Manager at the Uganda National Expanded Program on Immunizations, told Reuters that the new methodology was welcome but should have been adopted at the start of the program.
The Pan American Health Organization's (PAHO) assistant director, Jarbas Barbosa, called the switch good news.

However, subsequent rounds of allocations this year are expected to be conducted under different criteria, the slides also showed.
COVAX has so far overseen the allotment of over 500 million shots, of which about 300 million have been shipped to recipient countries.

The deal cuts Coty's stake in Wella to around 30.6%, valued at about $1.38 billion. The CoverGirl cosmetics maker sold a 60% stake to KKR for about $2.5 billion in December last year, with its remaining 40% stake valued at $1.3 billion at the time.
Coty said the value of Wella has increased since the closing of the majority stake sale, as reopening of salons across the globe has sparked a recovery in the business.

The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of Coty's fiscal 2022, will also help the Gucci fragrance maker simplify its capital structure and save $52 million annually, while also boosting its profits.
KKR's ownership in the Hugo Boss fragrance maker would reduce to the equivalent of about 45 million Coty Class A shares, representing a stake of about 5.2%.

Investing.com – Jefferies stock (NYSE:JEF) traded 1.6% higher in Friday’s premarket as high momentum in the investment banking business drove the company’s third-quarter results well past estimates.
It has been a boom time for investment bankers as the pandemic-fueled craze for deal-making and fund-raising has meant big business in fees for industry professionals, a large part of which came Jefferies’ way.
With an expanded roster of 1,200 investment bankers, the bank arranged 424 separate transactions for 407 different clients with an aggregate deal value of $238 billion in the third quarter.
The average value per transaction touched an all-time high and was 48% higher than the same period a year ago.
As a result, revenue from investment banking doubled to $1.18 billion and was more than 70% of the total net revenue. The company started the current quarter with an investment banking order pipeline at a record high.
Third-quarter net revenue rose 19% to $1.65 billion. Profit per share almost doubled to $1.5.

The complaint, filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, said Hidalgo Mining Corp raised $10.35 million from investors to finance a silver mine in Mexico that began production around 2012 and stopped in 2014. 
Silver prices averaged around $31 an ounce in 2012 and $19 an ounce in 2014. 
JPMorgan declined to comment. 
Hidalgo's claim, seen by Reuters, uses as evidence information from an investigation by U.S. regulators which found that JPMorgan staff between 2008 and 2016 sent fake buy and sell orders into metals and Treasuries markets to move prices in their favour. 
Traders say this technique, known as spoofing, is a short term trading tactic rather than a means of long-term price suppression.

JPMorgan last year agreed to pay more than $920 million to settle the investigation. 
The bank also paid $15.7 million last week to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors who said the manipulation had caused them losses.

(Reuters) - A slump in  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc's share price likely limited its ability to sweeten a nearly $15 billion all-stock offer for call center software firm Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) and led to the deal's collapse, Wall Street analysts said on Friday.
Five9 shareholders on Thursday voted down the sale to Zoom, denting the company's efforts to diversify its offerings as growth slows in its virtual conferencing business after a boom during the pandemic.
While some analysts expected Zoom to raise its offer to address Five9 shareholder worries about the price, others said an almost 30% drop in Zoom shares since July on the back of slowing growth only dampened the prospects.
Under the deal terms, Five9 shareholders would have received 0.5533 Zoom share for each share held. The terms then implied a 12.8% premium over Five9's market price.
""The deal was negatively perceived from the beginning given the small premium and all-stock structure,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Samad Samana said in a note to clients. ""ZM's stock declining 28% since the announcement only compounded the issues and likely made revising the terms difficult as well.""
The deal - which would have been Zoom's biggest-ever purchase if completed - was also opposed by shareholder proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis. The firms had recommended that Five9 shareholders vote against the deal, citing growth concerns and dual-class shares.
""While we think the deal made strategic sense for both companies over the long term, the variable deal tied to volatile (Zoom) shares was not an economically attractive deal for (Five9) shareholders at this time,"" Piper Sandler analysts said.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) blamed the fall in Zoom's share price and possible regulatory scrutiny for the deal falling through.
A U.S. Justice Department panel had been reviewing the deal over possible national security concerns, though analysts had said it was unlikely the deal would be scrapped as a result.
""(Our) conversations, especially with event-driven investors, suggest that they believe Five9 was important enough to Zoom that they would ultimately bump/sweeten the offer for Five9,"" J.P. Morgan analysts said.

""Obviously, the recent pullback in stock prices for premium valuation software stocks makes the current situation all the more complicated.""
Zoom's shares gained 1.6% to $265.79 in premarket trading, while Five9's stock was down about 3% at $155.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, starting the new month as the last one ended with investors fretting about high inflation and the potential early withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 115 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.3%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 30 points, or 0.2%.
The major indices ended September sharply lower, with the broad-based S&P 500 finishing the month down 4.8%, its worst month since March 2020. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively, their worst months of the year.
Investors have been worried about a variety of factors, including the fresh burst of Covid cases, Chinese regulatory headwinds, supply chain bottlenecks and fading fiscal stimulus.
But high among the concerns has been persistently high inflation, and the likely impact this has had on the timetable for the Federal Reserve 'tapering' its massive bond-buying program.
With that in mind, the focus Friday will be on the release of the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge of inflation, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). Minnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari - perhaps the biggest inflation 'dove' among the Fed's policymakers - said on Thursday he was comfortable with the idea of an imminent start to tapering.
PCE prices are expected to rise 0.2% in August and 3.6% year over year, unchanged on an annual basis from July, which was the highest level since May 1991.
Earlier Friday, Eurozone inflation hit a 13-year high in September, with CPI climbing to 3.4% year on year from 3% a month earlier, predominantly on a surge in energy costs.
Also of note will be the release of the University of Michigan’s September data on consumer sentiment, at 10 AM ET, which is expected to stay close to August’s 71 number, a near-decade low.
In corporate news, Merck (NYSE:MRK) is likely to be in the spotlight after the drugmaker announced plans to seek emergency authorization for its oral antiviral treatment for Covid-19, after it showed “compelling results” in clinical trials. 
Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) will also be in focus after the video conferencing company called off its acquisition of Cloud-based customer-service software provider Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN).
Crude prices weakened Friday after Reuters reported that top producers may raise output by more than planned in November to counter current concerns about tight supply.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, are scheduled to meet on Monday, and could boost production beyond the 400,000 barrels per day already agreed for November and December given the backdrop of oil hovering near three-year highs.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $74.38 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.7% to $77.80.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,754.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1587.

Cathie Wood’s flagship, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), has almost certainly just recorded its biggest ever quarter of outflows, with about $1.97 billion leaving the popular exchange-traded fund through to late September.
ARKK flow data arrives with a one-day time lag, meaning the final trading day for last month has yet to be logged. Yet a second straight quarter of outflows for the fund looks assured, while anything less than a $125 million inflow will make September the product’s worst month for outflows since it launched in 2014.
Wood’s main fund and her firm Ark Investment Management attracted billions of dollars in the past year after her thematic tech-focused bets trounced the market in 2020. But Wood and Ark have struggled to maintain momentum amid concerns about lofty prices and accelerating inflation.

Investing.com – Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) traded 0.4% weaker in Friday’s premarket after the success of 'Squid Game' powered it to an all-time high of $619 in the previous session.
Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos revealed earlier this week that the Korean TV show is on track to become the most-watched original series of all time on the streaming platform. The show currently tops the rankings worldwide on Netflix.
The first season, launched two weeks ago, features 456 people who are deep in debt. They are lured into a life-threatening game which gives them a chance to win 45.6 billion Korean won ($39 million) if they win a series of six games. They die if they lose.
Squid Game’s success comes at a time when competition is intensifying. The likes of  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) are ramping up their own offerings while striking new alliances for greater geographical reach.
Netflix had said in its latest quarterly update that it expected new shows to be able to address concerns of viewer fatigue after a year when user engagement has soared due to binge-watching by locked-down consumers.

Investing.com – Zoom Video stock (NASDAQ:ZM) traded 0.4% lower in Friday’s premarket as the company called off its acquisition of Cloud-based customer-service software provider Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN).
A rejection of the merger between the two companies by Five9’s shareholders forced Zoom to take the decision. The joint proposal did not receive the requisite number of votes from Five9 shareholders.
Zoom’s July 18 all-stock offer had valued Five9 at $13.56 billion. Zoom shares have lost around a third of their value since the offer was made and are trading not far from their 52-week low of $255.25.
Each Five9 share was then valued at $200.28. They traded 0.4% higher in today’s premarket, having lost around 16% of their value since the Zoom offer was made.
The acquisition was expected to enhance Zoom’s presence with enterprise customers and help the video chat service target the $24 billion contact center market.
Zoom, one of the biggest winners of the pandemic thanks to the breakneck-speed mass adoption of video-conferencing, was looking to take advantage of its rocketing stock value to expand beyond its core product. With the share price erosion and the merger rejected, Zoom now faces a calmer and arguably more challenging business environment as people return to their offices.  
While the deal went through its regulatory checks,a Justice Department-led panel known as Team Telecom was reviewing the deal with an eye on national security risks, something that threatened to delay the merger further. 
Zoom has regularly cited its Silicon Valley headquarters and the U.S. citizenship of its China-born Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan as proof of its U.S. base. However, its reliance on servers in China have been identified as a possible security weakness.

In China, the world's biggest car market, Hongqi's sales have grown in recent years thanks to the launch of more models and an expanded sales network.

Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that a panel of ministers accepted a proposal from officials recommending salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Sons ahead of an offer from Ajay Singh, promoter of India's airline operator Spicejet Ltd.
""Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect,"" the ministry said in a tweet. ""Media will be informed of the Government decision as and when it is taken.""
Air India and Tata Sons declined to comment.
Earlier this month the finance ministry said it had received bids for the airline, but did not name the bidders. 
A possible sale would come at a time the airline industry is trying to recover from the slump in travel caused by restrictions aimed at containing the coronavirus pandemic.
This would also be seen as a relief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has been pushing to sell its entire interest in the loss-making airline.
The winning bidder would win control of Air India's 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas, including London's Heathrow Airport.
It would also get 100% of the low-cost arm Air India Express and 50% of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports. 

The government loses nearly 200 million rupees every day to run the national carrier, which has accumulated losses of over 700 billion rupees ($9.53 billion), officials have said.
An effort to auction a majority stake almost three years ago drew no bids, forcing the government to ease the terms. It had also extended the deadline multiple times during the pandemic.

""To strengthen the development of Orange Bank, Orange is continuing to invest in its bank"", Orange said in a statement.
Reuters reported in early March that Orange was looking for a new investor in its banking unit.
Orange CEO Stephane Richard said in April that this quest for a new investor did not mean the group wanted to sell its banking unit, adding that the telecoms company would continue ""on its own"" in this venture if Groupama wanted to exit and if it did not find another partner.
French media reported over the summer that BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) were interested in buying a stake but that Orange put an end to the discussions, deeming the banks' demands were too high.
Orange will now own 100% of its banking unit. It did not say how much it paid Groupama for its stake.

It also said that Orange Bank, which was launched four years ago and now has 1.6 million customers in France and in Spain, would ""significantly"" reduce its losses in 2021, partly thanks to an increase in its net banking income, up 57% in the first half of 2021 versus the same period in 2020.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -SoftBank-backed Indian hotel aggregator Oyo Hotels is seeking a valuation of $10 billion to $12 billion, a source close to the matter told Reuters, as it filed for a local listing that could be the first for a hospitality firm since 2019. 
The aggregator, which Japanese conglomerate SoftBank counts among its biggest bets, had hinted at an initial public offering (IPO) in 2019 shortly before the pandemic battered the travel industry. 
The IPO comes as travel restrictions are being eased worldwide and the tourism sector sees a rebound, with stuck-at-home people heading out on vacations.
The offering will consist of a fresh issue of shares of up to 70 billion rupees ($942.8 million) and an offer for sale of as much as 14.30 billion rupees, according to a copy of its draft red herring prospectus dated Sept. 30.
The hotel-booking startup, officially known as Oravel Stays, said in the IPO document that it incurred net losses every year since incorporation, and that its ability to achieve profitability may be delayed due to the economic fallout from the pandemic. 
The company's net losses, however, narrowed to 33.82 billion rupees for the year ended March 2021, from 105.86 billion rupees in 2020.
Oyo's offer for sale comprises equity shares aggregating up to 13.29 billion rupees by SVF India Holdings, a firm incorporated in Cayman Islands to hold the investments on behalf of SoftBank Vision Fund L.P.
Oyo, launched in 2013 by Ritesh Agarwal, is the latest among a clutch of tech-focussed companies to tap a booming Indian IPO market, which has seen about 30 firms seeking a market listing this year including food delivery player Zomato, Ant Group-backed Paytm and TPG-backed e-commerce beauty firm Nykaa.
The offering comes at a time when Oyo is facing a legal tussle with rival Zostel over a deal between the two Indian hospitality startups that fell apart six years ago.

JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Kotak Mahindra Capital and Citi are among the lead book-running managers for the IPO.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 03:41AM ET</span>","Celebrity Instagram content linked to negative feelings, Facebook researchers say","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Major social media stars including Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber and Charli D'Amelio are among celebrities whose Instagram followers experience more negative feelings about their self-image, according to internal Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) research revealed by the Wall Street Journal this week, raising questions about the impact of celebrity culture online.
The Journal released the leaked research slide decks on Wednesday, which served as the basis of articles it published earlier this month saying that Facebook knew its apps harmed the mental health of some teenage girls and young users. 
The research, titled ""Social comparison on Instagram,"" surveyed 100,000 people in March and April 2020 in nine countries, including the United States, Australia and Brazil. 
Facebook spokesperson Kevin McAlister said the survey respondents were not asked to name specific accounts, but researchers found the celebrity accounts were ""some of the most frequently seen accounts for people who told us they experienced either higher or lower levels of negative social comparison on Instagram,"" based on the company's internal data. 
He noted the findings made sense because the celebrities listed have more than 30 million followers each.
Facebook researchers did not study whether users' exposure to those celebrity accounts led to negative feelings about themselves.
Singer Ariana Grande and model Kendall Jenner were among the celebrities who followers felt more negative social comparison, Facebook researchers found. 
Facebook researchers noted in the slide decks that the company could partner with the stars on campaigns to reduce negative comparison.
On the other hand, Instagram accounts belonging to ""The Ellen Show,"" which is hosted by comedian Ellen DeGeneres, American actor Will Smith and Brazilian soccer player Neymar had followers who felt ""less negative comparison,"" according to the research slide deck.
The findings are notable given that Instagram helped pioneer the rise of social media influencers and made efforts to recruit celebrities to the app in its early days.
Actor Ashton Kutcher was one star who helped Instagram gain credibility with other celebrities and helped introduce the company to Grande, according to an anecdote reported in the book ""No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram.""
The company's partnerships team also works with celebrities, musicians and other public figures to improve their presence on Instagram, according to the LinkedIn bios of some employees.

The Facebook researchers found that seeing more celebrity content in the Instagram feed was associated with more negative comparison.
Almost half of the content people see on Instagram comes from celebrities, the research showed.

Investing.com --  Ao World  (LON:AO) stock fell as much as 20% in early trading on Friday after the electronics retailer warned that the huge boost in sales it has had from the pandemic is fading. 
After the opening plunge, they recovered a little to be down only 17% by 3:30 AM ET (0730 GMT).
AO World said sales in the six months through September rose only 6% on the year, and added that it expects the next six months to turn out much the same. 
The company had been one of the London market's biggest winners from the pandemic in 2020, as demand for household appliances skyrocketed due to the mass adoption of the working-from-home model. It's now given up more than half of its gains from 2020 trough to peak, but is still up more than 100% from the before the start of the pandemic.
As with many companies trying to see through the distortions of pandemic effects, AO World stressed the comparison with the first half of its last full pre-pandemic year, Compared with the six months through September 2019, revenue was up 66%.
Despite what it called a 'challenging' operational environment due to supply chain and other issues, AO World indicated it didn't expect product shortages in the key holiday period ahead.
""Whilst the macro-outlook remains uncertain, we have confidence in the proven resilience of our business model and are well placed to meet customer demand in our peak third quarter sales period,"" the company said.

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>",Morrisons' fate to be decided in $10 billion Saturday shootout,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - The outcome of a $10 billion six-month battle to buy British supermarket chain Morrisons will be decided in a one-day auction on Saturday overseen by the Takeover Panel.
The shoot out will pit U.S. private equity group Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (CD&R), whose 285 pence a share bid was recommended by Morrisons' board in August, against a consortium led by the Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) owned Fortress Investment Group.
CD&R is being advised by Terry Leahy, who was CEO of Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) for 14 years to 2011.
Bradford, northern England, based Morrisons started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899. It listed its shares in 1967 and is Britain's fourth-largest grocer after market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.
The battle for Morrisons is the most high-profile amid a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets.
The Takeover Panel, which governs M&A deals in the UK, moved to an auction process because neither suitor has declared their offers final.
The contest will consist of a maximum of five rounds.
In the first round, either suitor may increase their bid. If neither does, CD&R's existing agreed offer wins.
In the event of a higher bid in round one, the other suitor can raise their own bid in three subsequent rounds.
If there still isn't a winner, both offerors may make an increased bid in a fifth and final round.
To prevent a draw any fifth round offer by Fortress must be at an ""even"" number of pence, while CD&R must bid at an ""odd"" number of pence.
The panel will make a statement on Saturday once the auction has completed.
Morrisons has until Tuesday to make its recommendation, but could make a statement as early as Saturday after its board meets after the auction. 
Given that the board has previously agreed offers from both parties it is expected to recommend shareholders accept the highest bid at a shareholder meeting slated for Oct. 19.
Morrisons shares closed at 295 pence on Thursday, indicating investors expect a higher bid.
Both CD&R and Fortress have committed to retain Morrisons' Bradford headquarters and its existing management team led by CEO David Potts, execute its strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and to maintain staff pay rates. The commitments are not, however, legally binding.

A victory for CD&R would reunite Leahy with Potts and Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson, two of his closest lieutenants at Tesco.
Potts, who joined Tesco as a 16-year-old shelf-stacker, will make more than 10 million pounds from selling his Morrisons shares to the victor.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Friday, starting the fourth quarter on a weak note on concerns rising inflation will prompt central banks to withdraw stimulus just as growth slows.
At 3:25 AM ET (0725 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.8%.
These losses followed on from weakness in Asia earlier Friday, with the Nikkei index in Japan dropping more than 2%, while markets in Hong Kong and mainland China were closed, and on Wall Street overnight, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 500 points, or 1.6%.
The disappointing news continued Friday, as German retail sales rose 1.1% on the month in August, a rebound from the revised 4.5% drop the previous month but below the 1.5% increase expected.
In corporate news, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock fell 2.6% as shareholder vote on potentially spinning off its truck-making division from its Mercedes-Benz luxury car operations. A similar move by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), down 2.2%, two years ago has done little to unlock additional value in its truck business Traton.
U.K. retail stocks suffered more than most, as investors priced in the likely hit to consumer spending from a tightening of fiscal policy as the government withdraws many of its pandemic-era supports. AO World stock fell 17% after its half-year update showed sales growth slowing to a crawl, while fast fashion group  Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) fell 2.1% to an 18-month low and rival ASOS  (LON:ASOS) fell to a 16-month low. JD (NASDAQ:JD) Sports Fashion (LON:JD) stock fell 4.3%.
Global markets have been unnerved by persistently high inflation while growth appears to slow and central banks look to withdraw their accommodative monetary policies.
With that in mind, investors will focus on the release of key inflation data later Friday and the likely response from the European Central Bank as the region’s economy recovers from the pandemic. 
The September Eurozone CPI is due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), and is expected to show an annual rise of 3.3%, climbing from the 3.0% level in August. The figures will test the resolve of a European Central Bank that is still convinced that inflation will quickly fall back below its medium-term target of 2%.
Crude prices edged lower Friday as traders prepared for next week’s meeting of top producers and the potential for additional output to ease the current tight supply concerns.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, are scheduled to meet on Monday, and could boost production beyond the 400,000 barrels per day already agreed for November and December given the backdrop of oil hovering near three-year highs.
By 3:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $74.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $78.12.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,754.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1587.

Qantas will operate three weekly return flights between Sydney and London and three weekly return flights between Sydney and Los Angeles starting Nov. 14 and add more flights if there is enough demand, the airline said. 
Passengers will be required to quarantine at home for seven days upon arrival in Australia. The Australian government on Friday indicated that some of its eight states and territories would open earlier than others.
""We welcome the federal government's decision and the work by the New South Wales government to facilitate the home quarantine approach that makes this feasible,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. ""We look forward to other states and territories getting on board.""
New South Wales is home to Australia's most populous city, Sydney.
Qantas said it had already sold out some of its international flights for December and it had seen strong demand for London and Los Angeles.

The airline grounded its international fleet in March 2020 and has operated only freight and repatriation flights since, with the exception of a short-lived quarantine-free travel bubble with New Zealand. 
Rival Virgin Australia, which does far less international flying, did not announce any schedule changes but said it would continue to add flights as travel demand increased and restrictions eased.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said on Friday that ""human error"" caused metal contaminants to get into  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc COVID-19 vaccine doses, leading to a recall.
Takeda, which imports and distributes the vaccine in Japan, and Moderna said in a new report that a Spanish manufacturer discovered contaminants in some vials in July, but supplies from the same production were allowed to be shipped to Japan.
Japanese authorities in August suspended the use of three batches of Moderna shots containing 1.63 million doses after being notified of the contamination. Moderna conducted an investigation in partnership with Takeda and Spanish manufacturer Rovi, which operates the plant where the contamination occurred. 
The new report said that the problem stemmed from ""incorrect assembly and was due to human error specific to visually misjudging the required 1mm gap between the star-wheel and the stopper"" of machinery that put the tops on vaccine vials.
A total of five, sequential lots of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine manufactured at Rovi between June 27 and July 3 were investigated. The first three were shipped to Japan and later recalled after the discovery of particles, later determined to be stainless steel, inside 39 vials. 
But a fourth lot failed inspection after the discovery of particles on July 2, and a fifth lot was also held back by Rovi. The problems with Lots 4 and 5 were reported to Moderna, Takeda and Japan's health ministry, but the first three lots were released for use because they ""had passed inspection and were not considered to be impacted.""
In fact the incorrect set-up ""led to the issue persisting throughout the series of five batches,"" the investigation showed.

Improved operating procedures and the use of a new precision tool will help prevent the issue from recurring, the report said.
The companies and Japan's health ministry have said the particles of stainless steel did not pose any additional health risk.

Fuel prices have become a hot-button issue in Brazil as inflation soars. Recent CEOs of Petrobras have been forced out over price hikes. Petrobras shareholders remain wary of price controls, leading the government to seek other schemes to curb the cost to consumers.
Bolsonaro said a fund could be created using government proceeds from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known. The money could be used to potentially not pass on the cost of rising fuel prices to consumers.
""Seeing Petrobras' profits, those that come to the federal government...this billion-dollar profit - I'm asking, I'm not confirming it - can't we convert this and put it in a regulatory fund?"" Bolsonaro said during a weekly online live broadcast.

Brazil's lower house speaker, Arthur Lira, said on Wednesday that Congress was considering such a ""stabilization fund."" The fund could cushion fuel price fluctuations, while allowing Petrobras to maintain its market-based pricing policy, he said.
Bolsonaro repeated past statements that Congress should approve a bill that would fix ICMS fuel taxes that currently vary between states, another measure aimed at reducing pump prices.

BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - As Australian beef exports to China wither amid diplomatic tensions, demand there for U.S. grain-fed beef has soared, fuelled by the appetites of a growing Chinese middle class.
Hotpot restaurants, Japanese barbecue chains and steakhouses, all expanding in the world's No. 2 economy, are swapping out Australian beef for U.S. meat. Several Australian suppliers were banned last year and shipments from others take too long to clear customs.
Beef imports from the U.S. have grown to 83,000 tonnes in the first eight months of 2021, nine times the amount in the same period a year ago, according to Chinese customs data, and are set to be worth more than $1 billion this year. Australia also fell behind the United States this year as the top exporter of grain-fed beef to China.
""They don't have a lot of other options when it comes to the well-marbled, grain-fed product,"" said Joe Schuele, spokesman at the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). ""That's the product that really stands out in China.""
Deteriorating relations between Beijing and Canberra have hurt supplies from Australia. Five of its largest factories were suspended by Beijing last year for reasons such as poor labelling and contamination with a banned substance.
Though other plants are still allowed to ship to China, importers say they face long delays.
Beef imports from Australia in the first eight months fell to 96,000 tonnes, half of what they were in the same period last year, China customs data shows.
""We've been told it will take at least 85 days to clear,"" said a Beijing-based importer who has six containers of frozen Australian beef stuck in Shanghai port and has begun offering Tyson beef to his restaurant clients. 
That compares with about one week for meat from other origins. China's General Administration of Customs did not respond to a request for comment.
Sino-Australian ties have been strained since 2018 and worsened last year when Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, prompting trade reprisals from China.
GRAIN-FED DEMAND
Grass-fed beef, a premium product in other markets, typically goes to cheaper channels in China, such as mass-market restaurants and supermarkets.
Last year imports accounted for 40% of China's beef consumption, or about 2 million tonnes. Though supplies are dominated by low-cost grass-fed producers Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, demand from mass-market consumers is slowing amid a weaker economy.
China's mid- to high-end market - where grain-fed rules - continues to grow, however, as consumers ""trade up, eat better"", said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank.
China's middle class spent $7.3 trillion in 2020, more than any other country's, according to a report by U.S. research group Brookings, and is still growing, with young people accounting for more spending than in other countries.
New York chain Wolfgang's Steakhouse, which has two restaurants in Beijing, opened another in the southern city of Shenzhen this year and has plans for a fourth in Hangzhou.
The restaurant flies in chilled U.S. beef before ageing it. Its 800g rib-eyes cost $150 apiece.
""Young people like meat, especially 20- and 30-year-olds who come here on dates,"" said Glen Feng, manager of the Beijing outlets.

TRADE TIES
Even as China's beef demand has surged in recent years, driven by a growing middle class, politics have reshuffled the country's top importers.
Domestic production costs, meanwhile, make local supplies of grain-fed beef erratic, said Zhong Dingming, the manager of Jingli hotpot restaurant in Beijing. He said imported beef like the Tyson short ribs he buys offers better quality for a slightly higher price.
In last year's Phase 1 trade deal between Beijing and Washington, China agreed that U.S.-approved processing plants could access its market without Chinese inspections. 
The number of facilities allowed to ship to China has jumped to more than 500.
TREX Corp, a U.S. meat exporter owned by Greater Omaha Packing Co, is buying meat from other packers to ship to China as demand climbs, said Henry Davis, chief executive of Greater Omaha.
In China, USMEF has doubled the number of training events teaching local chefs how best to cut and slice, said Joel Haggard, senior vice president for the Asia Pacific. 
Value of U.S. beef exports to China https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-BEEF/lbvgngxjmpq/chart.png 
Shanghai-based retailer Swiss Butchery said it had stocked up on American beef as Australian supplies became less reliable. The store now sells American wagyu for 1,430 yuan ($221.87)per kilogramme, on occasion selling 10 kilogrammes at a time, said general manager Jaap Zuidervliet.
U.S. beef that meets China's import standards is in tight supply and the European Union is competing to buy the same meat, said Omaha's Davis.
And though Australia's beef exporters have turned to Japan and South Korea, a well-established reputation means customers in China could quickly return if things change.

""Australian beef still has a reputation for top quality and being natural. Long-term we're still really bullish on China,"" said Andrew Cox, general manager of international markets at trade body Meat and Livestock Australia.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 10:31PM ET</span>",Foreign automakers ask U.S. House Democrats to reject union EV tax credit,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 12 major foreign automakers, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co, urged U.S. House of Representatives Democrats to reject a proposed $4,500 tax incentive for U.S-made electric vehicles by union workers.
A House panel this month approved legislation to boost EV credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries.
The U.S. units of foreign automakers said in a letter sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats on Thursday that the proposal ""would unfairly disadvantage American workers who have chosen not to join a union and produce more than half of all vehicles in the United States and the vast majority of American-made EVs.""
Others signatories include Honda, BMW, Kia, Mazda,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz, Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) and Volvo Cars which is owned by Geely.
Late Thursday, six Democratic lawmakers who are co-chairs of the House labor caucus led by Representative Thomas Suozzi, urged Pelosi to retain the $4,500 incentive for union-built EVs.
""Every foreign-owned automotive manufacturer employs a union workforce in their home country, but those same companies consistently choose to invest in right-to-work states that are hostile to collective bargaining agreements,"" they wrote. 
United Auto Workers (UAW) President Ray Curry said Thursday by ensuring ""taxpayer funding goes to domestic auto and battery assembly, and to make sure that these jobs are good paying union scale jobs we protect our future.""
Curry added ""these jobs of the future that replace traditional engine jobs need to provide the same middle class wages and benefits that built our modern economy.""
The tax credits, which are part of proposed $3.5 trillion spending bill, would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years and disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV, the parent of Chrysler - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in UAW-represented plants.
The EV proposal also does away with phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible again, along with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, although Tesla would not receive the $4,500 credit.

Tesla and foreign automakers do not have unions representing assembly workers in the United States and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk suggested on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) this month the EV proposal was ""written by Ford/UAW lobbyists... Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers.""

The Chicago-based carrier said only 320 U.S.-based staff are now not in compliance with its COVID-19 vaccination policy, marking a 46% drop in the past two days.
Excluding those who have sought an exemption, United said 99.5% of U.S.-based employees now have been vaccinated against COVID-19.
United, which in early August became the first U.S. carrier to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all domestic employees, had asked for proof of vaccination by Monday or face termination. 

It later softened its position, saying workers could save their jobs if they chose to get vaccinated before their formal termination meetings.
Since Monday, more employees have provided a proof of vaccination, a company spokesperson said. The airline expects a further decline in the number of unvaccinated staff in coming days.

Merck said the move was a mutual decision, mostly due to disappointing lung cancer trial data, adding that no milestone payments were made by GSK and no future milestone obligations remain.
Merck KGaA said in January that a late-stage lung cancer study, which was testing bintrafusp alfa against U.S. namesake Merck & Co's bestseller Keytruda in a certain type of lung cancer was stopped early because the drug was unlikely to show the desired effect.
GSK was co-developing the drug with Merck under a 2019 agreement that could have seen it pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.5 billion) to the German company. 
Merck said it would end several remaining bintrafusp trials including on lung cancer, breast cancer and bladder cancer. One trial testing the drug against Cervical cancer would continue, it added.
Family-controlled Merck KGaA and Merck & Co Inc, known as MSD outside North America, share historic roots but have been under separate ownership since World War One.

Earnings growth in Merck's diversified business has recently been driven by biotech lab supplies, which have benefited from a scramble to ready treatments and vaccines against the coronavirus, offsetting sluggish drug revenue growth.

(Reuters) - U.S. senators on Thursday grilled  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on its plans to better protect young users on its apps, drawing on leaked internal research that showed the social media giant was aware of how its Instagram app harmed the mental health of teens.
The hearing in front of the Senate consumer protection subcommittee was called after the Wall Street Journal published several stories earlier this month about how Facebook knew Instagram caused some teen girls in particular to feel badly about their self-image. After growing opposition to the project, Facebook put plans for Instagram Kids, aimed at pre-teens, on hold this week.
Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, disputed the committee and WSJ's conclusions of the research documents throughout the hearing, and said the company was working to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings. 
""This research is a bombshell,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, during the hearing. ""It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings.""
""IG stands for Instagram, but it also stands for Insta-greed,"" said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts.
The senators pressed Davis on several major themes, including what identifiable data Facebook collects on users under the age of 13, to what extent the company views young users as a growth area and to confirm whether it knew that Instagram led some children to consider suicide.
Davis reiterated that kids under 13 were not allowed on Facebook, adding 0.5% of teens in the company's research connected their ""suicidal ideation"" to Instagram, lower than the figures the Journal had reported. 
""You've cherry-picked part of the research that you think helps your spin right now,"" said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, demanding Facebook commit to releasing its full research on the links between Instagram and youth suicide.

A second hearing is planned for Tuesday and will feature a Facebook whistleblower. The whistleblower is expected to reveal their identity on Sunday in a recorded interview for TV news program ""60 Minutes,"" which in a preview described the woman as a former Facebook employee who left with tens of thousands of pages of research. 
Davis said Thursday that Facebook would not retaliate against the whistleblower for sharing confidential documents with the senators.

NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) -Hedge fund Elliott Management said it owns a ""significant"" stake in troubled Japanese industrial conglomerate Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, which is conducting a strategic review amid pressure from other investors that could include a sale of the company.
Elliott, one of the world's most powerful activist investors, which oversees some $48 billion in assets, has been invested in Toshiba since 2017 but recently increased its holding to just under 5%, making it a top 10 investor, people familiar with the firm's investments said.
The New York-based firm's announcement comes just months after Effissimo Capital Management, Farallon Capital Management and other shareholders ousted Toshiba's chairman https://www.reuters.com/business/pivotal-toshiba-shareholder-vote-future-board-chairman-begins-2021-06-25 after the company was found to have colluded with the Japanese government to put pressure on foreign investors. 
""Our investment in Toshiba reflects our strong conviction in the company's underlying value,"" Elliott, which prefers to conduct its negotiations out of the public spotlight, said in the statement.
The company is expected to update investors on its plans in the next weeks and is scheduled to release earnings in November. As those deadlines approach, Toshiba has told shareholders that it is mulling over three possible ways to try and unlock value, the sources said.
Elliott has engaged with management and the board and said in a statement the firm has been ""encouraged by the constructive nature of our engagement with the company in recent months.""
A Toshiba spokesperson said the company does not disclose communications with its shareholders.
In its discussions, the sources said Elliott has suggested to Toshiba that the company's stock could be worth 6,000 yen, which would mark a 27% increase from Thursday's close of 4,715 yen.
Shares of Toshiba rose more than 4% in Tokyo early Friday following the news, which was first reported by the Financial Times.
The three possible approaches for Toshiba could include an outright sale to a private equity firm, a breakup of the company led by its management team or a combination of the two options, the sources said.
Current shareholder frustration with the company might make a management-led breakup very unlikely suggesting instead that a private equity firm will play a role either as an outright buyer or a large minority investor, the sources said.
Toshiba launched a full review of its current assets after dismissing in April a $20 billion takeover bid from CVC Capital Partners. The results of the review will be presented when the company announces a new mid-term business plan in October..
Since then Toshiba has been in talks with financial and strategic investors, including U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc, to seek their ideas for a new strategy.
Japan has recently become a popular hunting ground for U.S. activist investors, with Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) targeting  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group and Olympus appointing three foreign directors after ValueAct took a stake in the company.
ValueAct has also invested in Nintendo and Seven & i Holdings.

Elliott too has previously engaged in Japan when it built a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank in early 2020. While it trimmed the stake as the stock price climbed, the hedge fund remains invested in SoftBank. 
During the first half of 2021, 10 campaigns were launched at Japanese companies, data from investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) shows.

On Tuesday, Brazilian petrochemical firm Braskem said its Mexican subsidiary Braskem-Idesa had reached a new gas supply accord with Pemex to settle differences between the companies and build a $400 million ethane terminal.
The deal settles a long-running conflict between the companies, as Mexico's government weighed canceling the Pemex ethane supply contract with Braskem-Idesa last year due to its high costs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Thursday and the S&P 500 posted its worst month since the onset of the global health crisis, following a tumultuous month and quarter wracked by concerns over COVID-19, inflation fears and budget wrangling in Washington.
The U.S. Senate and House approved a stopgap spending bill to keep the government running late in the session, but after a brief market uptick, stocks resumed their decline, dragging even the Nasdaq into the red after trending higher most of the day.
""The market’s been resilient, but the risk tied up in the policy headlines over the debt ceiling, the chaos around these spending bills is weighing on the markets a bit as the quarter comes to a head,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.
""In a larger context it’s been pretty mild. We’re coming on the heels of seven ‘up’ months and volatility’s been fairly muted despite the headline risks, not to mention COVID-19 and tapering,"" Mayfield added. ""The market had to take a pause, and a pause is necessary and probably to be expected."" 
All three major U.S. stock indexes had their worst quarterly performance since the opening months of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic brought the global economy to its knees.
The S&P notched a modest gain over the July-to-September period, while the Nasdaq and Dow suffered quarterly losses.
For the month, the S&P and the Nasdaq suffered their biggest percentage drops since March 2020, while the Dow saw its largest monthly percentage drop since October.
The tug-of-war between growth and value persisted throughout the month and quarter. The S&P growth index plunged 5.8% in September, but notched a quarterly gain of 1.7%. Value shed 3.5% in September and 1.4% over the July-to-September period.
""It's no surprise as we’ve seen yields tick higher you’ve seen the outperformance of value,"" Mayfield said. ""We expect yields to tick higher to the end of the year and cyclical and value performance to accompany that.""
On the economic front, initial jobless claims unexpectedly edged higher for the third straight week. Market participants now look to consumer spending, inflation and factory activity data expected on Friday for signs of economic health and clues regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's shifting timeline for tapering its asset purchases and hiking key interest rates.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, testified before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, even as wrangling continued on Capitol Hill over funding the government in the face of a looming deadline and the threat of potential shutdowns and credit default.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 546.8 points, or 1.59%, to 33,843.92, the S&P 500 lost 51.92 points, or 1.19%, to 4,307.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.86 points, or 0.44%, to 14,448.58.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with industrials and consumer staples showing the largest percentage drops.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 150 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.88 billion shares, compared with the 10.61 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp signaled on Thursday that higher oil and gas prices would boost third-quarter earnings by as much as $1.5 billion over the second quarter.
Natural gas prices in the United States have more than doubled this year and oil prices are up 52% as energy demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) also has been cutting costs and laying off personnel following a historic loss in 2020. Lower costs coupled with the recent rebound in oil and gas have driven profit sharply higher.
Natural gas prices should give the U.S. oil producer the largest increase in operating profit in the quarter, the company signaled in a corporate filing. Profit from natural could rise between $500 million-900 million this quarter over last, it said. 
U.S. natural gas prices were trading at almost $6 per million British Thermal units on Thursday.
Healthier refining margins could add from $500 million to $700 million in operating profits this quarter. Exxon quarter results will be posted on Oct. 29.
Chemical margins, on the other hand, could cut operating profit by between $200 million and $400 million in the quarter, the company said in the filing. 
It also said unsettled derivatives could reduce operating profit from oil and gas production by between $100 million-500 million in the period.

Last year, the company suffered a $680 million loss in the third quarter on lower oil prices and production volumes.
Exxon shares closed on Thursday at $58.82, up 43% this year.

Jorgensen, who has been the firm's finance head for over a decade, will help with the transition when a new CFO is appointed.
The development comes on the eve of the launch season, with the company set to release the much-awaited ""FIFA 22"" title on Friday, and ""Apex Legends: Escape"" and ""Battlefield 2042"" in November.
Jorgensen's other role as chief operating officer will be taken over by company insider Laura Miele, EA's Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wilson said.
Miele, who has been with the company since 1998, has been EA's chief studios officer since April 2018. She will assume the new role over the next few months.
Video game creators have emerged as clear pandemic winners after lockdowns drove people to spend more time and money on games.
With millions of new gamers, video game publishers are working on enriching user experience by adding interactive and social features to their popular titles.
However, EA has been facing stiff competition from Epic Games Inc's ""Fortnite"" and Roblox Corp that let users create a metaverse and interact with other players within the games.

In a bid to bolster similar social features, Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based EA on Thursday also named marketing officer Chris Bruzzo as its chief experience officer.

(Reuters) -Merck & Co said on Thursday it would buy Acceleron Pharma (NASDAQ:XLRN) Inc for about $11.5 billion, broadening its portfolio beyond aging cancer drug Keytruda with potential treatments that could bring in fresh revenue.
The deal gives Merck access to Acceleron's rare disease drug candidate, sotatercept, which the company expects could bring in billions of dollars in sales, and comes as Keytruda moves toward the loss of market exclusivity in 2028.
The lung cancer treatment accounted for 36.7%, or $4.18 billion, of Merck's total sales in the second quarter.
Sotatercept is currently in a late-stage study, testing it as a treatment for a rare cardiovascular disease called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a type of high blood pressure that affects blood vessels in the lungs. Merck sees PAH as a roughly $7.5 billion market by 2026. 
The drugmaker will pay $180 per Acceleron share in cash, representing a premium of about 2.6% to the stock's closing price on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data.
Avoro Capital, which owns 7% of Acceleron stock along with its managed funds, said the deal undervalues the drugmaker. 
""We believe there should be no urgency to sell at a low price now since the value of the company will only increase as additional clinical trial data is released,"" it said in a statement. 
Although the Acceleron deal will not fully remove the overhang of generic competition for Keytruda, it does help diversify sales, which addresses a large shareholder concern, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen wrote in a client note.

Merck is targeting a U.S. launch for sotatercept in 2024-2025 and its market exclusivity for PAH is expected to extend through 2036-2037.
The deal also adds FDA-approved blood-related disorder drug Reblozyl, which Acceleron markets with partner Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb, to Merck's portfolio.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian conglomerate Novonor, its creditor banks and state-controlled oil company Petrobras are expected to take a first step to divest from petrochemical company  Braskem  SA (NYSE:BAK) in the fourth quarter, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Novonor, formerly known as Odebrecht, is discussing a plan for multiple share offerings with its creditors. The first would unload Braskem preferred shares owned by Novonor over the next months. Petrobras, a minority shareholder in Braskem, has been invited to join all share offerings and divide the proceeds, the sources said.
The first offering may reach around 9 billion reais ($1.65 billion) if Petrobras also participates, the sources said.
After selling the preferred stake, equivalent to around 20% of Braskem's capital, Novonor, its creditors and Petrobras will discuss the best time frame to sell their common stock, added the sources, who asked for anonymity to disclose private talks.
Novonor and Petrobras declined to comment on the matter.
Before the next share offerings, the company may complete the listing of its shares on the Novo Mercado, a segment in the Brazilian stock exchange with higher standards for corporate governance. 
But creditors and shareholders want to sell the stakes as soon as possible to avoid a share offering months before a contentious presidential election in Brazil, which is expected to create market volatility. 
The process is being managed by some of Brazil's biggest banks, which extended billions of dollars in loans to the former Odebrecht and have grown frustrated by the amount of time it has taken to recover funds from the company. The former Odebrecht was a key player in the country's Car Wash corruption scandal, and is now under bankruptcy protection.
Novonor's 38.3% stake in Braskem is the collateral to the largest loans. Creditors have decided to sell Braskem through share offerings because no buyers for the entire company emerged during a formal M&A competitive process managed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) at Novonor's request.
Other bids for parts of the business were considered too low, the sources added. 
It is clear, however, that the divestment could not be done in a single share offering. Although the banks have priority in receiving the proceeds of the Braskem sale, they are coordinating the exit strategy through multiple offerings with Petrobras, owner of 36.1% of Braskem.
Shares of Braskem have soared 150% this year, driven by higher prices for resins and lower debt, while the broader Ibovespa index is down 6%. The company, which has also been settling disputes in Mexico and in the Brazilian state of Alagoas, has a market capitalization of 47 billion reais.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to confirm as chief consumer watchdog Rohit Chopra, widely praised by progressives for long defending Americans from predatory financial firms and students from insurmountable debt often incurred through deceptive private loans.
Chopra, currently a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to begin next week as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The agency will be key to President Joe Biden's administration as it tries to address social inequities underscored by the pandemic. 
While Biden nominated Chopra earlier this year, the U.S. Senate, over which Democrats have a wafer thin majority, has been slow to confirm https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-frustrated-by-slow-pace-senate-confirmations-nominees-2021-08-11 a number of agency heads due to Republican resistance.
In the meantime, CFPB Acting Director Dave Uejio has pushed ahead with an aggressive agenda, cracking down on mortgage servicers as Americans struggled during pandemic lockdowns. He also revoked Trump-era policies that had undermined the agency's ability to punish companies for ""abusive"" behavior, while stepping up enforcement against fintech firms.
As well as continuing to push these issues, Chopra is expected to focus on exorbitant lending rates and abusive debt-collection practices and address the student debt burden and gaps in minorities' access to credit. 
The CFPB has been a political lightning rod since being created after the 2009 global financial crisis. Democrats hail it as a guardian of ordinary Americans but Republicans revile it as too powerful and unaccountable.
""The Trump administration attempted to turn the CFPB into an agency more interested in protecting loan sharks and predatory lenders than hardworking consumers,"" said Lisa Gilbert, a vice president of the Washington-based consumer advocacy, Public Citizen. ""We welcome the return of an experienced consumer advocate to lead the agency and work on behalf of consumers.""

Mukherji said S&P's action would be the same in the case of debt nonpayments by other countries and that even a default on a single U.S. Treasury bill, note, or bond would push the U.S. rating to the bottom of the scale. 
""We don't think it's going to happen,"" he told Reuters. ""That's why we have a AA-plus rating, the second highest on our scale.""
In 2011, S&P downgraded the top rating of the United States by a notch to its current AA-plus level.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could run out of cash by Oct. 18 if the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended, leading to its first-ever default. A two-year suspension of the debt ceiling expired in July and Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain at odds.
Mukherji said defaults in other countries usually result from economic and financial stresses, and that political factors were driving the debt ceiling debate in the United States, which has a recovering economy.
He added that given the U.S. dollar is the world's most important currency, a default would have a far reaching impact.
""No one knows what the impact is,"" he said. ""We don't know, we don't want to know but it's going to be big.""
S&P noted that during the last decade, Congress passed legislation to raise or suspend the debt limit five times during periods of political impasse. 
The nation had top credit ratings with all three major credit rating agencies until S&P's August 2011 downgrade amid a previous round of political battles over debt, deficits, and the debt ceiling.

As for a potential government shutdown, S&P said it would not have a direct impact on creditworthiness.
Congress on Thursday passed a stopgap funding bill to avoid a shutdown this week.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 05:22PM ET</span>","GM's Cruise, Alphabet's Waymo win permits to offer self-driving rides to passengers in California","By Hyunjoo Jin, Jane Lanhee Lee and Paresh Dave
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)'s Cruise and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Waymo self-driving car subsidiaries on Thursday became the first companies to receive autonomous vehicle permits to offer rides to passengers in California.
Cruise has obtained a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to offer driverless rides to passengers at night in some parts of San Francisco, and Waymo has won a permit from the regulator to deploy autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel. 
The DMV said it would allow commercial service for the companies, but said they would need to obtain another permit from the California Public Utilities Commission to start charging passengers for rides. 
Another company, Nuro, last year received a California self-driving deployment permit, but that was for delivery of goods, not passenger rides. 
The California DMV said the new permit would allow Cruise to operate its vehicles ""within designated parts of San Francisco"" between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at a maximum speed limit of 30 miles per hour.
Waymo vehicles which have safety drivers behind the wheel ""are approved to operate on public roads within parts of San Francisco and San Mateo counties with a speed limit of no more than 65 mph,"" the DMV said. 
The two companies have ramped up testing in San Francisco, with Cruise using GM's electric Bolt EV vehicles and Waymo running Jaguar all-electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs. 
Waymo started public testing in San Francisco in August, with a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo has given paid, driverless rides hailed through its app in limited suburban areas in Arizona.
Waymo tweeted on Thursday that its ""new permit will help us build on our efforts to bring our AV technology to many more CA residents."" 
Self-driving startups are scurrying to commercialize the expensive technology and raise fresh funds, after missing their earlier deadlines for deployment, hampered by technological hurdles. 

Cruise, which also counts Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) and Honda as investors, earlier this year raised a fresh $2.75 billion from investors like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc while Waymo has raised $2.5 billion this year.
Reuters in May reported that Cruise and Waymo had earlier this year applied for approval from the California DMV to deploy their self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, setting the stage for the biggest tests yet of the technology in a dense urban environment.

BERLIN (Reuters) -BMW AG lifted its annual profit margin forecast to between 9.5% and 10.5% from 7% to 9%, the company said in an ad hoc statement on Thursday, as higher prices for new and used vehicles outweigh the effect of supply-chain issues. 
The carmaker also boosted its forecast for return on equity in its financial services segment to 20%-23% from 17%-20% and said it expects free cash flow in its automobile segment of approximately 6.5 billion euros. 
""Whilst the semiconductor supply restrictions are expected to further impact production and deliveries to customers in the coming months, BMW AG expects that the continuing positive pricing effects for both new and pre-owned vehicles will overcompensate these negative sales volume effects in the current financial year,"" the company said.
BMW's Frankfurt-listed shares were up 2% on the news.
Though chip shortages have plagued the auto industry for months, prompting companies from  Renault  (PA:RENA) to Toyota to warn of longer-term hits to output, higher prices have allowed some to offset their losses, companies have said.
 Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) in August attributed higher than expected earnings in its Mercedes-Benz division to pricing effects. BMW had also raised its profit forecast in August after strong quarterly results, but warned at the time that chip shortages could plague the second half of the year.

Still, BMW's strong relations with its suppliers have meant it was less affected by the shortages than other carmakers, many of whom were forced to bring production to a halt indefinitely at some of their plants.
The company is due to report results on Nov. 3.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets continued to fall Thursday as inflation fears persisted and expectations grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve would tighten policy in the coming months.
Earlier in the week, global shares suffered their worst rout since January. A heavy tech sell-off on Tuesday led Wall Street to its steepest drop since mid-July.
Major U.S. and European stock indices staged a partial recovery Wednesday but were unable to build momentum.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.62%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 547.39 points, or 1.59%, to 33,843.33; the S&P 500 lost 52.02 points, or 1.19%, at 4,307.44; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 63.86 points, or 0.44%, to 14,448.58.
""U.S. investors are glad to see September end,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, summing up the mood of most market participants. ""U.S. stocks ended mostly on a down note as lawmakers try to avoid a government shutdown and deliver on the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, all while an energy crisis brews abroad.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that resolving ""tension"" between high inflation and high unemployment is the Fed's most urgent issue, acknowledging a potential conflict between the U.S. central bank's two goals of stable prices and full employment.
Inflation prospects have helped the greenback to end the quarter on a positive note but it slipped from a one-year high on Thursday following dismal U.S. weekly jobs numbers..
The dollar index fell 0.129%, with the euro down 0.1% to $1.1583.
Gold, an alternative safe-haved, rose more than 2% as the dollar declined.
U.S. gold futures settled up 2% at $1,757.
Spot gold added 1.7% to $1,755.56 an ounce. 
U.S. Treasury yields dipped, after a sharp rise earlier in the week, as investors watched budget talks in Washington and rebalanced portfolios at the end of September.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.515%, from 1.539% late on Wednesday.
Electricity prices in France are expected to rise around 12% by February, French environment minister Barbara Pompili said on Thursday, highlighting inflationary pressures sweeping across Europe.
French inflation hit a near 10-year high of 2.7% in September, official numbers showed, slightly less than forecast. Italy's annual inflation rate rose to 3.0%.
""This is not a broad-based inflationary spiral,"" Oxford Economics analysts wrote in a note, though they added there was ""little relief in sight for the record high energy prices in the coming months, with the severity of this winter a key factor.""
Germany's 10-year government bond yield was little changed at -0.208%. 
European stocks ended flat.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.24% after several days of losses, but was still set for a 4.5% monthly decline and a 9.3% loss on the quarter.
That would be the benchmark's worst quarter since the first three months of 2020, as COVID-19 raged across Southeast Asia and investors worried about slowing global growth with China a particular concern.
China's economy has been hit by regulatory curbs in the tech and property sectors and is now grappling with a power shortage.
Data published on Thursday showed China's factory activity unexpectedly shrank in September, but services returned to expansion as COVID-19 outbreaks receded. 

However, analysts say slowing growth would pressure authorities to ease policy. That provided battered Chinese markets with some respite, with blue chips rising 0.67%.
U.S. crude oil futures settled at $75.03 per barrel, up 0.3%. Brent crude futures settled at $78.52 per barrel, down 0.2%.

Is AZO a winner in the auto parts industry? Keep reading to find out.Shares of the largest aftermarket automotive parts and accessories retailer in the United States, AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), have gained 46.1% over the past year and 42.5% year-to-date. Moreover, in terms of the nine months’ performance, the stock has gained 41.6%. AZO hit its 52-week high of $1738.78 in yesterday’s trading session. The main factor contributing to this impressive rally is the company’s bottom-line growth, aided by the rising demand for auto parts thanks to a booming used car market.
Over the past months, the used car market has been expanding like never before, as new car production dwindled due to supply chain issues. According to Edmunds’s research, the average transaction price (ATP) for used vehicles climbed to $25,410 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $20,942 in the same period last year, marking the highest quarterly used ATP Edmunds has on record.
Used cars require repairs to keep running. Also, people owning cars invested in repairs and maintenance to avoid add-on spending in buying new cars. The growing demand for aftermarket auto parts bodes due to lower production for new cars bodes well for AZO.

Gains were extended into Thursday due to the continued positive sentiment regarding the economy. Slight gains continued on Friday as stocks ended a volatile session on a high note.

In July, Bezos soared some 66.5 miles (107 km) above the Texas desert aboard a New Shepard launch vehicle in a suborbital flight.
Bezos's flight came nine days after Richard Branson was aboard his competing space tourism venture Virgin Galactic's successful inaugural suborbital flight.
Bezos ""started becoming impatient and (SpaceX's) Elon (Musk) and Branson were getting ahead,"" Abrams told CBS News. ""And then we started to feel this increasing pressure and impatience that would definitely filter down from leadership.""

However, its shares plunged significantly since hitting its 52-week high of $26.51 on August 13, as China took measures to curb steel production. So, can the stock rebound on the back of its solid financials?.Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF) became the largest flat-rolled steel company and the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America after acquiring AK steel and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) USA last year. Thanks to the soaring steel prices, CLF’s shares surged 212% over the past year. The company also aims to achieve net-zero debt by 2022, and its adjusted EBITDA is expected to be roughly $1.80 billion in the third quarter.
Also, the stock soared to hit its 52-week high of $26.51 on August 13, on the back of investors’ optimism surrounding the infrastructure bill. However, it has lost 24% since hitting its 52-week high and 16.5% over the past month as China has been taking steps to limit steel production. Moreover, Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that the U.S. House of Representatives may not vote on the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill today. So, CLF’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Taylor Dart explains why bulls need to make a stand, otherwise silver could fall to $20 before the end of the year.While it’s been a rollercoaster ride for gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)), silver (SLV) has been much more volatile recently, plunging 4% on Wednesday to close below the pivotal $22.00/oz level. This key level represents a zone where the metal broke out from in July 2020 ($21.20/oz to $22.00/oz), and any break below the lower point of this range would be a negative development. Fortunately, the bulls are trying to play some defense in this area, and at the same time, we’re seeing sentiment move onto a short-term buy signal. In the past, sentiment buy signals have led to strong forwards returns for the metal and typically contained any further downside to 10% or less. This suggests that we are likely nearing a bottom in the silver price or have already stuck one. However, even more, important than sentiment in the technical picture, which sits at a critical point. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: Daily Sentiment Index Data, Author’s Chart)
As shown in the chart above, the violent 8-month correction since February for silver has finally forced many bulls to throw in the towel, with bullish sentiment sliding from 78% in February to just 20% this week. This massive erosion in bullish sentiment suggests that just 1 in 5 investors are bullish on silver, down from nearly 4 of 5 investors being bullish as we headed into the back half of Q1 2021. This is great news for the bull camp on a short-term basis, given that extreme pessimism typically translates to durable bottoms in the precious metals space. The last time sentiment was this bad was during September 2018, with the metal rallying more than 14% over the next five months and more than 34% over the following 12 months. This was a great time to be a silver bull, but one had to go against the grain and buy when everyone else was giving up on the metal. However, while sentiment is crucial to finding the path of least resistance in the precious metals markets, the technicals are just as important.

The S&P 500 fell again and with a half-hour of trading left, was on track to break a seven-month streak of gains as investors worried about everything from inflation to the lasting effect the pandemic has had on employment and confidence. 
Despite that, the Commerce Department revised second-quarter growth slightly higher from an earlier reading. 
Rising rates have beaten down once high-flying tech stocks as investors ditch growth in favor of value. According to Reuters, excluding Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the rate-sensitive FAANG stocks have lost a combined $415 billion in value this month. Netflix is on track to gain 8% for the month.
Retailers struggling with supply chain bottlenecks continue to draw scrutiny. The whole sector has been disrupted not only by pandemic shutdowns but by difficulties getting products on shelves and stocked in warehouses.
 Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS) stock plunged 14% on Thursday after BofA analyst Lorraine Hutchinson lowered the stock’s rating by two notches due to supply chain issues. Hutchinson pointed out that the retailer’s top-selling active brands like  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE),  Under Armour  Inc A (NYSE:UAA) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) are facing supply chain issues. She said the product flow remains slow and warned investors to brace for a difficult second half.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday it would extend the public comment period for the draft environmental review of the proposed SpaceX Starship/Super Heavy program in Boca Chica, Texas, to Nov. 1.
The extension comes after federal and state agencies participating in the review made the request to extend the period for public input in the environmental assessment. SpaceX, the space company led by Elon Musk cannot launch the Starship/Super Heavy vehicle until the FAA completes its licensing process, which includes the environmental review.
The FAA released a 151-page draft environmental https://www.faa.gov/space/stakeholder_engagement/spacex_starship/media/Draft_PEA_for_SpaceX_Starship_Super_Heavy_at_Boca_Chica.pdfreview in September. The review looks at potential environmental impacts of SpaceX’s initial mission profile and reviews debris recovery, local road closures in Boca Chica and other issues.
If the FAA determines environmental impacts of the proposed project would be significant ""and those impacts could not be properly mitigated to less-than-significant levels, the agency would conduct a more intensive"" review. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported in July https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/faa-warns-spacex-it-has-not-approved-new-texas-launch-site-tower-2021-07-14 the FAA warned SpaceX that the agency could order SpaceX to take down a new tower because the environmental review was not complete. 
The FAA in July said the review of SpaceX’s proposed rocket assembly ""integration tower"" was ""underway,"" and added that ""the company is building the tower at its own risk.""

A May 6 letter from the FAA to SpaceX said construction activity on one of the two proposed 480-foot towers ""may complicate the ongoing environmental review process for the Starship/Super Heavy Launch Vehicle Program.""
Based on the environmental review, the FAA could order SpaceX to take down the tower. ""It is possible that changes would have to be made at the launch site, including to the integration towers to mitigate significant impacts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE must face investor claims it wrongly ""abandoned"" the investment strategies it promised to use on hedge funds that suffered massive losses as the COVID-19 pandemic shook markets early last year. 
In an 81-page decision, U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in Manhattan said investors could try to show Allianz was negligent and lacked good faith in managing its Structured Alpha funds. She also dismissed some state law-based claims.
Thursday's decision addressed 12 lawsuits, including two proposed class actions, in which investors claimed to suffer more than $4 billion of losses. The insurer faces more than two dozen such lawsuits, seeking at least $6 billion. 
Allianz's funds used complex option strategies to generate predictable returns without excessive risk, but according to the investors, imploded in February and March 2020 after quietly removing hedges designed to minimize losses.
According to court papers, the Structured Alpha Global Equity 500 fund lost three-quarters of its value, lagging its benchmark by nearly 60 percentage points. Two other funds once worth $2.3 billion were liquidated, locking in investor losses.
Failla said the investors could try to show that Allianz breached terms of a private placement memorandum for the funds, which she said the insurer portrayed as a ""glorified advertising brochure, the substance of which (it) could ignore at will.""
Allianz and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for investors in the proposed class actions did not immediately respond to similar requests.
On Thursday, Allianz said its top asset management executive Jacqueline Hunt was leaving her day-to-day role, and announced changes to its board.
The changes follow Allianz's Aug. 1 announcement that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the Structured Alpha funds.
That probe includes a review of whether Allianz fund managers misrepresented the funds' risks to investors, three people with knowledge of the matter said earlier in September.

Another U.S. regulator, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is also probing the funds' collapse.
The cases include In re Allianz Global Investors US LLC Alpha Series Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-05615.

(Reuters) - An estimated 2.06 million U.S. middle and high school students are using electronic-cigarettes with Puff Bar, Vuse and Juul among the most popular products, according to data from a 2021 survey analyzed by health officials. 
The data, published on Thursday in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, showed the use of the potentially addictive nicotine devices may have declined from 3.6 million students in 2020. 
However, authors of the study cautioned that estimates based on this year's survey conducted mostly online cannot be compared to results from surveys done in previous years collected from classrooms. 
The use of e-cigarettes among children and teens has been a growing public health concern. Makers of the devices came under the scrutiny of health regulators for allegedly targeting their marketing at youth and concerns that a new generation would become hooked on nicotine.
Manufacturers argue that the products help smokers quit. 
Puff Bar, a brand of disposable e-cigarettes that are sold in various flavors such as ""Blueberry Ice"" was the most popular among high school students, followed by Vuse, SMOK and Juul. Puff Bar and Juul were most popular among middle schoolers, according to the survey conducted from Jan. 18 to May 21.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this month delayed its decision https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-ask-more-time-before-deciding-juul-e-cigarettes-2021-09-09/#:~:text=Healthcare%20%26%20Pharmaceuticals-,U.S.%20FDA%20says%20it%20needs%20more%20time,on%20Juul%2C%20other%20e-cigarettes&text=A%20federal%20judge%20set%20a,while%20the%20agency%20reviewed%20applications on whether Juul and other major manufacturers, including British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc's Vuse, can sell their products in the United States as it decides whether the products provide a net benefit to public health.

About 85% of youth e-cigarette users overall said they used flavored products with fruit, candy, desserts, or other sweets being the most popular, the survey data showed. 
Among current middle and high school e-cigarette users, the most commonly used device type was disposables, followed by prefilled or refillable pods or cartridges and tanks or mod systems, the survey showed.

By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - The hit Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series ""Squid Game"" from South Korea has gone viral across the world and online by morphing childhood games popular before the digital era such as ""Red Light, Green Light"" into deadly survival challenges.
The playground game where players stop and go at a tagger's command is one of six kids games with fatal consequences depicted in the gory thriller named after a South Korean variation of tag played in the 1970s and 80s using a board drawn in the dirt. In the ""Red Light, Green Light"" episode, the show's first, players are shot for failing to stand still at the red light call.
The Squid Game is the last one the 456 cash-strapped contestants on the show, ranging from a North Korean defector to a fund manager charged with embezzlement, must compete in for a prize of 45.6 billion won ($38.66 million).
The horror series has shot to popularity since premiering on Sept. 17, becoming the first Korean drama to snatch the top spot on Netflix in the United States. It could become its most popular show yet globally, the company's Co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos said on Monday.
""We did not see that coming, in terms of its global popularity,"" he said.
South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has established itself as a global entertainment hub with its vibrant pop-culture, including the seven-member boy band BTS and movies such as Oscar winners ""Parasite,"" a satire about class and society, and ""Minari,"" about a Korean immigrant family in the United States.
The fame of ""Squid Game"" has transferred to the so-called metaverse, or digital world where people move and communicate in virtual environments.
Thousands of global users have been playing ""Red Light, Green Light"" in several game rooms dubbed ""Squid Game"" on Roblox, a California-based maker of popular online video game platforms.
The rooms emulate several film sets and let users sign up for a ""Red Light, Green Light"" game.
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), the hashtags “SquidGame” and ""RedLightGreenLight"" were trending and reviews of the Roblox games have inundated YouTube and other social media.
Venues outside the virtual world are also capitalizing on the show's popularity.
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post showed a mall in Quezon City in the Philippines had installed a 3-metre (10 ft) copy of the doll that calls out the commands in the ""Red Light, Green Light"" episode, which invites people to play across a crosswalk outside and win prizes.

Following the success of the nine-part series, season two of ""Squid Game"" is in the works, and Netflix has said it plans to invest $500 million on original movies and TV shows this year in South Korea, one Asia's fastest growing markets.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A group of European airlines agreed on Thursday to refund passengers whose flights were cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and committed to provide better information on passengers' rights in future.
After talks with the European Commission, 16 airlines agreed to clear refund backlogs, to better inform travellers when companies would cancel flights and to offer vouchers only when passengers chose them.
The airlines included Air France-KLM, British Airways, Easyjet, Lufthansa, Ryanair, TAP, and Wizz Air among others.
""In the early phase of the pandemic, some airlines pushed vouchers on passengers,"" Didier Reynders, European commissioner for justice, said in a statement. ""They were acting against EU consumer protection rules. That was unacceptable,"" he said.
National authorities in individual EU states are responsible for the enforcement of EU consumer protection laws. The EU law, the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation, has created a network of state enforcers to coordinate on such issues.
The EU Commission said this was the biggest Consumer Protection Cooperation action in the CPC network's history and the first action that was based on an alert from the Commission.
""Airlines have breached European consumer rights on a massive scale during the pandemic,"" Monique Goyens, general director of the European Consumer Organisation CEUC, which led the complaint to the EU in July 2020, said in an emailed statement.

Significant job growth last month, a moderate drop in the unemployment rate, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s recent announcement that the chamber had reached a deal to avoid a government shutdown this week should give a boost to the stock market in the upcoming days. This, along with the expected continuation of the low-interest-rate environment, should benefit small-cap stocks.
Moreover, with a sustained rally in the stock market over the past few months, many large-cap stocks have become highly overvalued. Therefore, quality small-cap stocks that remain under the radar should offer better returns.
We think Tennant Company (TNC), Standex International Corporation (SXI), Donnelley Financial Solution Inc. (DFIN), and  AdvanSix Inc . (ASIX) could be strong bets now, considering their expanding market reach and fundamental strength.

Since many customers are ready for an upgrade, the newly released iPhone 13 should undoubtedly continue to see a significant surge in sales. Therefore, iPhone’s component suppliers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and QUALCOMM (QCOM) should benefit from the sales super cycle.Tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched the much-awaited iPhone 13 line on September 14, and analysts predict a huge demand for upgrading older iPhones to drive sales significantly. Wedbush analysts expect 250 million iPhone users to go for an upgrade this cycle. More than 2 million pre-orders were placed in China for the iPhone 13 through AAPL’s official store on JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and it surpassed last year’s pre-orders for iPhone 12.
Wedbush analysts believe that AAPL is still in the middle of its “supercycle” of iPhone sales. Moreover, the sales momentum is expected to remain high ahead of the holiday shopping season, with improved features like increased battery life, higher default storage space, and camera up-gradation.
Given this backdrop, it could be wise to bet on shares of iPhone’s component suppliers Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). These stocks are expected to rally on solid iPhone 13 sales.

(Reuters) -European stocks ended flat on Thursday as declines in travel and leisure limited gains in miners, while ending the month with falls of over 3% on worries about a slowing global economy and higher inflation.
The pan-regional STOXX 600 index was 0.05% lower, with miners rising 2.0% and travel stocks falling 2.2%. 
The European stocks benchmark ended September with losses of 3.4% after a seven-month winning streak, as a surge in government bond yields drove investors out of high-growth sectors such as technology into economically sensitive banking and energy stocks. 
""Recent market moves suggest that a rotation is under way in favour of sectors and assets that benefit from a consumption shift from goods towards services,"" BCA analysts said in a note. 
""Given that we do not expect rising interest rates to have a damaging impact on the real economy over the coming 12-18 months, we recommend that investors maintain a moderate overweight allocation to stocks.""
A growing number of risks including hawkish stance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, supply-chain constraints and Chinese property developer Evergrande's financial troubles have weighed on sentiment this month, even as investors bet on a steady European economy. 
Defensives-heavy Swiss market is among the biggest decliners this month, while banking-heavy Spanish and British indexes remained buoyant. 
Among individual stocks, Sweden's H&M was 3.4% lower after the retailer said supply disruptions hit sales in September.

The order came directly from Vice Premier Han Zheng, who supervises the nation’s energy sector and industrial production, and was delivered during an emergency meeting earlier this week with officials from Beijing’s state-owned assets regulator and economic planning agency, the people said, asking not to be named discussing a private matter. Blackouts won’t be tolerated, the people said.
Oil futures erased earlier losses in New York. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed as much as 0.8% to $75.39 a barrel on Nymex. Chinese coal futures earlier surged to a record as the country grapples with shortages of the fuel ahead of a week-long holiday. Prices have more than doubled this year amid soaring electricity demand from factories and slow output growth from mines.
The emergency meeting underscores the critical situation in China. A severe energy crisis has gripped the country, and several regions have had to curtail power to the industrial sector, while some residential areas have even faced sudden blackouts. 
Calls to the state council went unanswered outside business hours. 
In a sign of how worried Chinese officials are, Premier Li Keqiang has vowed that every effort will be taken to maintain economic growth. China will ensure the needs of basic livelihoods are met and will keep industrial and supply chains stable, Li was cited as saying by China National radio during a meeting with foreign diplomats Thursday.

Investing.com – Stocks of Altria (NYSE:MO) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) fell around 5% and 3.5%, respectively, Thursday after an adverse ruling in the import and sale of the Iqos tobacco device by the companies.
The U.S. International Trade Commission held Wednesday that the cigarette alternative infringed on two of R.J. Reynolds’ patents.
The Iqsos device heats tobacco without burning it, a process supposed to give users the same rush of nicotine that a cigarette does, but without the toxins.
Philip Morris sells the device in several international markets and has granted Altria a license to sell it in the U.S. While Iqos’s U.S. sales aren’t significant, the order is upsetting for the companies given their efforts at shifting towards products seen as better alternatives to tobacco-based items which have seen falling demand amid negative public sentiment.
Altria spun off Philip Morris to focus on the U.S. market while the latter took care of the overseas sales. The two companies discussed reuniting in 2019 but called off the merger talks later.
The ban needs President Joe Biden’s stamp, and he has two months to review it. Philip Morris told CNBC it plans to appeal the trade agency’s decision. Altria told the channel the two companies are working together on contingency plans."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German truckmaker MAN, owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Traton division, aims to significantly raise its profit margin by 2023 as it restructures to adapt to the electric age, its chief executive said.
Andreas Tostmann, in an interview with Reuters, did not quantify where margins would stand in two years compared with the 3.3% it achieved in the first six months of 2021.
The division in March said it aimed for a margin of 8% over the full business cycle, leaving open when that would be.
Seen as the problem child at Traton, in which Volkswagen owns a 89.72% stake, MAN lags far behind Traton's Swedish subsidiary Scania, which had a first-half profit margin of 12%.
Traton late on Wednesday unveiled a reshuffle of top management that saw the resignation of CEO Matthias Gruendler, who will be replaced by Scania boss Christian Levin.
Tostmann, who has cut 350 jobs and closed two MAN factories as part of a restructuring, added that MAN was working towards generating the same profit from electric vehicles as diesel vehicles, without specifying when he expected this to occur.
Customers would expect cost parity between electric and diesel vehicles to be reached by the end of the decade, with two fifths of trucks on the road fully electric - rising to 60% among smaller vehicles, he said.

""Our customers demand a product with the same costs as a diesel vehicle or lower,"" Tostmann said.
The company is also experimenting with autonomous driving, he said, and is testing one truck model in the port of Hamburg with the aim of developing a vehicle which could drive at the same speed as a human-driven truck on the road.

Retailers have been battling port congestions and escalating transportation costs due to global supply chain disruptions in recent months as rising coronavirus cases dampened hopes of a swift economic recovery and a strong holiday season.
""We did take very assertive action to incorporate freight as a pressure point in our business,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Triton said in a post earnings call, referring to the inclusion of increased freight costs in the company's forecast.
""We did take a number of pricing interventions, (but) I actually think that we weren't agile enough and we paid the price for that. And that's something that we're also correcting for the third and fourth quarter."" 
Triton said the company was plagued by ""pervasive"" supply chain challenges and cost inflation, which soared as the months went by, eating into the retailer's profit in the quarter.
Bed Bath & Beyond shares hit an almost one-year low on Thursday as fears of the Delta variant hurt traffic in key states, including Florida, Texas and California in August, the largest month of the quarter.
That also led to the company missing sales and profit expectations for the quarter ended Aug. 28.
The New Jersey-based retailer forecast adjusted profit to be between $0.70 and $1.10 per share, lower than its previous range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share.

It also expects full-year net sales to be between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion, below the prior range of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) European Union antitrust fine was based on flawed calculations, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google said on Thursday, urging Europe's second-highest court to scrap or reduce what it said was not an appropriate penalty.
Google was fined for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals and cement its dominance in general internet search from 2011, in the largest penalty meted out to any company found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.
""The fine that was imposed, a staggering 4.34 billion euros, was not appropriate,"" Google's lawyer Genevra Forwood told the five-judge panel of the General Court on the fourth day of a week-long hearing, which is taking place three years after the European Commission sanctioned the company.
""The problem is not the headline-grabbing fine per se. The problem is how the Commission reached that figure,"" she said. 
Forwood said there was no anti-competitive intent in Google's actions nor could it have known that its conduct was an abuse based on EU case law and there was no precedent for it.
""So it was wrong for the Commission to impose any fine at all, let alone turn up the dials to reach its biggest fine ever,"" Forwood said. 
She also took issue with the EU competition enforcer adding a 11% gravity factor to Google's fine compared with 5% for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in 2009 in a separate case.
""Even if this Court considers that a fine is appropriate, it would only be proper to turn the dials right down,"" she said.
However, the European Commission's lawyer Anthony Dawes said Google ""simply could not be unaware of the anti-competitive behaviour of its practices"".
""Infringements committed negligently are no less serious than those committed intentionally,"" Dawes said, adding that the fine was just 4.5% of Google's revenue in 2017 versus a 10% cap allowed under EU rules.

A verdict is likely to come next year. The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission

Equally impressive, the record inventory gluts have been completely worked through, and we are at inventory levels that are below historical averages. Demand is already back to pre-pandemic levels, and there is another looming catalyst for demand as travel remains below pre-pandemic levels and could return to previous levels if/when the virus situation continues to improve.
From the supply side, CAPEX remains low despite higher prices and has been low for the last few years. This means that oil is likely in the early stages of a multi year bull market. This week’s featured stock under $10 - TransGlobe Energy (TGA) - is well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's top flight Serie A soccer league should follow the example of Spain's LaLiga and open up to private equity investors to mend clubs' finances ravaged by the pandemic, the new U.S. owner of Serie A club Genoa CFC has said. 
Earlier this year, Spain's top league soccer clubs backed private equity firm CVC's proposed investment in LaLiga, in a deal aimed at strengthening clubs and give them funds to spend on new infrastructure and modernisation projects.
In Italy, drawn-out negotiations between Serie A and private equity firms CVC and Advent for a stake in a new company housing the league's media rights have collapsed without a deal.
""Maybe the CVC-LaLiga deal is the best way to do it, maybe not ... I think it's definitely worth considering it,"" Juan Arciniegas, managing director at U.S. firm 777 Partners, told Reuters, adding there could be many ways to structure a partnership.
""It is paramount to evaluate all the possibilities in order to enhance the capitalisation of the league and the clubs."" 
Last week the Miami-based investment firm, which holds a stake in Spain's Sevilla FC, became the sixth U.S. owner of a Serie A side, purchasing Italy's oldest club Genoa in a 150 million euro ($128.05 million) deal.
""We recognise that these are difficult times, but difficult times create opportunities and the need for capital to meet opportunities. I think we could play a role in supporting the club both with capital and expertise"", Arciniegas said.
The 777 Partners fund plans to turn around Genoa, which ended 2020 with a 33 million euros loss, by injecting capital and restructuring some of the debt the club has piled up due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The club has more debt than we intend to have in the medium term. We want to de-leverage as part of our project"", he said.
One of the biggest problems Serie A clubs have is that few own their stadiums, depriving them of revenue, while ambitious projects to build new arenas often get caught up in red tape.
Genoa share their home ground, which is owned by the city municipality, with rivals Sampdoria. 
Arciniegas said that, despite the challenges, investing in the stadium would be a key part of a strategy to increase the club's revenue base by broadening services for fans attending matches and for corporate partners.

""We are looking at every possibility ... to allow us a direct investment into the stadium. It may be refurbishment, it may be expansion, it may be the creation of new spaces.""

Port congestion and high spot freight rates, caused by a combination of unexpected demand recovery and tight shipping space, would continue at least during the rest of 2021 and into the first quarter of next year, Chief Executive Rolf Habben Jansen told reporters.
Container usage in August was up 20% year-on-year, he said in an online briefing, citing information received by the Hamburg-based company.
Meanwhile, the company's cargo turnaround time has risen to up to 60 days from the normal 50 days, meaning that 20% more containers are bound in shipment than before the crisis - without delivering more cargo.
As demand outstrips capacity, the group still expects an increase of only a few percent in its full year transport volumes after recording a 4% rise in January-June, Habben Jansen said.
Among measures to remedy the problems, which include large vessel orders, Hapag-Lloyd last month ordered another 75,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) worth of containers for receipt in the fourth quarter.
Separately, Habben Jansen commented on possible changes to shipping flows once it completes its freshly announced purchase of a 30% stake in container Terminal Wilhelmshaven (CTW) and 50% of Rail Terminal Wilhelmshaven (RTW) at JadeWeserPort on the North Sea Coast west of Hamburg.
The move, which is subject to approval by antitrust authorities, has caused concern in the state of Hamburg that possible volume handling losses could hit the city's economy.

Habben Jansen said that he expects some 85-90% of usual volumes still coming into Hamburg after the transaction.
He said the acquisitions were aimed at securing greater volumes for German ports in general, amid competition with Antwerp and Rotterdam for receipts from the Far East.

Investing.com – CarMax stock (NYSE:KMX) fell 10% Thursday as the company’s unit profitability eroded in the second quarter despite record sales.
Profit per share came in below estimates while sales were higher. Higher staffing and sales compensation hurt profitability. The company had benefited from Covid-related cost-saving steps last year, an item missing this time.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of gross profit, was 70.4%, up from 58.8%.
Vehicle resellers like CarMax and  Carvana  (NYSE:CVNA) have had historic sales for more than a year now as a shortage of chips has meant that some of the popular models have not been easily available in the market. Consumers have thus chosen to go for second-hand purchases. As a result, prices of second-hand vehicles have also strengthened. But CarMax sprang a surprise.
Average retail selling prices rose 31%, reflecting higher acquisition costs. Gross profit per retail used unit at CarMax was $2,185, compared to $2,205 in the first quarter and $2,214 in second quarter of last financial year.
Wholesale gross profit per unit was $1,005, an $81 per unit decrease when compared with the second quarter last year.
An increase in warranty service costs hurt the gross profits, too.
Combined retail and wholesale used vehicle unit sales were 419,895, up 20% from the prior year’s second quarter.
Net revenue for the quarter was a record $8 billion, up 49%. Profit per share was $1.72."

1480,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",China's electric carmakers make their move on Europe,"By Nick Carey and Yilei Sun
MUNICH/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's electric carmakers are darting into Europe, hoping to catch traditional auto giants cold and seize a slice of a market supercharged by the continent's drive towards zero emissions. 
Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, among a small group of challengers, launches its ES8 electric SUV in Oslo on Thursday - the first foray outside China for a company that is virtually unheard of in Europe even though it's valued at about $57 billion. 
Other brands unfamiliar to many Europeans that have started selling or plan to sell cars on the continent include Aiways, BYD's Tang, SAIC's MG, Dongfeng's VOYAH, and Great Wall's ORA. 
Yet Europe, a crowded, competitive car market dominated by famous brands, has proved elusive for Chinese carmakers in the past. They made strategic slips and also contended with a perception that China, long associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. 
Indeed, Nio Chief Executive William Li told Reuters he foresees a long road to success in a mature market where it is ""very difficult to be successful"". 
Chinese carmakers may need up to a decade to ""gain a firm foothold"" in Europe, the billionaire entrepreneur said - a forecast echoed by He Xiaopeng, CEO of electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) who told Reuters his company needs 10 years ""to lay a good foundation"" on the continent.
These new players, many of which have only ever made electric vehicles, believe they have a window of opportunity to finally crack the lucrative market. 
While electric car sales in the European Union more than doubled last year and jumped 130% in the first half of this year, traditional manufacturers are still gradually shifting their large vehicle ranges over to electric and have yet to flood the thirsty market with models.
""The market is not that busy yet, if you compare it with combustion-engine models where each of the major carmakers has a whole range of vehicles,"" said Alexander Klose, who heads the foreign operations of Chinese electric vehicle maker Aiways.
""That is where we think we have an opportunity,"" he added on a drive around Munich in a U5, a crossover SUV on sale in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. 
The U5 starts at 30,000 euros ($35,000) in Germany - below the average new car price and most local EV prices - before factoring in 9,000 euros in EV subsidies - and comes in just four colours and two trim levels to minimize costs. 
'GERMAN PEOPLE BUY GERMAN CARS'
As Chinese carmakers gear up to enter Europe, they are trying out different business models, from relying on importers, low-cost retail options or building up more traditional dealerships.
The new reality that top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc now produce cars in technological powerhouse China has likely undermined past perceptions of low quality workmanship - though they can be hard to shake.
Antje Levers, a teacher who lives in western Germany near the Dutch border, and her husband owned a diesel Chevrolet Orlando but wanted a greener option. They bought an Aiways U5 last year after plenty of research to fend off criticism for not buying local, and loves its handling and low running costs. 
She said people had told her: ""You can't buy a Chinese car, they're plastic and cheap and do not support German jobs."" But she feels that is no longer true in a global car industry where you find German auto parts in Chinese cars and vice versa.
""German people buy German cars, so to buy a Chinese car you need to have a little courage,"" the 47-year-old added. ""Sometimes you just have to be open for new things."" 
NIO LANDS IN NORWAY WITH NOMI 
Nio launches its ES8 electric SUV alongside a NIO House - part-showroom, part-cafe and workspace for customers in the capital of Norway, a country that's also the initial base for Xpeng.
Norwegian state support for EVs has put the country at the forefront of the shift to electric. It makes sense as a European entry point because customers are used to electric vehicles so only have to be sold on an unknown Chinese brand, said Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association. 
""If you go to another European country you may struggle to sell both,"" said Bu, adding that her organisation has talked extensively with a number of Chinese EV makers keen to learn market specifics and consumer culture before launching there.
She is uncertain, though, how consumers will react to Nio's approach of swapping out batteries for customers rather than stopping to charge them, or the carmaker's strategy of leasing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nio-battery-electric-idUSKCN25G0OE rather than selling batteries to customers.
""But where the Chinese are really at the forefront is the technology,"" she added, referring in particular to Nomi, the digital assistant in the dashboard of Nio's cars. 
NEWCOMERS' STRATEGIES DIVERGE
One size does not fit all. While Nio and Xpeng have been hiring staff building up their organizations in Norway, SAIC's MG works through a car importer to sell cars in a handful of European markets. 
Aiways is trying an lower-cost approach to selling cars in Europe, though Klose says it varies by market.
In Germany, for instance, the company sells its cars through Euronics, an association of independent electronics retailers, rather than building traditional dealerships. 
It aims to sell across the EU by next year and to enter the U.S. market by 2023, said Klose, a former Volvo and Ford executive.
Past failed attempts by Chinese carmakers to conquer Europe are unlikely to hurt Chinese EV makers today, as consumers have grown accustomed to electronics coming from China, he added.
Such failures included Brilliance in 2007, whose vehicle received one out of five stars in a German car crash test, damaging the brand.
""The fact there are more Chinese carmakers entering the market will also help us, as it will make Chinese brands more accepted by consumers,"" Klose said. 
Selling cars to Europeans is a ""tough business, especially if your product isn't well known,"" said Arnie Richters, chairman of Brussels-based industry group Platform for Electromobility. 

""But if they bring a lot of innovation they have a lot of opportunity.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. joined a protest of its drivers in Brussels on Thursday with an unprecedented suspension of its service in the Belgian capital.
Rules dating back to 1995 prohibit drivers from using smartphones, meaning those that use the Uber app to pick up customers and to drive them to their destination risk losing their vehicles, Uber said in a blog.
""This is not acceptable in 2021,"" Uber said, adding the sector had been waiting seven years for reforms.
In an email to clients, the hail-riding company said its services would be unavailable for three hours in the morning because the Brussels government had failed to present a reform plan before the summer, contrary to its pledge to do so.
Uber said the suspension was ""exceptional and unprecedented"" in Europe and that it stood with the 2,000 independent drives who use its app daily and who ""fear for their work and are worried for their future.""

During the suspension, hundreds of Uber drivers drove their cars in a procession through central Brussels to the office of the regional premier, who met a delegation.
The Brussels government said it had set out a draft law on Tuesday to reform rules for taxi and ride-hailing services.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets edged higher at the open on Thursday amid fresh indications that the labor market recovery has lost momentum this month.
Initial jobless claims rose for the third straight week to 362,000, defying expectations for a decline to 335,000. That's the first time since early in the pandemic they have risen for three weeks in a row, although the increases remain much smaller than they were last year.  The news overshadowed a minute upward revision to annualized GDP growth in the second quarter, data that is now firmly in the rear view mirror.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up  126 points or 0.4% at 34,516, but it later gave up some of the gains and was trading up 30 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.4% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.7%. 
Claims have risen steadily as Delta-variant Covid-19 has continued to disrupt both supply chains overseas and economic and social life closer to home. On top of that, consumer sentiment and spending power have weakened as the emergency uplift to unemployment benefits was withdrawn in many states. 
""The end of emergency unemployment benefits may have done more bad than good amidst a Delta- and supply-induced economic slowdown in Q3,"" said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist with Oxford Economics, via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Despite inching higher, the S&P is on track for its biggest monthly decline since March 2020, unsettled by signs of higher inflation and consequently tighter monetary policy, along with peaking earnings growth and business disruptions set to last well into next year. 
 Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock became the latest to be hit by such issues, falling 25% after the retailer reported sales and earnings well short of expectations after a quarter hit by a drop in footfall and supply chain problems that it said will likely carry on for some time. The news casts doubt over management's ability to turn around the retailer, which was supported last by retail investors who squeezed institutional short sellers hard. 
BBBY's troubles also infected Kohls (NYSE:KSS) stock, which was already under pressure after a two-notch downgrade from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Kohls stock fell 12.1%. Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) stock and Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock also fell 6% in sympathy.
Elsewhere, heavyweight tech stocks recovered somewhat after heavy losses earlier in the week, while Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock rose 11% after the Federal Aviation Administration cleared the company to carry on with its flight program after closing an inquiry into pilot conduct during its first crewed flight. 
Meanwhile,  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) stock fell another 1.1% after widespread skepticism met claims from hedge fund Citadel Securities (which is the biggest buyer of Robinhood's order flow data) that it didn't put pressure on the company to restrict trading in certain 'meme stocks' at the height of the retail investor boom in January. Materials showing that Robinhood President Jim Swartwout sold all his position in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) just before the company acted to stop the company's clients buying the stock also have also shown the company in a poor light. 
Figures out of Robinhood itself on Thursday were also discouraging: the brokerage reported a 40% decline in active daily users in the third quarter, while downloads of its app fell by 78%."

Investing.com – Bed Bath & Beyond stock (NASDAQ:BBBY) plunged nearly 25% in Thursday’s trading as supply chain issues dented its second-quarter sales and forced the retailer to cut its annual guidance.
Prices of raw materials rose, and coupled with higher freight costs, ate into the company’s profits. The retailer just about managed to report an adjusted profit.
According to Bed Bath & Beyond’s President and CEO Mark Tritton, cost inflation escalated by month, “especially later in the quarter, beyond the significant increases that we had already anticipated”.
While both sales and profit at the retailer came in below estimates, the challenging environment wasn’t unique to just Bed Bath & Beyond as the pandemic ravaged through key supply centers like Vietnam and China.
From  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to H & M (ST:HMb) to Boohoo (OTC:BHOOY), manufacturers and retailers have reported their sales being held back due to supply chain issues and restricted raw material availability.
Vietnam was forced to order the closure of factories in and around Ho Chi Minh City to curb the spread of the virus. China, too, brought back restrictions in various cities to control the spread.
Second-quarter net sales fell 26% to $1.98 billion as divestitures and closure of stores hurt. Comparable sales fell 1%. Adjusted profit was $4 million compared to $62 million in the second quarter of last year.
Consequently, the company now sees its annual revenue at $8.25 billion at center of the range compared to the $8.3 billion estimate at midpoint it had given on June 30 at the time of its first-quarter results.
Third-quarter net sales are seen at $1.98 billion at midpoint.
The company closed August with 999 stores, including 813 Bed Bath & Beyond outlets, compared to 1,004 and 818 units, respectively, at the end of May.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission on Thursday proposed extending looser state aid rules for virus-hit companies for six months to June 2022 in a bid to slowly wean them off the billions of euros provided by governments across the European Union.
The EU executive, tasked with ensuring a level playing field in the 27-country bloc, also proposed two new measures to encourage investment support and solvency support for a limited time to help Europe rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The so-called Temporary Framework, adopted in March last year and due to expire at the end of this year, has allowed EU countries to pump in more than 3 trillion euros to thousands of companies across the bloc.
""We need to be aware of disparities across member states and the need to avoid cliff-edge effects when withdrawing public support,"" Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. 
""We are therefore proposing a progressive phase-out of crisis support measures to enable member states and industry to adjust, accompanied by measures to kick-start and crowd-in private investment in the recovery phase,"" she said.

While the proposed investment support measures are aimed at a wide group of beneficiaries and should be limited in size, the solvency support measure is targeted at small- and medium-sized companies which typically rely on bank loan financing. 
A final decision will be taken once EU countries provide feedback to the proposals.

With a day to go, September lived up to its reputation as a poor month for the S&P 500, showing its worst performance since, well, last September. The MCSI Emerging Markets Index dropped 4.5% in the same period.
Especially China equity traders, tormented by months of turbulence, are desperately looking for catalysts. The National Day holiday, also known as “Golden Week,” could provide a gauge on how far consumption is from bottoming out, after strict virus controls dampened spending.
The benchmark CSI 300 index has suffered its worst quarter since March 2020, as Beijing’s crackdown on companies, China Evergrande Group’s crisis and a power crunch bruised stocks.
The good news for equity investors is that China-linked markets tend to stabilize or even recover during long Chinese holidays, historical trading analysis shows.
More broadly, over the last 10 years, emerging-market stocks have led an October charge posting an average 2.6% return, with shares in the U.S. and other developed markets also climbing. All three cohorts go on to extend those gains for the fourth quarter as a whole, with U.S. shares returning almost 5% on average, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
Of course there’s a caveat: the much-discussed wall of worry markets need to climb from central bank tapering to debt ceilings to stagflation to possible changes at the top of the Fed. But risk assets have a solid seasonal foundation to start their ascent.

The refreshed jet, named Challenger 3500, was launched earlier this month as Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) vies to protect its dominant share of the market and capitalize on higher demand for private flying during the pandemic.
Bombardier, which has focused on paying down debt after facing a cash crunch in 2015, is under constant pressure to upgrade its expensive business jets in a market where wealthy buyers demand the latest features.
The Challenger 3500 seats up to 10 passengers and comes with voice-controlled cabin systems for a number of functions like lighting and multimedia. It is also equipped with a smaller version of the chaise lounge seats found on the flagship Global 7500.

The jet, expected to enter service in the second half of 2022, will list for $26.7 million, the same price as the 350, the company has said.

The United States has said it will allow in fully vaccinated travellers from Britain and dozens of other countries in November, fully reopening Virgin Atlantic's main market for the first time in 18 months.
Virgin had been considering a float this autumn according to reports in August, but it will now wait until next year so it can focus on, and benefit from, the wider restart of travel between Britain and the U.S., the person said.
Bookings surged 600% the day when the U.S. announced the rule change, Virgin said on Sept. 21. 
The airline, which is 51% owned by Branson through his Virgin Group while U.S. group Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) owns the rest, declined to comment on its IPO plans. 

Most airlines have struggled financially during the pandemic, but the long closure of U.S. routes deepened the crisis for long-haul specialist Virgin. It survived thanks to a 1.5 billion pound rescue between Sept. 2020 and March 2021.
In addition to the IPO, Virgin was also considering other funding options, the person added.

(Reuters) -Oxford Nanopore Technologies soared 45% in its market debut on Thursday, marking London's biggest biotech listing in recent years and valuing the firm at almost 5 billion pounds ($6.84 billion).
The company specialises in DNA sequencing and provides rapid COVID-19 tests.
The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has enjoyed a strong run of IPOs this year yet biotech firms have traditionally opted to list in New York over London, or have listed on the LSE's junior AIM bourse rather than the main market.
""We went through a thorough and rigorous process and went for London,"" CEO Gordon Sanghera told journalists this month. ""For many, many reasons is the right place to float, and some of the government moves are encouraging.""
Oxford Nanopore is the LSE's first major biotech listing since 2014 when allergy specialist Circassia went public and fetched a valuation of 581 million pounds, according to Reuters Breakingviews.
""This will be seen as a vote of confidence for the London Stock Exchange as a worthy launch pad for both tech and pharmaceutical companies, particularly given the NASDAQ's dominance in this space,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said in an email.
The company reached a value of about 4.95 billion pounds at the session's high after opening 28% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of 425 pence.
Oxford Nanopore, whose stated vision is to enable the ""analysis of any living thing, by anyone, anywhere,"" sells a range of devices for DNA and RNA sequencing - an essential tool in medicine, biology and forensics.
More recently, the company has sold technology for genome sequencing of the novel coronavirus that helps identify variants, besides providing rapid COVID-19 tests to Britain's national health services.
""The company has really hit a sweet spot since it makes devices to sequence COVID variants, and it's in a sector that will only become more important, attract more attention and more investment over the coming years,"" Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said.
Oxford Nanopore sold 524 million pounds worth of shares in the IPO. It had set its issue price towards the upper end of an earlier range.

It issued 82.4 million new shares, raising 350 million pounds, while existing shareholders sold 41 million shares, it said in a statement.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>","European banks need regulation reset to catch U.S. rivals, Botin says","MADRID (Reuters) - Banks in Europe need more dynamic regulation to enable them to improve their profitability and catch up with their peers in the United States, the head of European Banking Federation (EBF), Ana Botin, said on Thursday.
Europe's banks have tended to lag their U.S. rivals in terms of valuation and profitability. They have been slower to overcome problems left over from the financial crisis a decade ago and the European banking industry remains fragmented.
""Good regulation, proportionate, flexible and dynamic regulation is the route to high standards and growth. If we don't get the balance right, we will not get the investment in the European economy all of us here want,"" Botin told a European Banking Summit hosted by the EBF.
Banking capital buffers in Europe have been much tougher than in the United States, where banks are more easily able to capitalise on the U.S. domestic market of more than 300 million people.
The European Central Bank (ECB) became the single supervisor for the main banks in the euro zone in 2014, but Europe's banking landscape remains fragmented when it comes to serving customers. Cross-border deposit transfers, for instance, are not allowed.
The completion of a full-scale banking union and agreement on a common deposit guarantee insurance scheme are also pending.
Botin, who is also the Executive Chairman of Spain's Santander (MC:SAN), the euro zone second-biggest lender in terms of market value, said a faster implementation of regulation would also help European lenders.
""Profitability is the first line of defence and we do need to see further progress in European banking market integration,"" Botin said. 
""Overall, we should ask ourselves why we have lower profitability than banks in the United States, where new rules are adapted more quickly, with more developed capital markets, with a single much larger market than we have,"" she said.

Botin added that a ""truly"" European single market for banks, eliminating the many exiting barriers to cross-border business was needed and ""crucially important"".
Santander chairman also said that lenders had to be able to compete on equal basis with both non-European banks and companies ""acting like banks.""

Investing.com – Lordstown stock (NASDAQ:RIDE) climbed by 6% in Thursday’s premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that said Foxconn (TW:2354) may buy the company’s Ohio plant to fulfill its own ambitions of making an electric vehicle.
According to the report, the announcement of the deal could come as soon as this week. The plant once belonged to General Motors (NYSE:GM) and was acquired by Lordstown in 2019.
The sale will bring in much-needed funds for Lordstown, which has warned several times that its running out of cash and may go out of business next year. The company’s electric pick-up truck, Endurance, is behind schedule and commercial deliveries are now expected to happen in next year’s second quarter, according to the company's August 11 release.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are probing the company for inaccurate statements made by the company’s previous management about pre-orders for its Endurance trucks.
The company had eased out its then CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez with immediate effect in June as part of the cleanup. Daniel Ninivaggi, former CEO of Icahn Enterprises, took over at the helm of the beleaguered company last month.
The sale will help both Foxconn and Lordstown better use the factory's capacity, given that multiple models can be made there in future.
Foxconn (TW:2354), Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) largest assembler of iPhones, is hoping to replicate its smartphone success by building clients’ electric vehicles from the chassis up, Bloomberg said."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, helped by Treasury yields slipping off highs, while investors await key economic data and news from Washington about government funding.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 140 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 16 points, or 0.4%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 60 points, or 0.4%.
The major indices suffered from heavy selling earlier this week, the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite in particular, after the 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of just under 1.57%. The move higher in yields pressured less profitable tech stocks as it makes promised future cash flows look less attractive now.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury now yields just over 1.51%, easing the pressure on such stocks.
The positive tone may prove fragile, as the opposing political factions on Capitol Hill continue their game of brinkmanship over the continued funding of the federal government.  
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Wednesday that lawmakers had reached an agreement to avoid a government shutdown on Friday, extending government spending until Dec. 3. Positive as this news may be, it merely kicks the can further down the road. Democrats continue to fight, meanwhile, over two key spending bills, running the risk that neither is passed.
There is also a full economic data slate for investors to digest Thursday, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifying in front of the House of Representatives.  
The third estimate for second-quarter GDP is expected to show quarter-on-quarter growth of 6.6%, while consumer spending is likely to have risen by 3.7% in the second quarter, slowing from the first quarter’s 6.5% growth. The widely-watched core PCE price index is expected to have grown by 6.1% in the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter, while the weekly initial jobless claims are seen coming in at 335,000.
In corporate news, home retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is due to report quarterly results before the opening bell, while used vehicle retailer CarMax (NYSE:KMX) is also due to report second-quarter earnings.
Crude prices edged lower, weighed by an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories and a strong dollar, but expectations that the market will remain in supply deficit for some time has capped the losses. 
U.S. crude inventories were up by 4.6 million barrels last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed, as production in the Gulf of Mexico largely returned to the levels before Hurricane Ida hit around a month ago.
By 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% lower at $74.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $77.89.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Supply disruptions hampered H&M's sales in September, the Swedish retailer said on Thursday, after its June-August profit surpassed expectations and pre-pandemic levels.
Disruptions to the global economy during the pandemic have upset global supply chains, leading to shortages of goods as well as containers, storage and drivers for the transportation of goods, and causing a spike in shipping costs. 
""Sales in September 2021 were slightly higher than in the corresponding month the previous year in local currencies, even though demand was not able to be fully met because of disruption and delays in product flow,"" H&M said.
Chief Executive Helena Helmersson told analysts and media bottlenecks affecting H&M were mainly in production, transport and ports. She said the situation was now improving at the supplier end but that H&M was bracing for more delays in deliveries in the current quarter. 
Fiscal third-quarter pretax profit at the world's second-biggest fashion retailer jumped 158% from a year earlier to 6.09 billion Swedish crowns. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 5.05 billion crown profit.
Compared to the same quarter in 2019, before the pandemic, profit was up 22%. 
""The H&M group’s increase in profit for the quarter is mainly a result of well-received collections with more full-price sales, lower markdowns and good cost control,"" Chief Executive Helena Helmersson said in a statement. 
H&M said around 50 of its 5,000 stores remained temporarily closed currently, against 180 at the start of June. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, most stores were closed due to lockdowns and restrictions. 
H&M said an advantageous U.S. dollar exchange rate had in its third quarter offset substantially higher prices for shipping and raw materials, but warned: 
""As the positive U.S. dollar effect subsides and the high shipping and raw materials prices remain, the overall market situation for purchasing costs in the fourth quarter will gradually become less positive.""
Prices for cotton are rising on strong Chinese demand and unfavourable weather in key growing regions.
The group proposed paying a dividend for 2020 of 6.50 crowns per share in November. It had said in July that prospects of paying a dividend in the autumn were very good, after it failed to propose one at its annual general meeting in May.
H&M's shares were roughly unchanged at 0915 GMT. 

Market leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, earlier this month also reported quarterly profits above pre-pandemic levels. 
Helmerssom told analysts and media its situation remained complex in China, where the group is suffering a backlash over comments made in 2019 about workers' rights in the Xinjiang province.

Investing.com – Virgin Galactic stock (NYSE:SPCE) soared by more than 9% in Thursday’s premarket trading as the U.S. aviation safety regulator closed its probe into the company’s last spaceflight and gave it the go-ahead to resume launches.
The Federal Aviation Administration was probing the company’s July 11 launch of its first fully-crewed spaceflight, Unity 22, for deviating from its assigned path during its descent back to Earth.
The much-awaited first fully-crewed spaceflight by the company carried its founder and billionaire Richard Branson. The company had also failed to report the error to the FAA as required.
Virgin Galactic said the regulator accepted the proposed changes to how it operates space missions. They include designating a larger area as protected airspace to allow for a variety of trajectories during missions and taking steps to ensure the company communicates with FAA air-traffic control about flights as they take place.
The company said it continues to focus on its pre-flight readiness for Unity 23.
According to a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report in August, Virgin’s sole mothership, Eve, and the Unity spaceship are due to be temporarily grounded for maintenance. While they are grounded, there will be no spaceflight by the company. Virgin is also developing its Delta-class spaceship, which will have a shorter turnaround time."

Investing.com –  Boohoo  stock (LON:BOOH) slumped by almost 12% in London Thursday after the U.K.-based fast-fashion company sprang a surprise by revising its annual guidance lower.
The company behind young women-focused brand Nasty Gal is known to set stiff targets for itself and also meet them.
Boohoo blamed pandemic-related challenges and higher shipping and wage costs for its decision.
It now expects full-year sales to grow 20%-25% compared to the 25% growth it so far anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA margins are seen at 9.25% at the midpoint of the guidance range, compared to an earlier estimate of 9.75%.  
In the six months ended August 31, Boohoo’s revenue rose 20% on-year to 975.9 million pounds ($1.30 billion). Gross margin eroded by 40 basis points to 54.6% as the company had to spend more on marketing and shipping to overcome pandemic-induced tightness in the freight market.   
The company said consumer demand, which improved through August, was keeping its momentum in September as well.
Boohoo’s results compare to 9% growth in third-quarter sales at much-bigger rival H&M (ST:HMb). The Swedish retailing giant benefited from straddling both online and offline platforms. Online sales rose 22%.
H&M said the new autumn collections have been well received and September sales were better than previous year but also warned that it was being held back by supply chain challenges."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Telecoms group Bharti Airtel said on Thursday it will invest 50 billion rupees ($673 million) in expanding its data centre business to meet customer demand in and around India.
Airtel Business chief executive Ajay Chitkara said its Nxtra unit will make the investment by 2025, with plans to build a data centre economy across 80 Indian cities, adding that the move will triple its installed capacity to more than 400 MW.
""There is a huge potential and huge demand (for data centres) which is expected in the next three to four years time,"" Chitkara told a virtual news conference.
Nxtra currently runs 10 large and 120 edge data centres, or smaller data processing facilities, across India and the expansion is part of a strategy by telcos to add new revenue streams to their business and lure enterprise clients who typically offer higher margins.
The business plan also comes at a time when traditional voice services face new competition from free calls on apps such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s WhatsApp and Signal.
An affiliate of U.S. private equity group Carlyle last year bought a 25% stake in Nxtra. Airtel still owns 75%.
Public cloud spending in India is expected to exceed $12 billion by 2025, Naveen Mishra of research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) said.

Airtel's rival Reliance Jio, which is controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, forged an alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 2019 to build data centres across India and this year partnered with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to boost its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
Separately, Airtel said Nxtra will increase the use of green energy for its data centres, aiming to source 50% of its power requirements from renewable sources.

LONDON (Reuters) -British online fashion retailer Boohoo warned on Thursday that full year profit margins will be lower than its previous guidance due to a rise in freight costs in its supply chain and higher wages for its distribution centre workers.
Shares in the group dropped 11%, extending year-on-year losses to 37% after it said full year 2021-22 adjusted EBITDA margins were now expected to be 9% to 9.5%, compared to 9.5% to 10% previously guided.
""Elevated short-term cost headwinds experienced in the first half are expected to continue in H2 alongside recent freight inflation in our supply chain and wage inflation within our distribution centres,"" it said.
The group, which is seeking to improve its image after negative publicity over supply chain failings, also raised its guidance for full year capital expenditure to 275 million pounds ($376.2 million) from up to 250 million previously.
It plans to open a new distribution centre in North America in 2023.
Boohoo made adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 85.1 million pounds in the six months to Aug. 31, down 5% on the same period last year, reflecting 26 million pounds of additional freight and logistics costs.
First half sales rose 20% to 975.9 million pounds and are forecast to be up 20% to 25% over the full year, implying growth of 20% to 30% in the second half.
Boohoo said consumer demand had improved through both August and September.
Finance chief Neil Catto told Reuters the firm was in ""fairly good shape"" as regards seasonal workers for its distribution centres, though it still needed to recruit another 1,000 in Britain's tight labour market.
""We're attracting the staff with higher wages and potentially some bonuses,"" he told Reuters.
He said Boohoo's current season prices are ""a few percent"" higher year-on-year due to the elevated import costs.
Catto added that Boohoo planned to maintain delivery options through peak trading periods in line with previous years.
On Wednesday Next warned labour shortages could impact Christmas deliveries.

In January, Boohoo purchased the Debenhams brand out of administration for 55 million pounds and in February bought the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from the administrators of Arcadia for 25.2 million pounds.

At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%.
European equity indices are still recovering from Tuesday’s rout, prompted by higher U.S. bond yields, which saw the DAX and CAC 40 drop over 2% in Europe and the Nasdaq Composite slump 2.8%, its largest selloff since March, on Wall Street.
Helping the tone were the latest revision to U.K. quarterly GDP figures, which showed that the U.K. economy grew 5.5% in the second quarter, a sharp improvement from the 1.6% fall the previous quarter, with government spending, exports and business investment all stronger than previously estimated. However, the data is now three months old. More up-to-date numbers released on Thursday showed house price growth almost came to a standstill in August.
French consumer spending rose 1.0% month-on-month in August, substantially above July’s drop of 2.4%, while the country’s annual inflation rate rose to 2.7% in September, slightly less than expected but still its highest rate in nearly a decade. Germany's jobless numbers, meanwhile, fell by a seasonally-adjusted 30,000 this month, roughly in line with expectations.

 Boohoo  (LON:BOOH) stock slumped 9.7% after the online fashion retailer warned that freight inflation and higher wages would hit full-year profit margins. It also revised down its sales growth guidance for the year, suggesting that the reopening of rivals' stores and the hangover from a scandal over low pay in its supply chain have hurt its business.
More broadly, doubts remain about the strength of China’s economic expansion. The country’s factory activity contracted in September for the first time since Covid-19 began in 2020, with its manufacturing purchasing managers index falling to 49.6 in September, from 50.1 in August.
Also of concern was a report from Reuters that some of China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) offshore bondholders have not received interest payments due by the end of Wednesday New York time, meaning that the highly indebted property giant has missed its second debt obligation this month.
Crude prices edged higher despite official figures showing an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories as production in the Gulf of Mexico returned to near-normal. U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.6 million barrels last week, data from the Energy Information Administration showed, compared with expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel drop.

The bank, which had promoted its branches as ""community-focussed spaces"" to ""brighten ... lives"", said customer's willingness to bank online or using their mobile phones had prompted it to scale back.
Announcing the cuts, it said there was an ever greater willingness to use ""digital self-service"".
It will close 31 of its 162 branches in the coming months. It will also cut its office space, a move the bank said would give staff greater flexibility around their working location. 
Several banks paused branch closures in the early months of the pandemic but several have resumed cutbacks. 
Earlier this year, HSBC announced plans to cut 82 branches. In the second half of 2020 Britain’s biggest domestic lender Lloyds (LON:LLOY) resumed plans to cut 56 branches and Sabadell’s TSB announced it was axing 164 branches. 
Such closures are controversial because they can hurt some customers, who prefer branches to the internet.
When Clydesdale Bank merged with Virgin Money (LON:VM) in 2018 the group had a combined total of 245 branches but that will fall to 131 after these latest closures. 
Earlier this year, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority told banks to rethink moves to close branches during the pandemic lockdown, fearing it could be to the detriment of customers.
Virgin said the closures would trigger a restructuring charge of 25 million pounds ($34 million) in the fourth quarter. It will also book a 20 million pound charge from cutting back and modifying its office space. 

The bank said its restructuring charges for 2021 as a whole will now be 145 million pounds in total.

Shares in the initial public offering priced at 425 pence each, in the top half of an initial range, according to a statement Thursday. Oxford Nanopore raised 350 million pounds selling new stock, while its backers offloaded existing shares worth 174 million pounds. 
The University of Oxford spinoff’s holders sold more shares in the IPO than planned due to high demand. The  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).-backed company provides Covid-19 test kits to Britain’s National Health Service, and its sequencing technology has been used by researchers to characterize the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to identify and track variants. 
Oxford Nanopore has added about $1 billion to its market value since its last funding round in May, placing it among the U.K.’s most valuable startups. The IPO is an important win for London’s ambitions to boost its profile as a hub for innovative businesses.
The company has also given Gordon Sanghera, its founder and chief executive officer, a special class of shares with extra power to block an unwanted takeover. Though panned by some investors for diluting voting rights, there are plans to allow multiple classes of shares on the London Stock Exchange’s top-tier premium market.
For now, Oxford Nanopore is relegated to the bourse’s standard segment, which means it is ineligible for certain major benchmarks like the FTSE Russell indexes. Trading in the stock begins Thursday on the LSE.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are global coordinators of the offering.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Plc, Berenberg, Guggenheim Securities, Numis Corp Plc and RBC Capital Markets are joint bookrunners.

Recovery in Europe has been ahead of its own expectations, while in North America, despite supply constraints, the business has been ""performing strongly"", the company said in a statement ahead of its annual general meeting later in the day.
Sales at bars and restaurants, hit by COVID-led restrictions last year, are recovering strongly in both regions as higher vaccination rates encourage more people to venture out.
Sales in Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean markets are also performing well, but Diageo warned it expects some volatility in these markets to persist.

""We have made a strong start to fiscal '22 ... as we benefit from resilience in the off-trade (retail) and continued recovery in the on-trade (bars and restaurants),"" Chief Executive Ivan Menezes said.
The company is also benefiting from customers trading up to more premium drinks and from a rise in sales through higher margin channels such as e-commerce, Menezes added.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 02:57AM ET</span>",Pandemic recovery fuels deal craze as third-quarter M&A breaks all records,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Anirban Sen
LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions hit new record highs in the third quarter as companies and investors shaped their post-COVID future through transformative deals while their advisers struggled to cope with transaction volumes never seen before.
A frantic summer of merger activity produced deals worth $1.52 trillion in the three months to Sept. 27, up 38% from the same quarter last year and more than any other quarter on record, according to Refinitiv data.
Third-quarter volumes drove global M&A activity in the first nine months of 2021 to an unprecedented record of $4.33 trillion, overtaking an all-time annual peak of $4.1 trillion hit before the financial crisis in 2007 and forcing investment banks to hike pay for overworked and disgruntled junior staff.
""The path to recovery is increasingly clear and people are looking beyond COVID,"" said Birger Berendes who co-heads M&A in EMEA at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
""Investors are flush with cash and want companies to look for acquisitions in areas where they need to grow or add capabilities and services rather than just paying dividends or buying back shares.""
Third-quarter volumes doubled in Europe with $473 billion worth of M&A deals compared with the same quarter last year while the United States was up 32% to $581 billion and Asia Pacific rose 21% to $365 billion.
""M&A is a confidence game. Both corporates and sponsors feel very good about the current environment and that's why they are aggressively pursuing opportunities before there is a market correction,"" said Dirk Albersmeier, global co-head of M&A at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
""Investors are sensitive about factors like inflation, interest rate developments and increased regulatory scrutiny,"" he added.
While U.S. President Joe Biden's upcoming tax reforms are likely to increase the cost of doing deals, top M&A bankers said they do not expect a slowdown in deal-making in the near term.
""The new tax policy is not even a discussion point. Not impacting deals, whatsoever - probably a reflection on how people feel about the likelihood that it's going to come into fruition next year,"" said Mark Bekheit, an M&A partner at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.
While the market for blank-cheque companies has faced headwinds, a $32.6 billion SPAC deal led by Lionheart Acquisition Corp II for U.S. firm MSP Recovery topped up the quarterly charts.
Other sizable deals include Square's $29 billion takeover of Afterpay, Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY)'s spinoff of Universal Music Group (AS:UMG) and an 18.4 billion-pound swoop by U.S. sports betting firm DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) on  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) owner Entain.
ANIMAL SPIRITS 
Progress made by Western economies to vaccinate their adult population and the easing of COVID restrictions during the summer fuelled animal spirits with bidding wars erupting among private equity firms for control of listed companies including British supermarket group Morrisons.
Private equity buyouts surged 133% to $818 billion in the first nine months of the year as investment firms rushed to deploy cash, often paying rich prices to take assets off the public markets.
Bankers say private equity firms have learnt how to calculate risk after the financial crises.
""There is a clear recognition that valuations are very high at the moment. Funds are pursuing opportunities where they have conviction they can add value,"" said Anna Skoglund, head of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' financial and strategic investor group in EMEA.
""We have moved away from opportunistic, more financially driven transactions to thematic investing and platform building.""
The shopping spree is expected to continue as the Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme has helped push interest rates to all-time lows, offering cheap debt-financing to would-be acquirers.
""The rationale is pretty straightforward - we're really awash in liquidity,"" said Mark Shafir, global co-head of M&A at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
""You've got an incredibly hospitable fixed-income market in terms of rates and availability. So there's plenty of opportunity to do deals.""
CARPE DIEM
Deal-making surged in most sectors of the economy, especially the technology industry - where software deals more than tripled in the first nine months of the year - as well as energy and power with companies accelerating their move into renewables projects as part of their transition to a net-zero future.
Dealmakers say that while carefully pondering risk, corporate buyers have become more nimble to take advantage of opportunities and better compete with private equity in fast-paced auctions.
""Boards continue to assess multiple options to implement their strategic objectives. Clients are being very thoughtful about using M&A to accelerate their strategy where they see the opportunity to do so,"" said Omar Faruqui, co-head of EMEA M&A at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
As the threat of activist shareholders resurfaces, bankers say the pipeline ahead will also include spinoffs to unlock value trapped in profitable units and take advantage of buoyant stock markets.
Activist funds are carefully watching how companies are navigating the challenges of adjusting their business models to the post-COVID world and will be a key factor in driving change.

""Market dislocations cause a decline in activism. Not surprisingly, when the pandemic hit you saw a real pullback,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s David Rosewater, a managing director of the activist defense group.
""As the market came back, you saw activism come back and reward additional opportunities.""

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 02:23AM ET</span>",How global supply chains are falling out of fashion,"By Elisa Anzolin and Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - Fashion brands like Benetton are increasingly turning away from globe-spanning supply chains and low-cost manufacturing hubs in Asia, in a shift that could prove a lasting legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Italy's Benetton is bringing production closer to home, boosting manufacturing in Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt, with the aim of halving production in Asia from the end of 2022, Chief Executive Massimo Renon told Reuters. 
Renon gave an insight into the economics driving a trend affecting much of the industry as strained supply lines have driven up shipping costs and times, undermining a business model that's proved popular for the past 30 years.
""It's a strategic decision to have more control on the production process and also on transport costs,"" he said, adding the group had already shifted more than 10% of output out of countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, China and India this year.
""Today a shipping container that used to cost $1,200-1,500 can cost $10,000-15,000, with no certainty of a delivery date."" 
The tenfold jump in sea freight costs has been driven by a scarcity of available vessels, as many were idled during the pandemic, coupled with rebounding consumer demand, said Renon, whose company makes most of its sales in Europe but has shifted production to lower-wage countries since the early 2000s. 
This shipping quandary is roiling several companies in the clothes, and wider consumer, industry. Hugo Boss is also looking to bring manufacturing operations closer to its markets, for example, while more immediately Lululemon, Gap and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) say they'll rely more heavily on far costlier air freight to avoid running out of stock during the holiday season.
Renon, who took the helm of Benetton last year, faces the task of reviving the fortunes of the company which made its name in the 1980s with its signature bold colours.
He said that even if production costs remained 20% lower in Vietnam and Bangladesh versus Mediterranean countries, that benefit was offset by longer lead times sparked by supply snags.
""From an average lead time of 4-5 months, today we can reach 7-8 months (from Asia) given the lack of ships.""
By contrast, when clothes are produced in Egypt, delivery to warehouses and stores in Europe can be shortened to 2 or 2-1/2 months, Renon said. In the case of wool garments, which it produces in Serbia and Croatia, it can take just 4-5 weeks, he added. 
In those two countries, as well as in Tunisia, Benetton plans to ramp up production at its own sites, while in Egypt and Turkey it is working with suppliers. 
'MORE THINGS GO WRONG'
Strategies vary across the clothes industry, though. Market leader and fast-fashion pioneer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), owner of Zara, bases 53% of its production relatively nearby - in its home market Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey, according to its 2020 annual report.
By comparison, its main competitor H&M relies on Asia for about 70% of its production, according to analysts. Critics of this approach say it puts the company at a disadvantage to nimbler rivals in terms of getting new fashions into stores.
H&M declined to comment ahead of its quarterly results on Thursday, while Inditex did not reply to a request for more information about its supply chain. 
For those players who decide to move manufacturing closer to their markets, or ""nearshoring"", the investments involved mean there is unlikely to be any reversal in the near future. 
Advisory firm AlixPartners said the shift towards more regional or even national supply chains was here to stay. 
""The more global supply chains are, the more things can and will go wrong,"" it said in its report on the disruption caused by COVID-19. 
New Hugo Boss CEO Daniel Grieder said this month that he expected to produce more goods closer to where they were sold in future. He added that the company has its own manufacturing facility in Turkey, produced parts of shoes in Italy, and made-to-measure suits at its headquarters in Metzingen, Germany. 
""We will expand this (nearshoring) considerably. Then we can also react faster to trends and more flexibly to bottlenecks. That is a real competitive advantage,"" he told Manager Magazin. 
LOOKING TO THE SKIES
In some countries like Vietnam, factory closures have added to the pressure.  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), which makes about half of its footwear there, cut sales expectations last week and warned of delays during the holiday shopping season. 
Lululemon said this month it was working on shifting production out of Vietnam wherever possible, increasing the use of air freight and prioritising production for key fall holiday styles to mitigate its supply chain woes. 
Gap says it is also investing in air freight as it deals with delayed inventory deliveries due to shipping congestion and pandemic-led factory closures in countries it sources from.
It's not cheap, though; shipping an entire ocean container load of goods by air is over eight times more expensive, while for smaller shipments it is about five to six times costlier than current ocean freight rates, said Judah Levine, head of research at global freight booking platform Freightos. 
Retailers are mainly looking to use the air option for smaller and higher-margin products such as apparel, computers and accessories and smaller household goods, data from research firm Cargo Facts showed. 
There are also other factors at play in the nascent industry drift from Asia.
Even before COVID-19, rising labour costs in the region were chipping away at its low-cost lustre for Western brands.
Real wage growth across the world rose between 1.6% and 2.2% in the four years preceding the pandemic, with the growth in the Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe regions outstripping those in the rest of Europe and North America, according to the International Labour Organization's Global Wage Report 2020/21
""The cost gap has narrowed significantly,"" said Lorenzo Novella, a director at AlixPartners in Milan specialising in the retail sector, adding that high turnover among factory workers in China also made the level of service there less reliable. 
Benetton CEO Renon said that customers were now also prioritising quality over price. 
""The race amid apparel companies for rock bottom prices today seems to be secondary. Consumers are more quality-conscious, and want their garments to last longer,"" he said. 

For family-owned Benetton, based in Italy's northeastern Veneto region, the production shift is part of a drive to return to profitability. The chain, which counts around 4,000 shops of which 1,500 are directly owned and the others operated by franchise, has posted an annual loss for the past eight years. 
Attempts at turning it around have been hampered by the pandemic, even though Renon said the group was confident it could have a ""very good Christmas"" and get back in the black soon.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Thursday, continuing to stabilize after the sharp losses earlier this week, but doubts about China’s economic expansion remain.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.7% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
European investors are set to trade with a positive tone Thursday, still recovering from Tuesday’s rout, prompted by higher U.S. bond yields, which saw the DAX and CAC 40 drop over 2% in Europe and the Nasdaq Composite slump 2.8%, its largest selloff since March, on Wall Street.
Companies are beginning to position for a post-Covid future with global mergers and acquisitions hitting new record highs in the third quarter. Refinitiv data showed M&A deals totalled $1.52 trillion in the three months to Sept. 27, up 38% from the same quarter last year and more than any other quarter on record.
Helping the tone were the latest U.K. quarterly GDP figures, which showed that the U.K. economy grew 5.5% in the second quarter, more than expected and a sharp improvement from the 1.6% fall the previous quarter.
However, these gains in Europe are tentative as doubts remain about the strength of China’s economic recovery, the second largest economy in the world, and the main regional driver.
The country’s factory activity contracted in September for the first time since Covid-19 began in 2020, with its manufacturing purchasing managers index falling to 49.6 in September, from 50.1 in August.
Also of concern was a report from Reuters that some of China Evergrande Group's offshore bondholders have not received interest payments due by the end of Wednesday New York time, meaning that the highly indebted property giant has missed its second debt obligation this month.
The European economic data slate is pretty full Thursday, with French consumer spending, German unemployment numbers and preliminary consumer price inflation numbers from France, Germany and Italy also due.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive-The king of oil bets on batteries for a green world,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Alex Beard is losing his thirst for oil. 
Once one of the world's most powerful oil traders, the former Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) executive is now raising money to build a portfolio of strategic battery sites across the United Kingdom to support the renewable energy industry.
In his first interview since leaving the commodities giant in 2019, billionaire Beard said his Adaptogen Capital investment fund planned to build storage with a capacity of at least 500 megawatts (MW) to power homes when grid supplies fall short.
In his heyday at Glencore, Beard's team was trading as much as 7% of the world's oil. The fact he is turning to infrastructure to support renewables is another sign of the way the wind is blowing for the global energy industry.
""I have time for a second career in energy markets. It won't be oil and gas but it will be the transition away from carbon that will be most relevant for the next 25 years,"" he told Reuters at his offices off Regent Street in London.
Adaptogen Capital's fund raising drive comes at a time when the United Kingdom's energy industry is facing one of its worst crises for decades. A perfect storm of low gas supplies globally has sent prices surging while wind and nuclear power have been unable to take up the slack.
""The current crisis gives you a taste of what we will be experiencing more and more often,"" said Beard, who is 54. ""Batteries provide you with stability when the grid becomes unstable and are key enabling assets in the energy transition.""
As economies move away from fossil fuels, power grids are becoming increasingly important and governments and companies are looking at how to make them more resilient to avoid the supply outages and price volatility that have plagued networks from China to California in the past year. 
Supplies of renewable energy like wind and solar can fluctuate wildly depending on the weather and the peaks and troughs don't necessarily correspond with demand so battery storage has long been seen as a way to help cushion shocks.
'VOLATILITY BOX'
At the moment, the United Kingdom has 1.1 gigawatts (GW) of operational battery capacity to store power that can then be fed back into the grid when required. An additional 15 GW of capacity is under construction or being planned, much of it by companies also investing in renewable power assets.
Beard said Adaptogen's 500 MW of storage will use lithium-ion battery technology. That would be enough to supply about 750,000 homes in the United Kingdom, according to a Reuters calculation based on  National Grid  (LON:NG) data.
The National Grid has estimated that under a scenario where the country decarbonises rapidly, it could need more than 40 GW of storage capacity by 2050. 
""The world has learnt how to build renewables at a large scale and now we need to build enough storage to accelerate that transition to net zero,"" said Beard.
He also said renewable power companies have a long way to go to fully understand and integrate trading and price volatility into their operations - the kind of risks that have felled nine energy suppliers in Britain this month as wholesale power and gas prices soar.
At the moment, renewable power companies rarely face spot price risks as they operate under government-guaranteed contracts, which has allowed them to stay competitive with fossil fuels, he said. 
But as renewable output grows and government price support expires, the green energy industry would face a steep learning curve to understand how to hedge price volatility better, said Beard, who spent much of his career as a trader.
""Batteries can also be viewed as a volatility trading box for the green energy industry and a crucial asset to add to wind and solar generation,"" he said.
The battery response to supply and demand takes milliseconds and can be executed by algorithmic software to take advantage of power market volatility, as opposed to analogue instructions to ramp up output at a traditional fossil-fuel power plant.
Beard, who holds a stake of about 2% in Glencore worth $1.2 billion at current prices, has also co-sponsored Energy Transition Partners, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listed in Amsterdam.
The blank cheque company raised 175 million euros ($205 million) when it went public in July and is looking at targets in the renewables, electric vehicles and storage asset sectors.

Beard says oil and gas will continue to play a vital part in global energy supply but renewables will grow faster and hundreds of billions of dollars will be spent on the energy transition away from carbon in the coming years.

1517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 01:54AM ET</span>",Schumer Says Deal Has Been Made to Avoid Government Shutdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday lawmakers had reached an agreement to avoid a government shutdown on Friday, extending government spending until Dec. 3.
The legislation, scheduled for a Senate vote Thursday morning, though important, will resolve perhaps the least of Schumer’s worries. 
Federal agencies, pushed to the brink of the end of the fiscal year, had been preparing for a shutdown of non-essential parts of the government after Senate Democrats failed to push through a stopgap measure that included a suspension of the debt ceiling. Sixty votes are required to proceed on most legislation in the evenly divided Senate. 
Stripped of divisive language, the stopgap spending bill should easily pass both chambers. But the threat of a catastrophic default is less than three weeks away and Democrats still have no solution to that problem. 
At the same time, the main pieces of President Joe Biden’s massive domestic agenda remain mired in Congress over internecine Democratic squabbles, and had been shadowed by the threat of a shutdown.   
“Now, we are ready to move forward,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “We have an agreement on the C.R., the continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown and we should be voting on that tomorrow morning.”
The House on Wednesday approved a stand-alone debt limit measure, but that, too, is almost certain to fail in the Senate. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that without congressional action, the U.S. risks a disastrous default around Oct. 18.  
Republicans have said they won’t vote for an increase to the government’s borrowing ability as Democrats prepare to spend $3.5 trillion on social programs via separate legislation.
Democrats themselves remain at odds on that plan. The U.S. House is scheduled to vote Thursday on Biden’s $550 billion infrastructure package, but progressive Democrats have pledged to vote it down without action on the broader social-spending measure.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2021 01:22AM ET</span>","HSBC, BlackRock, Nestle to help design nature-driven risk framework","By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) are among the companies seeking to create a risk management and disclosure framework aimed at moving capital away from activities that damage nature.
The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was launched in June to tackle nature loss, which it says poses significant risk to corporate and financial stability. It said on Thursday that senior executives from up to 35 companies would aim to create the new draft framework for launch in early 2022.
The TNFD will be voluntary and aims to follow in the footsteps of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), championed by United Nations climate envoy Mark Carney and which is increasingly being made mandatory.
While TCFD requires companies to disclose risks connected to climate change, such as the impact of rising sea levels on a factory located near the coast, many of which are also connected to nature, the TNFD will go further in its scope.
Nature-related issues that could affect a company's share price include those such as deforestation, water shortages or the potential hit to food producers if declining bee numbers impact the pollination of plants which they rely upon.
Alongside the other Taskforce members, which also include Nestle, Citi and  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN), a further 200 institutions have expressed interest in joining the TNFD Forum, which will assist the work of the Taskforce.
""The business and financial world's race towards net zero emissions will only succeed if they race equally fast towards nature-positivity,"" TNFD Co-Chairs Elizabeth Mrema and David Craig said in a statement.

Each Taskforce member would be part of one of five working groups focused on defining nature-related risks, assessing the available data, looking at current standards and metrics, developing the beta framework and pilot testing it.
""The financial rationale for managing nature-related risks is increasingly clear now, but the information for identifying and acting on the risks in practice is not easily available,"" Herry Cho, Head of Sustainability and Sustainable Finance, Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY), said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australia is set for its best year ever in M&A activity despite extended pandemic-induced lockdowns in its most populous states as cash-rich corporates and funds scoop up assets, with bankers seeing no sign of the momentum slowing.
Deals involving Australian companies totalled $329.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021, up nearly six times year-on-year and exceeding the same-period amount of the previous three years combined, Refinitiv data showed. The previous annual record was $139 billion in 2007.
The volumes were driven by a number of mega deals targeting listed infrastructure and resources firms.
Those included BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s proposed $86 billion unification of its dual-listed company structure and the $14 billion sale of its petroleum business to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum.
Infrastructure assets in Australia were particularly attractive to superannuation and pension funds, which are eager to deploy their low-cost capital for stable, long-term gains, bankers said.
""Investors into semi-regulated infrastructure assets have high confidence in the future cash flows of the assets they are buying,"" said Nick Sims, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Australia co-head of investment banking.
Goldman led the league table for announced M&A deals in Asia Pacific, followed by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and UBS.
""Rates are going to stay low for the foreseeable future, if they do increase it will be at a slow pace, so infrastructure investors are investing with a long-term time frame,"" Sims added.
The deals were struck while many states in the country have been in and out of strict lockdowns since the onset of COVID-19.
""The lockdowns and the uncertainty around the demand side has really led corporate leaders to take a strategic reset of sorts,"" said Alex Cartel,  Citigroup 's (n:C) Australia head of investment banking. 
""You had a number of corporates, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds with access to capital markets, that had strategic ambitions that have said let's get going.""
'PENT-UP DEMAND'
Deals targeting Australian companies, at $200 billion, made up 20% of the region's overall value, the second highest after China, compared to just 4% in the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.
Tom Barsha, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s co-head of M&A in Asia Pacific, said Australia represented ""a real shift"" in the overall relative contribution to Asia Pacific volumes.
""There are a number of factors all coming together, including some pent-up demand from last year. Also noteworthy is the level of cross-border inbound activity. I'm not seeing signs of activity slowing down."" 
U.S. payments firm  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) made the year's biggest foray into Australia in August with the $29 billion acquisition of local fintech firm Afterpay.
Overall Asia Pacific deals reached a record $1.25 trillion from January to September, up 46% year-on-year, with Southeast Asia and private equity-backed transactions also scoring new highs, Refinitiv data showed. 

Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS, said more assets owned by private equity firms were set to be put on sale, while mergers between special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and their targets would likely be another volume driver. 
""In addition, China could well come back with outbound deals by state-owned companies,"" he said. ""2022 could well be another blowout year for M&A.""

(Reuters) - Initial public offerings (IPO) globally slowed in the third quarter of 2021 from their previous frenetic pace, but the number of listings in the first nine months of the year still was the highest since the dotcom bubble of 2000, according to Refinitiv data.
IPOs in the third quarter raised a total of about $94.6 billion, down 26.3% from the second quarter, as activity cooled due to a summer slowdown and U.S. scrutiny of Chinese listings following Beijing's crackdown on DiDi Global Inc just days after its New York IPO.
More than 2,000 IPOs have raised a combined $421 billion globally year-to-date, a record high, as private companies rushed to attain the soaring valuations of their publicly listed peers. That was more than double the proceeds raised during the same period last year. 
This number includes IPOs of 486 special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that went public in the first nine months of the year, raising a total of $127.7 billion.
""After record levels of SPAC IPO activity in the first quarter, that market has taken a needed pause. However, we are seeing early signs of that market begin to normalize and open up for the right issuers,"" said David Ludwig, global head of equity capital markets at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
Among the third quarter's high-profile IPOs were trading app  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD)'s $2.1 billion listing in New York and South Korean software company Krafton Inc that raised more than $3.7 billion on the Korean stock exchange.
The largest IPO this year so far is Tencent-backed Chinese online video company Kuaishou Technology Co Ltd's $5.4 billion offering. 
In July, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler asked for a ""pause"" in U.S. IPOs of Chinese companies and sought more transparency about their offshore structures and regulatory risk they face in China. Chinese listings in the United States came to a standstill as a result. In the first seven months of 2020, Chinese listings had reached a record $12.8 billion.[L1N2PU1GE]
Tech listings remained investor darlings even as valuations were scrutinised more closely. But a greater mix of sectors were among stock market debutantes. In Europe, Taylor Swift's record label Universal made a highly anticipated debut on the Amsterdam bourse, the most valuable company to list on the continent this year. 

Volvo Cars is also expected to launch an IPO while Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) is expected to list its trucks unit to diversify the offering for stock market investors. 
Ludwig said IPO activity in the fourth quarter could pick up. ""The backlog (of IPOs) across the street is very robust, across regions and sectors,"" he said.

The world's no.4 iron ore miner announced the suspension earlier in the day, citing a ""significant incident"" at the site.
In a brief update, Fortescue confirmed a fatality and said it was working with all relevant authorities on the matter. 
It had earlier said operations at Solomon Hub had been suspended pending a full investigation and that it was working with the Western Australia police and the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety.
The state's mining department told Reuters it was aware of a significant incident at the mine site, but did not divulge any more details.

The mining department will send safety inspectors from Perth to the scene, expected to arrive in the evening, it added.
The Solomon Hub, a remote mining site in Pilbara, comprises of Firetail, Kings Valley and Queens Valley mines, which together have a production capacity of 75 million tonnes of iron ore a year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Golden Week holiday this year is unlikely to see domestic travel rebound to pre-COVID levels, industry estimates show, hurt by uncertainty over pandemic curbs and consumer fears about the health of the economy.
The seven-day holiday from Oct. 1 to mark the founding of modern China is traditionally one of its busiest times for travel and is closely watched as a barometer of consumer demand in the world's second-largest economy.
Chinese travel booking site LY.com said it is expecting some 650 million trips, about 80% of the number made for the same period in 2019 and the lowest level since 2017. That is only a tad higher than the 637 million trips made last year when the holiday was eight days long.
""The impact of COVID-19 is big and is long,"" said Zhang Qidi, visiting researcher at the Center of International Finance Studies at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing. 
""Citizens are heavily indebted because of their home and car loans and that has resulted in a decline in disposable income.""
While China's economy has rebounded from last year's coronavirus-led slump, momentum in that recovery has slowed over the past few months - in part due to COVID-19 curbs imposed in several provinces and more recently due to power shortages. 
For those who are travelling, cheaper shorter trips are in vogue.
Online searches for ""niche travel destination"" have surged in the run-up to the holiday, according to Chinese lifestyle site Little Red Book, and domestic online travel company Trip.com Group said last week that more than half of the tourists using its platform were preferring to take shorter distance trips.

""Going to fifth-tier cities is the new choice for the long holiday,"" Trip.com said in a report, referring to some of the country's least-developed and rural areas. 
China's commerce ministry said this month it would strengthen efforts to boost consumer spending. At least 20 local governments have handed out coupons that can used at shopping malls, convenience stores and restaurants to encourage spending from late September's Mid-Autumn Festival through to Golden Week, state media has said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Thursday morning, with China releasing mixed economic data and investors assessed the challenges ahead as the third quarter draws to a close.
China’s Shanghai Composite slid 1.83% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component jumped 1.28%. Data released earlier in the day showed that September’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was at a lower-than-expected 49.6. However, the non-manufacturing PMI and the Caixin manufacturing PMI were at a better-than-expected 53.2 and 50 respectively.
China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt woes also continued to be on investors’ minds, with the People’s Bank of China injecting liquidity into the financial system on Wednesday ahead of a week-long holiday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.19%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.38%, with industrial production contracting a bigger-than-expected 3.2% month-on-month in August. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Fumio Kishida as its new leader on Wednesday, with Kishida likely to be the country’s next prime minister.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.46%, with building approvals growing 6.8% month-on-month while private sector credit grew 0.6% month-on-month in August.
Although concerns about global economic growth amid inflationary pressures alongside a looming energy crisis, supply chain bottlenecks, and regulatory risks in China remain, some investors remained cautiously optimistic.
“Growth has clearly hit an air pocket here with concerns about COVID-19, with the drama going on in Washington right now, the Chinese property sector that has sent tremors to global markets. Having said that, the general trajectory of the global economy remains very much where it was earlier in 2021,” Barings chief global strategist Christopher Smart told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde spoke at an ECB forum on Wednesday alongside Bank of England and Bank of Japan Governors Andrew Bailey and Haruhiko Kuroda. They were cautiously optimistic that supply-chain disruptions lifting inflation rates globally will be temporary.
Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will testify at a House Banking Committee hearing later in the day.
U.S. economic data, including GDP, is due later in the day. Further data, including the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing PMI and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, will be released on Friday."

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had terminated the employment of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who had accused the company of enforcing policies in a discriminatory fashion and instituting rules that ""chill and restrain"" the staff from exercising rights, according to their charge filed in October.
The NLRB found in April that Amazon illegally fired them after they advocated for better working conditions during the pandemic.
""Amazon will be required to pay us our lost wages and post a notice to all of its tech and warehouse workers nationwide that Amazon can't fire workers for organizing and exercising their rights,"" Cunningham and Costa said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
The U.S. agency said the company had reached a non-board settlement, a private agreement between parties in which terms were not disclosed, with the former employees. 
The NLRB regional director, however, is required to review and approve the settlement agreement before allowing the charges to be withdrawn.
""We have reached a mutual agreement that resolves the legal issues in this case and welcome the resolution of this matter,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

CNBC first reported about the settlement. 
Cunningham and Costa gained prominence for pushing the e-commerce giant to do more on climate change, questioned Amazon's pandemic safety protocols and worked to raise money for warehouse staff at risk of contracting COVID-19.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 09:41PM ET</span>","Evergrande set to miss second offshore bond coupon payment this month, sources say","By Andrew Galbraith, Anshuman Daga and Karin Strohecker
HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least some of China Evergrande's offshore bondholders had not received a due coupon payment by the close of Asia business on Wednesday, sources said, although the cash-strapped developer reached a $1.5 billion deal to settle debt with a Chinese bank.
With liabilities of $305 billion, Evergrande has sparked concerns its woes could spread through China's financial system and reverberate around the world - a worry that has eased with the Chinese central bank vowing to protect homebuyer interest.
The company, which has nearly $20 billion in offshore debt, was due on Wednesday to make a $47.5 million bond interest payment on its 9.5% March 2024 dollar bond. It also missed paying a $83.5 million in coupon on another bond last Thursday. 
Two people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said at least some of the holders of the 2024 bonds had received no information from Evergrande about the payment on Wednesday. 
It was not immediately clear if the payment could still be made during U.S. business hours. 
A spokesperson for Evergrande did not have any immediate comment. Reuters was unable to determine whether Evergrande had told any of the bondholders what it plans to do about Wednesday's coupon payment. 
Evergrande's silence on its offshore payment obligations since the missed payment last week has left global investors wondering if they will have to swallow large losses when 30-day grace periods end for coupons due on Sept. 23 and Sept. 29.
The company, once China's top-selling developer and now expected to be one of the largest-ever restructurings in the country, has been prioritising domestic creditors over offshore bondholders.
For Evergrande, ""the most likely outcome is debt restructuring with some help from the government,"" said Wai Hoong Leong, portfolio manager for the KraneShares Asia Pacific High Yield Bond ETF, in a presentation to investors on Wednesday. ""We expect the government and Evergrande to focus on protecting the customers and suppliers, while ensuring an orderly restructuring for creditors who are likely to take a larger impact.""
It missed the payment deadline on a dollar bond last Thursday, a day after its main property business in China said it had privately negotiated with onshore bondholders to settle a separate coupon payment on a yuan-denominated bond.
In the latest such move, Evergrande said in an exchange filing earlier on Wednesday that it would sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd to a state-owned asset management company.
The bank, one of Evergrande's main lenders, demanded all net proceeds from the sale go towards settling the developer's debts with Shengjing. As of the first half last year, the bank had 7 billion yuan in loans to Evergrande, according to a report by brokerage CCB International, citing news reports.
The move highlights the role state-owned enterprises may play in Evergrande's denouement.
""We are in the wait-and-see phase at the moment. The creditors are organising themselves and people are trying to figure out how this falling knife might be caught,"" said an adviser hired by one of the offshore Evergrande bondholders.
""The clock has started to tick on a restructuring process. The company is going to need to do something, it's obviously struggling with liquidity ... the liquidity issue is what brings the house of cards down."" 
GOVERNMENT PRODDING
Once the face of China's frenzied building boom, Evergrande has now become the poster child for a crackdown on developers' debts that has spurred volatility in global markets and left large and small investors sweating their exposure.
Evergrande's troubles slammed global stock markets earlier this month, although some global investors have since shifted their focus to political wrangling in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling and a rise in Treasury yields that has pressured stocks. (N)
Nonetheless, any negative surprise from Evergrande could give stock market bears more ammunition.
Rating agency Fitch on Wednesday downgraded the long-term foreign-currency issuer default ratings (IDRs) of Evergrande and its subsidiaries, Hengda and Tianji, citing likely nonpayment of offshore bond interest last week.
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Marathon Asset Management is buying debt issued by Evergrande Group, citing the investment firm’s co-founder and chief executive officer, Bruce Richards.
Beijing is prodding government-owned firms and state-backed property developers such as China Vanke Co Ltd to purchase some of Evergrande's assets, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Authorities are hoping that asset purchases will ward off or at least mitigate any social unrest that could occur if Evergrande were to suffer a messy collapse, they said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

On Monday, China's central bank vowed to protect consumers exposed to the housing market, without mentioning Evergrande in a statement posted to its website, and injected more cash into the banking system.
Those moves have boosted investor sentiment towards Chinese property stocks in the last couple of days, with Evergrande stock rising as much as 17% on Wednesday before closing 15% higher.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc, under criticism over internal data showing its Instagram app damaged the mental health of teenagers, plans to highlight during a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday what it argues were more positive impacts, according to the company's prepared testimony seen by Reuters. 
Antigone Davis, global head of safety at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), will detail the company's previously announced efforts to better protect children and teens online, including defaulting users under the age of 16 to private accounts when they join Instagram, according to the testimony.
""Our research showed that many teens who are struggling say that Instagram helps them deal with many of the hard issues that are so common to being a teen,"" Davis's written testimony says.
Facebook has been under fire for the past week after the Wall Street Journal reported internal documents showed that the social media company was aware that Instagram harmed the mental health of young users.
Ahead of the hearing, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn said in a statement that ""Facebook knows that its services are actively harming their young users"" and cited Facebook's in-house analysts who ""performed a series of deep dives into teen use of Instagram that revealed, 'aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm.'""
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal called the hearing ""Protecting Kids Online” following the Wall Street Journal's reporting.
Internal Facebook research shows that among teenage girls who said they had recently felt sadness, 57% said Instagram made things better, Davis' prepared remarks show.

Among teenage girls who felt loneliness, 51% said Instagram had a positive impact, according to the testimony.
In a separate hearing on Tuesday, a Facebook whistleblower will testify about the company and how it handles children's safety online at a Senate hearing featuring Blumenthal and Blackburn. The senators did not disclose any information about the whistleblower.

ZHUHAI (Reuters) - Western aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul providers (MROs) signed a flurry of new contracts with Chinese customers and joint-venture partners at the country's biggest air show this week to strengthen their foothold in the lucrative market.
The quick rebound in traffic in China's domestic aviation market to pre-COVID levels, coupled with large declines in other parts of the world, has made China even more important to providers trying to minimise pandemic-driven revenue hits.
""China is key to the future of aerospace because the centre of gravity of passenger traffic is moving east,"" Kailash Krishnaswamy, general manager at Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) China, said on the sidelines of Airshow China in Zhuhai after signing a 10-year repair contract with cargo carrier SF Airlines. Spirit was attending the show for the first time.
Consulting firm Oliver Wyman estimates China's MRO market will be 8% larger this year than in 2019, making it one of two regions to surpass pre-pandemic levels, alongside eastern Europe. By 2031, it forecasts the MRO market in China will more than double its pre-COVID size to nearly $20 billion annually.
Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON) is a major supplier to Commercial Aircraft Corp of China's (COMAC) C919 narrowbody programme and is bidding for work on the Sino-Russian CR929 widebody, said its China president, Steve Lien.
Such deals give it a foothold for the future when maintenance is needed. Honeywell this week signed a provisional agreement to provide MRO services for its C919 auxiliary power units with the plane's first customer, China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), and said it expected to sign up other carriers as COMAC ramps up production.
Like Spirit, it also sees strong prospects in the cargo market, which has been growing rapidly with the rise of e-commerce and typically uses older planes that require more maintenance than the latest generation of jets.
""The forecast forward for cargo is very strong,"" Lien said. ""China's cargo capacity is not as mature globally as in the U.S. and Europe. But it is in the national interest to make it mature."" 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Co Ltd (GAMECO) signed a deal at the show to set up two 767 freighter conversion lines next year.
Chinese airlines will need 8,700 new airplanes through 2040 worth $1.47 trillion at list prices, Boeing said in a forecast last week.

At a time when China is focused increasingly on production of homegrown planes, Boeing China President Sherry Carbary said her company's strength in services was key to giving it a market foothold over the longer term.
""It is the services that actually support that airplane over its life, over the next 20, 30, 40 years,"" Carbary said. ""So it is not a one-time sale. It is a lifetime relationship that is very important to us.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Shareholders approved a plan of  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, to spin off its towers business in Latin America, Mexico's biggest telecoms company said on Wednesday.
In an extraordinary general meeting, they overwhelmingly approved the spin-off, which will create a new company called Sitio Latinoamerica, America Movil said in a statement to the Mexican stock exchange.
Upon completion, Sitio Latinoamerica will own 36,000 telecommunications towers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Uruguay, the company said. 
America Movil will contribute to Sitio Latinoamerica a portion of its share capital consisting mainly of shares it owns in subsidiary companies that own towers and other associated infrastructure.
The company previously said it expected to complete the reorganization this year. 
Earlier on Wednesday, America Movil and Liberty Latin America announced they would combine Chilean operations to form a joint venture https://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-americamovil-liberty/america-movil-liberty-latin-america-plan-joint-venture-markets-cheer-idUSKBN2GP1LH in a move aimed at expanding fixed fiber operations and speeding up the launch of 5G services. 

The transaction combines the complementary operations of Claro Chile, the Chilean subsidiary of America Movil, and VTR, Liberty Latin America's provider of high-speed products like broadband and Pay TV.
The joint venture, which was expected to generate estimated run-rate synergies of more than $180 million, excludes all telecommunication towers owned indirectly by America Movil in Chile.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's agenda was at risk of being derailed by divisions among his own Democrats, as moderates voiced anger on Wednesday at the idea of delaying a $1 trillion infrastructure bill ahead of a critical vote to avert a government shutdown.
The White House said talks over twin bills that would revitalize the nation's roads and airports and fund social programs and climate change measures, were at a ""precarious"" point as moderates and progressives disagreed over the scope of some $4 trillion in spending.
Congress, which Democrats control by a razor-thin margin, is due to vote on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early December before funding expires at midnight on Thursday.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has scheduled votes on the measure beginning on Thursday morning, leaving plenty of time for the House of Representatives to act.
The House is also expected to vote on Thursday on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the Senate with bipartisan support, although some party leaders warned that vote could be delayed again - which would dismay moderates. 
Representative Stephanie Murphy, a moderate Democrat who backs the infrastructure bill, warned against defeat or delay of the legislation. 
""If the vote were to fail tomorrow or be delayed, there would be a significant breach of trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the Biden agenda,"" she told reporters on Wednesday. 
With House progressives warning they will vote against the infrastructure bill until a deal is reached on the separate multitrillion-dollar plan focused on social spending and climate, the vote was not guaranteed.
""The only way the vote happens (Thursday) is if we have the votes to pass the bill,"" Representative Dan Kildee, House Democrats' chief deputy whip, told reporters. 
WHITE HOUSE HUDDLE
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon to meet Biden, a former senator himself, who canceled a trip to Chicago to lead negotiations with Congress. 
""We're obviously at a precarious and important time,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday.
A White House staffer met at the Capitol with moderate Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who has expressed deep concern over the size of Biden's plans and has the power to block them due to the Democrats' narrow control of the Senate. 
If the resolution to fund the government passes the Senate, the House could vote quickly to send the measure to Biden to sign into law, averting a partial government shutdown in the midst of a national health crisis. Biden's Democrats campaigned on a platform of responsible government after Republican Donald Trump's turbulent four years in office.
Republican Senator John Cornyn expressed optimism on Wednesday.
""Democrats don't want to shut down the government. Republicans don't want to shut down the government. That will supply the result that we all expect, which is to keep the lights on,"" he told a news conference.
Senate Democrats have tried to pass legislation that both funds the government and heads off a potentially catastrophic federal government default by raising the nation's $28.4 trillion debt ceiling. But they have been thwarted by Republicans who want Democrats to use a parliamentary maneuver to act alone on the debt limit issue.
The government will hit the ceiling around Oct. 18, an event that could cause a historic default with long-lasting economic fallout and implications for financial markets.
Schumer has demanded bipartisan cooperation on the issue, arguing that it addresses debts racked up during both Democratic and Republican administrations.
The House passed a bill on Wednesday suspending the limit through December 2022, by a mostly partisan vote. It now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to be blocked by Republicans again.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this month described the standoff as ""the riskiest debt-limit deadline in a decade.""
RECONCILIATION
Several senior Democrats have said the $3.5 trillion ""reconciliation"" bill - so-called because it is being drawn up under a budgetary procedure to avoid Senate rules requiring 60 votes out of 100 members for passage - will need to be scaled back to pass.
Moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he believed it would take weeks to reach agreement.
""I cannot – and will not - support trillions in spending or an all-or-nothing approach that ignores the brutal fiscal reality our nation faces,"" he said in a lengthy statement late on Wednesday afternoon.
""There is a better way and I believe we can find it if we are willing to continue to negotiate in good faith."" 
He did not say, however, what he could support. 

House Democrats urged Manchin and Sinema to say publicly what they want.
""They need to come up with their counteroffer and then we sit down and negotiate from there,"" said Representative Pramila Jayapal, chair of the House Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus.

(Reuters) - Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya, whose huge bets on ""blank check"" acquisition companies earned him the moniker of ""SPAC King,"" said he remained bullish on the long-term health of such deals despite a recent slowdown.
Palihapitiya has raised billions of dollars in the stock market through SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, created to buy unspecified private companies. The targets assume the listing of the so-called blank-check firms to become public companies.
The recent correction, after a boom that lasted several quarters, was needed to separate the ""the wheat from the chaff,"" he told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should make SPAC sponsors put up more at-risk capital to ""have more skin in the game"" and be better aligned with investors, said Palihapitiya, who has so far launched 10 SPACs and backed several other deals.
""The incentives aren't aligned to create great outcomes from the beginning of a SPAC to the end of a SPAC. And the most important thing we need to do is to force the people that are the sponsors to have much more capital at risk,"" he said.
""So if I want to raise a billion-dollar SPAC, I have to come up with $100 million.""
SPAC managers are typically awarded warrants and founder shares that give them a much bigger stake in the combined company than their investment would otherwise allow them.
Palihapitiya's latest comments on lopsided SPAC incentive structures comes days after Elizabeth Warren and other Senate Democrats sent letters to a handful of SPAC sponsors, including him, Michael Klein and Tilman Fertitta, questioning incentive arrangements.
Through his SPACs, Palihapitiya has struck deals with companies ranging from space tourism firm Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc to home-selling platform Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) Technologies Inc.
However, since the peak of the SPAC boom in March, investors have lost their enthusiasm because of poor financial performance and scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. 
One of Palihapitiya's SPAC deals, Clover Health Investments Corp, was accused by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research of concealing a U.S. Department of Justice enquiry into its business.

""I'm going to get a lot of credit when things go up and I'm going to get a lot of the blame when things go down,"" he said.
""I think we all have to take a step back and say, we are one year in to a pretty meaningful revolution in the capital markets that will take years to play out.""

1533,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 07:53PM ET</span>","U.S., EU agree to work on chip supplies, tech rules, China trade","By David Lawder and Nandita Bose
PITTSBURGH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and European Union agreed on Wednesday to deepen transatlantic cooperation to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, curb China's non-market trade practices and take a more unified approach to regulating big, global technology firms.
Launching a new forum, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), senior cabinet officials from both continents also pledged to cooperate on the screening of investments on export controls for sensitive dual-use technologies and on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). 
The statement did not mention China but said: ""We stand together in continuing to protect our businesses, consumers, and workers from unfair trade practices, in particular those posed by non-market economies, that are undermining the world trading system.""
The Biden administration has kept in place tariffs imposed by former U.S. president Donald Trump but has sought to differentiate itself by collaborating more with allies in its approach to China.
The meetings were led by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis, and European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager.
They met in a robotics and AI technology development center built inside the rusted skeleton of a former steel rolling mill topped with solar panels, a symbol of Pittsburgh's post-industrial rebirth as a tech hub.
The meeting was nearly derailed by French anger over a U.S. decision this month to supply Australia with nuclear submarines, which prompted Canberra to scrap a $40 billion submarine contract with France.
But the U.S. and EU governments backed a joint declaration to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, focusing initially on easing short-term supply bottlenecks and later on identifying longer-term vulnerabilities and ""strengthening our domestic semiconductor ecosystems, from research, design to manufacturing, with a view to improving resilience."" 
They said they would work to avoid a subsidy race to attract chip investments and seek ""the right incentives.""
The statement did not specify a time frame for a second TTC meeting, but EU officials said this would likely take place in the spring of 2022 in Europe.
BIG TECH POWER
Reuters was first to report a draft statement revealing a more unified approach to limit the growing market power of Big Tech. This was echoed in the final statement that identified common areas of concern such as illegal and harmful content amplified by algorithms.
""We are committed to transatlantic cooperation regarding platform policies that focus on disinformation, product safety, counterfeit products, and other harmful content,"" the statement said. 
With the United States and Europe trying to restrain the growing power of American tech giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), such cooperation would make it harder for the U.S. tech industry to fight new rules.
Vestager, who has taken a tough stance on the U.S. tech industry for years, said the discussions on AI were among the meeting's biggest takeaway. 
""Minds are meeting for artificial intelligence to be trustworthy, to be human centered, and to have a risk based approach,"" Vestager told reporters after the meeting.
The new tech and trade council has formed 10 working groups to deepen cooperation on these areas and others that include climate and clean technologies, communications technology security, and misuse of technology to repress human rights.
Several tech trade groups in Washington said the industry does not want the United States to adopt the European approach to digital regulation.

EU officials said the meeting's participants did not discuss one of the biggest transatlantic trade irritants - U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum that have prompted retaliatory EU duties on U.S. bourbon whiskey and motorcycles.
On Tuesday, Dombrovskis said time was running short for the sides to reach agreement before an end-November deadline, but added the EU was ready to look at similar arrangements agreed by Canada and Mexico that lifted U.S. tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports to the United States in 2019.

Britons have become increasingly aware of the urgency of addressing climate change, spurred on by campaigners including veteran naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough and Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg.
Retailers have responded by cutting waste and their use of plastic, although some environmental groups have criticised these efforts as ""greenwashing"".
The M&S target is more ambitious than one set out by Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest retailer, last week.
M&S, which sells food, clothing and homeware, launched a sustainability programme in 2007 and in 2012 became the first major carbon neutral retailer for its direct emissions.
It wants to cut its total carbon footprint by a third by 2025 and has committed to zero deforestation in sourcing palm oil and soy by 2025, using more sustainable fibres by 2025 and supporting suppliers to advance lower carbon farming methods.
""This won't be easy. We need to transform how we make, move and sell our products to customers and fundamentally change the future shape of our business,"" M&S CEO Steve Rowe said.
To get customers on board, the retailer will now reward the 12.5 million members of its ""Sparks"" loyalty scheme with treats if they donate unwanted clothes to British-based charity Oxfam.

In May, Britain reaffirmed its commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a pledge it hopes will spur on other nations before November's COP26 climate summit.
Last month, M&S upgraded its profit outlook after a jump in demand for food in its home market and an online clothes sales surge indicated a turnaround plan was working.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. regulator on Wednesday charged a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) senior compliance analyst with insider trading, saying he made illegal trades involving banking clients while working in Warsaw, Poland.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Jose Luis Casero Sanchez, 35, of Spain, learned material nonpublic information about his employer's clients through his work in a ""control room"" that tracked pending mergers, acquisitions and financings.
Casero's duties included updating the bank's confidential ""Grey List,"" which tracked clients involved in such transactions, according to an SEC complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The regulator said Casero used brokerage accounts opened in his parents' names to trade ahead of significant transactions at least 45 times from September 2020 until his May 2021 resignation, reaping nearly $472,000 of profit.
Wednesday's lawsuit does not identify Goldman by name, but identified Goldman clients in whose stocks Casero allegedly traded.
At least nine of Casero's trades related to mergers involving special purpose acquisition companies, the SEC said.
""We condemn this egregious behavior, which violates our standards of conduct and business principles,"" Goldman said in a statement. ""We are fully cooperating with the SEC.""
Casero did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for him could not immediately be identified.

The SEC is also seeking an asset freeze against Casero and his parents, both of whom are ""relief defendants."" It said all three are Spanish citizens believed to have lived in Granada.
According to LinkedIn, Casero worked for UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) from Feb. 2018 to April 2019, before joining Goldman. He has not since worked at UBS, a person close to the matter said, though LinkedIn said he is ""currently"" employed there.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended firmer on Wednesday in a partial rebound from the previous day's broad sell-off, with remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the ongoing debt ceiling debate keeping a lid on gains.
The S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced, but the Nasdaq Composite closed lower as Treasury yields halted their ascent. Defensive sectors took the lead as investors sought stability in the volatile market.
All three remain on course to post monthly declines, with the bellwether S&P 500 snapping a seven-month winning streak.
""The same story we've seen for a couple of weeks,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York.
""Investors are concerned about three things: the eventual taper of bond purchases by the Fed, ongoing inflation with Chairman Powell saying it's going to stick around longer than initially expected, and the debt ceiling issue that congress is grappling with.""
Powell, speaking at a European Central Bank event, expressed frustration over persistent supply chain woes which could keep inflation elevated for longer than expected.
The stock market strengthened following his remarks.
""Powell has been very good at delivering the news officially that everyone knows is coming,"" Pursche said. 
Wrangling continued on Capitol Hill over funding the government as the Friday deadline to prevent a shutdown approached, with mounting concerns over a U.S. credit default.
U.S. Treasury yields paused after a runup in recent days as the debt ceiling debate unfolded in Washington.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.73 points, or 0.26%, to 34,390.72; the S&P 500 gained 6.83 points, or 0.16%, at 4,359.46; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.24 points, or 0.24%, to 14,512.44.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, materials suffered the largest percentage drop, with utilities leading the way with a 1.3% gain.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co provided the biggest lift to the Dow following China's aviation regulator's successful 737 MAX test. The planemaker's shares rose 3.2%.
Discount retailer  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR) jumped 16.5% after increasing its buyback authorization by $1.05 billion to $2.5 billion.
Drugmaker Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) gained 4.0% on  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s rating upgrade to ""buy"" from ""neutral."" 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.34-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 38 new highs and 151 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday said it closed its mishap investigation into the July 11 Virgin Galactic Unity 22 launch, which deviated from assigned airspace on descent, and lifted a grounding order the regulator imposed earlier.
The FAA said Virgin Galactic had implemented changes the agency required on how it communicates during flight and that the company will be allowed to resume operations.
The government investigation found the Virgin Galactic vehicle had deviated from its assigned airspace on descent from space and the company failed to communicate the deviation to the FAA as required.
The FAA on Sept. 2 said it had barred Virgin Galactic from flying its SpaceShipTwo pending completion of the report into the flight of the Virgin Galactic rocket plane that carried British billionaire Richard Branson to the edge of space. 
Virgin Galactic said earlier this month it was planning another SpaceShipTwo flight from New Mexico, Unity 23, pending technical checks and weather. That flight is to carry three crew from the Italian Air Force and National Research Council, it added.
The company said on Sept. 10 the earliest it expects ""to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid October.""
Virgin Galactic said the FAA had accepted the corrective actions it proposed. They include updated calculations to expand the protected airspace for future flights and additional steps in the company’s flight procedures to ensure real-time mission notifications to FAA Air Traffic Control.

""The updates to our airspace and real-time mission notification protocols will strengthen our preparations as we move closer to the commercial launch of our spaceflight experience,"" said Virgin Galactic Chief Executive Michael Colglazier.
Branson was among six Virgin Galactic employees who took part in the July flight, soaring more than 50 miles (80 km) above the New Mexico desert.

(Reuters) -Mirum Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Wednesday its drug became the first U.S. approved therapy for treating itching in patients with a rare liver disorder called Alagille syndrome (ALGS).
""(Itching) is really devastating for children and families dealing with this disease...and ultimately that itching is a driving factor for liver transplant decisions,"" Chief Executive Officer Chris Peetz told Reuters. 
Mirum priced the drug, to be made available for distribution immediately under brand name Livmarli, at $1,550 per unit. It expects the per unit annual cost at about $391,000 for a 17-kilogram child, the average weight of patients in its studies. 
The dosing for the drug will be prescribed by physicians based on a patient's weight.
SVB Leerink analyst Mani Faroohar told Reuters that Livmarli could easily reach peak sales of $400 million in ALGS indication by 2030. 
Mirum executives estimated a total market opportunity of about $500 million for the indication. 
Faroohar said that Albireo Pharma (NASDAQ:ALBO)'s oral therapy Bylvay is the closest competitor to Livmarli, but currently being tested in a late-stage study for ALGS.
In July, Bylvay received U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval for treatment of another liver disease called Progressive (NYSE:PGR) familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and is priced at $385,000 per year.
ALGS is a rare genetic disorder in which bile ducts are abnormally narrow, malformed and fewer in number, which lead to bile accumulation in the liver. 

Livmarli works by blocking an important bile acid transport protein on the surface of the small intestine, which directs more bile acids out of the body through feces. 
The drug's approval includes information about serious side effects including changes in liver tests which often indicate liver injury.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines said on Tuesday nearly 600 U.S.-based employees faced termination after failing to comply with the carrier's vaccination policy.
In early August, the company became the first U.S. carrier to require COVID-19 vaccinations for all domestic employees, requiring proof of vaccination by Monday.
The carrier said it would start on Tuesday the process of firing 593 employees who decided not to get vaccinated.
""This was an incredibly difficult decision but keeping our team safe has always been our first priority,"" Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) and President Brett Hart told employees in a memo.
The workers can save their jobs if they get vaccinated before their formal termination meetings, the company officials said.
United has received requests for vaccine exemptions from employees for religious and medical reasons. Those employees account for less than 3% of the airline's 67,000 U.S. workforce, United officials said.
The company had plans to put employees who received religious exemptions on temporary, unpaid personal leave from Oct. 2. Those plans, however, have been put on hold until Oct. 15 because of a lawsuit challenging the policy. 
Excluding those who have sought an exemption, United said more than 99% of U.S.-based employees have been vaccinated against COVID-19.
A company spokesperson said the airline plans to hire about 25,000 people over the next few years, and vaccination will be a condition of employment for all new hires.
United will also require students at its pilot training school to get vaccinated, the spokesperson said.

The company dismissed the notion that the vaccine requirement was deterring applicants for jobs at the air carrier. 
United received 700 applications for about 400 job postings last month at a Denver career fair. Similarly, it has received more than 20,000 applications for about 2,000 open positions for flight attendants, the spokesperson said.

Invictus, an Austin-based firm that specializes in debt financing, is the latest Capital Senior Living shareholder to offer cash in order to help scuttle the company's plans to raise capital through a private placement of convertible preferred stock to Conversant Capital.
The sources said Invictus' proposal would provide the company with $150 million in capital at a lower cost than its current plan but did not provide details. The sources said Invictus is ready to discuss its proposal with the company.
Shareholders will vote on the proposed financing deal with Conversant next month. The company on Wednesday pushed its shareholder meeting to Oct. 22 from Oct. 12.
Earlier this month, activist investor Ortelius Advisors, which owns roughly 13% of Capital Senior Living, also offered to provide a near-term cash infusion to avoid the plan with Conversant, which Ortelius says would harm shareholders.
Ortelius has also lined up a term sheet for a $46 million bridge loan for Capital Senior Living, in case the company prefers supplemental debt financing.
Earlier this summer Capital Senior Living unveiled the plan with Conversant Capital and said that Conversant had agreed to backstop an associated rights offering and issue additional debt at a 15% interest rate.

Kanter's nomination is not expected to spark any significant opposition at the hearing on Wednesday. If the committee approves the nomination, it goes to the full Senate for confirmation. 
Biden's decision to pick Kanter, a longtime critic of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, as the Justice Department's antitrust chief is the latest sign the White House is determined to rein in the world's biggest corporations, especially Big Tech. Progressives who advocate tougher enforcement of antitrust law pushed for his nomination.
Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Google. The Justice Department sued Google last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals.
The Biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise, Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
If confirmed by the Senate, Kanter will take the reins of the Justice Department's antitrust division amid calls for tougher enforcement, with special criticism aimed at Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
The division will play a key role in implementing the Biden executive order aimed at promoting competition across the U.S. economy. In addition to suing Google, the Justice Department is also investigating Apple.

The two companies said in a joint statement on Thursday they would invest a combined amount of up to $150 million of equity to fund loans in the initial phase. The Singapore-based platform aims to allocate more than $1 billion of loans within five years.
""The platform will target renewable energy and storage, water and waste treatment and sustainable transport to help meet carbon reduction targets and build resilience to offset the impact of climate change,"" the companies said.
Noel Quinn, group chief executive of HSBC, said the partnership ""aims to tackle some of the biggest barriers to financing sustainable infrastructure where it's needed the most.""
Globally, governments, companies and investors are taking steps to develop climate finance plans to fund the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Some $2 trillion in infrastructure investment is needed over the next decade to enable Southeast Asia's sustainable transition, a report issued by Bain & Company, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Temasek said on Wednesday.

HSBC and Temasek said the Asian Development Bank would offer technical and other assistance to the platform, while Clifford Capital Holdings, a Singapore-based specialist financing and distribution platform for infrastructure assets, would assist with project finance expertise.
""Public funding alone will not cover the scale of climate change mitigation and transition required across Southeast Asia,"" said Dilhan Pillay, CEO of Temasek International. ""By joining forces, we can catalyse our capital, multiplying impact and scaling to meet the opportunities.""

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group-backed Oyo Hotels and Rooms is facing a legal tussle with rival Zostel ahead of its up to $1.2 billion market debut over a deal between the two Indian hospitality startups that fell apart six years ago.
Oyo is looking to raise between $1 billion and $1.2 billion through a new share issue and an offer for sale from existing shareholders. The company is set to file draft initial public offering documents this month, Reuters reported last week, joining a wave of Indian start-ups looking to go public this year.
But Zostel filed a petition in August with the Delhi High Court to stop Oyo from changing its shareholder structure, including through an IPO, the petition, seen by Reuters, said.
Their 2015 deal was for Oyo to buy some of Zostel's businesses, while Zostel would get a 7% stake in Oyo. The transaction fell apart but the companies have been in a long-running legal battle over the terms, with Oyo arguing that they had not reached a definitive agreement.
In 2018, India's Supreme Court appointed an arbitrator on the case, who in March this year ruled that the terms of the deal were binding and Zostel was entitled to claim the 7% stake in Oyo.
Zostel ""did everything within their control to complete their obligations"" while Oyo breached its obligations by failing to execute a definitive agreement, the arbitrator said.
Oyo has challenged the arbitration order in the Delhi High Court.
A legal counsel for Oyo said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday: ""[Un]til the time that parties do not come to an agreement on the terms of the definitive agreements and the same are not executed, no right whatsoever arises in favour of any party for any type of shares to be issued in Oyo.""
Zostel is opposing any attempt by Oyo to alter its shareholding structure, Paavan Nanda, Zostel co-founder, said in a response to Reuters.
Oyo's lawyers in the court on Wednesday objected to requests from Zostel's counsel to keep the contested 7% stake in escrow. The judge declined this request and set an Oct. 7 date for a detailed hearing of the case.
Since its launch in 2013 by CEO Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo has grown rapidly, competing with U.S. home rental company Airbnb and home grown chains such as Fab Hotels and Treebo. 
It runs operations in 35 countries, including India, Europe and Indonesia, and counts Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners among its other investors.

(Reuters) -Google users can soon combine images and text in search queries, a feature unveiled on Wednesday that could help the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit expand its role in e-commerce and dominance in online video.
The new feature will arrive within months through its Google Lens search tool, the company said in its livestreamed Search On conference. Google said in May that advances in artificial intelligence software would make this possible.
""With this new capability, you can tap on the Lens icon when you're looking at a picture of a shirt, and ask Google to find you the same pattern — but on another article of clothing, like socks,"" Senior Vice President Prabhakar Raghavan said.
""This helps when you're looking for something that might be difficult to describe accurately with words alone.""
The technology also sorts within videos, including on Google's YouTube, already the internet's biggest streaming service.
""Your bike has a broken thingamajig, and you need some guidance on how to fix it,"" Raghavan said. ""The point-and-ask mode of searching will make it easier to find the exact moment in a video that can help.""

Users will be able to run reverse-image searches when surfing on the Google iOS app or the Chrome desktop browser. Selecting an image will pull up similar online visuals, which could help shoppers find where to buy items seen in photos and ultimately lead them to Google Shopping, its rival to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s marketplace.
Making more items searchable is another priority. Google said it was licensing a free Address Maker app to governments and organizations to map routes and assign addresses to businesses and homes not yet listed on Google Maps. The app could reduce the time it takes governments and organizations to assign addresses for a town from years to weeks, Google said.

Because the stock market is expected to remain highly volatile, dividend-paying stocks should outperform due to being higher-quality businesses and providing a guaranteed income.

The sector has also generated significant attention from investors who must steer clear of low-quality stocks. Considering this, we believe they should avoid stocks like  Harvest Health  & Recreation (HRVSF (OTC:HRVSF)), TerrAscend (TRSSF), and OrganiGram (OGI).Although the U.S. cannabis industry has been gaining steam due to the legalization of recreational marijuana in several states, there continue to be major obstacles including legalization at the federal level. Further, cannabis has proven itself quite easy to grow with few barriers to entry which means that marijuana producers are unlikely to deliver great returns for investors. 
Furthermore, with the laws around cannabis becoming gradually favorable, more players are entering the cannabis space, making the industry highly competitive. This could negatively impact the market share of existing players and place more downward pressure on prices.
Given this backdrop, it could be wise to steer clear of cannabis stocks Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. (HRVSF), TerrAscend Corp. (TRSSF), and OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:OGI), which possess weak fundamentals.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>",Coronavirus can transform pancreas cell function; certain genes may protect an infected person's spouse,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Coronavirus transforms pancreas cell function
When the coronavirus infects cells, it not only impairs their activity but can also change their function, new findings suggest. For example, when insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas become infected with the virus, they not only produce much less insulin than usual, but also start to produce glucose and digestive enzymes, which is not their job, researchers found. ""We call this a change of cell fate,"" said study leader Dr. Shuibing Chen, who described the work in a presentation on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, held virtually this year. It is not clear whether the changes are long-lasting, or if they might be reversible, the researchers noted earlier in a report published in Cell Metabolism. Chen noted that some COVID-19 survivors have developed diabetes shortly after infection. ""It is definitely worth investigating the rate of new-onset diabetes patients in this COVID-19 pandemic,"" she said in a statement. Her team has been experimenting with the coronavirus in clusters of cells engineered to create mini-organs, or organoids, that resemble the lungs, liver, intestines, heart and nervous system. Their findings suggest loss of cell fate/function may be happening in lung tissues as well, Chen, from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told Reuters. 
Certain genes may protect an infected patient's spouse
A study of couples in which both partners were exposed to the coronavirus but only one person got infected is helping to shed light on why some people may be naturally resistant to the virus. The researchers had believed such cases were rare, but a call for volunteers who fit that profile turned up roughly a thousand couples. Ultimately, they took blood samples from 86 couples for detailed analysis. The results suggest resistant partners more often have genes that contribute to more efficient activation of so-called natural killer (NK) cells, which are part of the immune system's initial response to germs. When NKs are correctly activated, they are able to recognize and destroy infected cells, preventing the disease from developing, the researchers explained in a report published on Tuesday in Frontiers in Immunology . ""Our hypothesis is that the genomic variants most frequently found in the susceptible spouse lead to the production of molecules that inhibit activation of NKs,"" study leader Mayana Zatz of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, said in a statement. The current study cannot prove this is happening, she added. Even if the findings are confirmed with more research, the contributions of other immune mechanisms would also need to be investigated, the researchers said.
Experimental pill shows promise against coronavirus variants

Laboratory (NYSE:LH) studies show that Merck & Co's experimental oral COVID-19 antiviral drug, molnupiravir, is likely to be effective in patients infected with any of the known variants of the coronavirus, including the dominant, highly transmissible Delta, researchers said on Wednesday in a presentation during IDWeek 2021, the virtual annual meeting of infectious disease organizations. Molnupiravir does not target the spike protein of the virus, which is the target of all current COVID-19 vaccines. Instead, it targets an enzyme the virus uses to make copies of itself. It is designed to work by introducing errors into the genetic code of the virus. Data showed that the drug is most effective when given early in the course of infection, Merck said. The company is conducting two large late-stage trials of the drug - one for treatment of COVID-19 and another as a preventive.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors sought to stanch the bleeding on Wednesday after world stock markets suffered their worst rout since January and U.S. and European borrowing costs raced to their highest in months.
Stock indices in the United States and Europe staged a partial recovery after a heavy sell-off on Tuesday consigned Wall Street to its steepest drop since mid-July. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.93 points, or 0.27%, to 34,390.92, the S&P 500 gained 6.86 points, or 0.16%, to 4,359.49 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.24 points, or 0.24%, to 14,512.44.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.6%, with investors looking past a 2.2% fall in the previous session.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.27%.
Declines in tech stocks earlier in the week created opportunities for investors looking for value, analysts said.
""Bargain hunters have stepped into the fold today as they have swooped in to snap up relatively cheap stocks,"" said David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital. 
Traders slowed their selling of U.S. Treasuries, leaving yields little changed, as they kept an eye on government spending talks in Washington.
After four consecutive sessions in which the 10-year yield rose, the yield fell as low as 1.494% on Wednesday morning before finding support.
Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 1.5288%, from 1.536% late on Tuesday. 
""The question that will come in the next 10 days is will the U.S. Treasury yield keep pushing above 1.5%,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kenneth Broux. 
The dollar rallied to a one-year high against rival currencies. The greenback is on course for its best year since 2015 just as doubts re-emerge about the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and Washington is bogged down in debt ceiling talks that could lead to a government shutdown. 
The dollar index rose 0.753%, with the euro down 0.78% to $1.159.
Gold fell to its lowest in seven weeks on Wednesday as the dollar advanced.
Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $1,725.10 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% lower at $1,722.9.
In commodity markets, oil prices dropped, having broken through $80 a barrel for the first time in nearly three years the day before. 
U.S. crude oil futures settled at $74.83 per barrel, down 0.6%. Brent crude futures settled at $78.64 per barrel, also down 0.6%. 
Overnight Asia-Pacific shares had managed to restrict falls to 1.2%. Not including Japan, the region was heading for a 9.4% decline for the third quarter, its worst quarterly performance since the first three months of 2020, when global markets were roiled by the initial spread of COVID-19. 
China's worsening power crunch pushed investors out of Chinese stocks vulnerable to factory shutdowns, including chemicals and steelmaking, even as the country's economic planning agency sought to reassure residents and businesses. 
Debt-saddled property giant China Evergrande's shares did leap 15% after it said it planned to sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake in Shengjing Bank.
Investors are still waiting to see whether the developer makes some now-overdue bond payments and rating firm S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said another major property firm, Fantasia, was also at growing risk of default.

Investing.com -- Stocks fought back on Wednesday after a sell-off the day before on concerns over inflation and rising bond yields.
But uncertainty persisted. Stocks traded mixed for much of the morning and then ventured into green territory at mid-afternoon, only to close mixed. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill continued their game of brinkmanship over the continued funding of the federal government. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of economic uncertainty in the medium-term, and that inflation was likely to remain elevated this year.
""It is frustrating to acknowledge that getting people vaccinated and getting Delta under control 18 months later still remains the most important economic policy that we have,"" Powell said in response to a question on the U.S. economic outlook at a virtual event sponsored by the European Central Bank, as reported by Reuters.
""And it's also frustrating to see the bottlenecks and supply chain problems not getting better, in fact at the margin apparently getting a little bit worse,” Powell said. ""We see that continuing into next year probably and holding inflation up longer than we had thought.”
Congress has until the end of Thursday before government operations start shutting down, unless, of course, the Democrats succeed in their efforts to provide a stopgap funding while still feuding with Republicans over the debt limit. Stay tuned.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More earnings
 CarMax Inc  (NYSE:KMX)’s second-quarter profit per share is seen coming in at $1.85 on a revenue of $6.78 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Meanwhile home retailer  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY)is expected to report second-quarter revenue of $2.06 billion and EPS of 52 cents.
2. Economic output
The U.S. economy is likely to have grown in the second quarter at the same pace as the first quarter. As per estimates, it is seen having grown at 6.6%. The ‘second estimate’ had pegged it at the same rate of 6.6%. The GDP data is expected out at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT)
3. Inflation reading
U.S. consumer spending is likely to have risen by 3.7% in the second quarter, slowing down from the first quarter’s 6.5% growth. The core PCE price index is likely to have grown by 6.1% in the second quarter, unchanged from the first quarter. This data is also due out at 8:30 AM ET.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 eked out a gain Wednesday, after coming under pressure into the close amid ongoing concerns about the recovery and a potential government shutdown stifled upside momentum. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%, or 90 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.2%.
Consumer staples and utilities, which serve as the defensive corners of the markets, were the biggest sector gainers, as investors appeared to remain cautious amid fears about slowing growth, faster inflation, and a potential U.S. government shutdown.

Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG),  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN),  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE), and Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) led the broader market to the upside.
Treasury yields, meanwhile, resumed their climb, with the 10-year Treasury trading above 1.5%. But some on Wall Street suggested the move higher in rates still has a way to go before troubling equities.
""Without any change to the P/E, the 10-year UST yield would need to rise above 2.3% for relative equity valuations to rank above the long-term average,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Tech, found some respite after a rout a day earlier, but gains were kept in check by a fall in semiconductors following weakness in Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell 2% after the chipmaker's fiscal first-quarter guidance fell short expectations and offset fourth quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Still, investors are likely to use the weakness to seek more exposure to Micron.
""[W]hile it is unlikely that last night will be viewed as an inflection, we see investors increasingly more interested in accumulating shares as risk/reward in CY22 appears among the best in the sector especially as MU continues to demonstrate structurally improving fundamentals,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
Energy stocks were flat as oil prices stumbled on data showing that weekly U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly rose.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles rose by 4.58 million barrels in the week to Sept. 24 versus forecasts for a drop of 2.2 million.
On the Capitol Hill, Senators are set to vote on a funding bill on Wednesday or Thursday. If the bill passes, it would move to the House of Representatives and then to President Biden's desk to sign to avoid a government shutdown on Friday.

Evolent declined to comment, while Walgreens did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Walgreens previously said it was focused on making strategic investments to build on its core pharmacy business. It made a $970 million investment last week to acquire a majority stake in specialty pharmacy company Shields Health Solutions.
Evolent had a market value of $2.36 billion, based on Tuesday's close. The company reached an agreement with activist investor Engaged Capital last year to appoint a new director and create a new board committee.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>","Explainer-Standing at the precipice, Washington courts debt limit catastrophe","By Jason Lange, Megan Davies and David Randall
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A standoff in Washington between President Joe Biden's Democrats and Republicans is threatening to trigger a financial and economic meltdown if Congress fails to act by about Oct. 18, when the Treasury Department expects to run out of cash to cover its expenses.
This kind of brinksmanship has become a regular feature of U.S. politics over the past decade. But the familiar fight belies the serious dangers the world's largest economy would face if it were to default on its debts.
WHY WOULD HITTING THE DEBT CEILING BE CATASTROPHIC?
Once Washington runs into its $28.4 trillion borrowing limit, it will only have incoming tax receipts for paying its bills. And because it currently borrows more than 20 cents for every dollar it spends, the Treasury would start missing payments owed to money lenders, citizens or both. 
Shockwaves would ripple through global financial markets as investors question the value of U.S. bonds, which are key building blocks for the world's financial system.
Domestic spending cuts would push the U.S. economy into recession as the government missed payments on everything from Social Security payments for the elderly to soldiers' salaries. A financial crisis would only worsen the economic troubles, and economists expect millions of Americans would lose their jobs.
WHAT OPTIONS DOES WASHINGTON HAVE?
Most experts say the simplest thing would be to abolish the borrowing limit altogether. 
First enacted in 1917, the debt ceiling went from being an occasional political football in the late 20th century to a full-blown crisis in 2011, when political dysfunction nearly triggered a default. 
Some observers say the debt ceiling itself violates the U.S. Constitution. But if the Biden administration invoked that argument, a legal challenge would follow.
While the administration has not said what it will do if the borrowing limit isn't raised, the U.S. Treasury's 2011 contingency plans offer a baseline scenario. During that year's political crisis, the plan prioritized paying financial market creditors to stave off a debt default while pulling back sharply on the government's other spending obligations -- which would include social welfare payments to the old, sick and indigent. 
ARE INVESTORS ALREADY SPOOKED? 
They might just be getting started. Despite recent warnings from Federal Reserve and Treasury officials, market reaction to the political impasse has been subdued. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index slid more than 2% on Tuesday, in part because of debt ceiling worries, but rebounded slightly on Wednesday. Investors generally presume Biden's Democrats will resolve the crisis. 
Still, the market for Treasury bills is showing signs of concern. Michael Purves, chief executive at Tallbacken Capital Advisors in New York, wrote in a research note on Monday that investors were now demanding higher yields for Treasury bills due in one month compared to bills due in three months because the latter ""presumably won't be burdened by default risk."" 
That is, some investors are worried the government could miss payments for a time.
HOW BAD DID IT GET IN 2011?
During the 2011 debt ceiling crisis - between then-President Barack Obama's Democrats and the right-wing Tea Party faction of Republicans - the S&P 500 plunged almost 20%. It later recovered, but investors were rattled and the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency put U.S. politicians on watch, downgrading America's credit rating for the first time in history.

WHAT ABOUT MINTING A GIANT COIN?
One far-fetched idea floated by policy wonks during the 2011 crisis was for the Treasury to mint a $1 trillion commemorative coin. Officials would deposit the coin at the Federal Reserve and use the funds to pay government bills, thus avoiding default. President Obama later acknowledged his administration discussed the idea, and on Tuesday House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler of New York had also brought it up. Earlier this month, Biden's White House rejected the notion.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Wednesday, attempting to claw back some losses from a day earlier, though ongoing concerns about the recovery and a potential government shutdown stifled upside momentum. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.77%, or 263 points, the Nasdaq was down 0.40%.
Consumer staples and utilities, which serve as the defensive corners of the markets, were the biggest sector gainers, as investors appeared to remain cautious amid fears about slowing growth, faster inflation, and a potential U.S. government shutdown.
""[W]hen the Fed begins to lift its foot off the gas, the fear is that the recovery will lose momentum and growth will slow,"" Stifel said in a note.
Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG),  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN),  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE), and Nextera Energy (NYSE:NEE) led the broader market to the upside.
Treasury yields, meanwhile, resumed their climb, with he 10-year Treasury trading above 1.5%. But some on Wall Street suggested the move higher in rates still has a way to go before troubling equities.
""Without any change to the P/E, the 10-year UST yield would need to rise above 2.3% for relative equity valuations to rank above the long-term average,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
Tech, found some respite after a rout a day earlier, but gains were kept in check by a fall in semiconductors following weakness in Micron.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) fell 2% after the chipmaker's fiscal first-quarter guidance fell short expectations and offset fourth quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Still, investors are likely to use the weakness to seek more exposure to Micron.
""[W]hile it is unlikely that last night will be viewed as an inflection, we see investors increasingly more interested in accumulating shares as risk/reward in CY22 appears among the best in the sector especially as MU continues to demonstrate structurally improving fundamentals,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note.
Energy stocks were flat as oil prices stumbled on data showing that weekly U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly rose.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles rose by 4.58 million barrels in the week to Sept. 24 versus forecasts for a drop of 2.2 million.
On the political front, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are locked in a stalemate on whether to raise the debt ceiling to fund the government, and avoid a shutdown on Friday.

(Reuters) -Laboratory studies show that Merck & Co's experimental oral COVID-19 antiviral drug, molnupiravir, is likely to be effective against known variants of the coronavirus, including the dominant, highly transmissible Delta, the company said on Wednesday.
Since molnupiravir does not target the spike protein of the virus - the target of all current COVID-19 vaccines - which defines the differences between the variants, the drug should be equally effective as the virus continues to evolve, said Jay Grobler, head of infectious disease and vaccines at Merck.
Molnupiravir instead targets the viral polymerase, an enzyme needed for the virus to make copies of itself. It is designed to work by introducing errors into the genetic code of the virus.
Data shows that the drug is most effective when given early in the course of infection, Merck said.
The U.S. drugmaker tested its antiviral against nasal swab samples taken from participants in early trials of the drug. Delta was not in wide circulation at the time of those trials, but molnupiravir was tested against lab samples of the variant behind the latest surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
Merck said earlier this year that a small, mid-stage trial found that after five days of molnupiravir treatment, none of the patients taking various doses of the drug tested positive for infectious virus, while 24% of placebo patients did have detectable levels.
Merck is currently conducting two Phase III trials of the antiviral it is developing with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics - one for treatment of COVID-19 and another as a preventive.
Merck anticipates that the Phase III treatment study will finish in early November, Grobler said. 
The trial enrolled nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients who have had symptoms for no more than five days and are at risk for severe disease.

The latest analysis was presented during IDWeek, the annual meeting of infectious disease organizations, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Shares of Merck were up 2.3% at $75.04 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) on Wednesday pressed a federal appeals court to let it recoup about $504 million of its own money that it accidentally wired Revlon Inc lenders, saying its mistake did not entitle them to a huge windfall.
The bank's lawyer Neal Katyal said the lenders had six ""red flags"" of the error, and had not expected the cosmetics company controlled by billionaire Ronald Perelman to repay them for another three years.
""If you hit rewind here, it's not unfair,"" Katyal told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. ""The parties get returned to the position that they bargained for.""
But one member of the three-judge panel said a key precedent from New York state's highest court appeared to leave legal questions about Citigroup's payment and the lenders' response unanswered, and which perhaps that court should answer first.
""Each of those issues is really a question of policy,"" Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said. ""We would largely be guessing.""
The case stemmed from New York-based Citigroup's August 2020 prepayment of an $894-million loan for Revlon, which lacked enough cash to repay it, that was not due until 2023.
Rather than return their share of the money, 10 asset managers whose clients included the Revlon lenders kept it.
They said Citigroup, acting as Revlon's loan agent, paid exactly what was owed, and they had no reason to believe a sophisticated bank would err so badly.
The asset managers included Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management, among others.
On Feb. 16, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman ruled against Citigroup, saying the prepayment was a ""discharge for value,"" and the asset managers were not on notice of Citigroup's blunder. 
Those managers deserve ""finality,"" their lawyer Kathleen Sullivan told the appeals court.
She also said the prepayment seemed plausible because Perelman had previously bailed out Revlon.
""They'd seen it before,"" she said. 
But Katyal said the banking industry wires $5.4 trillion each day, and mistakes will happen.

Industry groups have said a ruling against Citigroup could expose banks to excessive liability risks, and destabilize the approximately $1.2 trillion U.S. syndicated loan market.

Ken Murphy said in an interview for the upcoming Reuters Impact conference that the last three months had been ""quite challenging"" but that the supermarket had coped well due to its close ties with suppliers and detailed planning. 
The group has also started using a chilled rail service to bring fruit and vegetables into the country from Spain, helping to cut the number of trucks it has on roads and guarantee deliveries. 
From 65,000 containers a year on rail, Tesco has an ambition to increase that to 90,000 containers by November or December. 
""We're one of the few if not the only grocery retailer in the UK that uses rail extensively,"" he said. ""That helped us during the HGV challenges we've had during the summer.

Britain has been hit by an acute shortage of truck drivers this year, with some retailers and oil companies warning this month that they were struggling to maintain full services.
On top of that, many leading companies are either under pressure to cut emissions targets, or, like Tesco, have set out plans to do so.

PARIS (Reuters) -Air France took delivery of its first compact Airbus A220 jetliner on Tuesday, pledging greater comfort and lower emissions on short routes as its Franco-Dutch parent pushes ahead with a broader fleet shake-up to streamline costs.
The French airline, part of the Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM group, said the 148-seat, Canadian-designed jet would reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 20% after entering European service with a flight to Berlin on Oct 31.
Air France ordered 60 of the planes in 2019, with options for at least 30 more, to replace the smallest members of the Airbus single-aisle portfolio, the A318 and A319.
The unveiling illustrated a shift of emphasis from the world's largest jets to some of the smallest as airlines play up the lower cost and environmental benefits of light new models.
The audience of 300 guests including politicians gathered in a hangar originally built for the Airbus A380 superjumbo, once the flagship for Air France and other major long-haul carriers but whose retirement was accelerated by the coronavirus crisis.
In a reminder of the see-saw strategies in the $150 billion jet industry, a disused A380 sat ignored on the tarmac outside.
The A220 was developed by Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), but its ambitions foundered over a lack of cash needed to unlock the stranglehold of Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA). Airbus picked up the A220 programme for a symbolic dollar in 2018.
Now, Air France-KLM is playing the two planemaking giants against each other for the next stage of a sweeping fleet review under Chief Executive Ben Smith, a former Air Canada executive who has vowed to simplify a fragmented fleet to cut unit costs.
He said the group would decide within months on a new order for at least 80 medium-haul jets in a busier category just above the A220, in what would be its biggest fleet transaction ever.
That follows a tender earlier this year to renew and expand the medium-haul Boeing 737 fleets at KLM as well as the French and Dutch operations of budget brand Transavia.
STAGGERED FLEET RENEWAL
Smith said the deal could involve a firm purchase of 80 aircraft with options for another 60 to 80. Such a deal would be worth more than $8 billion at list prices before discounts that aircraft traders say can easily exceed 50% for large quantities.
Some analysts have suggested the competition is Boeing's to lose after a long association with KLM, but Smith stressed the group was in talks with both Boeing and Airbus.
The widely watched competition is between the A320neo and A321neo medium-haul jets on the Airbus side and Boeing's competing 737 MAX family. It comes amid resurgent demand from Europe's mainly debt-laden airlines for capacity to cut costs and respond to growing environmental pressure.
Beyond that, the group's fleet overhaul will see separate contests in around 2023 to replace earlier A320/A321 models and the A330 long-haul model: both on the Air France network. 
For the future competition to replace the workhorse A320, Air France would be interested in a frequently mooted longer version of the A220, if Airbus launched one, Smith said.

Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told Reuters the planemaker was studying the idea with a ""positive attitude,"" but no decision was currently on the agenda.
Industry sources say its immediate priority is to cut costs on the loss-making A220 by pressuring suppliers to offer deeper price cuts and by redesigning parts to be built more cheaply.

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) rose more than 4% on Wednesday as Bernstein upgraded both the stock’s rating and the price target because of attractive valuations.
Analyst Douglas Harned upgraded the stock to outperform with a target of $279, which implies a 21% gain from the stock’s current price of around $230.
According to Harned, at the current price, there is sufficient upside long-term to justify an outperform rating even it has issues to resolve. These include raising 737MAX rates, returning to 787 deliveries, and addressing program issues in defense.
In its July update, Boeing had said that the 737 program was producing at the rate of approximately 16 per month and that it expects to make it 31 per month in early 2022 with further gradual increases.
As per the same update, the 787-production rate was going to be temporarily lower than five per month to gradually return to that rate. Boeing expects to deliver fewer than half of the 787s currently in inventory this year.
Boeing’s KC-46A Pegasus program has been dogged by problems for years, and as per reports, the aerial refueling aircraft is close to getting back on the right track.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 12:37PM ET</span>",Wall Street firms dust off plans as debt limit talks go to the wire,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street firms are sounding alarm bells and dusting off contingency plans as fears grow that Congress may fail to reach a deal to raise the country's debt limit in time, executives said.
With federal government funding due to expire on Thursday and borrowing authority set to run out on Oct. 18, Democrats who narrowly control both chambers of Congress are scrambling to prevent an unprecedented U.S. credit default. Their latest efforts on Tuesday were blocked by Republicans.
A failure to raise the legal cap on how much money the government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations, currently set at $28.4 trillion, could send shockwaves across global markets. 
""If there were to be some kind of failure to pay Treasury securities, we honestly don't know what would happen,"" said Rob Toomey, managing director and associate general counsel for capital markets at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). 
""Certainly, you can expect significant volatility were this to occur, and the market needs to be prepared for that.”
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday that the bank had begun preparing for the possibility of a U.S. default, a ""potentially catastrophic"" event, although he added he expected lawmakers would reach a last-minute deal. Some analysts say, though, that the uncertainty is showing slightly in the spread between one-month Treasury bills and three-month Treasury bills, which are perceived to carry less risk of default. One-month bills currently yield 0.07% compared to 0.04% for three-month bills. At the beginning of the year, both yielded around 0.08%.
Previous debt limit crises have roiled global markets, despite being resolved. A now-notorious 2011 standoff over the ceiling led S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings to downgrade U.S. sovereign debt for the first time, wiping $2.4 trillion off U.S. stocks. Talks went to the wire again in 2017, although with less disruption.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this month described the standoff as ""the riskiest debt-limit deadline in a decade.""
Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute (ICI), a trade group representing the world's largest fund managers, said his members were concerned about the financial ramifications of a possible U.S. default for savers globally.
""ICI has made it clear in our conversations with Capitol Hill that failing to raise the debt limit would not only hurt our capital markets, it would negatively impact their constituents, regardless of income or political affiliation,"" he added. 
TWO SCENARIOS
Given how badly exposed Wall Street banks, dealers and investors would be to a default, they have to prepare for the possibility even if they expect the crisis to be resolved.
""We've been through this a number of times,"" said Toomey, adding the group had reprised its previous plans for a scenario in which the Treasury is unable to pay off debt coming due. 
""We've been dusting off that kind of work with our members to make sure that everybody is on the same page."" 
SIFMA is working on two scenarios. The more likely would see the Treasury buy time to pay back bondholders by announcing ahead of a payment that it would be rolling those maturing securities over for another day. That would allow the market to continue functioning even if there was broader volatility. 
The other, much less likely scenario would see the Treasury allow bonds to mature, which would be more disruptive as the unpaid bonds would still need to be settled but would no longer exist in the U.S. Federal Reserve's systems, said SIFMA.
In general, these plans aim to ensure firms have enough technology capacity, staff and cash to handle high trading volumes to ensure the markets continue to function. 
The Treasury Market Practices Group, a group of bond dealers convened by the New York Fed, also has a plan for trading in defaulted Treasuries, which it reviewed earlier this year.
Internally, individual banks are also making plans. 

Dimon said JPMorgan had begun scenario-planning for how a default would affect the repo and money markets, its capital ratios, and how ratings agencies would react. The bank has also begun combing through its client contracts to understand how they will react.
""You’ve got to check the contracts to try to predict it out,"" he said. ""It's a lot of work.""

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>","Chinese automaker GAC enters N. American market, but under Dodge marque","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese automaker GAC is exporting China-made sport-utility vehicles to Mexico, in its first massive sales in the North America after years of planning to enter the key market. However, the cars are under Dodge marque.
The ""Dodge Journey"" SUVs are built based on GAC's vehicle design and made at its own Hangzhou factory. Stellantis will sell them at its dealership network in Mexico, according to a statement. 
GAC has a joint venture with Stellantis, which is struggling to sell Jeep-branded vehicles in China, the world's biggest auto market, and has recently decided to close one of its two factories.
It is not rare for global automaker to sell vehicles under different brands in different regions but they tend to do that with their own models, rather than partner's. 
GAC, which is among the few Chinese state-owned automakers that aim to develop their own brand globally, said it aims to sell 4,000 such vehicles in Mexico by the end of this year. 
Like many Chinese companies including Great Wall Motor, GAC has long aimed to sell vehicles in the United States but the plan was progressing slowly due to restriction rules by the Trump administration.
""GAC will continue to strengthen and expand cooperation with Stellantis ... and continue to explore the Mexican Market, and radiate to surrounding areas to lay a foundation for further cultivation of the North American region,"" it said. It is now selling cars with its own brand in Asia, the Middle East and South America.

This is not the first time that GAC's model is sold through a global automaker's sales channel. Electric GAC cars were sold in GAC-Toyota venture and GAC-Honda venture's showrooms in China from 2018. 
Other than the GAC model, an SUV, originally under Baojun marque, developed by SGMW, a joint venture between General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and SAIC Motor, is sold in South America under Chevrolet logo.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive - EU to decide on Pfizer booster on Oct. 4 - document,"By Francesco Guarascio and Emilio Parodi
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's drugs regulator will decide on Monday whether to approve  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 booster vaccine, but it is unlikely to give precise guidance on who should receive it, according to an internal document and two officials.
If the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gives its backing for the jab, the 27-member block would join the United States, Britain and Israel which have already received the green light to deploy boosters, even though there is no consensus among scientists that they are necessary.
""On 4 October the EMA will deliver an opinion on the need for Pfizer boosters for the general population,"" EMA's head Emer Cooke told EU lawmakers in an internal meeting on Tuesday, according to minutes of the discussion seen by Reuters.
EMA was not immediately available for a comment.
EMA has publicly said it would decide on Pfizer's booster at the start of October, but has never given a precise date.
More than a dozen EU countries have already started administering boosters without official EMA backing. 
Official approval will provide legal protection to those countries and may spur others to launch a booster programme to fight the more infectious Delta variant during the winter months.
Two EU officials familiar with EMA's decision-making processes said next week's decision will focus on the booster's safety and effectiveness, and will be broad in scope, meaning that it will not indicate precisely which age or risk groups should receive it.
That would be in line with EMA's decisions on vaccine boosters for other diseases, such as tetanus.
The approach would also be consistent with EMA's earlier decisions in the pandemic - for instance it largely left it up to member states to decide whether to restrict vaccines in the face of potential side effects.
The broad guidance would allow states to tailor the use of boosters to their national needs, without risking administering them beyond the instructions authorised by EMA - which would increase their legal risks.
In August, EMA said there was not enough data to recommend using boosters, and the World Health Organization has called for a halt to boosters until more people around the world have been vaccinated.
""There is no need of boosters for the general population, but there is some waning effect, especially for the elderly,"" Cooke told EU legislators, according to minutes of Tuesday's internal meeting.
The wide guidance could amplify differences across EU states. Who gets a booster in the region is already fragmented. In Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic, authorities are aiming for wider rollouts, whereas in other states only some more vulnerable people would receive boosters.
The EU Commission has repeatedly warned that different national policies on vaccines can increase hesitancy. 
The EMA's broad approach would also differ from other major Western countries.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week recommended the Pfizer booster for those 65 and older, all people at high risk of severe disease, and others who are regularly exposed to the virus.
In the United Kingdom, boosters are being given to all adults aged 50 years or over, healthcare workers, and all those at high risk from COVID-19 or in close contact with immuno-suppressed individuals.
MANY SPARE DOSES
Scientists are divided over whether boosters are needed, because it is not yet completely clear how long protection lasts in people who have been fully vaccinated, the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) said.
However, EU states have already bought additional vaccines for boosters.
They agreed in May to buy at least 900 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. This came after the EU had already secured more than enough shots for its entire population from Pfizer and other vaccine makers.
Under the contract, EU governments are required to buy the 900 million shots mostly from next year, and could order another 900 million until 2023.
Given that nearly 75% of the EU's adult population has already been fully vaccinated, most of the additional Pfizer doses would likely be needed only if administered as boosters.
An alternative would be to donate or sell them to poorer nations who have not yet got enough doses. Some of the vaccines could also be deployed on children or be used against potential new variants. Pfizer has agreed to sell the EU modified shots if needed. 

But the decision on when a new variant may be predominant and whether the existing vaccine is not effective against it requires a complex procedure which makes it difficult to force Pfizer to provide an updated version, two people familiar with the contract told Reuters.
Pfizer had no comment on the contract with the EU but the company's boss Albert Bourla has said that it can develop in less than 100 days updated versions of its COVID-19 vaccine, if new variants emerged.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Factbox: Billionaires battle CEOs at Italy's Generali and Mediobanca,"MILAN (Reuters) - Power struggles at insurer Generali (MI:GASI) and Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) have billionaires Leonardo Del Vecchio and Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone pitted against the CEOs of both groups.
Here are the key facts in a growing confrontation over the strategies of both Italy's most powerful investment bank and the country's biggest insurer, which holds 61 billion euros in Italian government bonds. 
TYCOONS IN GENERALI PACT
Del Vecchio, 86, Caltagirone, 78, clinched a shareholder pact in September to consult over decisions concerning Generali ahead of a general meeting in early 2022 to name a new board.
They control a combined 12.5% stake in the insurer, after a third smaller investor recently joined their pact, and are opposing a third mandate for Generali's current CEO Philippe Donnet, who has the backing of Mediobanca.
They have criticised Donnet's M&A strategy as too timid, but have not explained what their alternative plan is.
MEDIOBANCA UPS GENERALI VOTING STAKE
Mediobanca last week borrowed shares to secure 17.2% of the voting rights in Generali until its AGM next year.
Mediobanca gets a third of its revenue from a 13% stake in Generali and is the biggest investor in the insurer. 
GENERALI BOARD DIVIDED
Generali's outgoing board on Monday agreed by a majority to file a slate of nominees for the April 2022 shareholder vote, including Donnet as CEO. The decision was backed by nine of 13 board members and opposed by the four representatives of the two tycoons.
MEDIOBANCA FEUD 
Del Vecchio proposed changing the merchant bank's by-laws at a shareholders meeting on Oct. 28, stepping up pressure on Mediobanca's top management. Del Vecchio, however, said he was not pushing for management or board changes.
Luxottica's founder is the bank's single biggest investor with a 18.9% stake. Caltagirone has also built a 3% stake in Mediobanca, piling pressure on its CEO Alberto Nagel.
SEEKING ALLIES
Caltagirone and Del Vecchio are expected to present their own slate of nominees for Generali's board, suggesting an alternative candidate as CEO. They are also seeking allies ahead of the April AGM. 
Italy's powerful Benetton family, which owns 4% of Generali and 2% of Mediobanca, is under the spotlight after announcing it was leaving the Milanese bank's shareholders pact.

Institutional investors own around 40% of Generali and their vote would be decisive at the AGM.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on Wednesday the company's decision to fire employees who defied its vaccine mandate will not affect the carrier's operations.
In an interview to CNBC, Kirby also said ticket sales have bottomed out, with the bookings for lucrative business travel rebounding to the levels seen in June.
The comments came a day after the Chicago-based airline said https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/united-airlines-says-more-than-99-us-employees-have-been-vaccinated-2021-09-28 it would start the process of firing 593 employees who failed to comply with its COVID-19 vaccination policy. 
In early August, United became the first U.S. carrier to require vaccinations for all domestic employees, requiring proof of vaccination by Monday.
The company had plans to put employees who received religious exemptions on temporary, unpaid personal leave starting Oct. 2. Those plans, however, have been put on hold until Oct. 15 because of a lawsuit challenging the policy.
Six United employees filed a class action https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-airlines-accused-refusing-employee-exemptions-vaccine-mandate-2021-09-22 in federal court in Texas last week claiming that workers who sought exemptions from the vaccine mandate were subjected to intrusive inquiries about their medical conditions or religious beliefs, including a requirement that they obtain letters from pastors. 
United said it has received requests for vaccine exemptions for religious or medical reasons from less than 3% of the airline's U.S. workforce of 67,000.
Excluding those who have sought an exemption, United said more than 99% of U.S.-based employees have been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Kirby said a vaccinated workforce will allow the airline to address any operational requirement. 
""We have planned and prepared for this that we are now able to confidently run a strong operation,"" he said.
Kirby said the airline would follow the guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in making a decision on whether to mandate COVID-19 vaccine booster shots.

He also said ticket sales have improved and the bookings for trans-Atlantic flights this week have been higher than the corresponding period in 2019.

WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) -The top U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday proposed requiring large hedge funds and endowments to disclose how they vote on executive pay, bringing this clutch of influential investors in line with other top funds that have made their pay votes public for a decade.
The proposal, subject to a 60-day period of public consultation before further action can take place, would also mandate investors provide more details about how share lending affects proxy voting as well as prescribe how funds and managers organize their reports by requiring the use of a structured data language to ease analysis.

Together, the changes from the Democratic-led agency are meant to bring more transparency to shareholder annual meetings, partly by implementing rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.
Among S&P 500 company CEOs average total pay rose 52% to $12.18 million in 2020 from $8 million a decade earlier, according to compensation consultant Farient Advisors.
Among other things Dodd-Frank mandated shareholders get the chance to cast so-called ""say-on-pay"" advisory votes on executive compensation, which have put a focus on CEO pay at many corporate annual meetings for the past decade.
The votes, combined with the disclosures that big mutual fund firms have filed since 2004 via Form N-PX, had already brought scrutiny to the biggest asset managers. 
But SEC Democratic Commissioner Allison Lee told https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/secs-lee-seeks-more-proxy-vote-details-powerhouse-funds-2021-03-17 an industry audience in March that the Form N-PX disclosures are too unwieldy to show retail investors how their money is voted and because they currently are not filed by certain investment firms.
Republican SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman voted in favor of the proposed changes, breaking ranks from his minority counterpart, Commissioner Hester Peirce, who had the sole dissent.
""The discretionary amendments to Form N-PX are being proposed in the name of enhanced transparency () but these could harm investors,"" said Peirce, adding that proxy voting is not the most important activity in which a fund engages. 
""These changes are unlikely material to influence an investor's choice to invest in a particular fund.""
Some managers have given up their rights to vote in exchange for fees when they lend out shares https://reut.rs/3ogxmNV to short-sellers. While this can cut costs for investors, it has also changed the outcome of corporate elections, according to proxy solicitors. 
Industry groups say that if the SEC's proposals prove too costly, those burdens would be passed on to fund shareholders. They also said the success of the SEC's rule change may depend on how quickly vendors can adapt to machine-readable technology.

Critics of the say-on-pay rule, including its co-author, say it did little https://www.reuters.com/article/ceo-pay-barneyfrank/dodd-frank-co-author-disappointed-on-pay-votes-cites-fund-managers-idINL2N0WR16B20150327 to slow the growth of rewards for top U.S. executives. 
Top asset managers still overwhelmingly back executive pay, according to new data from researcher Insightia showing that during the 12 months ended June 30 three of the largest fund firms each supported management on pay about 95% of the time, roughly the same as the prior period.

The BMW-owned brand said in a statement that its first fully electric powered car, named 'Spectre', will be on the market in the fourth quarter of 2023, with testing to begin soon.
""With this new product we set out our credentials for the full electrification of our entire product portfolio by 2030, said Torsten Muller-Otvos, CEO of Rolls-Royce, which is based in the south of England.
""By then, Rolls-Royce will no longer be in the business of producing or selling any internal combustion engine products,"" Muller-Otvos added.

BMW has not set an end date for producing fossil fuel burning cars, instead setting a goal of 50% electric vehicle production by 2030, but its subsidiary Mini said in March it would go all-electric by the end of the decade.

(Reuters) -Sergio Pasini, a manager at former carmaker Fiat Chrysler (FCA), now part of the Stellantis group, was released on Wednesday after being arrested two days before as part of a U.S. inquiry into diesel emissions rigging, a source familiar with the matter said.
Pasini was arrested on Monday in the northern Italian city of Ferrara during a regular patrolling service, police told Reuters earlier on Wednesday.
However, in a hearing on Wednesday the Court of Appeal of the city of Bologna ruled that Pasini should be freed as there was no risk of him escaping, the source said. 
Pasini was ordered to attend a hearing in Bologna in 40 days, when all documents and a full arrest order from U.S. authorities are available, at which the court will rule on a request for extradition to the United States, the source added.
Pasini's lawyers, Marco Calleri and Andrea Rossetti, did not comment.
His arrest follows an indictment in the United States earlier this year of Pasini on charges that included conspiring to rig diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests, another source said earlier on Wednesday.
Stellantis unit FCA U.S. said in an emailed statement it would continue to fully cooperate with the authorities regarding the diesel emissions issue and had nothing else to add beyond previous statements made on the matter. The company has previously denied purposefully attempting to evade emissions requirements.
A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.
In April, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled an indictment charging Pasini with conspiring to calibrate software in vehicles with diesel engines so they could dupe U.S. emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on roadways. 
Two other employees were also charged in the alleged emissions fraud. 
At issue are more than 100,000 diesel-powered Ram pickup trucks and Jeeps that were part of FCA's U.S. lineup.

FCA agreed in January 2019 to pay roughly $800 million to settle civil litigation brought by the Justice Department, state officials and customers alleging the company’s vehicles evaded emissions requirements. 
The Justice Department is conducting a separate ongoing criminal investigation of the company.

Most of the jobs will be permanent and full-time positions, Walmart said in a statement Wednesday. The hiring goal comes on top of a plan the company announced a month ago to add 20,000 supply-chain workers. 
The move by the nation’s largest private-sector employer signals even more competition for labor at a time when a tight market is already pushing companies to boost wages and benefits and enhance perks. Although retail employment hasn’t rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the industry is expected to add 700,000 employees this holiday season, according to hiring consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That’s down slightly from 2020.
 Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) plans to add 100,000 seasonal jobs, while  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS). and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX). are targeting a combined total of 190,000. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). is looking to hire 125,000 warehouse and shipping workers.   
Walmart didn’t specify how many of the new jobs will be seasonal. A year ago, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said it would recruit 20,000 people to help with the holiday shopping rush. This year, many existing employees will probably look for extra hours during the holiday season, and “we’ll continue to offer those opportunities,” Julie Murphy, Walmart’s chief people officer for the U.S., said in the statement. 
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its starting wage by a dollar an hour to $12 this month, while Sam’s Club, the company’s membership-based warehouse retailer, is now paying $15. Target also offers $15 an hour, while Costco (NASDAQ:COST) Warehouse Corp. has set its starting hourly wage at $16.

Investing.com – Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) stock fell nearly 1% Wednesday after supply chain challenges and pricier raw materials forced the company to lower its guidance for the current quarter as well as the financial year.
The company warned that its consolidated net sales in the current quarter could even fall below last year. At best, they would be flat, according to the company’s revised guidance.
For the full year, it sees net sales up by around 9% compared to a “high-single to low-double digit percentage” rise it expected in July.
The company had taken price increases during the second and Chief Executive Officer John G. Morikis had not ruled out further hikes at the time they gave the previous guidance. But the scenario has worsened and Morikis, in a note Tuesday, said “. . .we do not expect to see improved supply or lower raw material pricing in our fourth quarter as anticipated”.
The company said the hit from Hurricane Ida has been more severe and will be longer lasting than initially thought. Production of several key resins, additives and solvents, expected to resume by late September, has been pushed out. The company expressed confidence in recovering “majority of sales” over future quarters.
Sherwin-Williams is not alone in experiencing supply chain and raw material challenges. From Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), manufacturers are facing shortage of raw materials as supplies from China and Vietnam remain disturbed due to the pandemic and power shortages.
In other developments at the company, Sherwin-Williams said it will acquire Specialty Polymers, a supplier to the company and a manufacturer of water-based polymers used in architectural and industrial coatings. Revenue for the business was approximately $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2021."

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - Some instant messaging groups used by people owed money by property giant China Evergrande Group to organize protests and discuss claims have been blocked on Tencent Holdings’ WeChat platform, group members said on Wednesday.
Eight users across at least eight different groups, each numbering around 200 to 500 people, said they were prevented from sending new messages to the groups starting from Tuesday morning. Tencent declined to comment and the Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The crisis at Evergrande, weighed down under $305 billion in debt and in the midst of a cash crunch, poses a challenge for the government. It wants to impose financial discipline but analysts say it is wary of a messy collapse that could fuel unrest by local investors, suppliers and homebuyers.
Angry homebuyers and retail investors launched protests in several cities in recent weeks, and many took to social media platforms like WeChat, the country's most popular messaging app, to voice their grievances. 
Earlier this month, Reuters witnessed protesters being taken away outside Evergrande headquarters in Shenzhen, and similar scenes have been shared in WeChat groups.
On Wednesday, two WeChat users reported seeing the error message ""limits have been placed on this group because it violates relevant rules and regulations"". A screenshot seen separately by Reuters confirmed that wording.
Three other users said the groups had been deleted from their WeChat app. Another two users also said they could not access their groups.
Two people who had been members of some of the groups said separately that they were visited by Chinese law enforcement on Sunday and asked to sign papers pledging not to join any gatherings or do anything illegal. They declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
China's Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Evergrande's woes, which include missing payment on a global bond coupon last week, have rattled global markets but received scant coverage in official Chinese media, and Beijing has said little publicly about the situation.
An Evergrande exchange filing on Wednesday said it would sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake it owns in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd 2066.HK to a state-owned asset management company.
Chinese social media companies are subject to strict laws requiring them to censor content that ""undermines social stability"" or is critical of the central government, controls that have tightened under President Xi Jinping.

It was unclear whether other Chinese social media platforms were also blocking Evergrande posts. On the Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), videos of unhappy creditors confronting Evergrande staff as well as complaints targeting the property developer could be seen on Wednesday.
Some WeChat users complained on Weibo that their Evergrande-related WeChat groups had been blocked.

MILAN (Reuters) -Eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio has stepped up pressure on Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY)'s top managers by proposing governance changes at the Italian merchant bank, two years after emerging as its top shareholder.
The move comes as Del Vecchio, 86, is engaged in a boardroom spat with Mediobanca over Generali (MI:GASI), Italy's top insurer in which Mediobanca is the biggest shareholder.
The founder of Ray-Ban owner Luxottica and one of Italy's richest man, Del Vecchio is also a long-time investor in Generali.
He has stoked uncertainty over the fate of both Generali and Mediobanca by building his 18.9% stake in the Milanese bank that used to pull the strings of Italy Inc - a holding currently worth 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion).
Del Vecchio's holding company Delfin late on Tuesday said it would propose amending Mediobanca's by-laws at an Oct. 28 annual general meeting to encourage ""the creation of value for all shareholders ... and ultimately leave the right to directors and shareholders ... to decide who should run the bank.""
Delfin added it had no plans to push to replace Mediobanca's current management and board, whose mandate expires with approval of results to June 30, 2023.
Mediobanca acknowledged the proposal in a note and said it would hold a board meeting in the coming days.
Delfin said it wanted Mediobanca to ditch a requirement in its by-laws stating that up to three directors must be executives who have held that role for at least three years.
Delfin also said it wanted the board to have more independent directors picked from at least two slates of nominees submitted by minority investors.
""We expect the market to favour the first proposal ... but the second proposal could have a less market-friendly outcome,"" Citi analyst Azzura Guelfi said, noting the influence of other minority investors could be limited if Delfin proposes one of the slates. 
After initially criticising the strategy of boss Alberto Nagel, focusing in particular on Mediobanca's reliance on profits derived from the Generali stake, Del Vecchio has praised Nagel's latest business plan presented in November 2019.
Del Vecchio and Nagel have locked horns over a project for a Milanese hospital in the past and they are now battling over who should lead Generali.
Mediobanca, which is pushing to keep on CEO Philippe Donnet for a third term, on Monday scored a victory when Generali's board endorsed Donnet's reappointment.
Del Vecchio earlier this month struck a pact with fellow businessman Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, another leading investor in Generali, to push for a change of CEO and strategy.
The power struggle over two prized financial assets like Mediobanca and Generali on Tuesday prompted Italy's Benetton family, like Del Vecchio and Caltagirone an investor in both companies, to pledge to keep a neutral stance in relation to all of its investments.

By 1318 GMT shares in Mediobanca were up 2%, outperforming Milan's blue-chip index, with traders citing the stock's speculative appeal.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 10:01AM ET</span>",Factbox - COVID-19 and the U.S. courts: challenges to vaccine requirements,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - U.S. employers, universities and local governments are increasingly putting COVID-19 vaccine mandates in place to contain outbreaks of the disease as infection rates remain high.
Workers who fear losing their jobs for refusing the shots are turning to the courts. The following are some of the key cases.
- Employees fighting mandates and termination 
Many large U.S. employers have announced vaccine mandates, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and the federal government. 
Legal experts have said requiring vaccines is one way an employer can meet its duty to reduce workplace hazards such as COVID-19.
The cases against government employers generally allege that mandates violate the right to bodily integrity under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Cases against private employers tend to focus on violations of laws that bar mistreatment based on disabilities and religious beliefs.
In the first case considering an injunction against a private employer, a federal judge in Covington, Kentucky, upheld a vaccine requirement for staff at St. Elizabeth Healthcare, which operates facilities in the Cincinnati area. The judge said employees could refuse the vaccine and quit.
Houston Methodist Hospital, which was the first large health system to impose a COVID-19 vaccine requirement on employees, won quick dismissal of a case before an injunction was considered.
Gainesville, Florida dropped its mandate covering around 2,200 city employees and contractors after a Florida judge temporarily blocked the requirement because the city did not provide evidence it served a compelling interest. It appears to be the largest mandate to have been withdrawn.
- Challenges to mandates for students and teachers
More than 500 colleges and universities have imposed vaccine requirements and many have been challenged in court, sometimes for denying student requests for a religious exemption.
In the most detailed ruling that is often cited by other courts, a federal judge said Indiana University acted reasonably to protect public health by requiring vaccines, or masking and testing. The judge said students could choose to attend a different school or postpone their education if they did not want to take a vaccine.
Federal courts in similar cases have sided with the University of Massachusetts, University of Connecticut and Creighton University in Nebraska. 
A U.S. judge issued an injunction against the University of Western Michigan requirement for student athletes because it violated the students' religious beliefs and the judge found the school could have achieved the same goals without inoculations.
Federal and state judges upheld New York City's vaccine mandate for Department of Education employees. A U.S. appeals court briefly put the policy on hold before allowing it to go ahead.
- Lawsuits over government vaccine requirements
Some states have imposed requirements that healthcare workers to get COVID-19 vaccines while other states have banned vaccine mandates for public sector workers. Both approaches have prompted legal challenges.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was sued over a vaccine requirement for customers at restaurants, theaters and gyms.
The Montana Medical Association sued to block a state law that prevents private employers in the state from requiring vaccines for employees.

In one of the first rulings, a federal judge in New Mexico on Sept. 13 upheld the state's requirement that hospital workers and state fair attendees be vaccinated, finding the order did not violate a fundamental right.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd convinced a federal judge in Miami on Aug. 8 to prevent Florida officials from enforcing a state ban on ""vaccine passports."" The ruling allowed the cruise line to require passengers boarding its ships in Florida to prove they had been vaccinated, without fear the company would be fined by state officials.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday, in a modest rebound from their worst one-day loss in months on Tuesday. 
However, the early bounce was less vigorous than the overnight rebound in index futures had indicated, suggesting that market participants remain essentially cautious, if not outright bearish, as the political theater in Washington DC over the federal government debt ceiling approaches its ritual climax.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 66 points, or 0.2%, at 34,366 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
Earlier, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker gave a reminder of what's increasingly dominating the market's thoughts, saying he would support a decision to start running down the Fed's bond purchases in November and phase them out entirely by the middle of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely repeat such sentiments in a panel discussion at 1145 AM ET (1645) hosted by the European Central Bank.
The megacaps that have supported the rally for most of the summer posted modest gains, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock shrugging off a report of component shortages for its iPhone 13 suite to add 1.2%. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock both rose 0.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 0.7% and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock rose 0.8%. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock's rebound was supported by news that it has bought videogame maker Night School Studio in a further sign of it trying to diversify its revenue sources. 
Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rose 13.4% on a report that the company will begin deliveries of its luxury electric sedans in October, a development that provides for more competition for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the premium EV space. Earlier this week, the Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle Gores Guggenheim announced plans to take Polestar, the EV unit of Volvo Cars, public through a merger. 
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) stock also gained over 12% after it announced plans to raise prices on selected items to as much as $1.50 to restore margins that have been hurt by higher purchasing costs. It also said it will increase the scope of its stock buyback program.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>","Walmart to hire 150,000 U.S. store workers ahead of holiday season","(Reuters) -Walmart Inc said on Wednesday it was planning to hire about 150,000 new U.S. store workers, most of them permanent and full-time, in preparation for the busy holiday season.
The U.S. retailer also said it would offer extra hours to many of its store workers during the period, days after rival  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) also said it would provide more work hours for its retail employees amid a labor shortage in the country.
Retailers have been offering pay raises and other incentives to retain staff to ensure they have enough workers during the holiday shopping season, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has implemented three wage increases this year, with its U.S. average hourly wage now at $16.40. It also offers other benefits such as no-cost college tuition, similar to many of its rivals.

Walmart had previously announced it would hire 20,000 workers in its supply chain facilities to permanent roles as people have increasingly adopted curbside pickup and delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Target had said last week it was hiring more store fulfillment experts to better support in-store pickup and a service where store workers bring customer orders to their cars.

Scott Soussa, who had been the co-head of Blackstone's hedge fund and private equity stakes business within its Blackstone Alternative Asset Management unit, will join New York-based Angelo Gordon in April 2022.
Blackstone said earlier this year that Soussa was leaving for another opportunity but had agreed to remain with the company until the end of the year.
Soussa is the first senior hire made by Josh Baumgarten and Adam Schwartz, who took the reins as the $44 billion firm's co-chief executive officers in January 2021 after co-founder Michael Gordon stepped back from managing its day to day affairs. John Angelo, with whom Gordon founded the firm in 1988, died in 2016.

Baumgarten and Schwartz praised Soussa's knowledge of investment strategies and perspectives into the alternative investment management sector, and said in a statement that they look forward to his contributions and introducing him to their limited partners. 
Baumgarten also heads credit at the firm, while Schwartz is the head of real estate.

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 09:33AM ET</span>",Lucid to start deliveries of electric cars with range exceeding Tesla's in October,"By Hyunjoo Jin
CASA GRANDE, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. startup Lucid Group Inc said on Tuesday it will start delivering luxury electric sedans with a Tesla-beating driving range in late October, posing a major challenge to the market leader whose sales of premium models have stagnated. 
The California-based Lucid began production of its long-delayed Lucid Air cars at its Arizona factory on Tuesday, and said it aims to ramp plant's capacity up to 90,000 vehicles per annum in the next two years.
The top-end Lucid Air Dream Edition will be available in late October, followed by less expensive models: Grand Touring, Touring and Air Pure. The company said it has received more than 13,000 reservations for Lucid Air models, and it has increased the planned total production of the Lucid Air Dream Edition to 520 vehicles. 
A version of the Lucid Air Dream Edition, priced at $169,000, received an official U.S. government rating of a 520-mile (837 km) driving range, over 100 miles more than its closest rival, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model S, which is priced at $89,990. The higher range helped lead to a 23% jump in Lucid's shares this month.
Speaking at the production site, Lucid Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson, a former chief engineer on the Tesla Model S, said his company's cars have an advantage in battery technology and costs over the Model S. 
""We've ridden customers of the fear of range anxiety,"" he said. ""The next big obstacle is cost effectiveness of electric cars. We've got to get the cost down.""
He said the Air Pure, the least expensive version with a price tag of $77,400, will go into production late next year.
EXECUTION CHALLENGE
The company, founded in 2007, received funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in 2018 before going public via a shell company https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lucidmotors-m-a-churchill-cap-iv-excl/exclusive-lucid-motors-nears-spac-deal-as-klein-launches-financing-sources-idUSKBN2AG2D6 in July. 
""(20)17 and (20)18 were brutal. The company was in a parlous state. And then I've got to say, we met a perfect partner,"" he said. 
Rawlinson, who left Tesla in 2012, faces tasks similar to those of Tesla in its early days, including how to address manufacturing challenges and scale up production. 
""I think the big challenge for Lucid will be execution,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal analyst at Guidehouse Insights. ""I think that they have a very good car. It's very attractive."" 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in June that Tesla has canceled its plan to launch a Model S Plaid+, with a target driving range of 520 miles, saying the Model S Plaid itself is ""just so good"" https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-launch-high-end-model-s-plaid-fend-off-mercedes-porsche-2021-06-10.
Musk reiterated this month that ""production is hard"".
""Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard,"" he said, citing carmakers' razor-thin margins. 
Tesla's combined sales of Model S and Model X luxury models stood at only 1,890 in the second quarter of this year, down from 22,300 during the same period three years ago. Tesla does not break out figures for the two high-end models. 
""The Model S doesn't look fundamentally different from a Model S nine years ago,"" Abuelsamid said. ""In the premium market, customers are looking for the latest and greatest.""

Musk in October 2020 cut the price of its Model S, shortly after Lucid announced the pricing of its base model. ""The gauntlet has been thrown down! The prophecy will be fulfilled,"" he tweeted at that time.
Electric vehicle maker Rivian, backed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and now preparing for a public stock listing, earlier this month started production of electric pickup trucks. That move came ahead of similar expected moves by Tesla, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shareholders in British sportswear retailer Frasers Group on Wednesday backed a new executive share scheme which could earn chief executive designate Michael Murray 100 million pounds ($137 million).
Frasers, which was formerly called  Sports Direct  (LON:FRAS) and is controlled by founder Mike Ashley, said last month that Murray would succeed Ashley as CEO on May 1 next year.
Murray, currently Frasers' ""head of elevation"", is the partner of Ashley's daughter.
At the firm's annual investor meeting 86.6% of votes cast were in favour of the bonus scheme, while 13.4% opposed it. Ashley owns 64% of the equity.
Ahead of the meeting investor advisory groups had recommended shareholders vote against the scheme. 
As per the scheme, Murray would receive 100 million pounds of Frasers stock if the share price hits 15 pounds for 30 consecutive trading days before October 2025.
Frasers has said the target ""is suitably challenging but achievable and would be evidence of the success of the group's elevation strategy and Michael's leading role in this.""
The stock was trading at 692.3 pence at 1140 GMT.
Murray will also be paid a salary of 1 million pounds a year.

At the meeting 13.7% of votes cast opposed Frasers' remuneration report, while 15.1% opposed its remuneration policy.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>",China Evergrande to sell $1.5 billion stake in Shengjing Bank to state firm,"By Donny Kwok and Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Scrambling to avoid defaulting on its debts, cash-strapped China Evergrande Group said on Wednesday it plans to sell a 9.99 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) stake in Shengjing Bank Co Ltd to a state-owned asset management company.
Shengjing Bank, one of the main lenders to Evergrande, had demanded that all net proceeds from the disposal be used to settle the financial liabilities of the property developer due to the lender, Evergrande said in an exchange filing.
That requirement suggests that Evergrande, which missed a bond interest payment last week, will be unable to use the funds for other purposes such as another interest payment to offshore bondholders of $47.5 million due on Wednesday.
The payment deadline is being closely watched by investors as the developer's next big test in public markets. Shares of Evergrande rose as much as 15% on Wednesday. 
Evergrande has rapidly become China's biggest corporate headache as it teeters between a messy meltdown with far-reaching impacts, a managed collapse or the less likely prospect of a bailout by Beijing. 
The 1.75 billion shares, representing 19.93% of the issued share capital of the bank, will be sold for 5.70 yuan apiece to Shenyang Shengjing Finance Investment Group Co Ltd, a state-owned enterprise involved in capital and asset management, Evergrande said in its filing.
Shenyang Shengjing's stake in the bank will be increased to 20.79% after the deal to become the bank's largest shareholder. Evergrande's stake in the bank would be reduced to 14.75% from 34.5%.
""The company's liquidity issue has adversely affected Shengjing Bank in a material way,"" Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan said in the statement.
""The introduction of the purchaser, being a state-owned enterprise, will help stabilise the operations of Shengjing Bank and at the same time, help increase and maintain the value of the 14.75% interest in Shengjing Bank retained by the company.""
As of the first half last year, the bank had 7 billion yuan in loans to Evergrande, accounting for 1.19% of the lender's loan book, according to a report by brokerage CCB International last week, citing news reports.
The financial health of Shengjing Bank has come under the spotlight since May, after financial news outlet Caixin reported that China's top banking watchdog was investigating connected transactions worth more than 100 billion yuan ($15.45 billion) between Evergrande and the bank.
On July 5, Evergrande said in a statement its financial business with Shengjing complied with legal requirements. 
Days after that announcement, China's northern city of Shenyang, where Shengjing is based, encouraged local state-owned companies to increase stakes in the bank.
The Shenyang government said it valued reforms at Shengjing Bank and would strengthen the Communist Party leadership in the bank to help it develop into ""a good bank,"" according to a statement in July.
Beijing is prodding government-owned firms and state-backed property developers to purchase some of embattled China Evergrande Group's assets, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Shengjing reported a net profit of 1.03 billion yuan in the first half of 2021, down 63.6% from a year earlier, citing the impact of COVID-19, a decline in net interest income and increased provisions for impairment losses of assets due to ""increased uncertainty of business operations"".

The bank's non-performing loan ratio stood at 3.04% by the end-June, higher than the industry-wide average of nearly 2%. 
This story corrects 10th paragraph to say Shengjing Bank's 7 billion yuan loan accounts for 1.19% of its own loan book

Investing.com –  NuCana  stock (NASDAQ:NCNA) climbed 22% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the Food and Drug Administration fast-tracked the company’s experimental drug for treatment of biliary tract cancer.
The drug, acelarin, is currently being evaluated in a phase-III study for the first-line treatment of patients.
The FDA's announcement means that company and regulator will now stay in constant touch throughout the entire drug development and review process. This will ensure quick resolution of questions and issues to eventually result in earlier drug approval and access by patients, assuming the drug meets FDA norms.
A drug is fast tracked when no previous treatment exists or when the proposed solution has proven to be better than the available therapy.
The biliary tract comprises the gallbladder and interconnecting ducts responsible for the transport of bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. Approximately 178,000 new cases of biliary tract cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, with more than 18,000 of those diagnoses in the U.S.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 08:07AM ET</span>",Hong Kong legislature passes controversial anti-doxxing privacy bill,"By Pak Yiu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's legislature on Wednesday passed a privacy law tackling ""doxxing"" - the public release of information identifying an individual or organisation - that critics say could be used to protect those in power and target civil society.
Supporters say the legislation was long overdue to counter a problem festering since the city's 2019 mass pro-democracy protests. Some officers' home addresses and children's schools were exposed by anti-government protesters, leading to threats.
But some technology companies are concerned the legislation is so broad and vague that it could hamper operations in Hong Kong. Human rights and pro-democrcay groups fear it could be used to crack down on dissent.
""This is to fight doxxing behaviour that divides society, as early as possible,"" Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Secretary Erick Tsang, said in the Legislative Council, which has no opposition party.
""Foreign platforms have their own company policies requiring content on their platform to not violate the relevant local laws. Because of that we have confidence most foreign internet platforms will abide by notices to stop publishing under the new law.""
The law empowers The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to investigate and prosecute doxxing. Violators include anyone who discloses an individual's personal data without consent ""with an intent to cause specified harm or being reckless"" about the harm caused.
""Specified harm"" includes harassment, threat, intimidation, bodily harm, psychological harm, causing the victim to be concerned about safety, and others. Violators could face fines of up to HK$1 million ($129,000) and five years in prison.
The commissioner can apply for a warrant to enter and search premises and seize materials for investigation, and can access electronic devices without a warrant. It can also issue notices to remove content or block access to that content, anywhere in the world. 

Asia Internet Coalition, an advocacy group that includes Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), said in a June 25 letter to the commissioner that tech companies could stop offering their services in Hong Kong if authorities went ahead with the changes.
The coalition said the measures were ""not aligned with global norms and trends,"" and that any legislation that could curb freedom of speech ""must be built upon principles of necessity and proportionality"".

The owner of the cats was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Sept. 21 and the local disease control agency euthanised her three cats, which also tested positive later, despite her objections, Beijing News reported late on Tuesday. 
""There is probably no professional medical treatment for animals infected with the novel coronavirus,"" a community worker said in an interview with Beijing News, explaining why the cats were killed.
The community worker said the cats would have continued to leave viral traces in the room.
""It doesn't seem very realistic that the cats would contaminate the environment so badly that they would be a risk for their owner to re-contract COVID,"" said Rachael Tarlinton, a virology professor at Britain's University of Nottingham, adding that surfaces are not a major route of viral transmission.
Scientists have said there is no evidence yet that pets play a major role in spreading the virus to people.
""I firmly disagree with this approach! To put it bluntly, it's a crude, simplistic and lazy form of management, just in order to dodge responsibility,"" one social media user posted on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's version of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The Beijing News report was deleted from its social media channels on Wednesday. The outlet posted a commentary on Wednesday on Weibo calling on authorities to roll out standards for how to deal with infected pets.
China has contained most regional coronavirus outbreaks within weeks by enforcing mass testing and community lockdowns even when just a few cases are reported.
Feng Zijian, a researcher with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said pet cats should be killed if they repeatedly return positive results, according to Beijing News' Tuesday report. 
Vanessa Barrs, a professor at City University of Hong Kong specialising in animal health and disease, said the risk of transmission from infected pets to people is low.
""So far, in the whole pandemic, there have been no confirmed reports of cat to human infection, unlike the situation with farmed mink in Europe, where transmission from COVID-19 infected mink to humans occurred,"" she said.
""The situation is very different for pet cats and dogs and other solutions can be implemented for animals.""

Investing.com – Lucid stock (NASDAQ:LCID) traded 6.5% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as the company said the buyers of Lucid Air Dream Edition models, its luxury electric sedans, will begin to get their vehicles late next month.
Grand Touring, Touring, and Air Pure model deliveries are expected to follow. Lucid said in a statement it has received more than 13,000 reservations so far for Lucid Air and increased the planned total production volume for the Dream Edition to 520 vehicles.
The launch heats up the stakes in the electric vehicle industry, where Tesla still has a substantial first-mover advantage, despite the ramp up of efforts by legacy carmakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F). 
Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency certified that the range of the company's Air Dream Edition Range of cars outstrips any other in the EV space, including the most popular Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Lucid’s 19-inch wheel secured a rating of 520 miles on one full charge from the EPA, making it the longest-range EV ever rated by the body. That title so far belonged to Tesla's Model S Long Range Plus.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Payments to phone makers to pre-install only Google Search on their devices were not aimed at preventing competition but were necessary for Android to seize market share from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google told Europe's second-top court on Wednesday.
Google was addressing the General Court on the third day of a week-long hearing as it tries to get judges to dismiss a record 4.3-billion-euro ($3.7 billion) EU antitrust fine and a European Commission order to loosen its search engine grip on Android devices. 
The EU competition watchdog had taken issue with two kinds of deals made with phone makers, one being payments for only pre-installing Google Search on their devices known as revenue sharing arrangements (RSAs) because these shut out rivals.
This was not the case and the payments were just to encourage phone makers, which were already generating money from other apps, to give Android a place, Google lawyer Assimakis Komninos told the court.
""Google had to offer an offsetting revenue stream. An incentive to convince them to open up and adopt the Android platform. At the same time, the RSAs also helped them to keep prices down and compete more successfully with Apple,"" he said.
""And obviously, Google was getting in return a promotional opportunity, sole preinstallation, which allowed it to invest in a free OS (operating system), a free app store and so on.""
On top of that, the RSAs only covered 5% of the market, Komninos said.
Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan rejected the claim.
""What concerned them was competitors gaining traction,"" he said and the RDAs were ""the pinnacle of Google's interlocking practices"".

A verdict is likely to come next year. The case is T-604/18 Google vs European Commission

The shortened working hours affect the first two weeks of October, the company said, adding that on Oct. 1 only one assembly line would be running at the plant, located at the carmaker's headquarters.

Carmakers around the world have had to cut or adjust production in the wake of the shortage, which Volkswagen has said cost it a high six-digit number in lost vehicle production in the first half of the year.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's UniCredit is working on a scheme to offload risks on 11.8 billion euros ($14 billion) of Monte dei Paschi loans deemed in danger of turning sour as it discusses a possible acquisition of the state-owned rival, three sources close to the matter said.
UniCredit agreed to exclusive talks with Italy's Treasury on July 29 to buy ""selected parts"" of Monte dei Paschi (MPS), which is 64% owned by the state following a 2017 bailout.
Discussions are expected to enter a crunch phase after local elections and a vote in MPS' hometown of Siena on Oct. 3-4 to assign a vacant parliamentary seat.
The sources said the transaction would see state-owned bad loan manager AMCO underwrite, together with co-investors, the riskier notes in a so-called synthetic securitisation deal, effectively taking on the risk of losses on the loans in question.
The scheme is one of several options under consideration and a final decision is yet to be taken, a fourth source said.
Both UniCredit and AMCO declined to comment.
Unlike ordinary securitisations, synthetic deals leave the underlying loan portfolio with the bank that originated it but shift the related risks, freeing up regulatory capital.
In agreeing to discuss an acquisition targeting MPS' branches in Tuscany, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Veneto, UniCredit has set very strict terms for a deal - which must not affect its own capital.
UniCredit has said it will not take any of MPS' 4.2 billion euros of gross problem loans, which will go instead to AMCO, adding to 7.1 billion euros in soured loans it relieved the bank of last year in preparation for a sale of the lender.
UniCredit also said in July it had an option to discard any MPS loans it deemed too risky. Banks class loans seen in high danger of turning sour as 'Stage 2'.
The sources said UniCredit would be shielded from the risk on 11.8 billion euros of such loans thanks to the scheme.
As of June 30, MPS held 15 billion euros in Stage 2 loans, which included 43% of loans under moratorium and 27% of loans guaranteed by the state under emergency measures deployed to counter the COVID-19 crisis.
AMCO, which has become a major player in the Italian market for problem loans by aiding troubled banks, has said it is preparing to invest in 'Stage 2' loans through synthetic securitisation deals.

The presence of co-investors in the junior and mezzanine tranches, which one source said could total 3 billion euros, would ensure the MPS transaction is carried out at market conditions and complies with European Union competition rules.

DUBLIN/LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Ryanair on Wednesday said it would appeal a ruling by Europe's second-highest court rejecting its challenge against an EU order to repay millions of euros in illegal aid given by an Austrian airport.
The Luxembourg-based General Court also dismissed a challenge by TUIfly on the same issue.
The European Commission in its 2016 decision said certain airport services and marketing agreements between the operator of Klagenfurt airport in southern Austria and Ryanair, TUIfly and HLX - which was merged with Hapagfly in 2007 to create TUIfly - gave the carriers an unfair advantage.
The EU competition watchdog said the lossmaking deals amounted to state aid for the airlines as they reduced their operating costs. 
It estimated the illegal aid to Ryanair at around 2 million euros ($1.7 million), to TUIfly at 1.1 million and to HLX at 9.6 million. Both Ryanair and TUIfly subsequently challenged the decisions.
The Court agreed with the Commission in both cases. Ryanair's appeal will now be heard by the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest.

The cases are T-448/18 Ryanair and Others v Commission, and T-447/18 TUIfly v Commission.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded 0.8% higher in Wednesday’s premarket even as worries mount over supplies of key components for its latest gadget, the iPhone13.
The company is staring at a disruption in supplies of camera modules that it sources from Vietnam, according to a Nikkei report. The modules go into all the four new models of the phone as opposed to being present in only the premium iPhone 12 Pro Max earlier. This means a big jump in its demand for the module, at a time when contractors are struggling to deliver.
Vietnam has been ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic in recent months, something already illustrated by Nike's profit warning last week. Earlier Wednesday, the country's statistics office said gross domestic product was down 6.2% on the year in August, due mainly to widespread factory closures.
The modules are crucial in that they equip the phone with sensor-shift optical image stabilization, a feature that helps in capturing stable images and videos even while the person is in motion.
The wait time for an iPhone 13 Pro Sierra Blue with 512 GB storage is up to five weeks in China and Japan and four weeks in the U.S.
Other parts too have been in short supply and the company has had to divert some chips meant for its new iPads for use in the iPhone 13 series, as per the Nikkei report. That has meant the company restricting consumers in China to a maximum of two iPad purchases for the new models.
The power crisis in China is also now threatening to raise the anxiety levels though so far assemblers Foxconn (OTC:HNHPF), Pegatron and Luxshare remain unaffected."

Wood’s Ark Investment Management offloaded more than 340,000 Tesla shares across three exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, according to the firm’s daily trading update. 
Some 11% of the famous ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) is still betting on Elon Musk’s company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm tends to trim the stake when it rises above 10%. Tesla has generally outperformed in the global rout hitting rate-sensitive investing styles, while ARKK posted one of its worst sessions in months on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile data overnight showed money managers withdrew $297 million from the growth-focused fund on Monday, the most since March, to bring the four-day outflow to more than $660 million.
Since the Federal Reserve signaled last week a move to taper pandemic stimulus, Treasury yields have jumped and sent a shockwave through growth shares. Ark funds are heavily exposed to such names thanks to Wood’s focus on disruptive innovation and tech.
Tesla remains Wood’s largest bet as the biggest holding for the flagship ARKK fund as well as the firm overall. She predicts its shares will rise from around $778 currently to $3,000. However, Ark often trims its stake in the carmaker when it has performed very well or grown too large in the portfolio.
The carmaker is up 5.7% this month, compared with 5.2% drop for the Nasdaq 100 tech gauge. ARKK is down 8.2%.
Trading arrangements for the Ark ETFs mean flow data arrives with a one-day lag, but given ARKK’s 4.2% slump on Tuesday it’s likely there were more outflows in the latest session. If so, the amount of Tesla sold by the firm could have been higher than $270 million, since the daily trading updates show only actions by the Ark team, and do not include redemption activity caused by investor flows.
ARKK gained 1.4% in early trading as of 7 a.m. in New York, while futures for the Nasdaq 100 added 0.9% and Tesla climbed 0.9%.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, rebounding after the previous session’s rout, with U.S. debt ceiling negotiations and Micron’s downbeat guidance in focus.
At 7:15 AM ET (1115 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 155 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.6%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 90 points, or 0.6%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 500 points, or 1.6%, on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 2%, while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite was particularly hard hit, slumping 2.8%, its worst day since March. 
Surging bond yields prompted the selloff, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since June just below 1.57%, after Fed chair Jerome Powell warned, in a speech to the Senate Banking Committee, that the recent rise in inflation may last longer than anticipated.
The 10-year yield has slipped back to 1.51% on Wednesday, easing the pressure on the mega cap tech stocks, like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which all dropped more than 3% on Tuesday.
That said, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the world's biggest memory chip suppliers, is set to weigh on the sector when the market opens Wednesday after it provided disappointing first-quarter guidance late Tuesday. It also warned of supply chain issues that could disrupt shipments further down the line.
Also weighing on sentiment is the prospect of a U.S. default with lawmakers in Washington at loggerheads over whether to extend government funding beyond Thursday and raise or suspend the debt ceiling.
The economic data slate is largely empty Wednesday, with the sole release of importance being the pending home sales for August. These are due at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), and are expected to have risen 1.4% month-on-month after a 1.8% drop in July.
Crude prices weakened Wednesday following a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles, interrupting a rally that was given fresh legs by OPEC's upbeat forecast for global demand on Tuesday.
U.S. crude inventories grew by just over 4 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute. That would be the first increase in the country’s stocks in eight weeks if confirmed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration later Wednesday.
By 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $74.81 a barrel, slipping from its highest level since July, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $77.91, after previously reaching its highest since October 2018.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM is looking at raising fresh funds soon after completing a share issue earlier this year, bolstered by a positive trend in bookings since the United States announced a reopening to Europeans, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
""We did at our annual general meeting in May request from our shareholders flexibility on how we could look to recapitalise the group,"" CEO Ben Smith told reporters.
""We are studying right now what some of the options are, what some of the tools could be to be able to do just that. We are expecting to place another recapitalisation in the coming months,"" he said at an aircraft delivery ceremony.
Asked whether he saw any fund-raising happening before the end of the year, he said: ""I cant give you a full confirmation; we would like to make sure that we do it as soon as possible.""
In April, Smith said Air France-KLM may raise more capital to bolster its balance sheet and reduce debt as travel begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Talk of recovery accelerated earlier this month when the United States said it would reopen to travellers from 33 countries, including most of Europe, who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Asked on Wednesday to what extent this had prompted an immediate spike in transatlantic bookings, Smith said: ""a lot"".
The North Atlantic is the most lucrative market for Europe's largest long-haul carriers but business travel, which makes up the lion's share of profits, has been hit hard by the crisis.
Air France-KLM expects to benefit from pent-up demand from large corporate customers and others eager to travel to renew business contact with customers. But it is to early to say how far this will result in a sustained recovery, Smith said.
He said Air France-KLM was less exposed than rivals British Airways and Lufthansa to trends in corporate travel because up to half of its premium cabins had been filled with people travelling for leisure even before the pandemic.
Paris is seen as a prime destination for wealthy tourists.

The head of the group's French network, Anne Rigail, said earlier on Wednesday that Air France was beginning to see some recovery in business travel on domestic routes.
""We are seeing some signs in particular on domestic routes, with some conferences taking place especially in the south of France, but we are still very far from 2019 levels at this stage,"" Rigail told reporters at the A220 delivery.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2021 06:23AM ET</span>",Analysis: Auto industry wonders whether Ford-SK battery plants will sport the union label,"By David Shepardson and Ben Klayman
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - The plan for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Korean battery partner SK Innovation to build three battery plants in the United States, announced this week, will prompt a furious drive by labor leaders to organize the plants, potentially setting the tone for future union drives at auto industry factories in the U.S. South.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents about 150,000 hourly workers at the U.S. plants for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis NV, is working to represent workers at battery plants. Union leaders have said Ford has a ""moral obligation"" to make sure battery plant jobs are good-paying union jobs. 
The fate of these workers is so important because building electric cars and the batteries that power them is largely where the job growth lies in the auto sector. If the UAW strikes out in the Ford-SK plants, it could face the risk of further erosion of membership as consumers buy fewer gasoline-powered vehicles.
The UAW has strong allies in Washington as U.S. President Joe Biden has called on U.S. automakers to deepen their relationships with the union, and House Democratic leaders want to give union-made U.S. electric vehicles an extra $4,500 in consumer retail incentives.
However, Elon Musk, the chief executive of EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, whose plants are non-union, suggested on Tuesday the Biden administration was controlled by unions when it comes to EV policy.
While unions have seen a broad uptick in public support, the UAW faces a huge challenge in organizing new plants, said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research. Many of the newer plants are located in union-resistant states in the South and West, such as western Tennessee where the new Ford truck and battery plants will be built.
""It is going to be a challenge and one that will test the new leadership of the UAW” to organize the new truck assembly plant, Dziczek said. ""It would be a big win for the UAW to organize the battery plants."" 
TICKING CLOCK
The clock is ticking for the UAW, in which membership has declined sharply over the decades. UAW President Ray Curry, who attended a Ford event in Tennessee on Tuesday to celebrate the company's plan to build new electric F-150 assembly and battery plants https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-sk-invest-114-bln-add-electric-f-150-plant-three-battery-factories-2021-09-27 there, said the union is ""eager to work with Ford to continue to assure the culture of manufacturing high-quality vehicles and components for their customers.""
Ford's North American chief operating officer, Lisa Drake, told Reuters that ""in any environment, it's up to a workforce to decide if they want to be represented."" 
She was quick to add, however, that Ford is the largest employer of UAW-represented employees in the United States and that it has asked SK not to take an anti-union stance when it comes to the joint-venture battery plants to be built in Tennessee and Kentucky.
Biden's administration is backing the union.
White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese tweeted on Tuesday that ""Ford's announcement to invest in good-paying union jobs and wages shows that approach is starting to pay off."" Ford has not said those jobs will be unionized, and in any case it would be up to potential workers to vote in favor of organizing.
GM faces the same kind of pressure for the U.S. battery plants it is building with LG Energy Solution, a unit of Korea's LG Chem. 
The No. 1 U.S. automaker initially took the same stance as Ford that it was up to potential workers to decide on whether to unionize, but subsequently expressed strong support for efforts by the UAW to organize those plants without endorsing the union.
The issue is certain to be the subject of contract talks between the UAW and Detroit's Big Three automakers before the current four-year agreement expires in late 2023. 
The union's push comes as it has unsuccessfully sought to organize plants like Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s in Tennessee and other foreign auto plants.

In April, then-UAW President Rory Gamble called on GM and Ford to commit to union representation at new joint-venture EV factories.
The UAW in the past has criticized GM for announcing a $1 billion investment to build EVs in Mexico, where union rights are seen as far weaker and hourly pay is much lower, and has also criticized Ford for opting to build some EVs in Mexico rather than in Ohio.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -CNN said it is preventing Australians from accessing its  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) pages after a court ruled that publishers can be liable for defamation in public comment sections and the social media firm refused to help it disable comments in the country.
The move makes CNN, which is owned by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), the first major news organisation to pull its Facebook presence in Australia since the country's highest court ruled this month that publishers were legally responsible for comments posted below articles - even if the articles themselves were not defamatory.
The ruling has come under much fire with defamation lawyers accusing Australia of not keeping up with technological change and noting the contrast with the United States and Britain where laws largely protect publishers from any fallout from comments posted online. 
Australia is currently reviewing its defamation laws but in the meantime, other global news organisations, especially those that feel they can easily live without an Australian Facebook audience, are likely to follow CNN's lead, the lawyers said.
""This is the first domino to fall,"" said Michael Bradley, managing partner of Marque Lawyers.
For Australian media companies, the ruling also adds a layer of complication to their relationship with Facebook, just as many of them begin to benefit from a new law https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-media-defamation-idTRNIKBN2G40VZ that forces the social media company to pay for links to their content.
CNN's main Facebook page showed an error message when accessed from Australia on Wednesday. The U.S. news organisation said Facebook declined a request to help it and other publishers disable public comments in the country following the ruling https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-media-defamation-idTRNIKBN2G40VZ, which was made during an ongoing defamation lawsuit.
""We are disappointed that Facebook, once again, has failed to ensure its platform is a place for credible journalism and productive dialogue around current events among its users,"" a CNN spokeswoman said in a statement.
A Facebook spokesperson said recent court decisions had shown the need for reform in Australian defamation law and the company looked forward to ""greater clarity and certainty in this area"".
""While it's not our place to provide legal guidance to CNN, we have provided them with the latest information on tools we make available to help publishers manage comments,"" the spokesperson said. 
'OUTLIER'
As in most of the world, social media is a central channel for distributing content in Australia and about two-thirds of its population of 25 million are on Facebook. About a third of Australians said they used Facebook to source news, a University of Canberra survey taken at the start of 2021 showed.
But there has also been an explosion in defamation lawsuits, and state and federal chief lawyers are conducting a wide-ranging review into whether existing rules are appropriate for the internet age, and whether the rules fairly take into account whether or not a person has been harmed.
In a submission to that review in May, an industry group representing Facebook and other internet platforms said liability for defamation should remain with content ""originators"" since they could more easily monitor and delete offending content.
Mark Speakman, the attorney general for the state of New South Wales who is working on the review, said resolving the question of liability in online forums was a priority.
""Getting the balance right on any reform is crucial to balancing freedom of expression with the right of a person to protect their reputation,"" he said in an email.

Matt Collins, a prominent defamation lawyer, said CNN's decision showed the importance of aligning Australian law with the United States and Britain.
""Australia is among Western democracies an outlier, in relation to the circumstances in which media organisations and any user of social media can be liable for content they didn't they themselves write or approve of,"" he said.

The latest data from CFTC on asset manager positioning in U.S. equities for all contracts combined fell significantly, its second weekly drop, RBC strategists led by Lori Calvasina wrote in a note Wednesday. That follows retail investors’ sentiment taking a “sharp and sudden bearish turn” last week, they said.
“A decline in positioning in S&P 500 contracts contributed to the move, meaning investors pared back on general U.S. equity market exposure not just specific trades within it,” the strategists wrote. What’s more, “even with last week’s dip, institutional investor positioning remains quite elevated relative to history, suggesting the stock market remains vulnerable to bad news on fundamentals.”
The S&P 500 fell more than 2% on Tuesday, the most since May, amid concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling swirling along with inflation, supply-chain issues and the pace of economic growth.

SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is close to finalising the construction of a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Williamson County in the U.S. state of Texas, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Samsung (KS:005930) told Reuters that it is continuing due diligence in multiple locations, and that it has yet to make a decision.
The factory will make advanced logic semiconductor chips and is likely to create about 1,800 jobs, Samsung previously said in filings to state officials. 
One of the people said though no decision has been made, the Austin suburb of Williamson County is the frontrunner due to the subsidies on offer as well as the likelihood of stable sources of electricity and water. 
A winter storm shutdown at Samsung's existing chip plant in Austin during the first quarter caused the equivalent of 300 billion to 400 billion won ($254 million to $339 million) of damage to wafer production.
All three people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.
Samsung previously said it would start construction on the new 6-million-square-foot (557,418-sq-meter) plant in January, with production up and running by the end of 2024.
The plan comes at a time when the global auto industry faces a significant semiconductor shortage.

""Samsung wants to be on the ground in the U.S.""

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca will take full control of Caelum Biosciences in a deal worth up to $500 million, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, sharpening its focus on rare-disease drugs following its purchase of Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN).
The deal gives AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) access to another potentially lucrative rare disease drug that is undergoing late-stage trials and has a ""fast track"" status for regulatory review in the United States.
New Jersey-based Caelum will become part of AstraZeneca's Alexion division, the rare diseases specialist it bought for $39 billion earlier this year.
Alexion will pay $150 million to buy the remaining stake it does not already own in Caelum and make future payments of up to $350 million, depending on milestones achieved. Alexion took a minority stake in Caelum in 2019.
Caelum's drug candidate aims to treat AL amyloidosis, a rare, life-threatening disease that damages the heart and kidneys and affects an estimated 20,000 people across six Western countries.
The disease causes abnormal proteins called amyloids to build up in human organs and disrupt their normal function. Caelum's drug is a type of monoclonal antibody that binds to amyloid deposits to reduce or remove them and improve organ function.
""With a median survival time of less than 18 months following diagnosis, there is an urgent need for new treatments for this devastating disease,"" Alexion CEO Marc Dunoyer said in a statement.

Since buying Alexion, AstraZeneca has had mixed fortunes with rare disease drugs under development. While it reported promising results from trials of a Wilson's disease drug, it abandoned trials for an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug after it failed to show efficacy. 
Shares in AstraZeneca were up 2.2% by 0900 GMT on the London Stock Exchange, in line with the broader market.

Investing.com – Micron stock (NASDAQ:MU) fell 3% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the company’s guidance for the first quarter of the ongoing financial year came in below expectations.
The company sees its revenue in the current quarter at $7.65 billion at center of the guidance range, up 49% from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share are seen at $2 at midpoint of the range, compared to 43 cents in the first quarter of the last financial year.
The message that traders picked up from the company’s fourth-quarter commentary is that demand for chips, particularly DRAM, may have peaked or that it may be around flat. Even so, Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra called the demand outlook for 2022 strong.
Dynamic random access memory chips, which go into both personal computers and servers, accounted for 72% of the company’s FY21 revenue.
Unprecedented demand for chips in a world that had to suddenly pivot to work-from-home during the pandemic allowed companies like Micron to charge their clients higher prices. This was reflected in gross margins that expanded by 1300 basis points from a year ago to 47.9% in the fourth quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The market expectation for a better outlook was built up on assumptions that supply chains are still stretched. That elevated demand helped the company clock 37% growth in quarterly revenue to $8.27 billion. Adjusted EPS was $2.42. Both revenue and EPS beat estimates.

Etihad established a Sustainable Development Financing Framework in 2019, under which it raised 100 million euros ($117.14 million) to help fund the expansion of the ""Etihad Eco-Residence"", a sustainable apartment complex for cabin crew.
It also has a Transition Finance Framework through which it can raise cash via transition bonds, sukuk or loans, either through public transactions or private placements.
Proceeds from debt sales under that framework are eligible to finance investments in next generation aircraft to replace old fleet and for research and development into sustainable aviation fuels.

The airline has committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
Etihad last year raised $600 million via ""transition"" sukuk, or Islamic bonds - meant to help companies gradually switch to more environmentally sustainable operations.

The market regulator said Samsung had pushed up the prices of its televisions in the Netherlands for years, by constantly urging retailers to raise their prices if they were selling them below Samsung's preferred market rate.
This practice undermined competition between seven of the largest online electronics stores in the Netherlands, the ACM said, as Samsung made it clear to all retailers involved that their competitors would also follow its pricing policy.
Samsung also reached out to retailers if their competitors complained about TVs being sold too cheap, documents obtained by the regulator showed.
""Samsung's advice was not individual and not without consequences,"" the watchdog said. ""Its behaviour distorted competition and raised prices for consumers.""
Samsung said it would appeal the fine, as it maintained it had never forced retailers to use its price advice and that stores had always been free to determine their own strategy.

But the regulator said that Samsung should have known that its efforts to influence prices went far beyond normal guidance and was in fact a way to structurally determine the market prices of its televisions.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese prosecutors asked a Tokyo court on Wednesday to send former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor executive Greg Kelly to prison for two years for his alleged part in helping Carlos Ghosn, the carmaker's ousted CEO, hide earnings.
Prosecutors, who are also seeking a 200 million yen ($1.8 million) fine for the Japanese carmaker, called for the jail sentence for Kelly during their closing arguments in a trial that began a year ago.
A ruling in the case is expected next year, and if found guilty Kelly could join two other Americans who are serving time in Japan after a court sentenced them in July for helping smuggle Ghosn out of Japan on a private jet hidden in luggage to Lebanon at the end of 2019, where he remains as a fugitive.
Japan's conviction rate is about 99%
Kelly has denied charges he helped Ghosn hide 9.3 billion yen of Ghosn's earnings over eight years through deferred payments, saying in his only goal had been to retain a chief executive who could have been lured away by a rival automaker.
In 2010, Japan introduced new financial regulations forcing company executives earning more than 1 billion yen a year to disclose their compensation. 
Ghosn, who also denies any wrongdoing, faces separate breach of trust charges that allege he enriched himself at Nissan's expense through $5 million in payments to a Middle East car dealership, and by temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer’s books. 
Both former Nissan executives allege they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried that Ghosn would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), its largest shareholder.

Kelly has sat in suit and tie through months of testimony from witnesses, including former colleagues such as former vice president in charge of legal affairs Hari Nada and the official responsible for details of Ghosn's compensation Toshiaki Ohnuma. They cooperated with prosecutors and were not charged.

Britain is already facing disruption caused by worker shortages. A dearth of truck drivers in the world's fifth-largest economy is already threatening fuel supplies and has led to some gaps on supermarket shelves, with many blaming Brexit. 
Next, led by the Brexit-backing Simon Wolfson who has previously warned against cutting immigration, said on Wednesday that its clothing and homeware stores and online shop could be affected in the run-up to Christmas, Britain's peak buying season. 
""We anticipate that, without some relaxation of immigration rules, we are likely to experience some degradation in our service in the run up to Christmas,"" the retailer said in its half-year results statement. 
Finding staff for warehousing and logistics jobs for the peak season was beginning to come under pressure, it said. 
Next hopes that Britain will temporarily allow foreign workers to come to the UK, reversing post-Brexit labour rules. To tackle the shortage of drivers, the government last week said it would issue temporary visas to 5,000 foreign drivers.

Reuters reported on Monday that warehouses in Britain are having to pay up to 30% more to recruit staff after worker shortages exacerbated pressure on already buckling supply chains and threatened to derail the seasonal buying spree.
Next said its stock levels were currently down 12% compared with the period before the pandemic but it said it had got better at operating with less stock.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp losses, but concerns remain over slowing growth and high inflation levels.
At 4 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.9%.
European stocks steadied on Wednesday after one of the worst market routs this year, prompted by losses on Wall Street after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation could stay ""elevated"" longer than the central bank had previously predicted.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to a high of 1.57% on Tuesday, but has since retreated to 1.53%.
Fears that elevated inflationary levels will prompt central banks to rein in their stimulus measures just as global growth starts to stagnate have hurt stock markets of late.
Spanish consumer prices rose 4% in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in 13 years, according to data released earlier Wednesday. German import prices, typically a reliable advance indicator of inflation, rose another 1.4% in August, taking their year-on-year rise to over 16%, while Italian producer price inflation accelerated to 11.6%, the fastest in more than 25 years.
This puts the spotlight on Eurozone inflation data due to be released on Friday and forecast to hit 3.3%. 
In corporate news, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock gained 2.7% after the drugmaker said its newly acquired Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN) division will purchase the remaining equity in drugmaker Caelum Biosciences in a deal that could be worth up to $500 million.
 Next  (LON:NXT) stock rose 3% after the U.K. retailer published stronger than expected half-year results, but warned that areas of its business were ""beginning to come under pressure"", including warehouse and logistics staffing. 
On the flip side, Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock fell 2.7% following comments from Anne Rigail,CEO of the French flag carrier, that it was only seeing a small recovery in business travel on domestic routes and adding that premium travel remained far below pre-crisis levels.
Crude prices weakened Wednesday following a surprise increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude inventories grew by just over 4 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute. That would be the first increase in the country’s stocks in eight weeks if confirmed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration later on Wednesday.
By 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% lower at $74.56 a barrel, slipping from its highest level since July, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $77.61, after previously reaching its highest since October 2018.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,739.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1656.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 MAX test flight for China's aviation regulator last month was successful and the planemaker hopes a two-year grounding will be lifted this year, the head of Boeing's China business said on Wednesday.
""It went off without a hitch,"" Boeing China President Sherry Carbary said of the test flight, speaking on the sidelines of Airshow China, the country's biggest air show.
Boeing working with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) as it sifts through data and finalises reports before deciding whether the plane can be returned to service, Carbary said.
The ban, which has been lifted in the West and several Asian countries, could be eased in China around November, people close to the matter have told Reuters.
""We are hopeful it will happen by the end of the year,"" Carbary said, declining to be more specific. ""It is up to CAAC. But I can tell you we are doing all we can to support them and we're encouraged about how closely they are working with us."" 
Before the 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, Boeing was selling one quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers. 
The company's China sales have also been hobbled by U.S.-China trade tensions.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Tuesday the Chinese government was preventing its domestic airlines from buying ""tens of billions of dollars"" of Boeing planes.

Carbary declined to comment directly on the remarks but she said free and fair trade was important to enable Boeing to deliver its planes around the world.
""I think right now our two governments are having some competitive issues on some sensitive issues that are legitimate and the two countries need to work through those,"" she said.

The selloff pushed the DAX and the CAC 40 down by over 2%. 
The 10-year Treasury yield dropped back to 1.53% later Wednesday, helping sentiment in Europe.
Also helping the tone Wednesday was the news that China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) had agreed to sell its stake in Shengjing Bank for $1.5 billion, raising hopes the property giant will be able to make Wednesday’s $47.5 million bond interest payment deadline.
The highly-indebted property developer has been struggling to finance its debt of more than $300 billion, raising fears of a default which could have widespread repercussions. 
Back in Europe, a number of the world’s central bankers, including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and the Bank of England’s Governor Andrew Bailey, are all scheduled to speak at the ECB Forum on Central Banking on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans for a second day in a row blocked a bid by President Joe Biden's Democrats to head off a potentially crippling U.S. credit default, as partisan tensions rattled an economy recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
With federal government funding due to expire on Thursday and borrowing authority set to run out around Oct. 18, Democrats who narrowly control the Senate and House of Representatives are working to head off twin fiscal disasters while also trying to advance Biden's ambitious legislative agenda.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has insisted that Democrats use a parliamentary maneuver to temporarily lift the government's $28.4 trillion debt limit without Republican votes, although Democrats note that about $5 trillion of the nation's debt is the result of tax cuts and spending passed during Republican Donald Trump's presidency.
The two critical deadlines have added disarray to a complicated autumn for Democrats, who are deeply divided over a pair of bills worth some $4.5 trillion that form the core of Biden's agenda.
Biden canceled a planned Wednesday trip to Chicago to promote the COVID-19 vaccine so he can continue negotiations with the Democrats' moderate and progressive wings, which need to act in unison to pass anything due to their razor-thin majorities.
""There is a strong sense that progress is being made, and the president is staying to continue his engagement,"" said an administration source familiar with the talks.
Lawmakers now have just three days to avert a possible government shutdown by midnight Thursday, the end of the current fiscal year. Failure to do so https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-happens-when-us-federal-government-shuts-down-2021-09-27 could results in furloughs for hundreds of thousands of federal workers in the middle of a public health crisis. 
Fiscal brinkmanship has become a regular feature of U.S. politics thanks to partisan polarization. 
The most recent government shutdown, which occurred during Trump's presidency, lasted 35 days before ending in January 2019. 
A measure passed by the House last week would fund the government through Dec. 3. If Congress were to pass a measure on Wednesday with a similar timeline, it still would have to deal with providing the Treasury Department with additional borrowing authority.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told lawmakers the government would run out of options to service the debt by Oct. 18. 
Coming ahead of next year's congressional elections, a government shutdown or default would be a blow for Democrats, who have portrayed themselves as the party of responsible government after Trump's chaotic presidency.
No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer said the chamber may vote on Wednesday on a resolution to continue funding the government.
""We’ll see what the Senate sends us. ... They're trying to send us something,"" he told reporters.
'POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC'
The nation's largest lender, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), has begun scenario planning for how a potential U.S. credit default would affect its operations, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday.
""This is like the third time we've had to do this. It is a potentially catastrophic event,"" Dimon said. ""We should never even get this close.""
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed holding a vote to raise the debt limit that could pass with just the support of the chamber's 48 Democrats and the two independents allied with them as long as Republicans agreed to allow the vote to occur.
""If Republicans really want to see the debt limit raised without providing a single vote, I'm prepared to hold that vote,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor.
But McConnell insisted the responsibility for the debt ceiling was Schumer's and not his own. ""His responsibility is to raise the debt ceiling,"" McConnell said. ""He has the responsibility. And trust me, he will do it.""
BIDEN'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA
Democrats are also struggling to unite behind two pillars of Biden's domestic policy agenda: a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a social spending package pitched at $3.5 trillion that leaders have said will likely need to be trimmed. 
The larger measure could take several weeks to pass Congress and reach Biden's desk, dangerously close to the debt-limit deadline.
The Democrats originally planned to handle the social spending bill, championed by the party's left wing, in tandem with the infrastructure package, which has drawn bipartisan support. But they have scheduled a House vote on the infrastructure bill on Thursday even though the spending package is still being negotiated.
Lawmakers on the party's left insisted that Congress must first pass the social spending bill. 
""We articulated this position more than three months ago, and today it is still unchanged,"" Representative Pramila Jayapal, leader of the Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus, said in a statement.

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a powerful voice among left-leaning lawmakers, urged his House allies to oppose the infrastructure bill on Thursday, writing on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that its passage would end their leverage to move forward on the larger reconciliation package.
Democratic Representative Jim McGovern acknowledged that the stakes of the negotiations were high, saying: ""Failure on both these bills is not an option.""

Crypto assets are based on the blockchain or distributed ledger technology.
""In order to facilitate serious innovation, FINMA applies the existing provisions of financial market laws in a consistently technology-neutral way,"" it added, thus ensuring that new technologies are not used to circumvent existing rules.

Since crypto assets involve particular risks, FINMA said it had tied the approval to specific requirements, including that the fund may invest only in established assets with a sufficiently large trading volume.

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) has agreed to sell a 20% stake in  Shengjing Bank Co Ltd  (HK:2066) to the local Shenyang government for CNY10 billion ($1.54 billion).
The developer’s Hong Kong shares jumped 9.36% to HK$2.92 ($0.38) by 1:24 AM ET (5:24 AM GMT), after soaring over 10% earlier in the session. It will sell around 1.75 billion non-publicly traded domestic shares in Shengjing Bank to Shenyang Shengjing Finance Investment Group Co. at CNY5.7 yuan apiece, according to a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
Shengjing Bank was untraded after closing at HK$7 on Tuesday.
China Evergrande’s dollar bond due 2022 was indicated down a touch at 25.3 cents on the dollar while its 2025 note is unchanged at 23.5 cents, according to Bloomberg.
The company's share in Shengjing will drop to 14.57% once the transaction completes. It had previously sold a stake in the lender that netted it around CNY1 billion in August 2021.
China Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan has been under increasing pressure to spin off and sell assets to pay down the company’s massive debt. Its original 36% stake in Shengjing Bank was one of its most valuable financial assets, worth around $2.8 billion.
However, the asset’s value has diminished recently as regulatory oversight on dealings such as preferential lending and bond purchases between banks and their largest shareholders were tightened. The sale is also likely to be of little help in lifting China Evergrande out of its debt woes. The company has a coupon payment of $47.5 million due on Wednesday, after missing a bond interest payment due the previous week."
1648,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>",China Seeks to Curb Evergrande Risk With $1.55 Billion Bank Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- China stepped in to buy a stake in a struggling regional bank from China Evergrande Group as it seeks to limit contagion in the financial sector from the embattled property developer.
Evergrande agreed to sell a 20% stake in Shengjing Bank Co. to the local Shenyang government for 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion), with the bank demanding that all proceeds go to settle debts with the lender, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. In that case, the sale would do little to help Evergrande pay its massive debts to bond holders and homebuyers.
The sale illustrates how authorities are taking steps to minimize fallout to the banking system from the worsening liquidity crisis at Evergrande as they try to avoid a bailout. At least 10 lenders told investors earlier this month that they have sufficient collateral for loans to the developer and that risks are under control. Hong Kong’s central bank asked lenders to report their exposure to Evergrande Group, according to people familiar with the matter.
“Maintaining social and financial sector stability is still the overarching policy objective of the Chinese government,” said Nicholas Zhu, a senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service. “Authorities, including local governments, will take policy measures and assume coordination roles to ensure that the resolution of Evergrande does not cause social or financial instability.”
The real estate conglomerate will sell about 1.75 billion non-publicly traded domestic shares in Shengjing Bank to Shenyang Shengjing Finance Investment Group Co. at 5.7 yuan apiece, according to the statement. Evergrande’s stake in the lender will drop to 14.57% after the latest transaction, which requires relevant approvals. Evergrande raised about 1 billion yuan from a previous stake sale of Shengjing Bank in August. 
The transaction also underscores the mounting pressure on billionaire Hui Ka Yan to spin off and sell assets to pay down a mountain of debt. Evergrande’s original 36% stake in Shengjing Bank was among its most valuable financial assets, worth about $2.8 billion. That holding has become less appealing as regulators toughen oversight on dealings such as preferential lending and bond purchases between banks and their largest shareholders.
Evergrande shares climbed 10% in Hong Kong on Wednesday morning. Its dollar bond due 2022 was indicated down a touch at 25.3 cents on the dollar while its 2025 note is unchanged at 23.5 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Shengjing Bank was untraded after closing at HK$7 on Tuesday. 
Shengjing Bank would need a state bailout if Evegrande defaulted, according to a UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) report in July. By UBS’s estimate, as much as 139 billion yuan of funding to Evergrande could lie in Shengjing Bank’s 165 billion yuan of financial investments at the end of 2020, according to the note.
“The company’s liquidity issue has adversely affected Shengjing Bank in a material way,” Evergrande said in the statement, adding that the introduction of the purchaser will help to stabilize the bank’s operations. 
A report in May from Caixin Media’s WeNews said the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was examining more than 100 billion yuan of transactions between the two. Evergrande boosted its stake in Shengjing Bank in 2019, following a request from authorities who wanted to recapitalize the lender, Bloomberg reported last year.

The developments in Washington come as energy costs are soaring due to a power crunch in China and the Fed is likely to begin asset tapering soon.

By Krystal Hu and Echo Wang
(Reuters) -Shares of Amplitude Inc opened nearly 43% above their reference price in their Nasdaq debut on Tuesday, notching up a valuation of about $5 billion for the Benchmark-backed analytics company. 
San Francisco-based Amplitude, which confidentially filed for a direct listing in July, was valued at $4 billion after raising $150 million from Sequoia Capital and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC in June. 
Stock of the company opened at $50 per share, up from the reference price of $35 per share. 
Amplitude provides data analytics tools that enable companies to optimize their products. Its customers include NBCUniversal, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Holdings Ltd, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc and Instacart.
It has benefited from the accelerated digital transformation during the pandemic, as companies seek to optimize customer experience online by using analytical tools.
It reported $72 million in revenue for the first half of the year, a 56% jump year over year, compared with a loss of $16.5 million. 
The seven-year-old company chose to go public through a direct listing, an alternative to an initial public offering that has gain traction among companies after  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) pioneered it in 2018. 
In a direct listing, companies are allowed to list on the stock market without selling shares. They set a reference price but no shares are sold in advance at that price, unlike in an IPO where shares are sold to institutional investors at a set price.
""Traditional IPOs severely under-price companies,"" said Spenser Skates, Amplitude Co-founder and CEO, who has been a proponent of direct listing. ""There's a great window for companies to go out this year. This is about as fast as we could do it."" 
Investors see Amplitude's strong debut as a catalyst for other tech companies who are exploring ways to go public. 

""This is a watershed moment for direct listings. I think the entire market is looking at Amplitude to see how it does, because it looks like many of the software companies that will go public in the next 12 to 18 months in terms of size, growth and not being well-known household names,"" said Neeraj Agrawal, partner at Battery Ventures, an early investor in Amplitude.

1652,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",The Winners and Losers in Asian Markets From Energy Crunch,"(Bloomberg) -- The global spike in energy prices and China’s crackdown on power consumption look set to create more losers than winners in Asian equities as production costs surge and output takes a hit.
Chinese stocks dominate the watch lists of traders, given that the country is the world’s biggest consumer of electricity and largest exporter of goods. Factories churning out everything from toys to vital components for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. have been caught in the fallout.   
The region’s coal and natural gas producers will benefit in the short term from higher prices while their green-energy rivals should gain in the longer run. Energy-intensive sectors that make metals and chemicals may have the most to lose. 
Rising demand for hydrocarbon as economies recover from the pandemic coupled with lower supplies globally created the shortage. China’s increasingly aggressive push to curb emissions along is amplifying the immediate impact on businesses.
More than half of China’s mainland provinces are limiting electricity use, forcing factory shutdowns that are reverberating through global supply chains. 
Here are some of the stocks and sectors to watch:
Gas Plays
Companies that produce and export gas for the region will be clear beneficiaries of surging prices, while those importing, consuming and distributing stand to lose.
Likely winners include Australia’s Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum, Malaysia’s Petronas Gas Bhd., Japan’s Inpex Corp., India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. On the other hand, gas distributors such as China Gas Holdings (OTC:CGHLY) Ltd., Hong Kong and China Gas Co. and Kunlun Energy Co may face pressure. 
Costs are poised to climb for Indian gas importers like Petronet LNG Ltd. and city gas distributors, which use natural gas as feedstock, such as Indraprastha Gas Ltd.
“The risk is that we are going to see a margin squeeze as we come into the winter” for gas distributors, Neil Beveridge, senior energy analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Gas distributors may not be able to pass through the rising prices as they are regulated by China, he added.
Coal and Power 
Coal miners may mint more amid high prices for their commodity. Stocks to watch include Indonesia’s Adaro Energy Tbk, Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd. and Coal India Ltd. Chinese names include China Shenhua Energy Co., China Coal Energy Co. and Shanxi Coking Coal Energy Group Co.
Stocks of coal-based power generators such as China’s Huadian Power International Corp., Huaneng Power International (NYSE:HNP) Inc. and Datang International Power Generation Co. suffered steep losses Monday that were only partially recovered Tuesday.
Independent coal-fired power producers in China are likely to report net losses in the third quarter on higher costs,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts Pierre Lau and Lesley Li wrote in a Sept. 26 note. They add that companies will be unable to pass on the complete impact of surging coal prices to consumers. 
Electricity Users
Surging electricity prices threaten to hurt shares of intensive power users, with stocks to watch including Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd., Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Angang Steel Co., China National Chemical Engineering Co. and Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co. 
As power cuts in China curb industrial output, this flows on into lower shipping demand, affecting stocks like Cosco Shipping Holdings Co., according to analysts. 
“The shock is also a wake up call to some long on cyclicals like metals and coal that the best leg of gains are over,” said Shi Junbo, fund manager at Hangzhou Xiyan Asset Management Co.
Global Supply Chain
Some suppliers for iPhones and carmakers have halted production at certain facilities in China to meet Beijing’s tighter energy-consumption policy.
Apple supplier ASE Technology Holding Co (NYSE:ASX). said a plant in Kunshan City will see no production from Sept. 27 to Sept. 30 due to power restrictions. Other stocks to watch for similar risks include Tesla suppliers like Eve Energy Co. and Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp. Among Chinese carmakers, traders are watching BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF)., Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF) Ltd., Li Auto Inc., SAIC Motor Corp. and XPeng Inc.
“If power rationing lasts longer, upstream material price will likely increase, bringing cost pressure to part makers,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). analysts including Ming Hsun Lee wrote in a Sept. 27 note.
Green Energy Stocks
Companies generating power via renewable sources such as wind and water have bucked the weakness seen by their coal-fueled peers. China Longyuan Power Group Corp. shares reached a record on Tuesday after jumping 21% in five sessions. Other stocks in focus include Huaneng Lancang River Hydropower Inc., Fujian Mindong Electric Power Ltd. and Cecep Wind-Power Corp. 
The government-backed Economic Daily said in a front page commentary on Tuesday that the ultimate way to solve tightness in power supply is through transitioning to lower energy consumption. 
“In the long term, the events will provide greater support for wind and solar, and omissions targets will expedite clean energy to join the grid,” Hangzhou Xiyan Asset’s Shi said.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 09:51PM ET</span>",Investors with $4 trln assets aim to tackle Asian firms on climate change goals,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A group of six investors with a combined $4 trillion of assets under management, including Fidelity International, said on Wednesday it aims to step up engagement with big Asian companies like banks and energy producers to ensure they have a road map to meet climate change targets.
Initial engagement will focus on carbon risk and coal at banks and coal-exposed power companies, the group of investors, facilitated by Singapore-based advisor Asia Research & Engagement (ARE), said in a statement. 
The move comes as investors become more active in the field of environmental, social and corporate (ESG) governance, helping to shape firms' climate commitments to better manage that risk for their clients. ESG-related steps they have taken include backing activist shareholder resolutions and voting on board members and remuneration. 
At Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa (NYSE:RDSa).L)'s annual shareholder meeting in May, nearly a third of shareholders backed a resolution filed by an activist group, but rejected by the board, that wants the company to set short- and medium-term targets to cut absolute emissions. 
The six investors include BMO Global Asset Management EMEA, Fidelity International, Dutch pension fund PGGM, Britain-based Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF),  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors and Legal & General Investment Management. 
""Over the past year we have seen encouraging developments in sustainability-related business practices and policies, such as a raft of net zero announcements,"" Mirza Baig, global head of ESG investments at Aviva Investors, said in the statement. 
""In reality, there is still a stark mismatch between where we are today and what is required to ensure that the objectives of the Paris Agreement (on climate change goals) are met,"" he said. ""There is a huge opportunity for Asian companies to take the lead in tackling the climate emergency."" 
The group has already begun engagement with companies including China power firms Huaneng and Huadian. Huaneng and Huadian did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The investor group will encourage companies such as banks to commit to concrete actions like exiting from financing the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and stopping financing fossil-fuel expansion and related infrastructure.
Measures would also include encouraging Asian power utilities to set out plans to bring their businesses in line with Paris Agreement targets.

LONDON (Reuters) - INEOS Automotive, a unit of chemicals and energy giant INEOS, will launch a rugged off-road vehicle in Europe in 2022 and North America in 2023 for farmers and other primarily rural uses, it said on Wednesday,
The company plans initially to launch with a utilitarian version of the Grenadier for business customers - which should make up the majority of sales of the four-wheel drive vehicle - and a more comfortable passenger version. 
The vehicle will also launch in parts of Africa and the Middle East in 2022. 
INEOS Automotive is also working on a pickup truck version of the Grenadier, which will be crucial for the North American market. In the U.S. market, pickup trucks make up a sizeable and a highly-profitable portion of total auto industry sales.
The boxy Grenadier will have petrol and diesel engines and drive trains built by BMW. Production of the vehicle will launch in late 2021 at a former  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) passenger car plant in Hambach, in northeastern France, that INEOS Automotive acquired from the German carmaker last year.
Gary Pearson, who heads up INEOS Automotive's markets in the UK, Middle East and North Africa, said the combustion engine technology the company is using is right for today's market. 
But with bans on fossil-fuel vehicles looming in Europe, the company is looking at hydrogen fuel-cell technology for future zero-emission versions of the Grenadier rather than going electric.

""As electric technology moves on, it may well become right for us,"" Pearson said. ""But today in terms of range, the weight of batteries... in a vehicle that needs to pull things, lift things, carry things, that's not necessarily right for us at the moment.""
An agreement between parent company INEOS and Hyundai to explore opportunities for hydrogen production and supply includes evaluating using the South Korean carmaker's fuel-cell system in the Grenadier.

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) -Guo Hui, whose cleaning business is owed 20 million yuan ($3.1 million) by embattled real estate giant China Evergrande, is counting on the government to fix a crisis that has left his own company on the brink of bankruptcy.
In the meantime, the 50-year-old known by friends and colleagues as ""Brother Hui"", has sold his Porsche Cayenne and put his apartment on the market in a scramble to raise cash to pay debts and wages.
""We've reached out to those in charge but they either say they have no money or don't know when they can settle the payments,"" Guo said from his office at the back of a building in a street in Guangzhou's Tianhe district that is lively with small restaurants and stalls.
His case is typical of countless suppliers left on the hook by China Evergrande, based in nearby Shenzhen, which was the country's top-selling property developer before running short of cash this summer under the weight of $305 billion in debt.
Originally from Sichuan province, Guo founded his cleaning business, called Feiyun, more than two decades ago. 
Like many self-made entrepreneurs of his generation, Guo sees his as a rags-to-riches story that went hand in hand with the economic rise of China.
He said he has been working since 2017 with Evergrande, which accounted for 90% of his business when he started to face problems in June, when payments on commercial paper issued by the company stopped.
China Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guo's assertions.
""We're left in a very passive situation,"" he said.
Feiyun provides cleaning and repair services for Evergrande apartments in Guangdong province, ensuring that new builds are clean before being shown to prospective buyers. 
It has about 100 permanent staff and uses 700 to 800 contractors, depending on demand, most of them migrants from less-wealthy inland provinces, Guo said.
""Frankly, Evergrande really owes the money to ordinary migrants who worked hard for it,"" he said.
A few months ago, Guo had a team of 300 cleaning thousands of apartments at the high-end Zhanjiang Evergrande Waitan Gardens development in the southwest tip of the province on two contracts totalling about 1.5 million yuan. 
""They worked day and night for us. I'm doing my best to pay them from loans I've taken out, but I can only manage a third or fourth of it. We still owe them about 2 million yuan,"" said Hui, referring to staff arrears on three different projects.
Maotai bottles lined the shelves behind Guo, the single photo on his desk showed him skiing in northern China in 2017, ""before things got hard"". 
An outdoors enthusiast, Guo had been planning eventually to hand his business over to his son Guo Jing, who stood listening nearby, so that he and his wife could travel abroad - plans thwarted first by the COVID-19 pandemic and then Evergrande's crisis.
Beijing has been largely quiet on the Evergrande situation, which has rattled global markets and left investors as well as hundreds of thousands buyers of unfinished apartments facing uncertainty, triggering protests at Evergrande offices this month.
""We can only wait for Evergrande to sort itself out or for the government to help,"" Guo said. ""No matter what, I still believe in the government. This must have a conclusion.""
The next day, Guo drove to a Porsche dealership to sell back what he sees as a symbol of his hard work. He asked to sit in it one more time after the papers were signed.
""This is what the Evergrande situation has come to,"" he said at the dealership, adding that he could now only wait for the government and courts to act.
Having come from poverty once, Guo is confident his fortunes will turn.

""I'll definitely buy my car back, when I make some money. I'm sure I'll be able to get it back.""

1658,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 07:51PM ET</span>",China asking state-backed firms to pick up Evergrande assets - sources,"By Clare Jim and Jing Xu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Beijing is prodding government-owned firms and state-backed property developers such as China Vanke Co Ltd to purchase some of embattled China Evergrande Group's assets, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Evergrande, saddled with $305 billion in liabilities, is teetering on the brink of collapse. But the central government is unlikely to intervene directly to resolve Evergrande's crisis in the form of a bailout, according to six people, including four in government and regulatory bodies.
Authorities are hoping, however, that asset purchases will ward off or at least mitigate any social unrest that could occur if Evergrande were to suffer a messy collapse, they said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
A handful of government-owned enterprises have already done due diligence on assets in the southern Chinese city Guangzhou, said one person.
In one emblematic example, Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group is close to acquiring Evergrande's Guangzhou FC Soccer stadium and surrounding residential projects, according to the person, who has direct knowledge of the matter.
Set to cost around 12 billion yuan ($1.9 billion), the stadium https://www.reuters.com/business/china-evergrandes-construction-guangzhou-soccer-stadium-proceeding-planned-2021-09-27 has been designed to seat more than 100,000, making it the world's largest venue built for soccer by capacity.
Potential buyers of Evergrande's core assets in Guangzhou have been ""arranged"" with ""both political and commercial considerations"" in mind, the person said, adding that authorities don't want to see just a few companies bidding for the same assets.
Evergrande and Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The state assets regulator, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Vanke and China Jinmao Holdings are among government-backed property developers that have been asked to purchase assets from Evergrande, sources said. China Resources Land has also been asked, one source said. 
Property developers and government-owned firms have been sounded out either directly or indirectly about asset purchases, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately ascertain the current status of most of those discussions.
Vanke, which is one-third owned by Shenzhen's state-owned subway operator, said in August it has talked with Evergrande about cooperating on various projects. It did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment on the status of those discussions. Jinmao and China Resources Land also did not respond to requests for comment.
Evergrande missed paying $83.5 million in interest to offshore bondholders last week and has a $47.5 million coupon payment due on Wednesday. 
While expectations are high that it will undergo one of the largest-ever restructurings in China, government bodies have been largely silent on the potential for a bailout or how they might deal with a collapse.
Beijing has, however, worked to curb any ricochet effect on the financial system from Evergrande’s troubles, with the central bank pledging on Monday to protect consumers exposed to the housing market and injecting more cash into the banking system.
One of the first signs of an official inquiry into the real estate giant came this week when the Shenzhen government's financial regulator said an investigation had been opened https://www.reuters.com/world/china/exclusive-china-evergrandes-wealth-management-arm-faces-local-government-inquiry-2021-09-27 into an Evergrande wealth management unit. 
One person with direct knowledge of local government involvement said local governments have been asked to mediate with government-backed groups and companies so they can participate in Evergrande's reorganisation and asset sales.
Any action taken by local governments will depend on the extent of Evergrande's presence in those areas and the local finances of that particular province or city, the sources also said.

They added that regulators will first assess the funding situation of all Evergrande's businesses before taking any action on its liquidity situation.
""What kind of committee should be set up is a second story; it depends on the debt situation,"" said one regulatory source.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was not the friendliest and its electric vehicle policy appeared to be controlled by labor unions.
Speaking at a tech conference in California, Musk was critical of a White House summit on electric vehicles in August to which automakers other than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were invited.
""(They) didn't mention Tesla once and praised GM and Ford for leading the EV revolution. Does that sound maybe a little biased?,"" Musk said during a panel discussion at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills.
""Not the friendliest administration, seems to be controlled by unions,"" he added.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Biden in August signed an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric, and was joined by executives of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis.
The so-called Big Three U.S. automakers are the largest employers of the United Auto Workers (UAW) labor union, accounting for about 150,000 members.
Asked in August whether the White House did not invite Musk because workers at Tesla are not unionized, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: ""I'll let you draw your own conclusion.""
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have also proposed to give union-made, U.S.-built electric vehicles an additional $4,500 tax incentive, setting up a clash between Tesla and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp on one side and the UAW-affiliated automakers in Detroit on the other.

The proposal would boost the maximum tax credit for these electric vehicles to $12,500 from the current $7,500.
Responding to Musk's comments, UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada tweeted https://twitter.com/CindyEstrada174/status/1442989024067657730?s=20 that he should stop whining: ""Good leaders aren't afraid of smart workers but embrace them!""

The home robot is designed to take up tasks such as home monitoring, setting up routines and reminders, and can play music and TV shows while rolling around the house.
The device, which has digital eyes on a rotating screen mounted on wheels, is available at an introductory invite-only price of $999.99 and regular price of $1,449.99.
Among other launches in its latest lineup were a smart thermostat, smart display Echo Show 15 and a new health-tracking band called Halo View.
The Echo Show 15 can be mounted on a wall and is powered with AZ2 Neural Edge, a processor that helps users personalize the screen.
In its push to appeal to the next generation of customers - kids - the company introduced Amazon Glow, a gadget for playing games, reading or drawing while on a video call.
In its partnership with Disney, it will launch an Alexa-powered voice assistant at Disney's theme park hotels, along with a paid feature that lets customers interact with Disney characters at home.
The feature is expected to launch next year and will let users interact with Disney characters with the 'Hey, Disney!' voice command.

Amazon has launched a number of new gadgets every year, including sunglasses with voice control and an in-home drone, that have not become massive sellers.
Devices make up for a fraction of Amazon's overall sales.

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) -China touted its expanding military air power and hopes of capturing a growing share of its civil aviation market for domestic producers at a national air show inaugurated amid regional tensions over Taiwan and disruption from the pandemic.
Typically held every other year in the southern resort of Zhuhai, Airshow China opened on Tuesday after a year of delays caused by COVID-19, with a scaled-back foreign presence and a sharp focus on China's domestic and regional priorities.
Flying demonstrations on a hot and hazy day that had crowds scrambling for shade included a smoke-trailing display by J-10 fighters from the Bayi aerobatic team.
China's newer J-20 stealth fighter, which made its debut at Zhuhai in 2016, roared above dignitaries with domestic rather than Russian-made engines for the first time, state media said.
On the ground, China showcased a prototype of the CH-6 long-endurance drone, capable of reconnaissance and strike operations, and the WZ-7 high-altitude surveillance drone.
Also capturing attention for the first time was the J-16D, an electronic attack version of China's J-16 fighter.
""The scope and scale of high-end warfighting capability on display is definitely a step-up from previous shows,"" said Kelvin Wong, a Singapore-based defence editor at Janes.
""The J-16D is a very important new addition to (China's) air force order of battle. It provides critical new electronic warfare elements designed to degrade an adversary's ability to attack and engage other People's Liberation Army air assets.""
Analysts said its show debut appeared to signal a push to counter Western and Taiwanese defences.
""The J-16D is a special threat to Taiwan since it can attack anti-aircraft defences that Taiwan must rely on heavily in any Chinese attempt to forcibly take control of the island,"" said Bradley Perrett, a specialist on Asian aerospace and defence.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has stepped up military and political pressure to try and force the democratically ruled island to accept Chinese sovereignty.
Speaking at an opening ceremony in Zhuhai, Chang Dingqiu, commander of China's air force, said its officers would ""resolutely defend the reunification of the motherland"".
Taiwan this month proposed extra defence spending of almost $9 billion over the next five years, including on new missiles, in the face of what it called a ""severe threat"".
CERTIFICATION WAIT
Commercial planemakers, meanwhile, see strong post-pandemic prospects for the Chinese aviation market, with an increasing share of the spoils expected to go to domestic manufacturers.
China is a key hunting ground for foreign aviation firms, thanks to the quick recovery in domestic travel, but the outlook is complicated by Beijing's desire to grow its own champions.
The country's aviation regulator may be a stumbling block for foreign planemakers looking to boost sales in the world's biggest market for new planes.
As Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) ramps up production of the 90-seat ARJ21 regional jet, the regulator has not certified slightly larger offerings from Airbus and Brazil's Embraer.
Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR is also waiting for Chinese certification of its 42-600 model, it said last week.
Airbus China CEO George Xu said it was in talks with China about certification, a crucial step to winning new orders.
Outside China, the Airbus A220 entered service in 2016 and the Embraer E-Jet E2 family in 2018.
China, however, has policies that favour its homegrown planes, such as offering them favourable airport slots, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said last year. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is meanwhile waiting for approval of its 737 MAX after an almost two-year safety grounding. The ban, which has already been lifted in the West, could be eased around November after a successful test flight, people close to the matter said.
COMAC on Tuesday forecast 20-year Chinese demand for 953 regional jets with 90 seats. Deputy marketing manager Yang Yang said there was enough room in the market for all players.

""The aviation market is as vast as the Pacific Ocean, where we have our own competitive territories,"" he told reporters. 
COMAC expects local certification this year of its larger 160-seat C919, a rival to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 families, though it will take time to ramp up production.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",Surging Treasury yields batter ARK fund amid broad tech selloff,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A broad selloff in technology and growth names battered the flagship fund of star stock picker Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, as investors shifted away from tech shares amid a sharp rise in Treasury yields. 
The ARK Innovation ETF, which had $21.4 billion in assets as of last week, according to Refinitiv, fell 4.2% on Tuesday. That drop outpaced a 2% swoon for the benchmark S&P 500, its biggest one-day percentage decline since May, and a 2.8% fall for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, its biggest one-day decline since March.
Losses for the ARK fund have accelerated in recent days, fueled by a rise in Treasury yields that has hit the broader universe of technology and growth stocks in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting last week. The central bank took a hawkish tilt at that meeting, which some interpreted as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy.
“Anytime we see the 10-year UST yield move such a dramatic amount in a short period of time ... it generally coincides with a market sell-off of some magnitude,” said Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, in a note. “It is not surprising to see value and cyclical stocks hold up better than their growth counterparts given the increase in yields.”
While rising bond yields tend to reduce the relative attractiveness of many stocks, they can particularly weigh on tech and other growth names whose valuations rely more on future cash flows, which are discounted more severely as bond yields rise.
Since Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has climbed 24 basis points to 1.54%, while the ARK ETF has fallen 5% and the Nasdaq is down 2.4%.
Though stock indexes remain near record highs, many individual names have struggled in recent weeks. Half of S&P 500 stocks were down 10% or more from their 52-week highs as of Tuesday afternoon. That included over 60 stocks that had fallen 20% or more.
Wood’s fund, which was the best-performing U.S. equity fund in 2020, is down about 10% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained nearly 16%. The ARK Innovation ETF ranks in the lowest percentile year-to-date among 601 mid-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.
The high-growth names that helped Wood reap outsized gains during last year’s coronavirus lockdowns have hurt the fund’s performance in 2021, with so-called stay-at-home stocks such as Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health and  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) losing their luster as investors have turned to financials, energy companies and other economic reopening plays at various times over the last few months. 
“What worked for the fund in 2020 has not persisted even if the long-term trends favored by ARK remain relevant,” Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA, said in an emailed comment.
Earlier this month, Wood reiterated her call that slowing economic activity in the United States will bolster growth stocks. 
ARK Invest had no immediate comment on Tuesday. 
Short interest in the ARK ETF amounts to 21.41 million shares, or 11.9% of the float, with short interest declining by 1.1% in the past week as shorts have covered their bets, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. 

The fund’s top holdings include electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc as well as virtual health company Teladoc and television streaming firm Roku. While Tesla has climbed 10% in 2021, Roku has slumped 6.5% and Teladoc shares have dropped some 35%. 
Last week, China's moves to crack down on bitcoin trading dealt another blow to the fund, which lists cryptocurrency trading firm Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc as its fifth-largest holding. Since its inception in 2014, the ARK fund is up about 450% against a gain of roughly 115% for the S&P 500, and ranks in the top percentile in its category of funds tracked by Morningstar over a five-year period.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's decision on whether to ban Huawei 5G gear, as all the other members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network have done, is likely to be made in ""coming weeks,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
His comments about the decision - which has been under study for some three years - were the first since Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was freed last week from house arrest in Vancouver, where she had fought extradition to the United States for almost three years.
Two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were arrested by Beijing shortly after Meng's 2018 detention on a U.S. warrant, left China within hours of Meng's release and arrived in Canada on Saturday. They had been charged with espionage.
The United States has pressed allies to bar Huawei from next-generation 5G networks on grounds the equipment could undermine communications security. The Five Eyes network consists of Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Until now, Canada had said it was awaiting reports from its intelligence services to make a final decision. Well-placed sources have said, however, that Canada had effectively blocked Huawei but did not want to say so publicly for fear of harming the fortunes of the two detainees. 
""We continue to weigh and look at the different options, but we will be no doubt making announcements in the coming weeks,"" Trudeau told reporters when asked about the Huawei decision. It was his first news conference since his re-election last week to a minority government.
In June of last year, Bell Canada and rival Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp - two of the biggest wireless providers - teamed with Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Finland's Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms networks, ditching Huawei for the project despite using Huawei 4G gear.

""We have actually seen that many Canadian telecommunications companies, if not all of them, have started to remove Huawei from their networks and are moving forward in ways that doesn't involve them as a company,"" Trudeau said.
Canada's decision is unlikely to come before it has put a new government in place. On Tuesday, Trudeau said he would swear in his new Cabinet next month, without giving a date.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 06:51PM ET</span>","Wall Street swoons on rising Treasury yields, growing inflation worries","By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks ended sharply lower on Tuesday in a broad sell-off driven by rising U.S. Treasury yields, deepening concerns over persistent inflation, and contentious debt ceiling negotiations in Washington.
All three major U.S. stock indexes slid nearly 2% or more, with interest rate sensitive tech and tech-adjacent stocks weighing heaviest as investors lost their risk appetite.
It was the S&P 500 index's biggest one-day percentage drop since May, and the Nasdaq's largest since March.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite index were on track for their largest monthly declines since September 2020.
""The big picture is the sudden surge in the past week of yields, which has led to a 'sell first, ask questions later' mentality,"" Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""(But) there are multiple factors weighing on sentiment today,"" Detrick added. ""The back-and-forth in Washington with the debt ceiling and the spending bill and potential higher taxes have weighed on overall investor psyche and has led to a pretty good sized sell-off.""
The benchmark index was also setting a course for its weakest quarterly performance since the COVID pandemic brought the global economy to its knees.
Weakness pervaded across most asset classes, including gold, suggesting widespread risk-off sentiment.
U.S. Treasury yields continued rising, with 10-year yields reaching their highest level since June, as inflation expectations heated up and fears grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve could shorten its timeline for tightening its monetary policy.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she expected inflation to end 2021 near 4% and warned lawmakers their failure to avert a government shutdown as the nation moves closer to exhausting its borrowing capabilities could cause ""serious harm"" to the economy.
Senate Republicans appeared set to strike down Democrats' efforts to extend the government's borrowing authority and avoid a potential U.S. credit default.
A Conference Board report showed consumer confidence weakened unexpectedly in September to the lowest level since February.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 569.38 points, or 1.63%, to 34,299.99; the S&P 500 lost 90.48 points, or 2.04%, at 4,352.63; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 423.29 points, or 2.83%, to 14,546.68.
Half of the S&P 500's components closed 10% or more below their 52-week highs. That included 63 stocks that had fallen 20% or more.
Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but energy ended red, with tech and communications services suffering the steepest percentage losses.
Communications services shed 2.8%, the sector's biggest one-day percentage decline since January. The S&P growth index closed at its lowest since July and posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since February.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc weighed heaviest on the S&P and Nasdaq, falling between 2.4% and 3.6%.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co was one of the few bright spots, advancing 1.1% on news that it would join Korean battery partner SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three U.S. battery plants.
Declining issues outnumbered gainers on the NYSE by a 4.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 120 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.27 billion shares, compared with the 10.37 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Toymaker Lego doubled its earnings in the first six months of the year as customers flocked to its reopened stores to buy Star Wars building sets, model Colosseums and flower bouquets made from its colourful plastic bricks.
While parts of the global retail industry are still reeling from the pandemic and related supply chain issues, Lego says it has benefited from its decade-old strategy of placing production close to its key markets, cutting logistical issues and costs. 
""It has made us somewhat more resilient, since we have not had to send everything around the world urgently,"" Chief Executive Niels B. Christiansen told Reuters, adding that Lego has five large factories covering Asia, Europe and the Americas. 
The family-owned company saw a surge in its online sales during the pandemic but reiterated on Tuesday it would continue to bet on physical stores to attract new customers.
""If anyone doubted whether stores would still have relevance on the other side of COVID-19, we have simply seen both traffic and revenue come back into stores,"" Christiansen said. 
Lego said it had outpaced the toy industry in all major markets during the first six months of 2021 as production was uninterrupted by COVID-19 restrictions and most of its physical stores reopened. 
Based in Billund, Denmark, Lego expects to open 174 new stores around the world this year, reaching 851 stores in total. Last year, Lego opened 134 new stores. In the first half of this year it opened 60 new outlets.
Popular building sets in the first half of the year were Lego Star Wars and the advanced Lego Creator Expert sets, which include flower bouquets and a model of Rome's Colosseum. They have become popular among adults stuck at home during lockdown periods. 
Lego also opened a new flagship store in Manhattan, New York City in June where customers are able to interact with Lego products, both physically and digitally, such as designing new Lego figures or creating a Lego model of one's face. 
The new store format will be introduced to around 60 stores this year. 
""It's less about selling products, more about showing the entire Lego universe to consumers,"" Christiansen said.
Despite facing rising costs for freight and raw materials, Lego more than doubled its operating profit in the first six months of this year to 8 billion Danish crowns ($1.26 billion) compared to the same period last year. 

Revenue grew 46% to 23 billion crowns and online sales across all platforms grew 50% compared to the same period last year, Lego said. It did not give a figure for online sales or their proportion of total sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Tuesday the Chinese government was preventing its domestic airlines from buying ""tens of billions of dollars"" of U.S.-manufactured Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co airplanes.
Raimondo said that China was not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal with the previous administration.
""I don't know if Boeing is here. ... There's tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy but the Chinese government is standing in the way,"" she said in a question-and-answer session after a speech in Washington.
Boeing shares fell 2.6% on Tuesday to $218.41.
In a separate interview with National Public Radio broadcast on Tuesday, Raimondo confirmed she was specifically referencing China's blocking of Boeing airplane purchases.
""The Chinese need to play by the rules. We need to hold their feet to the fire and hold them accountable,"" she said.
Boeing declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun in March urged the United States to keep human rights and other disputes separate from trade relations with Beijing.
""I am hoping we can sort of separate intellectual property, human rights and other things from trade and continue to encourage a free trade environment between these two economic juggernauts,"" Calhoun said at the time. ""We cannot afford to be locked out of that market.""
Boeing last week raised its forecast slightly for China's aircraft demand for the next 20 years, betting on the country's quick rebound from COVID-19 and future growth in its budget airline sector and e-commerce.

Boeing estimated that Chinese airlines will need 8,700 new airplanes through 2040, 1.2% higher than its previous prediction of 8,600 planes made last year. Those would be worth $1.47 trillion based on list prices, Boeing said.
China's aviation authority, the first regulator to ground the Boeing 737 MAX following two deadly crashes, has yet to approve the return of service for the aircraft in the country. China accounts for a quarter of Boeing's orders of all aircraft.

(Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations and warned that shipments for its memory chips were set to dip in the near term as its customers making personal computers face shortages of other parts.
Shares of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc-supplier, which also said it was experiencing shortages within its own supply chain for some components, fell nearly 4% in extended trading on Tuesday.
The company makes both NAND memory chips that serve the data storage market and DRAM memory chips that are widely used in data centers, personal computers and other devices.
Micron, one of the world's biggest memory chip suppliers, said it expects shipments of both chips to sequentially decline in the near term.
""Some PC customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of non-memory components that are needed to complete PC bills,"" Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts.
""We expect this adjustment at our PC customers to be largely resolved in the coming months.""
Analysts, however, wondered if this was a ""speedbump or the start of a period of extended weakness.""
The question around Micron revolves around whether the memory industry is entering a prolonged downcycle, or encountering a more modest demand blip that will correct relatively quickly, Wedbush analyst Matthew Bryson said.
While Micron's comments support the latter view, Bryson said he awaited more concrete data to support this outcome.
Micron forecast current-quarter revenue of $7.65 billion, plus or minus $200 million, while analysts on average expected $8.57 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company also forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, plus or minus 10 cents, missing estimates of $2.33 per share.
In the fourth-quarter ended Sept. 2, Micron earned $2.42 per share on an adjusted basis, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.33 per share.

The problem was discovered on April 20 last year when negative oil futures prices were not displayed to customers, who were also unable to place limit orders to buy or sell, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.
The regulator also said it had reduced the penalty due to ""substantial cooperation and systems remediation"" by Interactive Brokers.
""This enforcement action demonstrates that the CFTC will hold registrants responsible for their handling of customer accounts,"" Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle said in a statement.
On April 20, U.S. crude futures turned negative for the first time in history, crushed by a collapse in oil demand as the COVID-19 pandemic derailed the global economy.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this month it would look to complete its data review for this age group as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months. That could mean an authorization of the shot for children by the end of October, sources have told Reuters.
The companies, however, have yet to start the official process for authorization, which could slow the decision. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FDA may not make its decision until sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving, citing a person familiar with the matter.
A Pfizer spokesperson said the company expects to start and complete its application very soon.
A decision on the vaccine's use in younger children is eagerly awaited by millions of Americans as coronavirus infections have soared in children to the highest point in early September, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The vaccine, which is already authorized for 12 to 15-year- olds and fully approved for ages 16 and up, induced a strong immune response in the target age group in a 2,268-participant clinical trial, the companies said on Sept. 20.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for the 12-15 age group roughly a month after the companies filed for authorization. If the same timeline is followed for this application, younger children could start receiving their shots as soon as late October.
A rapid authorization could help mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide.
While kids are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, they can spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations that are more at risk of severe illness.
The companies said they plan to submit the data to the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities. They also plan to submit data from the full late-stage trial for scientific peer-reviewed publication.
The FDA was not immediately available to comment.
Data from the companies' trial showed the two-shot vaccine generated an immune response in children that matched what was previously observed in 16-to-25 year olds. The safety profile was also comparable to the older age group, Pfizer said.
The drugmakers are also testing the vaccine in children aged 2-to-5 and those aged 6 months-to-2 years, with data expected in the fourth quarter.

 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine is not yet authorized for use in adolescents in the United States, while it has gained authorization for that age group in Europe.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been linked by regulators to rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, particularly young men. Pfizer said no instances of heart inflammation were seen in the trial participants.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors with assets worth over $1.6 trillion urged Congress on Tuesday to pass a federal paid family and medical leave policy as part of President Joe Biden's $3.5 trillion spending plan, according to a letter viewed by Reuters.
The more than 100 investors, which include public pension funds, state treasurers and asset managers, said a paid leave policy would help to improve the U.S. economy and make the companies in which they hold shares perform better.
""It’s an economic security issue,"" said Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. ""We have seen through the pandemic that the U.S. not having this policy has taken women, for example, out of the workforce.
""That's why we as treasurers and institutional investors are coming to the table, because we saw how it impacted communities and investments."" 
Trillium Asset Management, a green investing pioneer, and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, organized the letter, which was sent to leaders in Congress including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. 
""We believe paid leave is a crucial piece of fostering an economy where everyone can prosper,"" said Kate Monahan, Trillium's director of shareholder advocacy. 

Lawmakers have been trying to avert a government shutdown, and agree on a tax and social spending package. Some leading Democrats have said the $3.5 trillion price tag of the social spending package is too high.
The investor letter says the policy should include leave for new parents, for people who need to care for an ill family member and to address one's own serious sickness.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slumped Tuesday, as surging Treasury yields triggered a sea of red in tech at a time when economic data flagged weakness in the consumer.    
The S&P 500 fell 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2%, or 569 points, the Nasdaq slumped 2.8%.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.5%, rising to its highest level since June, as investors fret about the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates sooner than expected to control inflation.
""The many supply and demand imbalances, including new production constraints stemming from the pandemic and supply problems, could make inflation surge more than anticipated,"" Desjardins said in a note.
Some, however, believe it may too earlier to worry about a sooner rather than later liffoff in rates at a time when the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet shows there remains ample liquidity. 
“I don't think we've got enough data to suggest the Fed will lift rates soon,” Mike Skillman who is CEO of Faith Investor Services told Investing.com in an interview Tuesday. ""The U.S. central bank is going to be cautious on rate hikes, until it's very clear that inflation will be longer and more problematic than they believe it is today.""
Tech was shunned as growth sectors of the market -- with earnings that are further out into future -- become less attractive in a rising rate and inflationary environment, where money today is more valuable than money in the future.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ended more than 2% lower.
Chip stocks pushed the broader tech sector further into the red, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) the biggest decliners.
In a raising rate environment, “you want more exposure to financials, and industrials … as they have a higher proportion of fixed costs than just all labor costs [when compared] to tech companies,"" Skillman added.
Energy was the sole sector in the green, despite oil prices paring gains as investors continue to expect rising energy will persist amid supply-chain bottlenecks and improved energy demand.
On the economic front, consumer confidence fell well short of investor expectations as the impact of the delta variant weighed on sentiment.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly to a reading of 109.3 from 115.2, missing economists estimates for 115.0.

U.S. Treasuries extended their sell-off into a fourth day with the 10-year yield reaching a level last seen in mid-June. [L1N2QU21M]
The prospect of rising cash rates and the risk of inflation proving less transitory than expected took two-year yields to 18-month highs. European bond yields soared too.
U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers last week projected that they are ready to raise rates in 2022 and that the bank is likely to begin reducing its monthly bond purchases as soon as November.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.85%.
All three major U.S. stock indexes slid more than 1.5%, with interest rate sensitive tech and tech-adjacent stocks weighing heaviest as investors lost their risk appetite. 
The Nasdaq Composite index of tech stocks and the S&P 500 index saw their worst daily falls since March and May respectively and were on track for their biggest monthly declines since September 2020.
Tech stocks usually fall when bond yields are rising because they have higher valuations and are most reliant on future growth, which can be curtailed by higher interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 569.84 points, or 1.63%, to 34,299.53, the S&P 500 lost 90.5 points, or 2.04%, to 4,352.61 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 423.29 points, or 2.83%, to 14,546.68.

1681,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 28, 2021 03:38PM ET</span>","Debt Limit, Pending Home Sales, Inventories: 3 Things to Watch","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com -- Stocks, particularly in the tech sector, slumped on Tuesday on weak consumer confidence data and rising yields on U.S. Treasury debt.
The confidence reading for this month unexpectedly fell to its lowest level since February as consumers felt jolted by another surge in the Covid-19 pandemic that struck fear over the economy’s recovery. Stocks were in the red heading into the last half-hour of trading.
At the same time, lawmakers in Washington are haggling over the country’s own debt future, at loggerheads over whether to extend funding beyond Thursday and raise or suspend the debt limit. The prospect of a U.S. default, plus higher taxes to pay for trillions of dollars in proposed federal spending, is also weighing on sentiment.
The reading, coupled with a rising trade deficit and an expected decline in vehicle sales, brewed fresh concerns about the state of consumption in the country, which is a key driver of economic growth.
The United States 10-Year Treasury yield jumped to about 1.56%, hammering tech and growth stocks, while investors fled for value stocks. The Federal Reserve is preparing to ease off of its stimulus efforts, first cutting back on its monthly bond purchases starting later this year, and potentially raising short-term rates later next year.
Still, on Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is far from achieving maximum employment.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Washington showdown
Congress has to figure out how to extend federal government funding past Thursday at midnight or agencies could shut down, risking a U.S. default, several policy experts and executives warned. On Monday night Republicans in the Senate quashed an effort to both extend funding to December and suspend the nation’s debt limit to next year. Now Democrats will have to scramble to get something delivered.
2. Pending home sales
The National Association of Realtors will Wednesday release data on pending home sales for August. As per estimates, they are likely to have risen 1.4% month-on-month after a 1.8% drop in July, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. The data are released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT).
3. Oil outlook
The oil stockpile in the U.S. is likely to have eroded by 1.652 million barrels in the week ending September 24 after falling in the week prior as well. Falling inventories are coming as oil prices hover near three-year highs and analysts have raised their price targets for both Crude Oil WTI Futuresand Brent Oil Futures. The data are released at 10:30 AM ET.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co has begun preparing for the possibility of the United States hitting its debt limit, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday, adding he nevertheless expected policymakers to find a solution to avoid that ""potentially catastrophic"" event. 
The country's largest lender has begun scenario-planning for how a potential U.S. credit default would affect the repo and money markets, client contracts, its capital ratios, and how ratings agencies would react, Dimon said in an interview. 
""This is like the third time we've had to do this, it is a potentially catastrophic event,"" he said. 
""Every single time this comes up, it gets fixed, but we should never even get this close. I just think this whole thing is mistaken and one day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling. It's all politics,"" he added. 
Congressional Democrats are scrambling to find a way to raise the government's $28.4-trillion borrowing cap before the Treasury Department runs out of means to service the nation's debt. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the Treasury will likely exhaust extraordinary measures by Oct. 18. 
Democrats have prepared votes to head off a government shutdown and a potentially economically-crippling U.S. credit default on Tuesday, but a quick resolution appeared unlikely in the face of continued Republican resistance.
Fiscal brinkmanship has become a regular feature of U.S. politics over the past decade thanks to ongoing partisan polarization, with debt ceiling deals coming down to the wire in 2011 and 2017.
Bloomberg reported last week that Secretary Yellen had called the leaders of the biggest Wall Street financial firms to recruit them in her campaign to pressure Republicans to agree to a deal. The Treasury declined to comment on the report.
Dimon said as part of its preparation the bank was combing through its client-contracts, a resource-intensive process. 
""You've got to check the contracts to try to predict it out ... If I remember correctly, the last time we got prepared for this, it cost us $100 million,"" he said. 
RACIAL EQUITY
Dimon was speaking to Reuters before a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the bank's new branch in southeast Washington, part of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s effort to promote racial equity by boosting its presence in underserved communities.
The branch is the eleventh of its kind JPMorgan has opened in cities including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago, since 2019. As well as providing traditional services, the branches work with local community groups to provide free skills training and other small-business support. 
""It's not a traditional bank branch, we want it to be very welcoming, we want it to be attractive,"" said Dimon.
Following nationwide ""Black Lives Matter"" protests last year, JPMorgan pledged $30 billion over five years to advance racial equity. That includes originating 40,000 new mortgages and 15,000 small business loans to Black and Latino communities. 
The investment underscores how large corporations are increasingly embracing social, environmental and governance or ESG issues amid pressure from investors. 
Addressing racial equity is also a priority for President Joe Biden's administration which has said bank branch ""deserts"" perpetuate inequality by reducing access to credit.
Biden's acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu this month said he would scrap contentious changes to fair lending laws led by his Trump-appointed predecessor and start a fresh review with other banking regulators. 
Rules around the Community Reinvestment Act, where regulators score banks on how well they serve poor communities, need to be regularly modernized to account for technology-driven changes in banking, said Dimon, who said the overall law is good for the country. 

""It is very complicated, very slow, very late, very hard to measure,"" he said, adding CRA assessments should also be performed in real time, as opposed to a retrospective review every few years.
""Does it actually capture everything? No. Is it real time? No. Is it politicized? Absolutely.""

Below are some notable facts about the bout of volatility hitting U.S. equities.
* With investors increasingly worried about inflation and after the U.S. Federal Reserve last week revealed its latest clues on tapering its asset purchases and hiking interest rates, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed as high as 1.567%, reaching a level last seen in mid-June.
* As of Tuesday afternoon, half of S&P 500 stocks were down 10% or more, the definition of a correction, from their 52-week highs. That included over 60 stocks that had fallen 20% or more.
* With two sessions left in the month, the S&P 500 has lost 3.6% in September, making it the index's weakest month since September 2020, when the S&P 500 lost 3.9%
* The Nasdaq is now down 5.1% from its record high close on Sept. 7. That marks the Nasdaq's deepest decline from a record high close since May

* With growth stocks particularly exposed to rising interest rates, the S&P 500 technology index was Tuesday's worst-performing sector, down 2.5%, reducing its year-to-date gain to 16%, in line with the broader S&P 500
* Even with recent turbulence, volatility has calmed considerably on Wall Street this year, with the S&P 500 logging just 37 sessions with gains or losses of 1% or more. That compares to 109 such sessions in 2020, when the S&P 500 tumbled and recovered, marking its shortest bear market ever.

(Reuters) -The three largest U.S. drug distributors will pay more than $75 million to resolve claims they fueled an opioid epidemic in the Cherokee Nation's territory in Oklahoma, marking the first settlement with a tribal government in the litigation over the U.S. addiction crisis.
Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin on Tuesday said the settlement, which will be paid over 6-1/2 years, would ""enable us to increase our investments in mental health treatment facilities and other programs to help our people recover.""
The deal announced by the Cherokee Nation came after distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), along with the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), agreed to pay up to $26 billion to resolve similar claims by states and local governments.
That settlement did not cover any of the country's Native American tribes. The three distributors are in talks to resolve those cases, and other companies continue to face similar lawsuits.
Drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd and Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc on Tuesday separately said they agreed to pay $15 million and $7.5 million, respectively, to resolve claims they contributed to the opioid epidemic in Louisiana. Teva will also donate $3 million worth of medications.
The distributors in a statement called the deal ""an important step toward reaching a broader settlement with all federally recognized Native American tribes across the country."" The companies deny wrongdoing.
The Cherokee Nation became the first Native American tribe to sue drug distributors and pharmacy operators in 2017. The sovereign Cherokee Nation has more than 390,000 citizens.
It accused the distributors of flooding its territory with millions of prescription opioid pills, an oversupply of addictive painkillers that resulted in abuse and overdose deaths that disproportionately affected Native Americans.

More than 3,300 similar lawsuits have been filed by states, counties, cities and tribal governments. Nearly 500,000 people died due to opioid overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Cherokee Nation, represented by the law firms Boies Schiller Flexner, Fields PLLC, and Whitten Burrage, also sued pharmacy operators CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. They deny wrongdoing.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, as tech stocks slumped following a surge in Treasury yields and signs of consumer weakness at a time when concerns about a more sustained pace of inflation continue to heat up.
The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.2%, or 405 points, the Nasdaq slumped 2.2%.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.5%, rising to its highest level since June, as investors fret about the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates sooner than expected to control inflation.
""The many supply and demand imbalances, including new production constraints stemming from the pandemic and supply problems, could make inflation surge more than anticipated,"" Desjardins said in a note.
Tech was shunned as growth sectors of the market -- with earnings that are further out into future -- become less attractive in a rising rate and inflationary environment, where money today is more valuable than money in the future.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were more than 2% lower.
Chip stocks pushed the broader tech sector further into the red, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) the biggest decliners.

(Reuters) - As Merck & Co and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) prepare to report clinical trial results for experimental COVID-19 antiviral pills, rivals are lining up with what they hope will prove to be more potent and convenient oral treatments of their own.
Enanta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ENTA), Pardes Biosciences, Japan's Shionogi & Co Ltd and Novartis AG said they have designed antivirals that specifically target the coronavirus while aiming to avoid potential shortcomings such as the need for multiple pills per day or known safety issues.
Infectious disease experts stressed that preventing COVID-19 through wide use of vaccines remains the best way to control the pandemic. But they said the disease is here to stay and more convenient treatments are needed https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/inside-race-find-covid-19-treatment-pill-2021-05-21. 
""We need to have oral alternatives for suppression of this virus. We have people who aren't vaccinated getting sick, people whose vaccine protection is waning, and people who can't get vaccinated,"" said Dr. Robert Schooley, an infectious diseases professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine. 
Pfizer and Merck, as well as partners Atea Pharmaceuticals and Roche AG have all said they could seek emergency approval for their COVID-19 antiviral pills this year.
Rivals are at least a year behind. Pardes began an early-stage trial last month, Shionogi plans to start large-scale clinical trials by year-end, Enanta aims to start human trials early next year and Novartis is still testing its pill in animals.
Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said re-purposing drugs originally developed for other viral infections is not an unreasonable approach. But it is not known how potent they will be against COVID-19 or how well they can target lung tissue, where the virus takes hold.
The risk is ""if it's not a great effort ...you'll end up losing time,"" Luly said. 
Antivirals are complex to develop because they must target the virus after it is already replicating inside human cells without damaging healthy cells. They also need to be given early to be most effective.
Currently, intravenous and injected antibodies are the only approved treatments for non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
An effective, convenient COVID-19 treatment could reach annual sales of over $10 billion, according to a recent Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) & Co estimate. Merck has a contract with the U.S. government that implies a price of $700 for a course of treatment with its antiviral molnupiravir. 
SEARCH FOR AN EASY TREATMENT
Several classes of antiviral drugs are being explored. Polymerase inhibitors such as Atea's drug - first developed for hepatitis C - aim to disrupt the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself. There are also protease inhibitors, like Pfizer's pill, which are designed to block an enzyme the virus needs in order to multiply earlier in its lifecycle. 
We are trying to halt the processes ""that allow the virus to set up a replication factory,"" said Uri Lopatin, CEO at Pardes, which is also developing a COVID-19 protease inhibitor.
Merck's molnupiravir, developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, was at one point envisioned as a flu drug and works by introducing errors into the genetic code of the virus. 
""The broad spectrum activity of molnupiravir against RNA viruses, including other respiratory viruses, suggests that it should be a durable, useful molecule,"" said Jay Grobler, who oversees infectious disease and vaccines at Merck.
Merck said data shows the drug is not capable of inducing genetic changes in human cells, but men in its trials have to abstain from heterosexual intercourse or agree to use contraception. 
Until reproductive toxicology study results are available, ""we don't know if there's any potential effect of drug on sperm,"" said Merck research executive Nicholas Kartsonis. 
Both molnupiravir and Pfizer's pill are taken every 12 hours for five days. Pfizer's drug must be combined with older antiviral ritonavir, which boosts the activity of protease inhibitors but can cause gastrointestinal side effects and interfere with other medications.
""It is a nuisance to add a drug you don't need to have a drug you want to take be effective,"" Schooley said.
Pfizer said a low dose of ritonavir will help its protease inhibitor remain in the body longer and at higher concentrations.
Enanta, which gets most of its revenue from a hepatitis C deal with  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV), scanned its library of antiviral compounds early in 2020. It instead chose to design a new protease inhibitor that targets an enzyme vital to the ability of the coronavirus, and its variants, to replicate.
The drug will be tested at once daily dosing with no ritonavir boosting, Luly said.
Lopatin said Pardes is assessing once- and twice-a-day dosing and whether its drug needs to be combined with ritonavir. ""We do not anticipate that we will need to use a booster,"" he said.
Pardes received funding from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which gave up on an inhaled version of its remdesivir, an intravenous polymerase inhibitor approved for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Gilead is still working an oral remdesivir, which was also first developed for hepatitis C and is currently the only antiviral approved for treating COVID-19.

Martin said on Monday the additional cost saving will ""clear our path to being adjusted EBITDA positive by the first half of our next fiscal year, even if revenue was to remain constant with our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter levels"".

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) said on Tuesday its board had decided to make an interim distribution from 2021 earnings through a cash dividend and share buyback worth 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion), equivalent to 40% of its first-half underlying profit,
The announcement comes after the ECB said in July it would lift restrictions on bank dividend remuneration and share buybacks beyond September, clawing back a crisis measure that forced lenders to retain capital during the pandemic.
The board approved the payment of an interim cash dividend against 2021 results of 4.85 euro cents per share, equivalent to 20% of the group's underlying profit in the first half of 2021.
In addition, it agreed to implement a share repurchase programme for about 20% of the group's underlying profit in the first half of 2021 for approximately 841 million euros, for which it received approval from the ECB.
The bank also said it would announce a further and final distribution from 2021 earnings in the first quarter of 2022.
""Should the trend in the bank's performance for the first half of the year continue, it would result in a total cash dividend for 2021 that is in line with the cash dividend paid in 2019, and a total buyback equivalent to around 3% of the outstanding share capital.""
According to Reuters calculations based on data from Refinitiv, the total buyback would amount to around 1.6 billion euros taking into account the current share price.
The bank said interim distributions would be made around November and final distributions around May.
The bank had already signalled that it intended to restore a dividend of 40% to 50% of underlying profit.

Santander said its revised dividend policy reflected its commitment to long-term value and deploying capital to high-return businesses whilst maintaining a fully loaded CET-1 capital, the strictest measure of solvency, at the top end of its 11-12% target.

Robinhood and several other brokers restricted trading in GameStop's shares on Jan. 28 following a stunning two-week rally driven by retail traders that sparked a ""short squeeze"", leading to billions of dollars in losses for Wall Street hedge funds.
""Citadel Securities never requested, intimated, agreed or otherwise sought to limit or to restrict the trading of such securities,"" Citadel Securities said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday.
The trading halt frustrated retail investors, capped the losses for hedge funds and drew the scrutiny of lawmakers and regulators. At a U.S. congressional hearing in February, Citadel LLC CEO Ken Griffin, who also founded Citadel Securities, said the hedge fund had not contacted Robinhood about restricting trading.
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev had also said then: ""We don't answer to hedge funds."" The online brokerage did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.
""It must frustrate the conspiracy theorists to no end that Vlad and I have never texted, called or met each other,"" Griffin said.

Commission-free brokerages including Robinhood have been criticized for their practice called payment for order flow (PFOF), under which they receive fees from market-makers for routing trades to them and do not charge users for individual trades.
The practice is currently under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

On Friday, Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou flew home to China from Canada after reaching an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, a point of tension between China and the United States.
Within hours of news of the deal, the two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody were released from Chinese jails and were on their way back to Canada.
On Monday, the White House denied that the moves constituted a prisoner swap, with press secretary Jen Psaki instead describing Meng's deal as an action taken by an independent Department of Justice.
But on Tuesday, U.S. Representative Jim Banks sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for all communications between the White House, State and Justice departments since President Joe Biden took office, raising questions of interference in the case against Meng.

""You told the Senate Judiciary Committee that you would protect the integrity of the Justice Department from political influences,"" he wrote. ""But this sequence has left me wondering if the White House and State Department interfered in this prosecution case. To what extent was the decision to let Meng go influenced by politics?"" 
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -At least 400,000 people in the United States have received booster doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after U.S. health regulators cleared the third round of shots for millions of people, and a million more are seeking them, the White House said on Tuesday.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week backed an additional dose https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-advisers-recommend-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-65-older-high-risk-2021-09-23 of the vaccine for people aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions that put them at risk for severe COVID-19 and adults in high-risk working and institutional settings.
""Just over this past weekend at pharmacies alone, over 400,000 Americans received the additional protection of a booster and almost 1 million people have already scheduled their booster shots through pharmacies over the coming weeks,"" White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters.

The United States had an average of 95,000 COVID-19 cases, 8,500 hospitalizations and more than 1,300 deaths in its most recent seven-day period, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at the same briefing.
Over 70 million eligible people remain unvaccinated, Walensky added, and only 30% of pregnant women have received the vaccine. Expecting mothers were included on the list of those eligible for boosters.

The group, which has 55,000 permanent UK employees, said the temporary jobs would be in its network of fulfilment centres, sort centres and delivery stations.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) UK said pay for operations roles would start at a minimum of 10 pounds ($13.68) an hour, rising to 11.10 pounds an hour in some parts of the country - rates in line with a pay rise given to permanent employees in June.
The group is also looking for people to deliver parcels in their spare time for between 13 pounds and 15 pounds per hour.
Reuters reported on Monday that warehouses in Britain are having to pay up to 30% more to recruit staff after a chronic shortage of workers exacerbated pressure on already buckling supply chains and threatened to derail the run up to Black Friday and Christmas.
The labour shortages in Britain's logistics network come on top of a spike in European natural gas prices and a post-Brexit and COVID shortage of truck drivers that has left fuel pumps dry across major cities.

Amazon UK has not experienced delays in deliveries to customers, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
